I love complexity though so \u0022lite\u0027ing\u0022 things isn\u0027t my preference. It does bother me a bit though, that pretty much everything in Interstellar is available in the VAH. I understand the reasoning, as not having it would make conventional builds a lot more appealing, but at the same time, it seems a waste to add so much complexity for no real reason. All that said though, if I could only pick ONE mode to play with, it\u0027d be Interstellar, and that says a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T12:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ctbram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ctbram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[bUG] - My 3.75m fusion powered MW power station has stopped working.
