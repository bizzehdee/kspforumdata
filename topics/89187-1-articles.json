I\u0027ve been registered for a while here, played the game for a longer time, and have enjoyed the many mods the community has to offer. Recently, I started to think about doing something myself and I considered some kind of plugin, but A) most of the stuff I want in the game already exists in some shape or form, and \u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0026amp;)\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022\u003E that would mean more coding for me, which is actually what I do for a living, so I decided to settle on parts instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in that vein, one of the things that always bothered me in the game is that some of the craft I built whose purpose was to stay operational for a long time, they always looked kinda crazy. Each part would be modeled or textured in a different way than the other and it just looked weird. So I started sketching some stuff and came up with this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[image removed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd some images of the whole thing assembled:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[image removed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s what I came up with so far. Each thing is self explanatory I believe, but just to paint a better picture:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCommand Module: Holds 4 kerbals. Still deciding on that though. The idea, is to be relatively light and with a larger capacity than other pods, but it\u0027s node made for re-entry and landing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLiving Module: For now, it holds 2 kerbals and nothing else. And argument could be made to hold 4 as well, since the diameter is quite a bit larger than 2.5. I built this with the intention of having it help with Sanity and Fitness mods in the future.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nService Module: For the stock game it holds a large amount Electric Charge. If you use any sort of Life Support mod, than it would hold a fairly good amount of the resources needed, though don\u0027t know yet the exact amounts. For now, since I play with TAC LS, it has Oxygen, Water and Food.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReaction Wheels: This is something that I always figured would be good, have your reaction wheels also carry some mono prop. Saves up on extra tanks around the craft.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFuel Tank: Holds a good amount of Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer. Right now at ~33 tons and with the Poodle Engine, I get about ~3600 Delta-V out of these. I have designs to build different sizes, and tanks for other fuels as well. For instance, I want to do something with Karborundum.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have an engine design in the works, and I also want to do some solar panels to compliment it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you guys think? Would like to hear your thoughts and ideas and also know the interest in something like this. If there\u0027s interest in space ship packs like these, I have more ideas for the future like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E transports, cargo resupply ships and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-20T04:31:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2016 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by v1per\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yarbrough08","CreatedById":72048,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T06:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like your models, but I think your textures look great..
