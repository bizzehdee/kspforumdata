I have an orbital refinery with two Kerbodyne S3-14400 (largest stock) tanks, a FL-RC1 RCS Fuel Tank (largest monoprop), and a Small Holding Tank for storing ore for conversion to fuels on-demand (e.g. more LF for nuclear, more monoprop when getting low). I have a medium-sized miner lander with 3300 ore capacity powered by a Poodle and the large Rockomax X200-32 fuel tank. I net about 2200 LF and 2600 O2 per run but each run takes 15-30 minutes. The re-docking takes up a lot of that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some photos:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZaWmhP3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZaWmhP3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g82Q08a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g82Q08a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFilling up those refinery tanks is taking much longer than I expected. What\u0027s more concerning is I have been planning to launch a large tanker I designed that can carry several times more fuel than the refinery for parking in LKO. These are all preliminary steps toward my goal of a grand excursion to the Jool system where I will have miners, a refinery station, a tanker, science rovers, landers, etc. Without some improvements to my process, KSP feels like it will become a mining grind game where every big mission must be preceded by a few hours of repetitive landing, drilling, orbital insertion, rendezvous, docking, processing, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, there\u0027s the big debate about whether one should be doing orbital refining or refining on the surface. I\u0027m still very open to both options but what I have now is an orbital setup so I\u0027d prefer to fix what I have rather than redo it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if I should create a bigger mega-miner, use the claw for faster docking, use more auto-pilot features to speed up the process, redesign my miner to use the nuclear engine, move to some form of surface refining with maybe a big landable tanker and a rover that can do the resupplying, or something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping some of you guys can share some numbers and other specifics about how efficiently you\u0027re able to fill up your orbital refueling station, all things considered.

My mining op currently consists of a fuel station in orbit over Minmus with 2 medium Kerbodynes, a couple of monoprop tanks and some xenon (before I remembered that xenon can\u0027t be mined). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s not a lot of storage space, but that can easily be fixed by bringing more. The rest can be found on the ground. The very idea that you have to fly up and land your miner every time you fill it up seems a bit stressful to me. Instead I have a dedicated position on the ground where I keep my miner landed. The location is optimal, and it is very easy to enhance the base by bringing more equipment. My miner is poorly equipped, with only 2 drills, but it works wonders still. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any numbers on the efficiency, but for me it works like a charm. I mostly do other stuff while the tanks are filling up, and suddenly they are full. That\u0027s why I brought up a bigger tank to the ground base, so that I can store more before having to ferry it up. That way I can do many trips in a row efficiently, instead of waiting every time. My lander/fuel shuttle consists of a medium kerbodyne tank and monoprop tank with four engines/tanks on the side. The engines/tanks provides more than enough deltaV to ferry the fuel to the orbital station and down to the ground again, where it fills up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that I\u0027m using MechJeb and KAS. MechJeb is used to ease the landing, as landing on Minmus several times is nothing but tedious. KAS is used to ease the fuel transfer. Having winches and pipes to stretch between two vessels really makes it easy and smooth, and isn\u0027t unrealistic at all. If nothing else, it should be stock. If I were to do it without KAS however, I would just put some wheels and a claw on my stationary fuel tank. Problem solved. It only requires a bit more managing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that comes to mind as to why surface operations is pretty good opposed to orbital refineries, is that once the orbital refinery is out of ore, nothing more will be produced until it gets more. But on ground refineries, it will continue until all the fuel tanks are full (which is especially good in a situation like mine, where you have storage on the ground aswell).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw; what is the drill ore load like for you?

What happened this last run is I took off from the mining site with an apoapsis of 7500m, cut the engines, then accidentally hit Z while I was in map mode and didnt realize it immediately because I didn\u0027t see the engines firing.

This has been hashed and rehashed for years by people contemplating first Kethane and then Karbonite. The questions/tutorials forum is full of such threads, and they all say the same thing. Do not bother with a refueling system within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ore is no different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt boils down to several things. First, there\u0027s the sheer time and hassle of it all compared to just launching what you need to start with. But on the fuel side, it\u0027s also cheaper to do that, too. This is because the heavier a ship, the more fuel it needs to generate a given amount of dV. Thus, moving large quantities of fuel (and thus a heavy ship) consumes more fuel than you save save by putting the remainder into another ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider a fuel depot in LKO supplied from Minmus. For this run, your tanker doesn\u0027t even need landing gear so is just tankage and engines. From LKO out to Minmus surface is 1300-1400m/s. This is done with no cargo so doens\u0027t need all that much fuel. Coming back from Minmus surface and rendezvousing in LKO with the fuel depot can takes anything from 500-1000m/s depending on how well you aerobrake (and more if you don\u0027t aerobrake), but this time the ferry is heavy with fuel so the amount of fuel consumed is actually rather greater than what it needed for the outward trip even with dV on the low end of that scale. Plus whatever mono the tanker uses during docking. On top of this, unless you\u0027re adept at launching straight to a rendezvous, whatever comes up from Kerbin will have to spend about 300m/s on top of its launch cost to rendezvous with the station (plus mono for docking) to use any of the fuel from Minmus. There is also the sunk cost of setting up the whole operation, which will require many uses to pay off. So the end result is, you consume more fuel and spend more money, plus take a lot more time, doing all this than just flying out from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the question of what you\u0027d use an LKO refueling station for anyway. Anything going interplanetary is cheaper to launch with enough fuel for the outward trip than it is to bother with refueling in LKO. Use the refining stuff at the destination so you don\u0027t need to pack fuel to come home with. And even with SSTOs that can barely make orbit to start with and need to refuel to do anything else, it\u0027s still cheaper to send the fuel up from Kerbin than bother with the whole Minmus-LKO tanker system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way a refueling system in Kerbin is actually worth doing is if you luck into abundant ore next to KSC. That means you can build rockets with empty fuel tanks and fill them up for free on the launchpad prior to launch. Sure, you have to buy the rovers to do this but that will pay off finacially in a few launches, although it does cost time and effort on your part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T04:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may well be less efficient to set up a mining \u0026amp; refining operation on Minmus, but I want to try it anyway, cuz it looks fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And it will be good practice for mining on distant worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of us who don\u0027t use MechJeb, is it feasible to land multiple vessels on the same surface spot?

I learned so much from this and it would have been too stressful or wasteful to figure this all out so far away from Kerbin. That alone has justified it for me and plus it was fun! I am one of the folks who bought the game post-1.0 so everything is new and interesting to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think there are some spacecraft designs that could benefit from a Kerbin refueling station, though. For example, (and maybe I\u0027m just an naive newbie about this) an interplanetary Laythe-bound SSTO spaceplane. Or maybe another interplanetary craft that can get into Kerbin orbit with its expensive Rhino\u002BKerbodyne stage still available but almost empty; you could top it up and use it to its fullest potential, maybe even all the way to your next refueling station. Or maybe a Minmus \u002B Mun \u002B Kerbin science hopper for quickly collecting science from all the biomes. I\u0027m also intrigued by the idea of a permanent Duna shuttle that can leave Kerbin SOI full on fuel, get to Duna, send its returnable lander out for maybe a few landings, then return back to Kerbin for refueling, ready for another mission without anything else required except a crew change.
