The last one being small lightweight medium power needs and small amount of fuzziness.

Could map tracking be enabled for all vessels automatically? There are a few ways to look at this: a) KSC can track a vessel\u0027s location with its radio telescopes from kerbin, or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E need a satellite system to track location (RemoteTech integration?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
