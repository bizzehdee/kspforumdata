Why on Reddit posts about KSP1 are full of enthusiasm and fun, but any mention of [the sequel]] leads to a storm of indignation? After all, this is the same community!

Just play the game or don\u0027t; it doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s concerning to see how a video game tarnished this beacon of civility in the often rabid and rancid internet wasteland. The only hype I have left for the aforementioned is nothing else than some hope tucked in the recesses of my mind that one day it\u0027ll get better. I\u0027ve wholeheartly re-embraced my copy Kerbal Space Program and have no interest in playing its sequel until it offers everything that my copy with mods offers. On top of that, I have no interest in convincing others that my opinion on what game should and shouldn\u0027t be liked is absolute, as I have seen \u003Cem\u003Erepeatedly\u003C/em\u003E in various different threads and something that I once was guilty of.

Trying to roll back to quiet mode now would be an absolutely huge blow that\u0027d undo any and all efforts to maintain positive sentiment about the game. And I want to touch back onto the very start of this post, where I agree \u0022In Theory\u0022 to quiet mode. In practice, if KSP2 were to be judged by its actions and not its words, it\u0027d be judged as abandoned or a scam. If the team had said nothing about all the things they say are in the pipe, and all we had was the release day messaging and the following patch notes, then stuff like reentry heat would be burning bigger holes in the community confidence than it already is. The wording back then about it being a brief period would make the lack of it and lack of communication over the following eight months a glaring indicator that something has gone terribly wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yea, they\u0027re stuck in a pickle.

They\u0027re now failing to deliver those promises, and can\u0027t just walk it back since its tied into the whole correction of the rough state of the game - abandoning one would be tantamount to abandoning the other. And they can\u0027t realistically expect the community to accept some new solution either - They\u0027ve already shown by action they can\u0027t deliver on game or community update promises, and we\u0027ve unfortunately no reason to believe any new plan would be any different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-18T14:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224331133\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697637531\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStepping back now might cause worse damage as the optics of the situation among the most negative become \u0022First they abandon their release cadence, then they abandon any reasonable content schedule, and now they abandon even trying to tell us what\u0027s going on - All that\u0027s left is to officially abandon the game\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t think that matters!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224331133\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697637531\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve already shown by action they can\u0027t deliver on game or community update promises, and we\u0027ve unfortunately no reason to believe any new plan would be any different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t think there is any form of communication that can turn that around.

And while I believe the team 100% when they say the team is currently fully funded and staffed and that\u0027s not a worry right now, its also guaranteed that its not in perpetuity. When the next budget cycle comes up, the community sentiment and its impact on future revenues will be considered - People don\u0027t want to buy a \u0027dead\u0027 game, and even success stories like NMS show it takes literally years upon years to turn the sentiment around once the wider, non-owning public whom you rely on buying the game to continue justifying its development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no reason for leadership to rush into making any funding decisions about the games future as of right now, but if they let the sentiment tank hard enough that the pubic narrative becomes \u0022Games abandoned\u0022, they would be remiss to not consider whether they\u0027re about to throw good money after bad. Remember, massive community support and excitement is what originally made the publishers agree to a scope increase and three additional years of development over the original plans and release date. Massive community rejection can very much do the same in the other direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-18T14:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224331114\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697634961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, coupled with the fact that the CM\u0027s have gone completely silent, tells me more than any words they can say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this regard, it is completely unclear why the company has two community managers (it seems they were looking for a third).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-18T14:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224331143\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697639617\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145774\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alexoff\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Alexoff said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this regard, it is completely unclear why the company has two community managers (it seems they were looking for a third).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne to do Discord/the Forums and the other for the other social media platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
