That was with 6 LV-N\u0027s as well but I added 4 other engines in case I needed extra boost in an emergency. Upped the weight a bit though but they came in very useful when I accidentally got an encounter with Ike which would have totally messed up my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demobot","CreatedById":77729,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T15:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a very cool design.
