But everybody was terribly skeptical and funding to investigate this was immensely difficult to come by. The largest source of it ended up being funds from the Manhattan Project. The Chicago Pile-1 was the first manmade nuclear reactor built in 1942, first chain reaction on December 2nd of that year. It demonstrated what many of the brightest minds considered impossible, that man could intentionally produce, and control to some degree or another, an artificial fissile nuclear reaction. The time in between this event and the worlds first commercial nuclear power plant? The Shippingport Atomic Power Station began construction on September 6th, 1954, producing power on May 26th, 1958. 12 years. Twelve years to go from something that was \u0022obviously impossible and/or impractical\u0022 to a completed design and construction underway.

Gravity, first and second laws of thermodynamics remained true to the early 20th century and god does not play dice with the Universe. . . . . . . . . . Quantum physics gets alot of leeway because you always have uncertainty at the smallest scales and via heisenberg uncertainty, BUT the full connotations of quantum physics have not been worked out, so that there is wiggle room still left for unusual things to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo go back to an even more philosophical stance, in statistics there arises a point in where one has to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or accept the hypothesis. This is known as the threshold of type I error or alpha. Alpha typically is presented that way when you fall below alpha, the hypothesis is summarily rejected. The probability that is generated below alpha is the risk of rejecting the null (or standard) hypothesis when it was in-fact true. However the other type of error is the error of accepting the false hypothesis is called the type II error. And this is where science has a particular amount of trouble. The hypothesis is often dependent on the distribution, and if you go pouring through the scientific literature (I\u0027ve seen this so many many times in genetics especially prior to 2005) the distribution is never characterized and often assumed to be normal, when it is not. You cannot assume a distribution until you start looking at the margins. So the reality is that if you set on one side of a distribution and you get a certain T-test value you reject the hypothesis, but if one does a monte-carlo, sorted all possibilities analysis you accept, but on the other side the reverse is true. Bonnferronis correction and other correction modalities often assume independence between variables tested in parallel when it is known often they are not independent and grossly over correct.
