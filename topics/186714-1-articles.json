I\u00B4m actually tired of writing stuff down here after any given update, I\u00B4m not your beta tester unless you pay me. Here\u00B4s a little list of what\u00B4s not working but actually it was easier to write what\u00B4s left working because it is nothing but the main menu and the view on the Space Center (actually I\u00B4m not even confident that there\u00B4s not also some hidden bugs)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all started with loading my career savegame and start crafting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-First of all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is crowded with Kerbals although I turned them off in settings they will not disappear and still lagging the hell out of the One-X.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E camera (RS) randomly stopped working so I had to leave and return for like 3 times until I finally was able to start my vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I received\u00A0an Achievement for having \u0022a spin\u0022 in a Mun Rover. Unfortunately I never built anything close to a rover. Not even anything close to have\u00A0wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-When trying to switch to any flag site in the tracking station the loading screen appeared and...nothing...endless loading loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I decided to reinstall everything and delete all my save games local and in the cloud. I cleared the system cache and started over just to find out that I still can\u00B4t get rid of the super laggy Kerbals in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it doesn\u00B4t matter if the box is checked or unchecked they are always there and as soon I turn my camera to the ground I have like 10 fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The tracking station now doesn\u00B4t show anything anymore\u00A0and the\u00A0camera (RS) isn\u00B4t working (Radial, Simple, Cursor all the same).\u00A0It simply does nothing but showing a weird zoom out from Kerbins atmosphere (?) into sort of space, then stops showing\u00A0a random spot of nothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually there\u00B4s absolutely nothing left you could possibly do with this game, at least nothing useful. Not bad, you really managed to release the worst update in the history of updates and I really wonder how the heck this is actually possible. Compared to this your last update was a sophisticated masterpiece of perfection which\u00A0is ridiculous because, between us, we both know it was rubbish and took a month and two further updates to solve the issues it caused. But this time you\u00A0really heaved the meaning of the term \u0022failure\u0022 to a completely new, unknown level. This is crazy but as always I\u00B4m a positive and patient guy, sh... happens and it happens also twice or 10 times. It\u00B4s just a bit annoying to say the least.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-25T23:56:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2019 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by HUG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EInserted the term *radial* then forgot to mention here, now I came back to write down that I forgot to mention that I inserted the term *radial* and therefor came back to clarify the situation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HUG","CreatedById":149279,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-01T00:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday\u00B4s fix on XBO fixed the flag loading issue.
