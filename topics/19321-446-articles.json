I built an airliner with Mk3\u002BB9 wings and I keep getting into an irrecoverable dutch roll at around 7500-8000m (I\u0027m playing with 64k) and I can\u0027t find the proper parameters for the yaw damper to stop this. Is there an aerodynamic solution that could reduce the risk of Dutch roll and works in FAR?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://code7700.com/stability.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epage I linked yesterday\u003C/a\u003E deals with Dutch Roll a good deal. Looking at the design history of the two RL planes specifically mentioned on that page that had notably bad Dutch Roll tendencies - the Boeing 707 and the KC-135 - would give you some clues as to how to fix the problem design-wise; the long and the short of it boils down to increasing yaw stability (the \u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8 parameter) with MOAR FIN (the fin surface area I usually go for is 10% the area of the main wing, if you need a working guideline). And then that page I linked will tell you how an RL pilot would handle the Dutch Roll on your existing design (it\u0027s down at the bottom).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T15:42:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 03:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m4ti140\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m4ti140\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you guys deal with Dutch roll using FAR built-in yaw damper?

You could perhaps look at reducing the roll part rather than the yaw component. Also maybe winglets ( little wingtip vertical stabs ) which will help reduce the sideslip.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T15:44:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T16:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CrisK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CrisK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFerram, the latest FAR release has been incredibly stable.
