I just downloaded restock for KSP and it has been working great. I love all of the new textures and styles. The only problem is the engines are not working correctly. Whenever I fire an engine, it doesn\u0027t display the burn stream correctly. Instead of all the fuel coming out of the engine, the burning stream comes out slightly in front of the engine, leading to an ugly result. The restock website (space dock) said that the mod doesn\u0027t work fantastically on new versions of KSP, but I didn\u0027t think that would matter. Is it a mod issue or is there something I can do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContext:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP download method: steam (epic games)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmods: I\u0027ve downloaded a few visuals mods, kerbal engineer, and kerbal alarm.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-06T22:08:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2023 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 6\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by oli123314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-09T18:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard of this glitch, but Restock is working correctly for me, so I\u0027m no help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-09T20:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s a dependency issue? I usually install mods using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E app which understands dependencies. It looks like you manually installed from Spacedock, and I have no idea whether that Spacedock download bundles any dependencies. Read the Restock thread and check your install for dependencies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re just having a cosmetic plume issue, maybe try \u0022random\u0022 changes instead of fully diagnosing what\u0027s not working. Maybe uninstall any plume mods to see if you like the result. Or, if you have no plume mods, test whether adding Waterfall improves things for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you try those self-help steps and things still don\u0027t work, search for the \u0022how to get help\u0022 thread. It makes additional suggestions that help with a lot of mod issues. It also shows you how to share your log file so that other forumites can search for mod errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-09T21:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2023 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 9\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by DeadJohn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
