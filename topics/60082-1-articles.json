Was very happy once i got the cargo doors working but that surprisingly was the easy part. The take off style i wanted to do took the most work. It can be fiddly but worth it once you get it working its worth it. It has a medium docking port as that\u0027s the main universal port for ship docking with stations and has enough fuel to either drop off cargo in orbit and return or do a meet up but it will need fuel to return after a meet up unless your really good with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5Lgb-iuYpw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-15T21:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2014 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Legendmir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T21:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s amazing how you made the cargo bay doors.
