I built this station by using the lower command pod. The first structure I made is the center piece on the very top; this is also a command structure. After that I attached the other parts to it, but none of these have a command module. I just attach them to the transport pod with a docking port and after I\u0027ve docked with the station, I detach the command pod and leave. You can see on all the structures that there\u0027s no commanding node on it. Is that what I\u0027ve been doing wrong?
