Since were talking about the Demo here that complicates things further... I assume you haven\u0027t had any problems playing any other games on the card? Not sure what to suggest here except updating your graphics card drivers, audio drivers, verifying the cache on steam etc... Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will be along soon with a better idea, best of luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ktm127","CreatedById":159813,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T05:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket In My Pocket, thanks for your help. I played around with things a bit tonight and I got it working. I went with your advice and started looking at my graphics card and found some ways to optimize it\u0027s performance. While I was working on that I discovered that I did not have Java installed on my machine. After the installed java the program worked fine.... I was also playing with my graphics settings, so I switched them all back to default just to be sure and it still worked. I was running out of ideas and your thoughts eventually got me where I needed to go.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
