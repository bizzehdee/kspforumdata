There are two new parts: The OxygenCo m12 and OxygenCo m24. Your kerbals use 1 oxygen every second while on a planet or moon with an atmosphere. Your kerbals use 2 oxygen per second on planets with no oxygen. Your tanks by default have 100 oxygen in them, which can be improved by upgrading your space suits. The m24 oxygen part come with a new Oxygen tech that is a second to last tier tech. Upgrading spacesuits is one of the highest tier techs which can be researched after you research oxygen. You do not recharge oxygen while on EVA, and the max oxygen a ship can hold is 10000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygen tech description: If we don\u0027t want our astronaut\u0027s lives to be a lot shorter, we will have to research oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacesuit upgrading tech description: We will need to research this to conduct safe flights to distant planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygenCo m12:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 1000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 oxygen every 3 seconds using 2 ElectricCharge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OxygenCo m12 looks like a green solar panel, with a small leaf in one of the panels as an easter egg. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag: 0.001\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash tolerance: 5 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax temperature: 3000\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygenCo m24:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: 5000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 oxygen every second using 1 ElectricCharge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OxygenCo m24 looks like the OxygenCo m24, but with no easter egg, and it\u0027s twice as big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag: 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash tolerance: 8 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax temperature: 3600\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_____________________________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrading suits: upgrading space suits let you go farther.
