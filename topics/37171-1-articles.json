Wheels must be perfectly vertical and aligned as much as possible (use Shift\u002BWASDQE)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. CoL must be behind CoM, but not much. CoL must remain behind CoM even when fuel gets used up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s better to align CoL, CoM and CoM in one line at lenghtwise axis, than place one below another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You are using basic turbofan engine. It\u0027s intended for low altitude planes. Use turbojet and ram air intakes for high altitudes. For \u003Cem\u003Espace\u003C/em\u003Eplane use 3-4 ram intakes per engine, one engine per 4-5 tons (not counting engine itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, watch your \u0022intake air\u0022 resource. If it drops below 0.10 (at full thrust), engine will flame out. So throttle it down to reduce air consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Just use ram air intakes, they are light and most efficient. Air scoops are heavy. Engine bodies are cosmetic, they are very poor as intakes, suiting only for low altitude planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- toroidal aerospike rocket is \u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- place intakes behind of CoM, or their drag will try to flip you over\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- delta-deluxe winglet have very low steering capability. Replace it with tail fin and 1-2 small control surfaces or with ordinary AV-R8 winglet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- also, you can try dihedral or anhedral wings, but it\u0027s somewhat tricky to build self-stabilizing plane. It\u0027s easier to use ASAS or avionics pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-17T21:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2013 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by koshelenkovv\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepants","CreatedById":74088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T21:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis will help:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalsource.wordpress.com/answers/#spaceplanebuilding\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalsource.wordpress.com/answers/#spaceplanebuilding\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(edit: FYI, I only posted the link for the \u0022more info\u0022 part of the question.
