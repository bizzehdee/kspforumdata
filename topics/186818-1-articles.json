There is no reason why you would use Pea instead of mk1 capsule. Its decoupler and heatshield don\u0027t give any significant advantage over small and controllable mk1. Same with Onion\u00A0compared to mk2. Pomegranate is quite light for 3-seat pod, so it is useful for 3-crew landers. It\u0027s decoupler and heatshield are useless\u00A0for this application though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is to include ejection mechanism for Pea, just like Vostoks had. It will make the part more historical and at the same time more useful and interesting to play with. Other pods shouldn\u0027t feature this ejection mechanism, as their historical counterparts didn\u0027t. This will make Pea somewhat unique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnion should probably have more distinctive mounting for airlock module. It can also have solid motors for softer touchdown, which in reality were introduced\u00A0on Voskhods for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Voskhod 1 with 3-crew was a great achievement, I don\u0027t think that it is a very interesting\u00A0mission to recreate. Thats why\u00A0my idea is to completely redesign Pomegranate and make it resemble Soyuz pod instead. It will add more posibilities for historical mission recreations as well as alternate history N-1 moon landings and modern missions to ISS. With some lifting surface, solid motors for touchdown and iconic look in general, it will be a great pod to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I can see that many people ask for changes in these pods and their properties. Now it just looks like laziness, three different parts with almost\u00A0the same look and the only difference is the amount of Kerbals inside.\u00A0Come on, Squad, it was a paid DLC, while we bought it to support you in the first place, we expect some visible updates in it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NiL","CreatedById":190772,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-31T19:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be REALLY cool IMO. That pods are pretty much useless right now, and players use fairings and part clipping to make Soyuz pods. And with your idea they can keep the old-shaped round pod (Pea) for Vostoks and Soyuz orbital modules. Ejection seats could also be added to Gemini pod, because a real Gemini had ones - and it will partly fix the problem with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E tower beeing too big for all the pods exept the MK1-3. In fact, maybe ejection seats are too new of a game mechanics, so maybe Squad can left Pea just with ablator and decoupler, re-making other pods as you said.

It would enable a couple of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. Normal parachute usage - 1.25m one would fit perfectly, returning the capsule it\u0027s original round shape for Vostok replicas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. Clamp-o-tron docking port would also fit - can your MK1 pod do this\u2122? BTW, MK1 would still be useful because of being a lot more modular.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC.

Onion could be changed to resemble a LK lander cabin by adding a slight bulges on both sides - one for entry hatch\u00A0and one for attaching an inflatable airlock. They should not be too large so Onion could still be used as a Vostok pod. Also decoupler bit at the bottom could be made more light (sorry for that phrasing - english is, obv, not my first language). I mean, all Squad landers have a crew of two, it\u0027s just logical to dedicate a two-kerbal pod to be a lander (i personally hate that, but it\u0027s just my personal opinion).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Soyuz pod probably could\u00A0be resized to a 1.85m bottom and 0.625 top dimensions - to both enable usage of Making History parts for Soyuz SM,\u00A0making Zond-style crafts with Clamp-O-Tron Jr. on top (coz now it\u0027s not wery useful) and to continue\u00A0MH theme with Clamp-O-Tron Jr. compartible pods (new adapter to MK1-3 for it, Gemini pod, LEM pod - it should\u0027ve been called \u0022Making uses for C-o-T Jr.\u0022). Also for gameplay balance reasons maybe it shoudn\u0027t have a hatch - that would prevent MK1-3 from being useless compared to a new lightweight 3-crew pod and also create a reason for Orbital Module to exist - i mean, kerbals don\u0027t suffer from lack of space in thir pods, so 1.25m Clamp-o-Tron adapter and airlock is a good reason for OM to exist. And you\u0027ll still be able to use Soyuz pod without OM in a Zond configuration, but also without ability to EVA (early career missions and stations resupply?).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Retro-rockets probably should be added to all the pods, because they are useful. Perhaps they should be activated with staging (like normal SRBs), but could also have activation settings in right mouse button menu - like being fired \u0022X seconds before touchdown\u0022 or \u0022at Z altitude\u0022 (after staging, of course). I think altitude activation is better, because it\u0027s simpler of a game mechanic and does not need trajectory calculations, just altitude readings. With standart \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust and fuel level settings it will allow full customisation of a landing assist burn, while remaining simple and user-friendly. Also it should have a \u0022toggle instant fire\u0022 button (the name is self-explanatory) wich hides \u0022fire altitude\u0022 bar, or instant fire should be set automatically when \u0022fire altitude\u0022 bar is set to max. The bar probably should have a logarhytmic scale - like first santimeter of the bar is \u00220.1-1m\u0022, second - \u00221-10m\u0022, third - \u002210-100m\u0022, 4th - \u0022100m-1km\u0022 and 5th sets \u0022instant fire\u0022. Instant fire\u00A0option is for use built-in motors as separatrons for Soyuz OM or as a 2nd stage kick-motors on a Onion lander. They would probably need to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~5-10 m/s and atmo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of ~1.25\u00A0on Kerbin - to alow\u00A0landing assist of a pod with extensions (players are creative), but not function as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E of some veird sort.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs i understand, it\u0027s not too hard - to slightly change models in Blender and add .cfg\u0027s. However, my skills in both modeling and cfg-wrighting are non-existent. If someone with that skills would do that - it will be a great mod. In fact, i have a couple of ideas about revmping other Making History parts to make them both useful and cool-looking - idea of a shiny metal 1.875m Atlas/Titan tanks bothers me so much, also with new \u0022remove from symmetry\u0022 feature togglable ladders on a landing legs could be added (even through they are not MH parts). As soon as i will have my computer in reach, i will try to do something with models (some time ago, btw, i could\u0027t pull out even a fuel tank, so idk...). Maybe we should turn that into some\u00A0sort of community project like ReStock and stuff?
