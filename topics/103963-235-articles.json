Been using it now since quite a while.... I have this problem also since over a year, and I thought, hey, I\u0027m surely not the only one. This problem appears on many of my computers, not only one configuration does it. I\u0027m not really sure it is scatterer that does it, so if it doesn\u0027t please apologies me. The water level, usually when returning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, is too high. Or technically not even the water level, but somehow the world ball must shrink in diameter.... And sometimes it\u0027s worse, sometimes there\u0027s no building visible at all... Notice that my test flag pointer is way too high also, looks like the z coordinate has moved away. I would need to go to the other side check if it\u0027s a movement or a world diameter shrink.......\n\n![uKcvQ.jpg](https://puu.sh/uKcvQ.jpg)\n\nBy zooming in and rotate the camera, I can go under that water layer:\n\n ![uKcyk.png](https://puu.sh/uKcyk.png)\n\nI\u0027m terribly sorry if I got the wrong impression, if it\u0027s not scatterer that does it...

No need for them after the half files are made.\n\nEnjoy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-18T18:33:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2017 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Galileo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynton","CreatedById":130307,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-18T18:29:29Z","Content":"I may not have used Kerbin as a code-reference, but I\u0027ll try it again.
