I was wondering if there was a way to disable these effects, or just the part that makes them interact with the ground, so vtols become a bit more practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T10:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question.
