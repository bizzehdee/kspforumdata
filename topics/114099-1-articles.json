I was wondering if there was a way to disable these effects, or just the part that makes them interact with the ground, so vtols become a bit more practical."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T10:15:55Z","Content":"Good question. I\u0027m never tried this before, but I believe you want to go into your CFG, and locate this module: ModuleSurfaceFX\n\nTry removing each PREFAB\\_PARTICLE and MODEL\\_MULTI\\_PARTICLE subsection. If you\u0027re not sure how to remove the sets properly, then just remove everything below the module name, provided you can live without the sound effects as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Spraki","CreatedById":155616,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T23:20:01Z","Content":"Sorry for the necro, but I suppose this thread does involve a partial solution I am also looking for. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Good question.

I am not sure if I should just delete everything there, but leave the { }? I\u0027ve long forgotten how to program correctly, so I must admit I am lost here. \n\nAlso, is there maybe a mod that can remove smoke effects all together? I am on a lowend laptop (obviously), so turning these things off might help a lot. \n\nI have also  set the surfacefx=false, but I need to figure out how to get engine smoke/trails/exhausts off, or at least cut their durations so the screen is not loaded with it. I haven\u0027t quite figured if there is a decay/despawn value. \n\nThanks for any advice"}]}
