If they were to optimize the current build completely, they would lose a big part of that optimization again when they need to modify existing code - and need more time for that, as well. In general, you develop first and optimize then, but as this game is already being played, a certain amount of optimization is very much needed to keep it playable. Especially the memory usage and the restriction to 32Bit just limits modding way to much, because with a certain amount of mods, you run out of memory. But I think Squad knows what they\u0027re doing, at least better than us.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T17:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re also looking at a lot of limitations imposed by the Unity Engine, which is itself under heavy development. The Squad team has been pretty quick about translating applicable updates to the game as the Unity engine updates also. A lot of optimizations and the memory limits fall into this category, but as long as Squad and the Unity dev team keep up with each other, all should be well in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T16:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what someone said earlier is right, each patch \u0026lt;have yet to see a new patch yet, as I came in only just after .21 dropped\u0026gt; is more optimal than the prior with things having been smoothed out some.
