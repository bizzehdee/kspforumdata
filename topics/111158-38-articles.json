However, have you ever felt good for taking moderation action before?\n\nYes. Handing out infractions to community members isn\u0027t particularly fun. I suppose that comes from growing up as members ourselves, instead of hired monkeys. However, as Van says, there are lots of ways to take positive action also. Personally I prefer to help people out more than anything else, which is why I hang out in the support and questions forums so much.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T20:50:48Z","Content":"While this is already stickied, it\u0027s now also featured in this months TOTM, well done Dman979 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T22:30:46Z","Content":"Yippe kay yay!

Quite a bit of the \u0022invisible work\u0022 such as zapping spambots and approving new members\u0027 posts (which are both handled through the same queue, incidentally) are sufficiently quick and painless enough on most days that they\u0027re almost therapeutic once you get into the habit.\n\nAlso, in line with what Claw has said, I also view some things that wouldn\u0027t exactly be considered \u0022moderator action\u0022 as an important part of the job, such as making sure that new users with questions get the appropriate help and that our more creative sorts get a few words of encouragement. If anything I say as a moderator is going to get a little extra scrutiny from the user base as a whole, then I want to be seen as a positive source of encouragement to people who are making contributions, not just an endless fountain of citations for bad behavior.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While this is already stickied, it\u0027s now also featured in this months TOTM, well done Dman979 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yippe kay yay!
