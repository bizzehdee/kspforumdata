Maybe giving the choice to select the distance of your final approach would be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In the maneuver node planner, when I make a Hohmann transfer to a moon, it always shoots straight into the moon and I have to manually modify the periapsis. Maybe making a \u0022transfer to a moon\u0022 planner would be useful, with the ability to select the desired periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The landing autopilot is working pretty well, but I have been having a few bugs sometimes where it would just keep saying \u0022burn to change low orbit plane of Xm/s\u0022 and it would stay stuck at 0m/s and never do anything. Also when selecting a target on the map, the selection cursor is in the way of some of the coordinates and we can\u0027t see them. Lastly when in the final descent, just before hitting the ground, in the case you have a large ship, it might get a tad bit off course and the autopilot tries to correct it by making 45 degree turns at 20m from the ground. Often ends in a catastrophic way, so maybe modify the code so that in the final descent it just goes straight down where it is? And adding an \u0022emergency abort\u0022 button where it would just shoot you back up a few hundred meters if something bad is happening. Allowing to land with parachutes would be useful too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I noticed the ascent stats in the ascent autopilot are gone. They were quite useful so maybe bringing them back would be good. And also having a way to know your LPA if you want to save it for later would be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Forgot something about the rendez-vous guidance: When the hohmann transfer to target is scheduled in a long long while and that the autopilot warps 1000x, it doesnt stop in time and usually overshoots the node of ~3mins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I think about for now although I probably forgot some things. I apologize if I repeated something someone said before, I didn\u0027t take the time to read everything that came before my post, I\u0027m just trying to help, you have a really awesome mod with a lot of potential!

Before letting live Kerbals in, I\u0027m running numerous simulations in a separate save file. That is, strapping it to a probe core, putting it out on launchpad, using HyperEdit to drop it in orbit around Duna and telling MechJeb 2.0.7 (latest build too) to land to see how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it\u0027s not working. While MechJeb has no problem whatsoever landing literally on the head of a Kerbal standing on the ground when on the Mun, and lands in KSC like a pro with scant meters deviation from the launchpad itself, it behaves very bizarrely on Duna in the case described, particularly if I give it a landing location somewhere far from the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst it deorbits to a highly inclined orbit, as expected, after which, for some reason, a predicted location at least a quarter of the globe away from target appears on the map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it starts doing numerous course correction burns, the first typically being as high as 50m/s, which seemingly never quite stop once they go down to 0.2m/s. By that time it seemingly abandons all hope of ever getting to the target location and just settles on being 300km away - not a distance I can expect to realistically cover in a rover. Sometimes it never actually stops doing those course corrections until it runs out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I settled on landing manually with the use of parachutes and translatron, which seems to exhibit no problems and at least gets the lander down in one piece, but that required me to overbudget on fuel to ensure I can rendezvous with the service module later. Even that seems problematic as when I try that after takeoff, MechJeb appears to have issues with correctly executing maneuvers it calculated, missing warp times (always late by about 200 seconds for some reason), trying to catch drifting maneuver node targets and nonsensically spinning, and otherwise misbehaving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to know, is that a side effect of how HyperEdit sets orbits on things, and MechJeb is just trying to make the best of a bad situation, a runtime interaction of some kind, or a genuine problem MechJeb exhibits around Duna area?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u0027s default ascent path curve is, as I seem to remember reading somewhere around the forum, appropriate for taking off from Kerbin.

Eventually I just went back and landed manually after the initial burn, aligning the ship retrograde and burning manually with no further course adjustments, and was able to land within 0.3km of the target.

Before letting live Kerbals in, I\u0027m running numerous simulations in a separate save file. That is, strapping it to a probe core, putting it out on launchpad, using HyperEdit to drop it in orbit around Duna and telling MechJeb 2.0.7 (latest build too) to land to see how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it\u0027s not working. While MechJeb has no problem whatsoever landing literally on the head of a Kerbal standing on the ground when on the Mun, and lands in KSC like a pro with scant meters deviation from the launchpad itself, it behaves very bizarrely on Duna in the case described, particularly if I give it a landing location somewhere far from the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst it deorbits to a highly inclined orbit, as expected, after which, for some reason, a predicted location at least a quarter of the globe away from target appears on the map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it starts doing numerous course correction burns, the first typically being as high as 50m/s, which seemingly never quite stop once they go down to 0.2m/s. By that time it seemingly abandons all hope of ever getting to the target location and just settles on being 300km away - not a distance I can expect to realistically cover in a rover. Sometimes it never actually stops doing those course corrections until it runs out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I settled on landing manually with the use of parachutes and translatron, which seems to exhibit no problems and at least gets the lander down in one piece, but that required me to overbudget on fuel to ensure I can rendezvous with the service module later. Even that seems problematic as when I try that after takeoff, MechJeb appears to have issues with correctly executing maneuvers it calculated, missing warp times (always late by about 200 seconds for some reason), trying to catch drifting maneuver node targets and nonsensically spinning, and otherwise misbehaving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to know, is that a side effect of how HyperEdit sets orbits on things, and MechJeb is just trying to make the best of a bad situation, a runtime interaction of some kind, or a genuine problem MechJeb exhibits around Duna area?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u0027s default ascent path curve is, as I seem to remember reading somewhere around the forum, appropriate for taking off from Kerbin.
