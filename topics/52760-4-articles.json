IOW, you stick the light on the side of a rocket and it\u0027s pointing down. You want it to point right. With any other part (say a Sepratron), you\u0027d hit D for this. But with this light, you need to hit E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe 4-way light has separate right-click buttons and action group actions to turn each separate light on and off individually.

The spotlight rotation isn\u0027t really an issue---you can still rotate it any which way, you just use different keys than with other parts to do the same thing.
