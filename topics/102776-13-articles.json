For example the luminosity for the blue star would be insanely high, so I\u0027d have to cut that right down and the radius will need to be kept to a controllable state...however the results for all the stars are pretty cool so it\u0027ll be a very interesting addition.\n\nFor those confused about whats going to happen when i take the winner, let me explain. The winning star will be developed and distributed as my main/default star for the New Horizons mod. HOWEVER the other stars will still be available (as well as stock) as simple MM patches to download in the OP and install as you guys feel like. Orbits for all bodies will be slightly different as heat/luminosity/radius have to be taken into account for the new stars, but they will all be there for any who want to experience the other stars.

It drops a huge amount of memory, but at the cost of some visual fidelity (most noticable on arin/nolas \u0026 atell).
