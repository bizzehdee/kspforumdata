I\u0027ve tried many times to dip into the atmosphere over multiple passes, but eventually I hit ~30k and have to land, but I don\u0027t have the fuel to slow down enough to deploy parachutes, or any electricity to use reaction wheels to remain stable while using the heat shield to slow down. I am wondering if there is a way to get electricity to my ship, or save Jeb and the tourists in some other way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really stuck. Is my best option to try and deliver electricity in a battery or something? using another kerbals inventory? I was thinking about sending a kerbal up with the battery, then having jeb get out and retrieve it, but idk if that power will be useable. I haven\u0027t tried this before. If a battery is in the inventory of the Mk1 crew cabin, will it power the reaction wheels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got some ideas, and I might be able to do it, but I am hoping for a better solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I don\u0027t have any save states within reasonable time before this mission, I\u0027d have to lose heaps of progress if I were to revert to an older save...
