can get something with the aerodynamics of a sounding rocket (i.e. long and slender, with a long pointed nose cone and tiny fins for stability) up to Mach 10 or so, and launch from Colombia at a suitable upward angle, it would climb out of the atmosphere before losing too much speed or burning off the fins, then ought to come close to coasting to the African coast before reentering -- and which time, it\u0027s likely to either burn up or break up.\u00A0 Of course, if you\u0027re trying for orbit, you\u0027d start the rocket engine a little before apogee.\u00A0 Starting from, say, Mach
