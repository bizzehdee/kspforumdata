The reason they went with the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LRO) approach was because it cut down on the amount of fuel that would have been necessary to accomplish the Direct flight profile. Cutting down on the fuel required, cut down on the mass that the Saturn V needed to lift, which would also save money. Really I think a lot of it came down to a question of accomplishing the same mission in a manner that saves mass and money more than can we do with say a direct ascent. We definitely would have been capable of landing on the Moon with a Direct Ascent, but it may have taken longer and cost more money. I\u0027m not well versed in the arguments that were made back then for Direct Ascent or LRO, but I believe that is the gist of the debate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rovers on Mars, I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d call their methods \u0022complicated\u0022, but I think at least a part of the reason is that the parts in KSP are a lot more resilient than in real life. The Martian atmosphere is much thinner than Earth\u0027s and so to slow down the rovers to survivable velocities requires much larger parachutes than say on the Soyuz. These larger parachutes would add mass, probably not much, but some. Also, for the parachutes to stay attached until touchdown the chutes could obstruct the rover\u0027s ability to exit its \u0022capsule\u0022 so you\u0027d have spent millions of dollars to place a rover on Mars only to have it sit there with no may to untangle the parachutes. Using the skycrane method or omnidirectional airbags ensures that the rover makes it to the surface in one piece, will be operational upon arrival, and will be able to leave its container.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T01:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022abihoooo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022abihoooo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...It would require a ridiculously large parachute to land a 2,000 lb rover going in re-entry speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, that parachute wouldn\u0027t just \u0022disappear\u0022 as soon as you touch the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit_rendezvous\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELOR\u003C/a\u003E choice, the lunar module was as simple as it gets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nettcod","CreatedById":59103,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T01:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe planets and distances between them in KSP are 10x smaller than real life, so it takes a lot less Delta-V to get to places than in real life.

During removal, a bolt that attached the tank to the O2 shelf was left in place, which caused the mounting fixture to break and the tank dropped 2 inches to the ground. In a distinctly un-Kerbal-like response, the incident was recorded, the tank minutely inspected, and analysis was performed to see if the drop would have caused damage to the tank. It was certified safe and had no subsequent problems during extensive mission testing until a couple years later. During a countdown demonstration test for Apollo 13, the tank was filled normally, but failed to vent after filling and pressurization. Again, the incident was recorded, analysis was performed, with a loose filling line internal to the tank (possible caused by the 2 inch drop) the suspected reason for the problem. After trying multiple times to vent the tank normally, it was decided to vent it by heating the tank up with its internal heater to boil off the oxygen. And here\u0027s where the real failure occurred. In the original design for the O2 tanks, the heaters were to be operated at 28VDC. This was later revised to 65VDC to speed up boil off times during testing, but the thermostat relay specifications were never changed to match the new voltage, NASA signed off on the new designs, and the relays were never tested under load. So when Apollo 13\u0027s O2 tank heater was turned on, the thermostat saw the temp rise to 80 degrees, then tried to open the relay to shut off the heaters. The relay was unable to open under a 65 volt load and the contacts fused shut, so the heater stayed on. The temperature inside the tank probably got to around 1000 degrees during the boil-off, which no one noticed because the thermostat only went up to 80 degrees. The high temperature damaged the Teflon insulation around the wires leading to the tank mixing fan, and the rest is history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the commission never would have been able to determine the cause of the incident if there weren\u0027t documentation of every component\u0027s history from manufacture to installation, all tests performed, every failure analysis, telemetry graphs, etc etc etc. Keep in mind that all this was done with paper; no computer storage.
