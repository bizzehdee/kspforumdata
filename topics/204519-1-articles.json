They will likely have to focus on a very specific kind of multiplayer experience, and pure co-op hosted by one of the players is the most achievable. It\u0027s also entirely possible that the state multiplayer ships in is not representative of what they want to shoot for eventually, and we\u0027ll get some good options for dedicated servers and versus modes some time after release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate, I wouldn\u0027t expect too much from multiplayer early on.
