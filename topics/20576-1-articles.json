I\u0027m pretty much damned to use the MechJeb autopilot because the game lags so much on the blastoff, its plainly impossible to drive it. Anyway, my fun with this game is to actually build a ship that can go somewhere, its not being a master in driving it ahaha. Anyway, decided to go back to my V-ROY-IV ship, heavily modified it, V-ROY-V was then ready for a test drive. After a woobly transfert from stage 1 to stage 2 (the ship tends to do a frontflip in this stage, pretty rad but kinda slow down my ascent lol), the ship went to orbit as planned, I was on stage 3 with almost 90% fuel. Time to try MechJeb\u0027s Mun transfert. I tried it before but set the final periapsis too far so I couldn\u0027t cath the orbit. This time, I set the periapsis to 30km, was able to circularize the ship and BAM! My first Munar orbit is done (thanks to MechJeb).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I wonder, there is a landing module aswell, might try it at this point. Activate it, the ship began to trust retrograde. Began the descent on Mun, I try to detach stage 3 from the SAS landing module, my separator didn\u0027t worked. Gotta land directly on the engine, in a hill. Here\u0027s the result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img838/1448/munlanding1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munlanding1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a small step for Siggard, but a giant step for all the Kerbals dead to get to this point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img88/3028/munlanding2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munlanding2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite sad, I got there with even less than 1/3 of the fuel of stage 3. Might had have enough to get back to Kerth, but as Kiggs is realising, an unplanned landing result to an impossible return to homland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img20/3066/munlanding3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munlanding3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Kiggs is now lost on Mun, wondering if a rescue team will ever come to get him back. Since this mission was quite a success, I decided to try again and send this ship on Minmus. Pictures got lost in my copy/pasta history, but long story short, made it to Minmus orbit, once I activate the landing module, 2 engine exploded, tried to detach the SAS pod and it failed again (I don\u0027t understand how the 3 legged detach thingy works it seems), the 2 remaining engine got destroyed while the ship was spinning out of control. So it now orbit Minmus for ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of Jebediah in space, pushing himself in a reverse orbit (for a test).
