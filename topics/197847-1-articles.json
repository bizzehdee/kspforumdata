Which is large enough to push an oblong propellant tank through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarping is used to reach other star systems in a reasonable amount of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the 7 LY portal gate limit, spaceships carrying them will deposit spare gates every 7 LY of travel and use them as links with other gates every 7 LY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Main Question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust because spaceships can now \u00A0accelerate indefinitely in the home system won\u0027t mean they will. And I mean purely from an economic standpoint. Why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the dirty litle secret of efficient high thrust rockets thrusting in space is that it is resourcefully wasteful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean is, for every 20 tons of LH you burn for a spaceship accelerating around the solar system, that\u0027s 20 tons of hydrogen from Earth you ARE NOT getting back (as it is likely exhaust at escape velocity anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible solutions: Off world propellant refineries. Likely from icy moons no one is using. Why use Earth hydrogen when you can mine Europa and portal it off to fuel your growing portal equipped space fleet? Just drop a few portals off on a moon with equipment and workers, let them at it, and send them back to waiting ships at regular intervals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnexpected solutions: Artificial gravity is no longer a need, since crew can effectively hop from ship to ship through linked portals within the 7 LY range all the way back to the homeworld. Barring that they could also hop between portal satelites in deep space, but they need space suits for that to reach the next gate. You could go to a world 44 LY away and be back home for dinner if you wanted LOL. Assuming all the portal satelites were already laid in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny place actually interesting will already have linked portal satelites if it was previously explored, likely in an orbit high enough that it can be maintained without having a need for any boosting to counter atmospheric friction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional questions: In such a setting will there still be a need for AM rockets? Or will NTR rockets rule just fine? Which engines will become obsolete? My guess? Solid propellant rockets, also kind of ion rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think? And bear with me, I already recognize that mixing tech levels may seem absurd...however it also uses things we ACTUALLY can grasp which puts at least SOME limits on activity that are based on known\u00A0physics and not mere plot devices.

But i guess that\u0027s why they use their own ME effect devices to null out their mass, then again what\u0027s the relay for at that point....anyway this shouldn\u0027t be a spoiler filled breakdown of plot holes in ME\u0027s fictional tech).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the gist is that for a ship to use a Relay to get to a planet, it still needs to at least be capable of interplanetary flight (Well above, Earth\u0027s relay was out at Charon). And it needs to have it\u0027s own propulsion, as the relay itself provides no motive force. It just minimizes the amount of energy needed to get from one destination to another. And the Relay can only go from one destination to another (In the case of \u0022Primary\u0022 relays) but these can connect longer distances, while \u0022Minor\u0022 relays can connect several hundred destinations. And computers are used to plot the course, because significant amounts of drift from the intended destination on the order of multiples of thousands of LY can be encountered even with the best efforts, so the ship also needs to be able to travel back to it\u0027s destination if needed. And the calculations need to account for the drift,\u00A0 making sure the ship won\u0027t just smack into a planet or other obstacle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd ofc these things aren\u0027t built by their discoverers, they\u0027re remnants of some long, long lost civilization.
