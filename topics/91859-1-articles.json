The plan is to separate the two parts (one is a lander, one is an orbiter) and send the lander down to the surface after putting the joined craft in a sub-orbital trajectory. The orbiter has 2 DTS-M1\u0027s and a Comm 88. The lander has a KR-7, Comm 32, and a DP-10 on the outside of the fairing to maintain link through entry . The lander is in a procedural fairings casing for aerodynamic protection during entry. Once the lander is on the surface , it will relay the telemetry back to the orbiter, once it has re-established a safe orbit and the orbiter with its Comm 88 will send the data back to my Satnet around Kerbin and then to KSP. Simple enough right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell here\u0027s the problem: I disconnect the lander from the orbiter (which has a green link to KSP) and when I switch to the lander it shows a red link. I thought that the DP-10 would automatically connect the lander to the orbiter? Now, keep in mind that the orbiter does NOT have a dedicated omni, but the probe core should have a 3km omni right? All I need is enough time after separation of the two craft to activate the lander\u0027s KR-7 to one of the orbiters DTS-M1\u0027s. However I still do not have a connection despite the omni\u0027s being within range of one another and unobstructed by a fairing or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you made it this far, thank you so much. Please give me suggestions, comments, or if you\u0027re in the mood, make a fool of me. Whatever floats you\u0027re boat. If you have any questions about particulars or details, please let me know.

So I assume you got that part figured out. But be sure that your orbiter has a two-way connection to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, you need to ensure a two-way connection between each relay in the path to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in your case, your Orbiter must connect one of its dish antennas directly to the Lander or to \u0022Active Vessel\u0022. Another dish on the Orbiter must be pointing at KSC/Kerbin/Kerbin Relay. If you do that, the Omnidirectional antenna on the lander should suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not directly connecting from the Orbiter to KSC, I\u0027m betting you have a relay network around Kerbin. What are those relays pointing to? If you say \u0022Active Vessel\u0022, that\u0027d be your problem. To explain this more, imagine you have this connection:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutgoing: KSC \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Kerbin Relay Network \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Active Vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncoming: Lander \u003Cstrong\u003E(Active Vessel)\u003C/strong\u003E \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Orbiter \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E(Not Active Vessel)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Kerbin Relay Network \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how in your incoming connection, the orbiter is no longer the active vessel when you separate the lander. If your Lander cannot reach the Kerbin Relay Network on its own, you cannot control it after separating it from the Orbiter. An easy way to fix this is to go in and temporarily point your Kerbin Relay Network specifically to your Orbiter (not Active Vessel), or to the body your Orbiter is orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this solves your issue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T05:27:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 05:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zeenobit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELots of typos.
