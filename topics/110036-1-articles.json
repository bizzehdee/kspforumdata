So that, for example, you could order your fuel tanks so that the 3m LFO tanks were arranged large to small, then the 2m tanks, 1m, etc, then the aircraft tanks, then xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges were saved to a text file within the mod\u0027s GameData folder and were reloaded in the user-defined order each time an editor was opened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe features that PartArranger were based upon were eliminated with the editor-revamp that occurred with .90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real game in town for organizing parts now seems to be Filter Extensions, which, while helpful and with a rather dedicated support staff, just doesn\u0027t provide the same level of finesse that PartArranger did and it\u0027s no where near as ergonomic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my request is for something akin to PartArranger, that would allow us to re-order the tabs of the parts list to our liking, without having to resort to something silly like manually renaming the titles of parts in the cfg. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this could be accomplished by the introduction of a new editor parameter and some clever use of MM or anything of the sort - if I knew more, I\u0027d be taking a stab at it myself. But the biggest drag on my enjoyment of the game right now is how disordered my parts are and if someone could give us a meaningful way of organizing them, I\u0027d be very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
