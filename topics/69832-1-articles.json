This prediction will not work well with FAR. However, if you want to do skipping, FAR will be required. This is because KSP\u0027s aerodynamics are, as many people know, very, very basic. This means that the capsule\u0027s shape doesnt allow it to produce lift like the capsules can in real life since KSP hasnt given it a lift value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T19:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have FAR... (otherwise skip this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne easy way to half-ass it would be to just put your return Pe at around 38-40km, this should capture you into around a 1,000km-30km orbit. Then depending on your return vehicle, and how much re-entry heat you can tolerate, you can land on second approach with a much higher degree of accuracy (being captured at this point). Alternatively, raise your Pe back to 36-40km when you reach Ap for second pass. This will bring your Ap down closer to 300km once you hit the atomosphere again. You can safely deorbit without a heat shield attached on a Mk1 pod from an orbit roughly along those lines. Once again adjust your Pe to around 35km for third and final approach though or you perhaps might need a heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis process take a very long time as opposed to a single pass re-entry, but I use it often. Especially early on in the tech tree when I often forget to strap on a heat shield... Oops. Once you\u0027re coming in for final approach though it can be very pleasant. Hit F2 and enjoy the ride. This kind of return trajectory tends to give you almost a full orbit while in the atmosphere. You will hover along at 40-20km altitude while slowly losing your orbital velocity. Probably catch a sunrise or sunset. Good time for pictures and snacks. Don\u0027t forget to decouple all of your hardware from the pod before you come in to final approach. And do make sure to keep your velocity vector aimed at retrograde... Your capsule will survive but your parachutes might not. The stock node attach parachute will probably burn up if you lose control. If you have Real Chutes mod, they seem a bit more resilient. I tend to use 2 radials (mod) as well as a node attached chute (stock) on the top just in case something like that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso of note, it takes awhile in real-time, but Kerbin orbits are very short. So even with life support this is viable if you are just doing a quick Mun-and-back. 3 Orbits should happen in roughly 1 kerbal day I believe. I used this technique in a new game last night and the whole mission time was less then 3 days IIRC. That was a burn from the pad straight to the Mun. Science and return.
