I remember it being picked up for the role-playing game *Traveller*, and it had been the subject of NASA studies then. That\u0027s over 35 years. And it isn\u0027t far off from the drops in *Starship Troopers*, though that was rather different. [But real tests were done a half-century ago.](http://www.jamesoberg.com/112003irv_his.html)\n\nWith current Kerbal tech I could make something now. There\u0027s a Hangar set with includes a lander Hanger, to get you rovers onto moons and planets more easily. Comes with an add-on heat shield. But it could be any small object, unless you\u0027re using real reentry mods.\n\nFor the look I\u0027d use a ROUND-8 Toroidal Fuel Tank with an EAS-1 External Command Seat and a parachute. It might need a strut to connect things. Would the Kerbal\u0027s jetpack have enough delta-V to start a reentry from a low orbit. It could start getting a little complicated. The smallest size reaction wheel set and 3 or 4 separatrons?\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be so hard to make a small heat-shield that could carry an EAS-1 and a parachute."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T12:27:15Z","Content":"There\u0027s a USI mod with a tiny inflatable lifeboat around."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T13:31:29Z","Content":"Yep, you probably want this:\n\n![Ok7NVwo.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ok7NVwo.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T13:37:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep, you probably want this:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Ok7NVwo.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ok7NVwo.png)\n\nOr the Pteron or WEKA tiny shuttles."}]}
