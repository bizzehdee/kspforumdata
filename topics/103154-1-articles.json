There\u0027s a Hangar set with includes a lander Hanger, to get you rovers onto moons and planets more easily. Comes with an add-on heat shield.

It might need a strut to connect things. Would the Kerbal\u0027s jetpack have enough delta-V to start a reentry from a low orbit. It could start getting a little complicated.
