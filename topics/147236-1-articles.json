I know people share saves, and that there are mods to allow this (of sorts), we also have Dark Multiplayer and I\u0027ve seen a few YouTube video\u0027s of players sharing responsibility to build a space station, etc. \u00A0However, it would be nice if there were a means to make this an all in one package:\u00A0by having a schedule of flights, facility to upload and download saves/scenario\u0027s, communicate, log, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m suggesting a website\u00A0that I\u0027d like to create whereby a single save is created, stripped of non-essentials and uploaded to a server. Community members can then create their own groups, allowing others to join in a community goal, create a schedule of flights that other users can commit to, perform scheduled actions and then re-upload the file allowing the next scheduled user to download and continue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, this could all be\u00A0garbage really, but it would be good to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-07T14:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2016 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by udk_lethal_d0se\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"greenTurtle1134","CreatedById":167701,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T21:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could probably whip up a program to merge saves, so you\u00A0fly a mission, merge the craft into the save, while other people fly other missions.
