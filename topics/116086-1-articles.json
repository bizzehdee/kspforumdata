I play on OS X and don\u0027t have problems other than having a scandalously low amount of RAM. Because of this I don\u0027t use the max textures, which might be related to why I don\u0027t have crashes. Also, while in orbit my computer often doesn\u0027t even load the texture resolution that I set, making it run faster. So, basically what KSK said, adjust the resolution settings and hope it gets fixed. If there\u0027s a bug that makes the game unusable for a lot of players I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a high priority for Squad."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:48:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hopefully Unity 5 (is that the latest version?) will fix some of the OS X problems and if not, I\u0027m sure Squad won\u0027t be leaving us Mac users swinging in the breeze.\n\nUnity 5.1 is the latest, but Squad says that there were issues with 5.1 that didn\u0027t apply to 5.0, so they are, initially at least, targetting 5.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:55:26Z","Content":"Make sure to check for crashed KSP instances with your activity monitor... it nearly made my hardware shut down due to heat a few days ago, because 3 crashed instances were still generating a whole lot of cpu usage in the background... and yes, i agree... 1.0.x is a real pain on OSX.
