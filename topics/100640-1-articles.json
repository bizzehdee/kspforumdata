Kerbin is quite small compared to the earth, and has MUCH lower orbital velocity. The orbital speed of the ISS for example, is ~7.5 km/s so real life SSTOs require a lot more fuel. 2.

Assuming somebody tried to balance them and didn\u0027t just assign values randomly it makes some sense from a gameplay perspective: if the mainsail, for example, had better ISP than everything else, in addition to its superior thrust, I wouldn\u0027t ever need to use anything else (instead the 48-7S has better ISP and TWR so only partcount keeps me from never using anything else); having fuel tanks with varied mass ratios would drive people to use the better tanks whenever possible, in which case, why bother including the others. However, it does ruin the rocket equation for those silly cases where you don\u0027t take any payload.\n\nIt\u0027s worth noting that you only need somewhere over a 10:1 fuel:everything else ratio to get into earth orbit (with an ISP typical of a large bipropellant rocket), so if real life rocket engines were balanced (or not) from a gameplay perspective and fuel storage scaled as well as it does in-game you could do some pretty unrealistic things here as well."},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T23:51:29Z","Content":"Maybe air breathers should not exceed 600m/s without melting the compressors.\n\nIf the game was very realistic SSTO would not even be possible, like on earth.\n\nRockets are also way overpowered in this game.\n\nIt\u0027s almost like squad was more concerned about building and flying things in space than just struggling to get there.\n\nIt seems that these old arguments may be only for pre-release versions of the game, but who knows?\n\nMaybe the release will also be easy for experienced players and focused on fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T23:57:22Z","Content":"It\u0027s less an issue of \u0027are SSTOs OP?\u0027 than it is \u0027Is the stock system too small for the part stats?\u0027.
