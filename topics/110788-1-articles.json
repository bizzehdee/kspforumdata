Try balancing that pencil when it\u0027s moving super sonic. With no weight up top it\u0027ll want to rip around backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it\u0027s good practice to build rockets so they stage higher up around 25-30km. Radial boosters is fine they can be dumped whenever. But when it comes to serial staging that will make your craft shorter you must make it so the first stage does more work. Once your above 30km it\u0027s easy. The air is thin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother hint is to simply wait. This had been working great for me. The problem is in the early careers your limited to small rockets. Small rockets are harder then big rockets because they are far more susceptible to the air and lack a heavy payload. So what I\u0027ve been doing is if I can\u0027t get my rocket to stage really high up I wait. Let the first stage burn out then just hold prograde and wait until 25-30km before separating and continuing on.

A perfect rocket would have the center of thrust all the way at the bottom and the center of mass all the way at the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinglets and control surfaces increase stability in that they counteract aerodynamic pressures exerted on the opposite end of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket is a big lever with the COM being the fulcrum. Your job is to keep the top of the rocket from being pushed in the wrong direction by aerodynamics by controlling the direction of thrust coming out the bottom. The more difficult you make it for that lever to be pushed the wrong way, the more stability your rocket will have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENextly, SRB\u0027s. While they have their use, their main purpose is to get you off the pad and moving so that your control surfaces can take over. They have no ability to direct your rocket other than forward. The longer you burn them, the more magnified errors in flight become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Rely less on SRB\u0027s and more on engines with gimballed nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep your COT as low as possible. In two images, you have SRB\u0027s half way up the rocket. Bad physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Until you get some more experimentation under your belt, use winglets, canards are better. Two of your rockets have no winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Reaction Wheels - Adds another control factor to your rockets. Get them as soon as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Drag. With version 1.0\u002B This has become a new huge reality. Do this as a test. Send up just your SRB with a cockpit on top. Let it fly straight up, and check it\u0027s max altitude. Next, strap 4 of your parachutes on it and launch again. Again, check the altitude. I think you\u0027ll be stunned at the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. This is just my preference and may make no difference. Have your stability enhancers detach in the same stage as your engine ignition. If you fire off the engines without detaching, you\u0027ll soon see your rocket start to wobble. That wobble gets translated into your launch direction. Anything you can do to keep pointed the right way, do it. Even better, only use stability enhancers when you absolutely need to. I always put my rockets on the pad without them and only add them if absolutely necessary. Rocket engines and SRB\u0027s, unlike jet engines, have no spool-up time. Their thrust is almost instantly translated from your trust setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SultanSaidi","CreatedById":144891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T11:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh yeah i figured it out my problem was that i put my center of mass and center of thrust too close together because i didnt wanted a too high mass shift while destaging because of that i builded my rockets always a bit more wrong but now i think my wrong physiks thinking got correct thank you all for your help yaall \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you\u0027ve found the problem but I\u0027ll input my .02 for launches\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 make it somewhat aerodynamic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
