It works out the math between two bodies orbiting the same central one. As the landed vessel isnt orbiting so it cant work that out. The way I usually do those kind of launches is to time my launch for when the vessel is under the orbit path (I use KAC Launch Rendezvous alarm for that) and then use an orbit with a different eccentricity to catch/wait for the station, So one launch into the orbital plane for the station, and then its just time to wait for a rendezvous burn - you dont waste much fuel if any, and just need to wait for the distance to come in. Getting the vessel into the orbital plane of the target object is the key to saving fuel (thats my opinion anyways \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thegreatgonz","CreatedById":135977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T05:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting some fairly sketchy results from this plugin.

Alexmoon\u0027s planner gives that, TWP does not as far as I can tell. For me this is the important thing for a transfer. Exactly how you get into the transfer orbit doesn\u0027t matter, if you leave at the right time and aim for the given apo and peri round the Sun you\u0027ll get your transfer. For example if you want to leave Laythe, snag a slingshot off Tylo, and get to Kerbin Transfer Window Planner is never going to tell you the exact ejection burn from Laythe orbit but if you know the solar apo and peri you want you can work towards that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, and adding more complexity, the ability to specify the inclination and longitude of the ascending node as well as the altitude of the parking orbit.
