For instance, with Build Rate 1 at 1 BP/s and Build Rate 2 at 0.5 BP/s if you have a ship worth 600 build points and a second ship worth 300 build points then they would complete at the same time 10 minutes later (600BP @ 1 BP/s = 10 minutes, 300BP @ 0.5 BP/s = 10 minutes). If you never upgrade the second rate then the first ship would have to be complete before the second ship would have any progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, they let you build multiple ships at once. The reason later ones have larger increases is because multiple rates is less useful than one really fast rate (a 2 BP/s primary rate is functionally equivalent to two 1BP/s rates, but if you only have one ship building then the 2BP/s rate is more useful. With two ships they are equivalent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SPH has it\u0027s own rates, btw, which are upgraded in the same manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take a look at why the GUI is disappearing and not coming back.

In terms of calculating the amount of time required to build a particular craft - as I understand it KCT takes into account the number of particular parts that are being built and how often they have been built, so the same craft built over an over again will be built quicker. May I suggest that similar account is taken of the joint between two parts. So if you regularly put a poodle underneath a jumbo, then the jumbo/poodle attachment becomes something that your engineers are familiar with building and so they get quicker at doing it, whereas if you choose to but a mainsail underneath instead, and have never done that before then that becomes something that will take along while the first time you do it.

You can make these are usual, dump them in a recycle bin, process them back into rocketparts and make the new parts/ships with the ELP then recover the built ship.

(though I dont know how much easier)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with splitting the mod is that I either have to have two separate mods with the same features (and update both when bugs are discovered/new features added) or have KCT use the other mod for simulations (harder for me to do with my current programming knowledge). What if someone decides to add KCT in after trying the simulation mod? Then the data needs to be transferable too so they can seamlessly switch. It\u0027s doable, and may almost be preferable in some ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifying the existing code is probably easier, I just need to disable some features when a certain boolean is set (that\u0027s how disabling per game is done). The convenient thing about it is that you could switch between the two settings without having to exit the game. Several times I wanted to use simulations but not deal with build times (I generally just set the overall time modifier to 0.0001 in that case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKCT is small enough (less than 100kb for the .dll) that I don\u0027t think splitting the functionality will save anything there (downloading the whole mod and disabling part isn\u0027t too hard). Though I can see an advantage to using the simulations with other mods (MCE for example) where having a separate .dll and opening it up to modders with an API (to do what exactly, I don\u0027t know) would be beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of APIs, I have considered making one but haven\u0027t seen a need. I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027d open up. If there are other modders who want to integrate with KCT in some way, or if anyone thinks of things that should be able to be controlled by other mods (build times, maybe) let me know. KCT is almost feature complete meaning a full release is relatively soon. An API may be one of the features that should be included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Splitting is probably harder, but may be better, but I probably won\u0027t do it.

Didn\u0027t feel it deserved its own number and many of the changes are bug fixes. Among the new features there are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to reset spent upgrades (costs two upgrade points to activate. Just makes it as if you never spent any, you still have the total amount afterward)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can opt out of using parts from the inventory in new builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In the editor GUI you can manually define the rate that should be used for displaying the estimated time. By default it is the highest appropriate rate you have. Later I will probably add a quick way to check what your rates are from the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Names are pulled directly from the text field in the editor, instead of from the ShipConstruct, meaning you don\u0027t have to save the ship for the name to appear correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe big one:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can disable ships taking time to build but still use simulations. New tech unlocks are instant, but any ships currently being built or tech being researched will continue as normal. This is essentially a \u0022simulation only\u0022 mode, as discussed in the past few posts. This is turned on in the settings menu with \u0022Disable Build Times?\u0022. Note: This is cheating if you temporarily turn it on to get a ship instantly built (say, for a rescue mission or for a launch window) and we will all judge you for that (it\u0027s like hyperediting a rescue ship into orbit). However, if you ALWAYS use it, then that\u0027s pretty legitimate, since you\u0027d just be using it for simulations, which still have to be unlocked normally (unless you override the body tracker, in which case I might consider you a cheater).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, maybe I should move some of the settings to a \u0022cheat\u0022 window so that people are aware that they\u0027re kinda cheaty.
