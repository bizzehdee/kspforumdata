We are done for, thrice blasted and skint. Well, to be more precise, we are quite well-off, it\u0027s just that we can\u0027t spend any of our damned funds anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI must confess that we\u0027ve had this coming for quite a while and our space programme has crawled through the past year or so on a bucket full of borrowed time (or six). Two months after our last trip to the Moon failed to deliver any further insight into the origins or purpose of the Monuments we detected there, the Trans Atlantic Resources Company cut off its funding and reclaimed their assets in Kourou, denying us access to this crucial equatorial site that had made our spaceplanes so useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe kept going against all odds for a year after that, but a lack of any further transmissions other than the still enigmatic pictures of alien motherships and bacteria, as well as a failed second attempt by Froemone to deliver a useful quantity of water-ice mined from a Near Earth Asteroid (despite his best attempt and the most powerful nuclear reactor we could cram onto one of our Prayssac boosters), meant that our days were numbered. Our best attempt simply hadn\u0027t been good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wD4Qkbs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wD4Qkbs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCrucially, we had failed to deliver the critical new technologies our sponsors had been fantasizing about (and it was our own silly fault for promising them in the first place to ensure their continued support), such as advanced fission reactors, nuclear fusion, and other such science-fiction nonsense that a spacefaring race of aliens from another star system must certainly have developed to get here in the first place. Technologies that would be infinitely useful in keeping our isolated Kerbal communitites alive, and even allowing us to expand into the Sol system. To the Moon, to Mars, the asteroid belt, and perhaps even beyond. The Great Dream of the Resources Alliance had failed before it ever came to pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut the most heartbreaking, gut-wrenching moment had been switching off \u003Cem\u003EMartel Two\u003C/em\u003E; the second probe we had sent to the gigantic, cold reaches of the outer solar system. Her sister ship, \u003Cem\u003EMartel One\u003C/em\u003E, had succumbed to the punishing radiation belts of Jupiter more than a year ago, but not before returning stunning images of the gas giant and its moons, and giving us confirmation that the alien artifacts were not confined to the inner solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut Trans Pacific\u0027s new policy limited space flight to a couple of comsat launches per year using the remaining \u003Cem\u003ECarderie\u003C/em\u003E spaceplanes stationed at Omelek, so \u003Cem\u003EMartel Two\u003C/em\u003E had been terminated half-way through her six-year journey to Saturn. Without our remote instructions, the probe\u0027s engines would not fire to bring her into orbit around the beautiful, ringed jewel of a planet. She would sweep past her intended destination, a piece of cold, dead space debris, destined to wander on a wide solar orbit for all eternity, or as close as dammit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225tvzZci.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5tvzZci.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNaturally, any further crewed flights were out of the question. And so, my days as a planetary scientist and Kerbonaut at the head of a programme that was no longer authorised to explore any planets or launch any Kerbals into space were numbered also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe letter came this morning. I knew that I would be relieved from my position. I didn\u0027t bother opening it, but instead left the untouched envelope on my desk and stormed out of the office to find out when the next Air Service flight out of Omelek would be. Damn all of this to hell and back, and backwards to boot. I have a few calls to make, and then I\u0027m going home to play some golf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYEAR 9, DAY 89. BARTDON.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter much deliberation and haggling at the Air Service office, I worked out an itinerary that would get me home. It wasn\u0027t the quickest or simplest route, being a westbound journey that made use of just about every means of transportation that Kerbal civilisation had invented to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe first leg, mercifully, was the late-morning, westbound supersonic flight to Tanegashima. One of the reasons I\u0027d been wanting to travel sooner rather than later was to avoid having my privileges as Principal Investigator revoked, and leave Omelek in style. Waving my badge at the steward worked, and soon I was sitting in my favourite spot on the back row of the cabin near the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nBi7D05.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nBi7D05.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Air Service\u0027s punctuality was impeccable, as always. I will miss the kick of the Rapier engines flinging one hundred tonnes of composites, titanium and cryogenic methane fuel along the runway and pulling up just in time to avoid obliteration in the Pacific Ocean. Usually, this service would be taking me to oversee a launch from Kourou, or to meet the Board of Directors in Uchinoura. I never expected it to be taking me on what was beginning to look like a permanent vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mY4kk31.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mY4kk31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TL504K3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TL504K3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSoon we were climbing swiftly towards \u003Cem\u003ELivernon\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s cruising altitude of 25,000 metres, the slender ship flicking aside the sound barrier with contemptuous ease. I glanced across the aisle at a middle aged Kerbelle who was obviously flying supersonic for the first time. Clinging to her seat, she gazed out of the thick, laminated glass in terror as the orange glow of ionised plasma began to lick at the aircraft\u0027s airframe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JXs4Pf5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JXs4Pf5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI, however, felt absolutely elated at the prospect of escaping the recent drudgery and tedium that surrounded the role of Principal Investigator. I leaned across the aisle and said to her with a wink, \u201CDon\u0027t worry, old gal. This is nothing. You should see how hot it gets at Mach 25.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe boys up front were obviously intent on reaching Tanegashima in time for lunch, and the westbound route \u2013 at just under 4,500 kilometres \u2013 was well within \u003Cem\u003ELivernon\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s capabilities, so they were pushing her to well over Mach 4.5: the glow surrounding the craft was beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L3BVyWv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L3BVyWv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLess than an hour after take-off, I felt the engines spool down as \u003Cem\u003ELivernon\u003C/em\u003E pitched forward to bleed off height and speed before hitting the lower atmosphere. This, I knew, was the most challenging part of the flight for the crew who had to avoid overshooting our destination without causing the aircraft to burn up or over-stress the airframe, although I refrained from sharing this information with my concerned traveling companion. In the end, the crew had to pull some pretty tight curves to line us up with the runway at a reasonable speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uhAqkWy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uhAqkWy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter disembarking and thanking the crew for such a swift and pleasant flight, I took a short walk across the tarmac to where my next ride was already waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022H6145qI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H6145qI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HfpKuHY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HfpKuHY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI had managed to negotiate the jump-seat of a large freighter flying from Tanegashima to Xichang, the shortest leg of my journey, in distance at least. \u003Cem\u003ECrepin\u003C/em\u003E was a big, ugly cargo hauler, one of the workhorses currently used to fly equipment and supplies around the planet. The crew was already busy going through the preflight checklist so I showed myself on board, climbing up the ramp into the cargo bay, through the rows of pallets and up a ladder to the pressurised door that lead to the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e1QmtFi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e1QmtFi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NrVipkF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NrVipkF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI was greeted by a friendly \u201CHowdy!\u201D from the three-Kerb crew of freight-dogs; Captain Donlin, First Officer Lizphie and Load Master Corbles. These Kerbs were not from the Air Service, but from one of the many subcontractors that flew for Trans Pacific, Trans Indian, and other companies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey lived a hard and thankless life, most of it spent in the air and far away from home, if they even had one. In fact, as I watched them finish their checklist, grab a quick snack before take-off and taxi out whilst complaining about their salaries, the weather (or lack thereof) and just about anything they could think of, I realised that they were more like a family than a team. I therefore expected to feel like an intruder for the duration of the flight, and resigned myself to flicking through the data screen in front of me. However, Corbles made me feel instantly welcome with the news that \u003Cem\u003ECrepin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s tiny galley was equipped with an excellent quality expresso machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou ever flown into Xichang, boss?\u201D asked Captain Donlin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSipping my coffee, I confessed that I hadn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWell, you might want to buckle in tight then, sir.

Mountainous terrain lay ahead: the Himalayas, the scourge of all Kerbal aviators, as Corbles aptly put it. It could also be the scourge of Kerbonauts returning from orbit, I\u0027d replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWith peaks rising to well over 11,000 metres in places, this mountain range was no place to suffer an engine failure, or to perform an off-course re-entry, since some of the blasted summits were high enough to take out a jet at cruising altitude. Our ship was carrying a reasonable load (and I was soon to find out why), and a relatively small amount of fuel for our short trip, so \u003Cem\u003ECrepin\u003C/em\u003E had no trouble slaloming between some of the taller mountains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gHMwgwI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gHMwgwI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut as we banked hard to commence our approach, I caught my first glimpse of Xichang and let loose an awed \u003Cem\u003Eblast!\u003C/em\u003E as I realised where we were about to land. Xichang was nestled in the eastern end of the Himalayan range, surrounded by crests and ridges that reached at least four thousand metres; more, in places. A particularly high ridge lay slap bang in the way of final approach, but this was the only route in if we were to have any hope of performing a go-around, should anything go wrong during our descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZHXssF0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZHXssF0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCaptain Dunlin announced, \u201CShe\u0027s mine; flaps two, please override thrust reverser lock-out,\u201D and took full manual control of the big bird, pulling her into a steep bank to bring us across the slope to the centreline, whilst diving from nearly 6,000 metres to the deck. Just after nosing over, he applied full thrust which I thought was insane until I realised that it was full \u003Cem\u003Ereverse\u003C/em\u003E thrust. I turned to Corbles, wondering if the aircraft was designed to use thrust-reversers in flight. His jaded look and gallic shrug said it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COh, this is our SOP for Xichang.

Once on the centreline, he pulled the wings level and stamped on the rudder to line up\u003Cem\u003E Crepin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s nose with the runway. Just short of the threshold, he heaved back on the yoke to arrest a terrifying rate of descent. \u003Cem\u003ECrepin\u003C/em\u003E hit hard, but didn\u0027t bounce and skidded to a halt just over half way down in a cloud of hot exhaust from the much-abused thrust reversers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dWPH5hl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dWPH5hl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThere you go sir,\u201D said Corbles cheerfully, \u201CSorry you didn\u0027t get a kiss landing, but we charge extra for those.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CKiss landings are for little Kerbelles,\u201D snorted Captain Donlin contemptuously. I know several Kerbelle Air Service test pilots and Kerbonauts who would have a thing or two to say about that, I thought, but I didn\u0027t press the matter. Instead, I thanked them for a pleasant flight, grabbed my bag, and made my way over to the Air Service Office to await my next flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Uvpdz6F.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uvpdz6F.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter a couple more hours in the cool, damp, mountain air, I boarded a \u003Cem\u003EMasseries\u003C/em\u003E Combi for what would be, by far, the longest route of this trip. The ubiquitous \u003Cem\u003EMasseries\u003C/em\u003E airframe had been around in many different configurations for as long as I could remember: passenger variants, freighters, and the combi that seated 16 passengers and could carry a few tonnes of cargo in the rear bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor a long time, the \u003Cem\u003EMasseries\u003C/em\u003E range had been powered by thirsty low-bypass jet engines, and had hopped from one runway to another around our planet. In the past couple of years, however, almost all of them had been re-engined with large, fuel-sipping propfans.

The capsule stabilised for a moment, pinned against the larger ship\u0027s fuel tank. Miraculously, neither the hull of our lander, nor the tank itself had ruptured.

The white-hot glow from \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s exhaust illuminated the cabin like broad daylight on Earth.

My furious mental calculations told me that twenty seconds at one gee meant about two hundred metres per second.

None of it made sense, so I kicked off the floor to the capsule window and looked down at the Martian moon below. It was drifting visibly closer by the second, and Margaret apparently had no intention whatsoever of changing course. Whether this had been her original plan or whether she had realised that we had managed to hitch a ride and had therefore resolved to ensure none of us ever left Phobos, I will never know. All I knew was that in just under two minutes, the unplanned, hastily assembled \u003Cem\u003ECernin-C\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E composite ship would go crater-making.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWe have to get out of here...\u201D I breathed at no-one in particular.

I pushed off towards him to check it was properly sealed and then hollered at Jonnie to pull the plug. I was at the hatch and spinning it open before the last of the air had even been vented. Without taking a single moment to think, for fear of recoiling from what I was about to do, I threw myself into space and activated my KMU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jWOdxZv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jWOdxZv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI went into a wild spin for a few seconds before the old reflexes returned and I jabbed on the button that stabilised my rotation. I looked around and took stock: the retraction of the winch had dragged \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E up \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s hull as far as the laboratory, and as a result, the lander was partially obstructing the hatch that allowed access to the lab\u0027s airlock. OK, the forward crew module\u0027s airlock it is, then. But that meant traversing more than twenty metres of space, and going around the still spinning centrifuge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnother twenty seconds, at least.

I called out to Angun to start moving: there would simply be no time for us to make the trip one at a time if we were to have any chance of turning the situation around before impact. I realised with a glimmer of hope that we were on a grazing trajectory that would certainly take us into the wall of Stickney crater, but that might also allow us a reprieve of a minute or so more than my initial estimation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tRSTGY8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tRSTGY8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd as I squeezed the controls of my jetpack with a death grip, willing it to carry me faster across the few metres that separated me from the forward hatch, I heard Jonnie\u0027s voice cut through the static of my headphones. For a moment, I wondered who he was talking to, and then I understood that he had opened \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s high-gain antenna, and was transmitting. Incredibly, he was trying to send one last message back to Earth. It was futile, as the capsule was spinning, and most of what he said would be lost into the void. But the simple fact that our cool-headed test pilot had chosen to waste precious seconds in an attempt to inform mission control of the situation was spine-chilling, despite the fact that his voice was as calm and as matter-of-fact as ever. Even Jonnie thought that we had no chance of making it out of this alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMission Control, this is CTP Jonnie on board the lander \u003Cem\u003EC\u00E9r\u00E9\u003C/em\u003E.

We managed to attach to \u003Cem\u003ECernin\u003C/em\u003E with our harpoons but both vessels are currently out of control and heading towards Phobos at high speed.
