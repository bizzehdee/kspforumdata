And what with the long gap between transfer windows, I\u0027d like to do as much as I can in the way of collecting science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: is it better to build an interplanetary transport and make all or some of the individual craft small in-system things that are brought along on it, or just send everything individually from Kerbin, with the craft that have to come back given enough delta-vee to do so?
