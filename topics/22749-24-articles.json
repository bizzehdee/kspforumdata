The Soyuz-FG can put a couple hundred extra kilograms into orbit, and has been used when the Progress needed to lift more (e.g. a fully loaded Progress M-1). Most of the Progress launches to the ISS, though, have been on the -U. The last Progress-M (M-19M) was actually launched on a -U. As both the -U and the -FG are being phased out over the next two years, we probably won\u0027t see many Progress launches on the -U going forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Soyuz-U/TMA should be named the Soyuz-FG/TMA right, along with the Soyuz-FG/Progress-M rather than -U and -TM?

But since the BobCat models don\u0027t operate at the very limit of their ability to launch, it\u0027s sort of pointless to try and distinguish by name here, as there\u0027s no need to have a more powerful Soyuz. The launcher is based on the Soyuz-U, and sticking a ST fairing and a Fregat on it doesn\u0027t suddenly make the first stage more powerful, so it\u0027s arguably still a Soyuz-U. In real life, putting the Fregat plus payload or a Soyuz TMA on top of the Soyuz-U would just result in a lower initial LEO than you\u0027d want (or possibly a nice long parabolic arc back to somewhere in the Caucasus). The Soyuz-2 is indistinguishable from the Soyuz-U or the -TM -- the only difference is using the uprated RD-117/118 on the first stage vs. the RD-107/108 on the -U (or 107A/108A on the -FG). It\u0027s the same model for all three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe \u0027oldtype\u0027 Soyuz-U/Soyuz craft has always bothered me because I cannot find a single picture of any of the older variants of Soyuz with antennae that match Bobcats except for the one-time manned flight of the Soyuz Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program variant with the APAS docking system instead of the usual drogue/probe.

The Soyuz-T was, in part, based on the 7K-TM... the specially-modified version of the 7K-T ferry (the one that had no solar panels) used for ASTP. There aren\u0027t a hell of a lot of pictures of the -T; most come from the early days of Mir (the first few missions to Mir after launched used the Soyuz-T variant.) There are a good number of pictures of the -TM, though, and it looks pretty much exactly like Bobcat\u0027s Soyuz. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://users.skynet.be/satimage/satbase/soyuztm.JPG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a link to one.\u003C/a\u003E His -TMA is spot-on, though -- here\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-26/hires/jsc2010e194867.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuper hi rez photo of one from NASA.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T22:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by daver4470\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eedited to fix -TM photo link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T22:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, while reading the post above me, I couldn\u0027t help hearing this song in my head\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWHniL8MyMM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daver4470","CreatedById":57076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T22:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fyrem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fyrem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eok, while reading the post above me, I couldn\u0027t help hearing this song in my head\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWHniL8MyMM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Man in Black gets you a reputation point, sirrah!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T23:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey bobcat, you did say you would make a Voskod after .20 was released, are you still planning on doing that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltac","CreatedById":12493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T02:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey bobcat, you did say you would make a Voskod after .20 was released, are you still planning on doing that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter .20.5 probably. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article801276.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Brown\u002Bbear\u002B%28female%29\u002Band\u002Bits\u002Bchildren\u002Bplay\u002Bwith\u002Ba\u002Bball\u002Bin\u002BKamchatka\u002BPeninsula,\u002BRussia\u0022 alt=\u0022Brown\u002Bbear\u002B%28female%29\u002Band\u002Bits\u002Bchildren\u002Bplay\u002Bwith\u002Ba\u002Bball\u002Bin\u002BKamchatka\u002BPeninsula,\u002BRussia\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T02:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Bobcat or any of his team, I was wondering, if in the stuff you have planned, is there going to be one day a full on Saturn V system with Apollo command pod and LEM in one of your packs?
