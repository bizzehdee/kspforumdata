I got the shape kinda right, but this is a plane which takes off from the runway and not a VTOL thing. It does have VTOL capability for landing on other planets and moons, but when fully fueled the VTOL is too weak to counter Kerbins gravity. It has a stupid amount of air intakes, but most of them are hidden because I don\u0027t like unrealistic looking vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Capable of return missions for 3 kerbals to Duna, Ike, the Mun, Minmus and Gilly. I haven\u0027t attempted to reach Dres yet. I suspect it might be possible, but I\u0027m not very good at finding efficient paths to targets with inclined orbits. Theoretically it should be able to carry quite a bit of payload if I move the RCS tank and battery and stick something to the back, but I haven\u0027t tried that yet. Currently i\u0027m working on a semi disposable shuttle version which should be able to reach everywhere else except Eve, Tylo and Moho. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nsMHK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
