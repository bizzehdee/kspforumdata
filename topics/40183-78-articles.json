I have never ever suggested doing this, or listed at any time to ever have to do this. MCE can be installed directly over an existing MCE Folder without any issues. This is because your save files are a UniqueName.sp file and can never be overwritten (MCE does not ship with an .sp files). A lot of Mod authors want you to delete their folders because they are part files. And a lot of times Part files change, or get new Models. In those cases folders are moved and things change, so they need a fresh start for new folder structures. This is not the case with MCE. MCE mostly is just .dll files. .dll files can be overwritten without any of those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever need to delete your MCE folder I will clearly warn you before hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I work by myself on my free time for free.

They are looking pretty dang awsome! Not sure if I will release them when done, or wait until .24 is done. I have some work on my end to make them work in unity and MCE so might be a .24 update thing. But I will post pictures once things get rolling on my end. So thanks again HellDiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also done some more gameTime with the New .72 Default Price values in MCE. (IE KSP config Part cost) and have noted that even the updated prices I suggest people use for MCESettings.cfg file might still be way to easy. I highly suggest going down even more to .6, .7 and .8. Unless of course you like it, then leave it the way you want. So hard to balance things to everyones taste.

My idea was to actually make it available for people to edit the Random Planet Name list. That way they can add more planets or change the names for RSS. And to edit all the varibles like max AP and Min PE. The way it is now MCE contracts are written just for vanilla KSP planets. So this way someone could edit the config file and make it work for RSS. But like I said for some reason it was not working, and the NODE system was not working correct for the way I have it written in code. (might be bad code on my part). I could do it, but I would have to rewrite the whole code system I think. And thats the work load problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping though. I know lot RSS guys wanted MCE to be more friendly toward RSS and even planetFactory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way the code is written right now is that everything is hardcoded. And everyplanet has a Max AP and Min PE set up inside. Also they have Base Pay for Money and Science. It was these things I wanted to be loaded into a config file for easy editing. And have it set up as a List or dictionary. that way people could also add more stuff if they wished. And all MCE would do is Load the List every game session from config File. And when I random mission came up for contract the contract would get the names from that config file.
