Drag is of course enormous here, and there is a real risk of burning up. FYI the first simtest ended with the Mk1 cockpit exploding due to overheating, at about 10km. (2) stability--call it poor design if you want, but in simtesting I Bill found myself himself unable to control the ship in a lower turn. In fact, it started to flip even doing the turn at 30km--but the air was thin enough I could get back on track.\n\nThe careful reader will note I lampshaded this with Bob\u0027s comments in the pre-flight checklist ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027ve also been asked why I didn\u0027t asparagus-stage. The answer is pretty simple: I had always intended to. I simtested a prototype with simple staging, thinking I would just see how short I was and then know what other changes I had to make. When the prototype blasted to orbit from sea level with 400 m/s to spare, I decided to just go with what I had. I guess that\u0027s also the answer to why I didn\u0027t spend more time on the ascent profile ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nLastly, the design requirement to SSTO from Kerbin came into play. The ship actually had less margin doing that than it did getting to Eve orbit...so I took the first solution that worked for both ascents, went with it, and got back to writing the comic. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T17:29:10Z","Content":"Remember, everyone - Jeb is Air Service and Bob is Space Service IIRC, so they\u0027re getting a Kerbfleet (kind of military) court-martial.\n\nSo Mister Civilian Administrator Mort has absolutely no say in the result of said CM.\n\nWith that hope spot established, happy landings! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T17:46:51Z","Content":"There is only one piece of music in existence badass enough to accompany this great chapter. \n\nGentlemen, behold:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPf_PJlJsJQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T20:30:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There is only one piece of music in existence badass enough to accompany this great chapter.\n\nI\u0027ll admit, I wanted the soundtrack to be \u0022Magic Carpet Ride\u0022-- but as soon as the M7 lifted off *this* was what I was humming.
