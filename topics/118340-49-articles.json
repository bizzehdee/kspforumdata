Click on it, you will find a menu with details of the pad. Copy the position. Close everything, except the game.\n\n\\*Again open Ctrl\u002Bk, and click on spawn new and find for spawn marker. Click on it as soon as you find it. Click on paste position. Save the marker as a launch site. Try moving it down little to fit your rockets in the pad.\n\n\\*Use launch clamps, outerwise you rocket will start jumping\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T13:07:49Z","Content":"Been a long term fan of this project- can I ask for a progress report?"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T14:33:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Been a long term fan of this project- can I ask for a progress report?\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/23/2016 at 0:57 PM, Tristonwilson12 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is a VERY soon update\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E this weekend\n\u003E \n\nKappa"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T14:41:09Z","Content":"i finally got unity to work and I will get everything packaged up on my git hub...\n\nIncluding this little guy (still working on the animations for it tho)\n\n![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/231003929956057099/231553430504603648/unknown.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T14:51:44Z","Content":"What is it"}]}
