This is understandable, but I can\u0027t help but feel as if SQUAD could have just delayed the update a couple weeks or so. I would HAPPILY sit for 2-3 weeks if it meant that the features I\u0027ve been waiting AGES for would be, in my opinion, in the most hyped update in a while. You may feel differently, and I do NOT intend on throwing any heat at SQUAD; I love Kerbal Space Program, it\u0027s one of, if not my most favorite game on Steam. I\u0027m just a little (make that severely) disappointed. Probe telemetry was my most anticipated feature of 1.1, as I was dreaming of making my own version of the TDRS system (reference:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_and_Data_Relay_Satellite_System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_and_Data_Relay_Satellite_System\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I got that out of my system, I would like to hear your guy\u0027s opinions on the matter.
