My advice is either do your deorbit burn relatively low or make sure you compensate for the rotation of the body (Mun shouldn\u0027t matter much). Line up your trajectory into the ground past your actual target because you\u0027ll burn some of that off as you burn retrograde for the landing. How much to aim past is hard to say, it\u0027ll be based on your speed, altitude, body rotation speed, and a little experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is build a ship that can carry a small disposable rocket rover with a probe core. Then just land anywhere within about 30km and you\u0027re golden. Any rover really but a rocket rover with landing gear that can hop over craters is more forgiving imo and faster. Or bring enough fuel that you can land and then make short hops over to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me landing on target was worse than learning orbital rendezvous but a little patience and trying different things will go a long way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-03T22:43:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2014 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T22:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, as we\u0027re talking about the Mun we don\u0027t have to watch for the rotation as the mun is tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the EASIEST but most fuel consuming way of precise landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou obviously need an orbit going over your target as a starting position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you\u0027ve a lander with a high TWR and a lot of spare fuel: simply burn retrograde directly over your target until your predicted path is a straight fall down on it. then you have to slow down your fall and smothely touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe EFFICIENT way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estart the retrograde burn further away like a quarter or a third of an orbit if you have low TWR and/or less fuel. but watch where your predicted path hits the ground.
