I use RealFuels. I wrote up a ModuleManager patch that makes the orbiter work with RealFuels:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/wshk7htvw8i3k8o/KSO_realfuels_v1.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wshk7htvw8i3k8o/KSO_realfuels_v1.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain engines are set up for liquid hydrogen, side boosters for kerosene/LOX, OMS thrusters for MMH/N2O4. If you set up your staging to jettison the external tank at the same time as you activate the OMS thrusters, you\u0027ll switch over automatically, because the orbiter itself doesn\u0027t hold fuel for the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested both orbiters to orbit (with FAR), but this is just a rough first draft, so there might be some bugs, let me know if anything horrible happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westi29","CreatedById":80595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T03:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy not make it an option? or have it toggleable?
