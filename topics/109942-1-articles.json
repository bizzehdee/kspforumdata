Using the large radial RCS tank to propel the seat pretty much gives the look of a roof/floor that you are after and you can attach things by using the offset tool... it\u0027s fiddly but it works. I added pretty much every science experiment to the version that I made and it still fly\u0027s very well in low/zero gravity.\n\nI\u0027m at work at the moment so can\u0027t post a picture but can do so later if you like...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T14:06:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gmiddlemass**"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:08:55Z","Content":"This is the version I made, works well for exploring low gravity areas like Minmus (and looks a little bit like a Dalek) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)...\n\n![?interpolation=lanczos-none\u0026output-format=jpeg\u0026output-quality=95\u0026fit=inside|2048:1152\u0026composite-to=*,*|2048:1152\u0026background-color=black](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37498056377500724/288AC1C21921B54C357760C40400222E0E5D5FAB/?interpolation=lanczos-none\u0026output-format=jpeg\u0026output-quality=95\u0026fit=inside%7C2048:1152\u0026composite-to=*,*%7C2048:1152\u0026background-color=black)\n\nEdit: Hmmm.. not sure why the picture won\u0027t show but the link should work anyway if you copy it into your browser.\n\n![oAQhK7d.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/oAQhK7d.jpg?1)\n\nEdit...
