When I first read about the kOS mod, I envisioned setting up automated resupply missions to my space station while my main mission to another planet is going on. But of course the problem is you can only have influence or control over one entity at a time. So it would be neat for example have an automated task setup like something in kOS/Mechjeb and the click on the probe/AI to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Do Task A\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E and then the ship with that computer on it would undock, go to a refueler, fill up, come back and transfer it or what ever else you have in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you could also make Bill and Bob follow (walk with you) while on a planet instead of doing one by one? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would come much later in the development though, around 0.40 or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think \u003Cstrong\u003EAutopilot\u003C/strong\u003E has a different context than AI or player Controlled. It\u0027s not about Squad making a MechJeb for you but instead allowing other Kerbals and Probes to do Tasks that you setup while you\u0027re controlling your main person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T21:34:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nostromo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
