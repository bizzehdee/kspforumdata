My game has been crashing occasionally since I got it, and I was able to find a graphics setting combination that let my computer run KSP without crashing for at least a few hours. After realizing that I never updated to 1.0.4, I updated it and lost my graphics settings (I think because I downloaded the new version from the site and copied my saves over rather than updating it some other way, this was the only way that seemed to work). Now the game could crash as often as every few minutes, (so far while flying low over Kerbin, when going back to KSC or into a different building). I\u0027ve tried to read over the last few pages of this thread to get an idea of what I could do, but I think it would be best for me to just ask. I am not even sure if it\u0027s KSP, as my computer is 3 years old and has been through a lot of traveling to and from university, as well as to the ground, without landing gears. I also think my system specs might be on the lower end of what KSP requires.\n\nCould someone help me figure out where I stand in system specs (if they might be causing some issues and I really should lower settings). I am also graduating this next year, and I have a birthday coming up, so I\u0027m considering getting a new computer, (hopefully a PC), is that a good idea, bad idea, or just won\u0027t help or hurt.\n\nHere are my system specs:\n\nOS: 10.10.3\n\nMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)\n\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\n\nMemory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\n\nI know I\u0027ve seen people post more specs of their computers, but I don\u0027t know where to find them, sorry about that."},{"CreatedByName":"Wobblier","CreatedById":147042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T21:54:34Z","Content":"I think your specs are more then reasonable.

It really is damaging my experience and I can\u0027t really be bothered with KSP if it just keeps crashing every 10 minutes (no, seriously, I\u0027m not exaggerating). I know it\u0027s a lot of work to do, but the devs must at least do something to try and fix these issues."},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:40:15Z","Content":"Tom, \n\nTry the tweaks listed in this thread. They really do help. I\u0027m pretty much able to play without crashing, unless I do something really stupid like have a bunch of windows open and then try to change scenes. I play with about 20 mods, including KIS, KAS and a bunch of parts packs, and while my graphics res isn\u0027t ideal, I can at least play for several hours without disruption.\n\n///on another note///\n\nI noticed something new this morning. I have a memory monitor app installed, so I can keep an eye on my system memory. I generally hover around ~6gb free space when I\u0027m not doing anything, but after a KSP hang yesterday that required a force kill, I noticed my free memory never recovered. It was hovering around 1.5gb with nothing open. I force killed everything and didn\u0027t see any improvement. So I started nosing around in activity monitor and there was nothing in the memory usage tab, but under the CPU tab were two instances of KSP, one of which was running at about 55% CPU usage. I forced them to die, and immediately recovered the missing memory.\n\nSo thought for the day - if you have a KSP hangup and force kill the app, go into activity monitor and look for lingering processes and kill them too. Otherwise, it seems like you get into a spiral of diminishing returns that leads to eventually running out of memory."},{"CreatedByName":"cwalrus","CreatedById":146367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:51:51Z","Content":"JJ i noticed that as well - very odd. 50% of my cpu (which is 8 core so that\u0027s out of 800%)\n\nTom hang in there- i have finally achieved long periods of no crashing.

I would just like to know what it is before I download it, and not just follow someone\u0027s advice blindly, even if they are highly regarded in the community. Sorry for having so many questions.\n\nOkay... first question about killing the KSP process... I\u0027ve only noticed the phantom KSP process when I have to force quit the game after it hangs. So that\u0027s when you\u0027ll want to do that. If I quit normally, it looks like everything goes back to normal.\n\nAs far as running in low res- as I understand it, all that does is disable Retina for that window and allows it to run in normal resolution. As I understand the way that retina works, basically it\u0027s a super high resolution screen that scales down to normal resolutions to proceed really high-fidelity graphics. Basically, the pixels on the screen are smaller, so you can use more of them to draw and create finer resolution images. Running in low res basically disables that and allows KSP to run under a normal resolution. A conflict appears to be occurring for retina users because of the way OS X packs graphics in a retina display.\n\nAs far as ATM - there is some debate if it\u0027s worth using right now. I think it is. What it does, in a nutshell, is take standard graphics formats (jpg, bmp, png) and compresses them on the fly into more a more efficient format - DDS - that eats less memory. Think of it this way, if you have a jpg image that\u0027s 128x128 - and jpg\u0027s store data at 24 bits per pixel (8bits for red, 8 for green, 8 for blue), that\u0027s 128 \\* 128 \\* 24, that\u0027s 393,216 bits per image. At 8 bits/byte, that comes to 49k per texture file.\n\nIn comparison, DDS only uses 5 bits per color channel, so you get 128 \\* 128 \\* 15 = 245,760 bits per image, or 30k per texture file. \n\nThe real benefit comes when your jpg files are 512x512 or 1024x1024 and you use aggressive ATM to reduce them to 128x128. A 512x512 jpg would be 6,291,456 bits, or 786k per texture file. Compare that to 30k per texture file. There\u0027s quite a bit of savings there. This doesn\u0027t even begin to touch on DXT compression.\n\nFor your eyes, you won\u0027t see hardly any difference between jpg texture maps and DDS texture maps. In fact, most mod designers are already using DDS, which is why ATM might be a moot point. For those who aren\u0027t, however, there is some memory savings to be gained from using it."},{"CreatedByName":"DannyS","CreatedById":145339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:15:48Z","Content":"I opened it in low resolution mode and I think I got 2 hours of playing time without a crash.

It reminded me of some of the problems we have with KSP on a Mac.\n\nKSP is based on Unity. Unity runs on Mono. Mono may have been compiled on GCC. Software compiled on GCC uses glibc. The multithreaded implementation of malloc() and free() in glibc wastes memory under some circumstances.\n\nIn short, small (by default smaller than 128 kB) memory allocations done by threads other than the main thread are typically served from so-called arenas. An arena is a smallish memory region (1 MB on 32-bit systems), so there are usually many arenas at the same time. When a thread tries to allocate memory, it cycles through all arenas, starting from the one where it last allocated memory successfully, until it finds one where the request can be served. If all arenas (where the thread could acquire mutex) are full, a new arena is created. When a thread calls free(), the deallocated region isn\u0027t really freed, unless it was the highest allocated region in an arena.\n\nIf there are many small allocations and deallocations, the end result is a lot of fragmented arenas with unallocated regions inside them. Because many free() calls don\u0027t actually free the memory, while many malloc() calls don\u0027t fit in the holes in the existing arenas, memory usage tends to grow slowly over time. This isn\u0027t really a memory leak, because everything is under control, but it certainly looks like one.\n\nI don\u0027t know whether this is the real cause of the memory leak in KSP, but it could explain the symptoms."},{"CreatedByName":"andrewmcgr","CreatedById":157803,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T12:33:06Z","Content":"I just solved this issue on my machine, and I guess people would like to know how.\n\nI read a bit about Unity crashing issues in general, and I read that certain very old fonts could cause Unity crashes, and this led me to look in my user font library, only to see this:\n\nAndrews-iMac:FontCollections andrewmcgregor$ ls -l\n\ntotal 136\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   1341 18 Oct  2004 Chinese.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff    899 18 Oct  2004 Classic.collection\n\n-rwx------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   2380 26 Jul  2012 Fixed Width.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff    872 18 Oct  2004 Fun.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   2477 18 Oct  2004 Japanese.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   1217 18 Oct  2004 Korean.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff    815 18 Oct  2004 Modern.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff    856 18 Oct  2004 PDF.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   1164 18 Oct  2004 Web.collection\n\n-rw-rw----\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  23606  3 Dec  2007 Windows Office Compatible.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   1492  7 Dec  2007 com.apple.Favorites.collection\n\n-rw-------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   2969 14 Jul  2011 com.apple.Recents.collection\n\nNow, that looks a bit suspicious... those are the fonts from Microsoft Office way back when, since my OS install has been upgraded and ported to different machines since about 2003.\n\nSo I deleted them, and a bunch of similarly old fonts here:\n\nAndrews-iMac:Fonts andrewmcgregor$ ls -l\n\ntotal 1792\n\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 andrewmcgregor  staff      0  8 Apr  2004 Brush Script\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  36284 17 Feb  2005 FTL\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.TTF\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  35968 17 Feb  2005 FT\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.TTF\n\n-rwx------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  41416 20 Oct  2004 OptimusPrinceps.ttf\n\n-rwx------\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  57296 20 Oct  2004 OptimusPrincepsSemiBold.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  65932 25 Apr  2005 Vera.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  63208 25 Apr  2005 VeraBI.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  58716 25 Apr  2005 VeraBd.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  63684 25 Apr  2005 VeraIt.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  55032 25 Apr  2005 VeraMoBI.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  49052 25 Apr  2005 VeraMoBd.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  54508 25 Apr  2005 VeraMoIt.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  49224 25 Apr  2005 VeraMono.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  60280 25 Apr  2005 VeraSe.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  58736 25 Apr  2005 VeraSeBd.ttf\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   4268  9 Apr  2012 encodings.dir\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   5523  9 Apr  2012 fonts.dir\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff    810  9 Apr  2012 fonts.list\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff   5523  9 Apr  2012 fonts.scale\n\n-rw-r--r--\u002B 1 andrewmcgregor  staff  51220 25 Apr  2005 opens\\_\\_\\_.ttf\n\nLo and behold, KSP is now stable, whereas before I did that it would crash instantly on trying to launch."},{"CreatedByName":"Wobblier","CreatedById":147042,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T21:56:11Z","Content":"This solution fixed it for me:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3laqnf/psa_ksp_64_bit_works_on_mac_os_x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3laqnf/psa_ksp_64_bit_works_on_mac_os_x/)\n\nIt\u0027s a little bit of a puzzle.
