Been hanging in this forum for a few days now, and so far nothing but cool people, interesting (and sometimes veeeery technical) discussions, talented modders... This place is great! As is KSP... I would have sold everything as a kid for a game like this.

I\u0027m french, i\u0027m a guy, I do have some sound editing skills (if that can be useful to some) and I\u0027m addicted to chocolate.
