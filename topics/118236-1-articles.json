During this we came to the conclusion that the real question (or at least the more interessting to us) is: How would we react, if we discover that we are not alone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have distinguished four cases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDiscovery of extraplanetary life:\u003C/strong\u003E Some probe/rover discovers life on another planet/moon in our solar system.\u003Cbr\u003EI do not think this will matter all that much to most people. The news will be full of it for some days, most people will tell everybody who wants to hear it, that this was always clear and no sane person ever doubted it. A not to tiny fraction will probably declare it as contamination from earth, a scam to get more money for space agencies or a mortal danger to all life on planet earth (like the film Evolution or so \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). But in general I think most will have forgotten it after some days. In the middle to long term it will most likely help the space agencies to get more funding for exploration. Also most likely regulations for sterilization of space craft will get even tighter than now and return of samples at least from the \u0022infected\u0022 planet/moon will be out of question for some time. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReceiving a signal, but do not understand it:\u003C/strong\u003E somehow like the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWOW! signal\u003C/a\u003E, but longer and clearer to be artificial in nature\u003Cbr\u003EI think there would be a great depate if this signal is artifical or natural or a scam. If it is artifical and only noticed by military/national controlled stations I suspect that they could try a cover-up. For thi scenario, although I deem it the most probable, I have no further idea what would happen. As information on public reaction and circulation is a bit scant and I was not alive then, I cannot really compare it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReceiving a signal and understanding it at least in parts:\u003C/strong\u003E like the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAericibo message\u003C/a\u003E, also I really do not know how some other race should ever understand this message... \u003Cbr\u003EThis would probably be the most interessting solution. There we will get evidence of another intelligence. I do not know what they would send. If I had to compose my own message and just wanted to say \u0022I\u0027m no artifical signal, I\u0027m from an intelligence!\u0022, I would just send a sequence of prime numbers (dit-dit pause dit-dit-dit pause dit-dit-dit-dit-dit pause ...). This does not really transfer any knowledge, but it should be understood by every being able to receive this message (as the count and prime numbers are the same in every numerative system). But let\u0027s just say we get a bit more complex message. We can decipher something like origin and there system layout or so. What would happen?\u003Cbr\u003ELike in the first example I suspect that certain governments will try to cover-up if they can. Even if they have no good reason to do so, it will be a reflex. We do not know it, so it must be bad... If it goes to the public their will be a gigantic discussion how to interpret this message. Five \u0022experts\u0022 will have six opinions how to decipher the message. But I think in the end the contents will not really matter. The fact that we are not alone will matter.\u003Cbr\u003ESome people will clearly use the situation and try to immediately answer with a message of their own. So if the origion would not be too far away, we could (speaking in long term of one message per generation or so...) establish an interstellar \u0022freindship\u0022 or at least post office. Other will try to hide. No message may compromise earth. They want to play dead. So this are most likely the extrem positions. I think the genral will either rush into an new Golden Age of space exploration (either united in face of the big unknown or as competition between the different agiencies) or we will go through something akin to the five stages of grief: denial (scam), anger (terroristic attacks against radio telescopes?), bargaining (What if they are evil?), depression and acceptance.\u003Cbr\u003EI for myself would really welcome the first variant. I cannot hope to live for any extrasolar exploration but a radio message, although unlikely, might be the only chance to ever know if there is/was anything other out there. The thought that we are all alone out here is frightening and also the number tell us, that we should not be alone it is a completely other thing as knowing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinding physical evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence:\u003C/strong\u003E like the \u003Ca href=\u0022Pioneer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPioneer plaque\u003C/a\u003E or the Golden Records\u003Cbr\u003EThe chances to ever find an alien artifact are way beyond slim. But if it happens, I cannot really think that it would change all that much in comparision to scenario 3. Maybe a global received transmission would be sooner admitted as real than any physical evidence. Here the same principles apply as above: cover-up, accusation of fraud, maybe panic of invasion. But in general I think it would have less impact as a message. The probe would be tens of thousands of years old (in minimum), so the probabillity that its builders are still alive is slim.
