You however can leave on Kerbal in the orbital vessel while another one is doing whatever you have planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A Kerbal that has not yet launches is considered to not yet have left the planet (even if he is already in a rocket). So you are allowed to gather the ground science on Kerbin. You can build a rover to get the ones far away, but as soon as you lift off with anything (even a plane) the Kerbal and vehicle may not touch the ground again (at least not alive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScore (if you want):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Point for each planet visited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10% bonus for each planet that contains a \u0022house\u0022 for the landed (living) Kerbal (house = any accessible crew cabin \u002B working power generation \u002B working antenna).

That is: incoming money vs. buying new Kerbals. Also doing rescue missions won\u0027t really help, because you are not allowed to get them back to Kerbin for your next launch nor launch an unmanned rocket to pick them up on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo already your first rocket needs to have an antenna and batteries to get the science back down to earth, as it will either reach orbit and stay there (with the Kerbal) or crash into the ground and gets destroyed (probably with the Kerbal). In both cases you loose the rocket, and the Kerbal in question will not launch a second rocket ever again, because he is either dead or drifting in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also cannot easily do missions, because you need to spend a Kerbal for each one of them. Simple refuel? Costs 1 Kerbal. Satellite positioning mission? Costs 1 Kerbal. And so on. At some point you face the issue that buying another Kerbal will cost more than the entire mission nets you, leaving you with the only option to sacrifice one Kerbal (and loose the 10% point bonus) so you can buy a new one (hence Kerbal Morghulis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not as easy as it sounds!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T10:37:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Two\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"killakrust","CreatedById":132877,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T21:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, surely a sub-orbital flight wouldn\u0027t count as \u0022leaving Kerbin\u0022?
