Think of it as more of a tunnel than a vehicle. (Primer actually did a pretty decent work of it.) So the fact that you cannot send a message to yourself now merely says that there is no time machine available to you that goes to this particular time. It doesn\u0027t mean that you won\u0027t have access to a time machine of some sort in the future.
