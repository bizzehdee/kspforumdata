The names of these scaletypes correspond to the exponent used to calculate the mass of the part in relation to its volumes. The scaletype \u0022stack_low\u0022 (the \u0022low\u0022 meaning low mass, or something) will make doubling a part\u0027s radius/size result in it having something like 4.3x the mass rather than 8x the mass like the default \u0022stack\u0022. The type \u0022stack_mid\u0022 is a middle ground between 4x and 8x (I think it\u0027s 6x the mass for 2x the size). It\u0027s what I use for engines, for example, so that scaling one up results in reduced TWR, but not so severely as with regular stack where scaling a 0.625 or 1.25m engine to large sizes starts to result in an engine that can barely push its own weight.
