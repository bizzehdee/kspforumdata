During setup at settings/input screen, when clicking on Primary button for Pitch, Roll and Yaw axis it seems a little unstable when trying to recognize what axis I\u0027m selecting. But trying to move slowly to the extremes I could select them, identified as \u0022joy0.1\u0022, \u0022joy0.2\u0022 and \u0022joy0.0\u0022. The throttle was easily identified as \u0022joy0.3\u0022 (no difficulty), as was the hat. The attribution of the 8 buttons worked well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to the game, the buttons work perfectly, but from analog controls only the throttle works well - using the Invert option it works smoothly from 0 to 100% as expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the 3 axes have strange behavior. Looking to the display in the lower left corner, having the joystick in neutral position (let\u0027s call it 50% position), all arrows (pitch, roll and yaw) point to the lower extreme (roll and yaw to the left and pitch down) - let\u0027s call it \u00220%\u0022 for this explanation. Moving the controls I can see that if moving to the other extreme (let\u0027s call 100%) the arrows go also to the other extreme, and when returning the control slowly they obey, but like as being in a different scale (multiplying the movement x2) - when the control is at 75% position the arrow is already in the middle (50%), and when I reach the middle of the control course (50%) the arrow reaches the other extreme (0%). After this point, when moving the control from 50% to 0%, the arrows jump to the maximum extreme and remains there, ignoring all this half of joystick\u2019s course.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, half of joystick course (one side) controls the axis from 0-100%, and the other half (the other side) is ignored. The behavior is exactly the same on all 3 axes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to adjust it using the trimmers (ALT\u002BA, S, D, W, Q, E) and could \u0022bring\u0022 the position of arrows to the middle when joystick was in neutral position, but it was just a shift to the other side, it continued responding just to half of the course of the joystick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course that the game becomes uncontrollable with this behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny idea of what is happening, or if there is some way to correct this incorrectly reading of the joystick position by the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks and regards!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: KSP 1.7.3.2594, no MODs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
