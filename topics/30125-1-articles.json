Provided a few things are happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst with Lazor plugin settings at KSC set your load distances all to the max. There\u0027s a quick button for this. I think it\u0027s something like 90km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to have MechJeb spaceplane guidance set to hold your altitude, preferably above 30km if you can get your air breather that high. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as soon as you decouple your rocket (assuming the rocket was built on top of the plane and not the plane built under the rocket) you should still be in control of the air breather. Use the [ and ] keys to switch over to the rocket. Do not time warp and do not exit to the tracking station as this will break mechjeb\u0027s control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickly get your rocket into the bare minimum orbit, remember if you get more than physics distance away from the air breather you\u0027ll be racing against the clock to get back to it to recover its decent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe safest bet would be to just get an apoapsis above 80km, check how long you have till Ap, then let the rocket drift while you land the airplane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETab back over to the airplane and keep in mind how much time you have before the rocket starts to descend again. Plan your landing site (it won\u0027t be KSC unless you orbited kerbin in atmosphere and its now ahead of you)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quicker you can get on the ground the better!!! You can use the tracking station to switch back to the rocket now that your not relying on physics load range for MechJeb autopilot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you get the idea.
