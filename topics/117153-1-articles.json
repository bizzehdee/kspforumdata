However, adding all the planets featured in the Ratchet \u0026 Clank series will take an awful amount of time, so I\u0027ll let you, KSP\u0027s awesome and huge community, decide what planets you want to see in Kerbal Space Program.\n\nAfter a few weeks/months the poll will be closed, and I will start to re-create the four most selected planets.\n\nAnother thing the community should know is that the first versions are probably far from completion. When the first \u0027beta\u0027 version is released, please know that it might not be entirely stable, so use at your own risk.\n\nWhen the first planet pack\u0027s first beta is released, a new poll will start, featuring the other planets that didn\u0027t make it through the first poll as well as four new planets.\n\nI\u0027ve already voted on four planets, but now it\u0027s your turn. Vote on 1-5 planets in the poll, and select the planets you\u0027d like to see in Kerbal Space Program.\n\nThese are the planets you can vote on:\n\n**Veldin** - an orange, backwater, mountainous planet. The mountains provide an interesting challenge when it comes to landing, though the atmosphere is breathable and oxygen-rich, making it a nice place to use a spaceplane.\n\n**Fastoon** - a yellow desert planet with huge canyons and scars. The oxygen-rich environment allows the use of air-breathing engines, and the canyons provide some of the most interesting views in the whole galaxy!\n\n**Orxon** - a polluted, planet. The surface is black, with radioactive, green oceans and thick green clouds that hide the surface from view.\n\n**Pokitaru** - somewhat like Laythe in terms of gameplay, Pokitaru is basically a tropical, smaller version of Earth. The planet has very little landmass and lots of warm oceans, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere will give you a nice opportunity to use those water-landing skills of yours. Or you can use a spaceplane or excellent aiming/timing to land on one of the isles, your choice.\n\n**Kreeli Comet** - an icy, large comet with very irregular terrain and a somewhat large gravity well for a body it\u0027s size. The Kreeli Comet\u0027s surface releases lots of Oxygen-rich gases, giving this comet an oxygen-rich atmosphere in terms of gameplay, making this one of the most odd places in the entire game!\n\n**Grelbin** - an icy world with huge cliffs, though the cold atmosphere is breathable. Grelbin has lots of violent ice storms, so watch out! Add to that, the planet is not fully frozen - there are small parts still unfrozen, so watch out when trying to land!\n\n**Stygia** - a stormy, mountainous world. The planet\u0027s surface is hidden from view by an everlasting thunderstorm, and only the mountains reach above the clouds. Above the mountains is yet another thundercloud layer, though this one\u0027s charge is opposite to the lower clouds\u0027 charge, creating powerful discharges through the upper atmosphere. Because the universe is not **that** cruel, the atmosphere is breathable and allows the use of air-breathig engines.\n\n**Eudora** - a world covered in a dense rainforest and huge clliffs. Eudora\u0027s breathable atmosphere makes it one of the most beautiful places to fly.\n\n**Smolg** - a white gas giant with an interesting moonsystem. Unlike almost every other gas giant, this gas giant has an **oxygen-rich atmosphere,** providing a brand-new experience.\n\n**Aridia** - this orange-brown desert planet has a breathable atmosphere, though it is somewhat thin. Though the atmosphere is purple, it is breathable. The orange-brown surface is not **that** barren, though: there are oceans of purple acid here and there. No matter what: **never** touch that acid without at least one layer of protection to shield you from the acid, or else it\u0027ll burn right through your skin!\n\nThese are the planets you\u0027re voting on. Seems interesting enough, huh? Then scroll up and select your favorites!\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI hereby claim no ownership of these planets. The eventual mod and it\u0027s maps and codes are my work, though the Ratchet and Clank franchise (including it\u0027s incredible planets) belongs to Insomniac Games.\n\nThe mod, the planets\u0027 maps and their script files for Kopernicus belong to me, though.\n\nThe planets\u0027 maps belong to me because they are not from the game. The planets\u0027 maps will be made using 3D software to re-create them very closely. Because of this, the resulting planets are not identical to Insomniac\u0027s planets. The planets are in fact fan art by me, and will also be featured on my DeviantArt page, \u0027TheWhiteGuardianArt\u0027. However, I do not own the planets\u0027 names and the planets they\u0027re based off, those belong to Insomniac Games\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T21:20:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The White Guardian**"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T00:42:26Z","Content":"An unpleasant thought here (sorry).

Would there be any copyright issues with recreating another games assets without permission?\n\nI believe there are no copyright issues as long as I don\u0027t claim ownership of anything that belongs to either Insomniac Games or Sony. Also, I am not using any assets from the Ratchet \u0026 Clank games: I am using screenshots from the games to re-create them as closely as possible in 3D software. Because of this, the re-created planets are actually Ratchet and Clank fan art.\n\nTo give proper credit, the license will also include a disclaimer in which I, once again, underline that the planets\u0027 ideas and Ratchet and Clank in general belong to Insomniac Games.\n\nOf course, these planets belong to Insomniac games. If Insomniac Games prefers this thread (and the eventual mods) gone, I\u0027ll remove it immediatly. To Insomniac: no worries, I do not claim ownership of your incredible work and I never will."},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:28:43Z","Content":"OK - just wanted to make sure you had considered it.

It\u0027s just that I never saw a Ratchet and Clank mod for KSP/Kopernicus, so I decided to make one myself. I don\u0027t know if this mod will ever be popular, and I don\u0027t really care if it\u0027ll be popular. As long as someone out there enjoys it, it\u0027s been worth all the work."}]}
