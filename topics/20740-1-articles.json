The lander will have a capsule, but I want to launch it with no crew, using MechJeb. Problem is, my usual designs put the capsule at the top of a very tall stack... and while it\u0027s certainly possible to have the crew of the second rocket leap out and go *splat* on the pad, one by one, I\u0027d rather not kill any more kerbals than I absolutely have to. (Or unless it\u0027s really entertaining.) In real life I\u0027d get them down by the gantry, or just not crew the rocket in the first place, but those aren\u0027t options here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone explain to me how to edit the persistence file of a rocket sitting on the pad, to either delete the crew entirely (which I assume is simplest) or place them someplace safely nearby?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkwolfpaw54","CreatedById":37377,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T01:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif theres a lunach clamp you can use the MMU pack to go down (have been proven to work in the 25 things to do with your kerbals video). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T02:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the option to not crew the rocket in the first place is indeed there.
