You know, give them more time to cut into the air. \u00A0So I made a simple command capsule with three chutes, no crew, and started to test. \u00A0It slammed into the ocean, too\u00A0fast. \u00A0It slammed into the lowlands, too fast. \u00A0It slammed into the mountains, too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I added a fuel tank and four engines to the capsule, between the heat shield and the command pod even though my brain told me heat and rocket\u00A0fuel did not mix. \u00A0Starting the rocket engines right when I go past the re-entry \u0027everything is cooling off\u00A0phase\u0027 slowed me down enough to deploy the chutes - right in time to watch the craft slam into the ground at a slightly slower speed. \u00A0I sat down and had a good think. Now, I assume a returning space craft is going to hit at a angle, not just go up and down, and therefore the forces involved would work slightly different. \u00A0But I like space stations and landing pods from stations returning crew for a little R\u0026amp;R back home normally just kind of come down. \u00A0Not straight down, but pretty much down-down. \u00A0Also, escape pods want to get down in a hurry. \u00A0So they well likely just head straight down, no fancy wings or playing about to loss energy. \u00A0Yeah, I am not a number cruncher. \u00A0I understood everything in The Martian book but I doubt I could explain it to others with all the proper math stuff. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried one last time, starting the rockets the second I entered the dark blue band of the atmosphere - you know, when the heat from re-entry and the heat of the engines should make it extra dangerous and fun. \u00A0Fun in a Dwarf Fortress method. \u00A0Well, it worked. \u00A0But even with the chute properly deployed I was going at 6 meters per second. \u00A0I was not sure if that was something the craft could survive so I dumped the heat shield (which I had tried once before but it had failed to help at all - going too fast). \u00A0It cut down the speed to something like 4 meters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WTr8ZCG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022WTr8ZCG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd my tiny craft survived. \u00A0To me, this was an important step because if I can do it anybody (including MechJeb which I like to use)\u00A0can do it. \u00A0Because I suck at being a pilot. \u00A0But it also made me feel kind of happy to have figured out a problem. \u00A0Maybe everybody else had already figured it out - but I had figured it out on my own. \u00A0And that felt good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also means my little guys can come home when I want to cycle the old crews out and the new crews in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bLlxyO6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022bLlxyO6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teag2","CreatedById":119694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T15:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelp, long story short: I broke KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened is this: Last night,\u00A0I was messing around in Sandbox, and decided to make a Gilly probe. After the probe landed, I got bored and Hyperedited (I\u0027m proposing for that to be added to the dictionary) the probe to low Jool orbit. I de-orbited it and watched it buuuurn.

Nope; vertical speed was at -70. So, I thought that I\u0027d just wait. Unfortunately, it did not actually stop, because neither the gravitational force nor the atmospheric pressure seemed to be\u00A0increasing. I waited a while, then decided to look for an atmospheric pressure display on KER. I couldn\u0027t find one, but I did notice the situation display:\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ELanded\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I was apparently landed on Jool while still moving at about 70 meters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realized that that meant I could probably get the hidden Jool\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESCIENCE!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked to see if there were any instruments on the probe, but there were none. I then realized that I had Vesselmover installed, and tried to see if I could spawn a ship. It let me, but unfortunately it got stuck at \u0022Spawning vessel...\u0022 so it didn\u0027t work. Out of curiosity, I pressed \u0022move vessel\u0022 , but that did nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to go back to the space center. I couldn\u0027t though, because I was \u0022moving over the surface\u0022 and it couldn\u0027t save. I tried Hyperedit\u0027s velocity changer, but that reported that the position would be under the surface. Thanks, Hyperedit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then realized that if I hacked gravity, the atmosphere would quickly slow me down and stop me. I did that, but then the ship actually started to float up. That is one dense atmosphere. I tinkered with Hack Gravity until I came to nearly a stop, then went back to the space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided to send another vessel in to the atmosphere, so I whipped up a ship with all the science and flew it in to Jool. I was ready to do the science when it exploded at -250m like usual. I was extremely confused at this point, so I went back to the space center and in to the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, not only were the probe still there, but the two ships I had tried to spawn earlier with Vesselmover were there, too. I took control of one and tried to do a crew report. The game said that it needed crew to do that. There was no crew display in the bottom, but clicking on the hatch showed a Kerbal in there. I clicked EVA, and then the Hell Kraken struck (the game blackscreened and the GUI instruments broke)\u00A0I then clicked \u0022Space Center\u0022 and the game crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured that was enough and went to sleep.
