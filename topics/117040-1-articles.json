So without further ado:\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\n**or how I learned to stop worrying and love the probes**\n\nFour-hundred and fouty-five parts totaling at over one hundred tonnes sits on the pad. The spacebar is pressed.\n\n![GfPtEOt.png](http://i.imgur.com/GfPtEOt.png)\n\nWhat are all of those objects?\n\n![ebk41m4.png](http://i.imgur.com/ebk41m4.png)\n\nWhy are there so many?\n\n![3VfuBJ5.png](http://i.imgur.com/3VfuBJ5.png)\n\nThis is a mission to orbit every single celestial body that can be orbited.\n\n![tyFPLCQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/tyFPLCQ.png)\n\nSixteen, one for each body.\n\n![qkB5mDM.png](http://i.imgur.com/qkB5mDM.png)\n\nAnd now it is in a stable orbit! Deploy forst probe.\n\n![2IXywyr.png](http://i.imgur.com/2IXywyr.png)\n\n![IUrvJJ7.png](http://i.imgur.com/IUrvJJ7.png)\n\nThis is a daring mission to go from kerbin orbit to kerbin orbit. NEXT!!!\n\n![eXCbZ2C.png](http://i.imgur.com/eXCbZ2C.png)\n\nThis is a simple mun satalite. NEXT!!!\n\n![0EG8ycX.png](http://i.imgur.com/0EG8ycX.png)\n\nAnd this will be a minmus sattalite. The rest will need to be deployed at the right launch window.\n\n![jhTnCCw.png](http://i.imgur.com/jhTnCCw.png)\n\nBoth the munbound and minmusbound probes preform thier intercept burns.\n\n![YpVMwxf.png](http://i.imgur.com/YpVMwxf.png)\n\nGlamerous naming ceremony.\n\n![SSpiXM2.png](http://i.imgur.com/SSpiXM2.png)\n\n![0EG8ycX.png](http://i.imgur.com/0EG8ycX.png)\n\nAnd the Mun Ion Probe is in a stable orbit!\n\nThat\u0027s it!

What\u0027s with the funky arrangement of solar panels? Where you\u0027ve got 2 in the same place, normally one will overlap the other and keep it from working.\n\n2. Are all these probes identical? If so, you might have problems from Dres outwards. At Duna, solar panels produce only about 50% what they do at Kerbin, only about 10% at Dres, and less than 5% at Jool."},{"CreatedByName":"K3achas","CreatedById":99468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T15:30:46Z","Content":"There\u0027s one answer to both: I somehow messed up symetry in the VAB, so even at kerbinthe probes use up some battery power to burn. Fortunatly, they all have so much battery power that even the Eeloo-bound probe should have enough power to make the insertion burn at night."},{"CreatedByName":"K3achas","CreatedById":99468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T20:53:58Z","Content":"Going to try using Imgur albums, please post your thoughts.\n\n**Chapter 7**\n\n**or: a bunch of off camera explosions**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
