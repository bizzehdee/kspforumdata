It\u2019s very entertaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of these videos set me on a rabbit trail concerning battery specific energy and specific power. As we likely all know, one of the challenges in trying to get electric planes and electric flying cars is the competition against the terrific specific energy of hydrocarbons. The weight of the batteries required to generate enough power for sustained flight is just about prohibitive, and incremental advances in lithium-ion technology are unlikely to change that any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries is the zinc-air battery, where zinc reacts with air using a catalyst to produce zinc oxide and electrical energy. Because the air is one ion source, it has a very good specific energy (5-6 times greater than lithium-ion) and reasonably good specific power (about 30-50%). They do have some odd side effects, though. For example, because zinc oxide is heavier than zinc, the batteries get heavier as they discharge; for another thing they are tricky to recharge over many cycles and usually must have their zinc \u201Cfuel\u201D reprocessed rather than simply being plugged into the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if there was a way to catalyze a faster uptake of oxygen atoms by zinc air battery, then presumably you could increase specific power. If you could quadruple specific power, then zinc air batteries would dramatically outperform lithium ion batteries, perhaps to the point that they would become a viable alternative to hydrocarbons. It is worth noting that zinc air batteries are much cheaper, much safer, and much more environmentally friendly than lithium ion batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how exactly would one quadruple the reaction rate of a battery? Here\u2019s where it gets interesting. I freely confess I am no chemist, so this could be absolute BS, but it seems to me that if zinc and air reacts together at rate R, and air is only 21% oxygen, then zinc and pure oxygen should react together at 4-5R. If the reaction rate is 4 to 5 times faster, then presumably the specific power would also be significantly higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBringing canisters of pure oxygen along doesn\u2019t seem like the greatest idea, though, for a number of reasons. So we will have to get our oxygen somewhere else. Remember all those silly \u201Cwater fueled car\u201D hoaxes that pop up from time to time? They purport to use electrolysis from a vehicle alternator to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, increasing vehicle gas mileage. Of course this is nonsense; whatever negligible power is added by burning trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen in the engine is outweighed by power lost to the alternator to split the water in the first place. There is no free lunch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we don\u2019t need a free lunch. We are looking for something different. What if we bring along water and use electrolysis from the zinc-air battery to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen, then feed that oxygen back into the zinc air battery to increase the rate of the reaction? As an added bonus, electrolysis is a self-pressurizing reaction, meaning we can feed the pure oxygen into the zinc air battery at pressures that would otherwise require a heavy turbine or compressor, thus further increasing the reaction rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, since the discharge of the zinc air battery is now being tapped to provide current for our electrolysis, the actual output of our battery has gone down, not up. It seems this exercise has been a waste. But is it? No. Because the system is producing some thing else: pure hydrogen. Pure hydrogen can be fed into a hydrogen fuel cell which reacts with ordinary air to recuperate roughly 60% of that lost energy, and hydrogen fuel cells have a specific power in order of magnitude higher than lithium ion batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s no free lunch happening here, of course. This system would simply take advantage of the fact that the reaction between hydrogen and air happens much, much more quickly than the reaction between zinc and air, and so it\u2019s an acceptable trade to lose some specific energy in order to feed pure pressurized oxygen to the zinc-air battery. This only works if doing so will linearly increase the reaction rate.

There was a bus company in California (can\u0027t remember the name) that was doing research into bus scale zinc-air batteries. They discovered the graphite side (oxygen gathering) limited the O2 into the battery and not the quantity of O2 in the air. They theorized that a different configuration of carbon was needed, like graphene. I\u0027m not sure they solved that, but that was not the biggest problem. The best electrolyte they found was KOH (common in alkaline batteries) but as large scale zinc-air batteries discharged the potassium reacted with with the air(mostly the CO2) and the electrolyte was precipitating out of the solution (pretty sure they haven\u0027t solved that one yet).\u00A0 The best part of most x-air batteries is the ease of recycling (also , if you want another rabbit hole to fall down, zinc-air can be made into a hybrid flow battery). Used zinc for instance just needs heated and it will reject the oxygen.

It accounts for the airplane getting lighter and lighter as it flies. (Or alternately, you can think of it as accounting for \u0022burn to fuel to carry fuel\u0022 penalty -- the same thing that drives the rocket equation.

For another, reserves would get really tricky, because your airplane would be heaviest at the end of the flight, so that\u0027s actually when you would need the most energy to fly, which means you would have to carry a significantly higher fraction of your takeoff energy as your final reserve energy than you do now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this would really push the range of the airplanes down hard, unless it was made up for by being very significantly more efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd somehow I really doubt that loading the plane up with water is somehow going to improve its range.
