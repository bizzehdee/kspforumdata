Along with that I feel Kerbals and their complex should provide the player with the ability to \u003Cstrong\u003Epay to add onto their experience\u003C/strong\u003E. This might seem kind of a cheap way to give them experience, but we must remember Funds in a career mode are very important. Skills aren\u0027t totally game breaking, and would make losing a kerbal a bigger deal, especially if you invested funds rather than time in training them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t totally neccessary as of right now as many of the skill levels on the classes are un-used. But with more capabilities added to our little green guys and gals, there should be more reason to be able to train them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am unsure if there should be a limit to how much you can train a Kerbal, as getting a kerbal from noob to pro should take crazy amounts of cash. Which would just add to a players options on how to spend their funds later in the game, as earlier your far better off spending money on more important things such as building upgrades and more ambitious flights and science stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately this sort of option would provide a lazy player with a way to get a kerbal to rank up a bit before their first mission (what do you mean you don\u0027t know what prograde is?)by spending excess funds, which later in the game should be plentiful enough on easier difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis makes a lot of sense to me here are some other thoughts/considerations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Upgrading the astronaut building is already pretty important as it unlocks EVA\u0027s and increases the limit of astronauts (especially important when trying to staff science modules in mid-game). Tying the level of the complex to the amount and or cost of training an astronaut makes a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Although leveling up astronauts is currently a bit of a grind, I have found it makes mission planning a lot more difficult/important in my new career. How much space is available, who do I NEED, who should I try leveling up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As an alternative to buying experience via training, I\u0027ve thought about a system where you can use a crew can in conjunction with a transmitter to slowing level up in space. For example, you\u0027ve planted a flag on Minmus, now go to a Crew Can and \u0022Train\u0022 or \u0022Report\u0022 or something and the experience that you would have received at KSC is slowly accrued to you assuming you have a transmitter (maybe the good transmitter) and enough electricity. This would reduce the grind while keeping the \u0022achievements\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
