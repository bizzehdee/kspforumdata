Good enough.\n\nSome googling later, I found\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZEYbzKctSg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n. The relevant part starts at 10:00.\nLong story short, that guy claims the laser was visible about 6 km away, when both laser and the observer were at almost sea level. Both mine and his calculation agree that either one (laser or the observer) should be about 3 m above the surface.\n\nSo, my question is following. Assuming he\u0027s not lying about the laser being visible and laser and observer being at sea level, what explanation would account for the visibility of the laser?\n\nI\u0027ve seen a documentary about the sinking of Titanic, where they demonstrate how the visible horizon can be much further than the straight line would allow when certain meteorological conditions occur, namely strong temperature gradient of the air above the surface where the cold air sits on the surface with warmer on top of it. However, this guy has just done the experiment and is located in California. I don\u0027t live there, so I\u0027m not talking from experience, but weather archives list local temperature between 15 and 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C during the days of the filming. Also, that scenario would require either laser or the observe to be above the cold air. In any case that explanation does not fit.\n\nReflection from the surface of the water would also not account for it, since the geometry of the round Earth does not allow it.\n\nIf you were debating this guy, what would you offer as an explanation, or would you reject his claim that the laser was visible?"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T17:58:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you were debating this guy\n\nExperience tells us it has no use.

Unfortunately I live on the continent and the largest straight body of water I have available nearby is 2 km long which is not enough for a good test. So I can\u0027t do a proper photographic test until I get to the seaside in a month or two.\n\n@Robotengineer \n\nYou would say that the tides locally leveled out the surface of water enough that much (3m over a few km)? That sounds too much.\n\nEdit:\n\nEratosthenes approach to calculating the size and shape of the Earth fails in the eyes of flat earthers since they believe the Sun is a spot light that hovers a few thousand kms above the surface of the flat Earth. Such a model, with appropriate dimensions, would closely simulate the effects of a distant Sun and round Earth on the shadows of towers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T21:26:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shpaget**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T23:27:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I used to love going to the Flat Earth Society\u0027s web page to read and laugh at all the reasons they come up with for the earth being flat. ...\u0022\n\nI\u0027ve been under the impression that the Society is more a social thing rather than people actually believing such things.

Even for a 1m height, the angle of dip is around 2 arcmin, which equals a distance to observed horizon of 3.5 km, using Earth\u0027s polar radius (6356.8 km). Now, consider that the refraction of a setting star is around 50 arcsec (close to 1 arcmin) such as that when you see a star setting they actually already set a few seconds ago, guess what - you can see as far as 5 km ! There\u0027re other factors such as tides (which makes, least, the sea level at your site being farther / nearer to Earth\u0027s center) and the recipient is also standing \u003E1m above the sea level. Additional refraction might helps as it\u0027s pretty hard to model refraction near the horizon.\n\nThey\u0027re plain stupid, that is...
