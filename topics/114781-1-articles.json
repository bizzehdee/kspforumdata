The relevant part starts at 10:00.\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, that guy claims the laser was visible about 6 km away, when both laser and the observer were at almost sea level. Both mine and his calculation agree that either one (laser or the observer) should be about 3 m above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my question is following. Assuming he\u0027s not lying about the laser being visible and laser and observer being at sea level, what explanation would account for the visibility of the laser?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a documentary about the sinking of Titanic, where they demonstrate how the visible horizon can be much further than the straight line would allow when certain meteorological conditions occur, namely strong temperature gradient of the air above the surface where the cold air sits on the surface with warmer on top of it. However, this guy has just done the experiment and is located in California. I don\u0027t live there, so I\u0027m not talking from experience, but weather archives list local temperature between 15 and 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C during the days of the filming. Also, that scenario would require either laser or the observe to be above the cold air. In any case that explanation does not fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReflection from the surface of the water would also not account for it, since the geometry of the round Earth does not allow it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were debating this guy, what would you offer as an explanation, or would you reject his claim that the laser was visible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T17:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you were debating this guy\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperience tells us it has no use.
