I know the Lazor mod had some robotic arms (they\u0027re really big though) and DROMOMAN allows you to design your own using Infernal Robotics. Might wanna take a look at those.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo yea I mentioned before that there are ways to get a robotic arm on the KSO\u0027s, however, Romfarers stuff is growing increasingly out of date with each release, and they are huge so it takes some tweaking to get them down to size. I have used the IR arm and it works however its bulky takes up quite alot of room in the cargo bay because of the attachment point. I was just saying that the work you guys do, I think you would do an incredible arm that would round out the KSO and the pack in general. Because like I said it could be extremely versitile, for base building or attaching to a rover or to release the rover. I mean I know you guys would make it versatile because most of the parts in this pack can be used for 20 different things. I honestly don\u0027t think it would be a one use thing. It would be incredibly versatile and useful in building bases. You land to far away, get the rover attach the arm and drive it to where it has to go. You want to deploy the rover from a cargo bay use the arm, building a station and you don\u0027t want to use the tug use the arm, servicing the cactye telescope, i mean it adds a whole new dimension to the game if its done properly and if there are any modders out there that could do it I know you guys could do it properly and make it versatile. I mean think about it, it could be a modular arm that could be configured in different ways for different purposes. That all being said, as I said this isn\u0027t a request it is merely a suggestion and something you guys should think about if you ever come back to doing stuff for KSO. I mean the hours you guys put in to it, you probably just want to move on to different things. I totally get that and I wont even be remotely upset if you ignore the suggestion completely. Im just saying it would be really cool and you guys could totally do it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z3R0_0NL1N3","CreatedById":60881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T10:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh.

So don\u0027t fly it like a plane. It kind of flies like a VTOL though, so if you can fly one of those you\u0027ll adapt pretty well. Otherwise, practice makes perfect. Only real caveat is the vertical speed is really sensitive so go easy on throttle changes, especially if you\u0027re trying to land or hover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-05T16:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2014 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qnistNAMEERF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dtoxic","CreatedById":103573,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T01:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello all a question about kso (i was searching about it but with no luck)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esoo what happens i start the game (fresh) career mode and the big trio is there (nothing wrong there) but whenever i add kso cockpit in the VAB or SPH it somehow \u0022auto\u0022 hires additional crew to fill up the seats in the kso cockpit (although i did not go to astronaut complex and hire additional crew ,they are somehow added automatically) can any one help me out on how to stop this behavior its getting pretty cramped up with all the additional crew members being auto hired \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethx\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
