When given requirements, making them fit precisely into it while minimizing waste is key. In this, it was a satellite built for a challenge. Had to have RCS, its own thrust, three science devices, one long and short range communications system, and be at least 1.25 tons while self-powered. I managed that with 1.26 tons, in fact the hardest part was making it look pretty and actually weigh up to the requirement. I could have made it significantly smaller than that (one design I was so proud only weighed in at 0.6) but it wouldn\u0027t have met the requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In fact I probably spent nearly as much time balancing out those two RCS thrusters on it than I did on anything else.
