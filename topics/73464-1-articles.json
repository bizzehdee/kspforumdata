Some are obviously ridiculous (such as hearing a ship explode in Star Wars despite being in a vacuum), whereas others seem likely or plausible. When a capital ship such as the Galactica suffers a hull breach, it starts venting atmosphere. If, however, the hull breach went though a few decks and actually ruptured a plasma conduit or something similar, would flames be ejected from the breach until the hull was sealed? With all that atmosphere escaping, it seems that flames would have plenty of oxidizer to burn...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe so yes.
