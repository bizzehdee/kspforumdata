I found a savegame in which I\u0027d landed probes on Eve and had a few en route to Moho. So far, I\u0027ve returned kerbals from the surface of Moho and landed probes on every body inside of Jool. I\u0027m just beginning to mine Minmus to fuel a new generation of permanent orbital tugs to send kerbals all over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, I\u0027m in 1.3. Not even 1.3.1. The reason for that is that I have a concoction of mods that work very well together and I\u0027m always hesitant to fix it if it ain\u0027t broke. The problem is, I recently discovered that I have the DLCs due to being an early supporter, and Breaking Ground in particular looks awesome. That coupled with a few new mods I want to try out, as well as all the features that have been added since April of 2017 when I assembled this install, make me want to start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, I\u0027m 8 years into my game, and I\u0027m just getting to the \u0022good part\u0022. I finally have enough tech unlocked to do some serious long-haul missions and build bases and space stations. I can finally go back to Jool, which I haven\u0027t been to for IRL\u00A0 years because I haven\u0027t kept a save going that long since career mode was introduced. And that\u0027s the crux of the problem: every time I play this game, I lose interest somewhere along the ramp up stage, and quit before I get to the fun stuff. Not that one part of it is more fun than others, but I\u0027ve flown robotic landers to the inner planets and set up comm relays dozens of times. I have yet to really explore MKS and set up any colonies because I never get that far. I\u0027ve only sent kerbals to Jool once, back in 2014 when I was still learning how to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now with KSP 2 coming out next year...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what to do. Does anyone else have this problem? Any suggestions? What is a game in 1.7 like compared to 1.3? If you were in my position, would you start over?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-15T04:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy pick?

It\u0027s a life-bearing world, after all; those could use a little more detail than barren fields of regolith. If I was Squad, I\u0027d have ambitious plans for Kerbin.

The six \u0022close\u0022 bodies (Mun, Minmus, Eve, Gilly, Duna, Ike) are coming in 1.8. Another six bodies constitute the Joolian system (Jool, Laythe, Tylo, Vall, Pol, Bop). And then there\u0027s four left: Moho, Dres, Eeloo, and... Kerbin.\u00A0Those can form another set, with Kerbin receiving the extra man-hours saved by having fewer bodies in the set. Now, whether it\u0027ll be the second set or the third to be released? Or if Squad is actually going to do it this way for real? No clue...
