Once the station is slightly behind you in map view, raise your apoapsis to the target craft\u0027s height. Once within 1km, use gentle RCS taps to maneuver ever so slightly closer to you station. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T23:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything you do to close the gap wil inevitably loose you the altitude match. That\u0027s just the laws of orbital mechanics. You can speed up, but that will cause you to rise above it, and then you\u0027ll need to burn down to correct. Or you can brake (counter-intuitive as it sounds) which will cause you to drop below it, thereby speed up and overtake it, but then you\u0027ll need to burn up to meet the target again. Those are pretty much your only options. It\u0027s an unnatural situation to have two objects orbiting at the same altitude but different speeds, so you\u0027ll need to just keep making burns until you\u0027re close enough to finalize things with RCS, which is 20km or less. Personally, I would speed up because that approach is a bit less complicated to carry out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAO","CreatedById":30795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T02:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esuccess! thanks a lot you guys! couldn\u0027t have happened without you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5KXY0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225KXY0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T02:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDang, that\u0027s pretty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods are you using?
