The rocket starts to roll as it picks up speed, and I can\u0027t overcome it unless I add fins. Even with the fins, it\u0027s annoying that I need to keep fighting against it. What could be causing this roll, and is there a good way to just design it out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Using ASAS tends to make my rocket wobble and flex a lot. Even when it doesn\u0027t break it apart entirely, it\u0027s probably pretty inefficient to have the engines vectoring back and forth constantly. Adding a bunch of struts helps, but is there any way to just get the ASAS to behave better and stop overcompensating? Does it help to have more of them? Does it matter where they\u0027re placed?

Basically ASAS doesn\u0027t know how maneuverable your rocket is, developers have set some hidden value on how hard it steers based on some assumptions on how they think the \u0022average rocket\u0022 would handle. So if you rocket is way more maneuverable than how Squad envisioned a rocket should be then ASAS will constantly oversteer when it tries to adjust for small errors, overshoot the correction then oversteer the opposite direction, hence the wobble and the constant back and forth gimbling of the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat back and forth gimbling is very wasteful of delta-V by the way, because any time your engine is not thrusting you directly up it\u0027s using some of its thrust to steer the craft and you lose that bit of thrust. In this case it\u0027s doing a whole lot of steering to try to get the rocket stable, yet the very fact that it\u0027s steering so hard is what\u0027s causing the rocket to wobble in the first place and you lose a non-negligible amount of delta-V to steering loss. One of the big hidden disadvantage of mainsail is that it has too much control authority for it\u0027s own good. First stage engines (of which mailsail is one, since it has high thrust and low Isp) need no to very little vectored thrust, since:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In an asparagus rocket, high Isp gimbling engines that fire together with first stage engine like LN-V or LV-T45 provide enough control authority. During first stage burn you are not turning the rocket, so you only need enough control authority to keep the rocket upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If for some reason you do need more control authority, you can alway add steerable fins since first stage burn is through the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the fact that mainsail has very powerful vectored thrust (as it has both big gimble range and very high thrust) actually works against it and destabilises the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the steerable fins on your rocket makes things even worst because:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - you already have too much control authority from the mainsails, adding steerable fins makes things even worse. If you have to control spin with fin then use the non-steerable fin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - The fact that fins are at the very bottom means that when they move to steer your rocket they give the bottom of those radial boosters a sideway force, thus twisting them even harder into a helictical shape. You will see this when staging. You know how when you stage radial stages without fin then more or less fall straight down? Yet if they have fins on them when you stage they instead twist away from your rocket? That twist is also happening when the stages are burning and unless the radial boosters are very stiff and resist the twisting your whole rocket will start to spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-15T01:11:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2012 01:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T02:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to think it also has something to do with placement of struts.
