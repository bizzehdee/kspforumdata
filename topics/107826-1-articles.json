Building this particular rocket is routine and about as basic as an early-game 1.25m 2-stager can be, so I was really stumped at how unflyable it was. I\u0027d hit around 180-280 m/s somewhere in the mid-to-low atmosphere and just flip. And if I ever took the SAS-off, the ship would immediately drift hard, often *away* from the horizon, despite having everything placed with symmetry and snapped to grid. And I\u0027m not new to this whole more-realistic physics thing. I\u0027ve been rocking the hands-free gravity turn forever.\n\nSo I started dismantling, piece by piece, to try to solve the problem. With payload, without. With all manner of fin/control surface patterns. Using an SRB for the base, etc. I replaced basically the whole ship over maybe 20-30 trial launches. Still no love, and it\u0027s maybe only a 15 part launcher, at most. \n\nSo I go back and load up a stock craft, the Z-MAP launch vehicle, which was damn near the same thing I\u0027d built. Suddenly, no problem. I think we\u0027ve all had this happen with this game, but this scenario was simple enough, timely enough, and tested exhaustively enough to be revealing. All of this has me thinking that there was something intrinsic about the craft file itself or some part-related glitch. *Something* weird from the VAB that was just going nuts as soon as the physics really got ahold of it.\n\nThere have always been weird physics quirks like this (planes burrowing on the runway, rocket magically tipping over on the launch-pad, parts with two attachment nodes that suddenly only have one, kerbals exploding from a one foot drop, missing your SOI change by half a solar-system, etc.), isn\u0027t it more reasonable to assume that this is just one of *those* kinds of issue, rather than that Squad suddenly lost their minds? \n\nSurely someone else out there can corroborate. **So to summarize**, what I\u0027m saying is that the issue is less about the specific aero .cfg settings and more about how glitches in physics interact with parts/crafts now that the model is fully fleshed out.
