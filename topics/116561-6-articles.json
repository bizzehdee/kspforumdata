The goal of the OZTP was to dock a Odin and a Zhar-Ptitsa craft in LKO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Zhar-Ptitsa 19 launched first, from the Kerviet Cosmodrome. It\u0027s reliable booster, that cant trace it\u0027s heritage to the rocket that launched the first satellite, put the crew into a 120 km circular orbit around Kerbin. There the crew, consiting of Gherman Kermanov and Svetlana Kermanova, awaited the arrival of the Odin spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral hours later the Odin spacecraft launched ontop of a Sleipnir IB booster. The craft was crewed by our most senior team of Kerbonauts: Valentina, Bob and Bill Kerman. Once in orbit the spacecraft seperated from the second stage, turned around and extracted the Odin-Zhar-Ptitsa docking adapter, just like a MEM in a munar Odin mission. About one hour after it\u0027s launch the Odin spacecraft approached Zhar-Ptitsa 19. In this first docking the Kerviet craft would remain passive while the Odin capsule took the active part in the docking procedure. Once docked two crew commanders Valentina and Gherman exchanged the first international handshake in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two crews assembled a commemorative plaque, exchanged flags and snacks, visited each other\u0027s ships, ate together, and conversed in each other\u0027s languages. After several hours the two ships undocked and Odin positioned himself in front of the Sun to produce a artificial solar eclipse for Zhar-Ptitsa 19. The spacecraft then docked a second time, this time with Zhar-Ptitsa as the active partner. However, this time none of the Kerbonauts changed their spacecraft. After a few more hours the two vessels undocked and went their seperate ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth vessels stayed in orbit for a few more days, conducting several experiments. The craft that first reentered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was Zhar-Ptitsa, it landet safely in the desert. The Odin capsule splashed down off the coast of the KSC a little later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrokerb","CreatedById":151932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T22:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was a cool mission.
