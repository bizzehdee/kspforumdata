Basically, I want to know if it\u0027s possible in the stock game to load multiple designs simultaneously. For example, let\u0027s say I make a generic lifting rocket design, and have a few designs for a final stage, such as a Lander, Probe, etc. Is there a way that I can load the Lander and add the lifting rocket to the active build session to save myself some repeated effort, or would I have to define a full rocket for each and every desired final stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-26T21:40:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2013 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vollstrecker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion was answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Metanolo","CreatedById":75909,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T16:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeingly, yes, you have to build up the full rocket becouse there is no way to import other ready-to-use dsigns, yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at the wiki in the \u0022planned features\u0022 section, and read under \u0022Spacecraft Construction\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vollstrecker","CreatedById":76077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T21:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, glad to see that it\u0027s planned at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vollstrecker","CreatedById":76077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T21:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, glad to hear it\u0027s planned at least!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Icetom","CreatedById":76195,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T02:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello.
