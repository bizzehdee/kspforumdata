If Squad was for random events (not quite micrometeor hits, Apollo 13 like explosions, harmed reentry shields, etc), then skill might allow for repair, or improvised repairs. I\u0027d be fine with that. Or how about this, I built a rocket early on, and for some reason put a clampotron someplace I knew was off-center. I knew it would behave less than well, but was too lazy to relaunch, and I didn\u0027t want to revert. I wanted the extra fuel for a Mun lander trapped in orbit around the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 so I turned on the RCS, and tried to hold it straight during the injection burn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I got the job done, but I was constantly fighting to keep it where it needed to be (felt like that scene in Apollo 13 if I upped the throttle above \u0022barely running,\u0022 lol). THAT is a situation where maybe a highly skilled pilot could have a broader range of holding control with RCS. Not increasing RCS thrust, just better at \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E balancing my CM problem. Works with no physics harmed. Those kind of errors are not all that common, though. Also, if the pilot was WORSE than \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E am skill wise, the ship should behave badly, even if I pilot perfectly.

We must remember that part of this game gets inspiration from Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race into Space. In that game failures would happen if the parts of your craft weren\u0027t good enough, or if your pilots didn\u0027t have the correct skills. The issue therefore is that in this game, the space craft engineers bring the spacecraft close to 100% reliability, is YOU the player.
