Actually, the differences of energy required is the kinetic energy of ~300m/s (speed of elliptical vs no speed in straight up), which, due to Oberth effect, represents a tiny difference of ~20m/s at 70km. I did not do the math but I expect a not greater difference in theoretical dv requirement to land on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re damn right about how to test different methods : ships to orbit and ships to straight up are really different. Dv requirement is irrelevant, because high TWR crafts lose less dv, but are often more expansive, and often have less dv.

When we reach the centre of the gravity well, this situation is reversed - we\u0027re now accelerating at thrust minus gravity again. But, we\u0027re now travelling at a given velocity, and still net accelerating, which means that the time it took to get to the centre is more than the time it will take to reach surface level on the other side. In other words, the amount of acceleration we gained due to gravity falling from the \u0027surface\u0027 to the \u0027centre\u0027 will be more than the amount we lose climbing from the \u0027centre\u0027 to the \u0027surface\u0027 on the other side.

However, net acceleration will be reduced by losses to gravity - our rate of acceleration is thrust minus gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we \u0027launch\u0027 from the other side, assuming we now don\u0027t need to fly to orbit and avoid an unhealthy terrain interface, we can also burn directly towards our intended escape/intercept target. Because gravity pulls us down, we accelerate at thrust plus gravity - so, we accelerate at 2x gravity faster than from the other start point. When we reach the centre of the gravity well, this situation is reversed - we\u0027re now accelerating at thrust minus gravity again. But, we\u0027re now travelling at a given velocity, and still net accelerating, which means that the time it took to get to the centre is more than the time it will take to reach surface level on the other side. In other words, the amount of acceleration we gained due to gravity falling from the \u0027surface\u0027 to the \u0027centre\u0027 will be more than the amount we lose climbing from the \u0027centre\u0027 to the \u0027surface\u0027 on the other side. This is what I mean by \u0022gravity free acceleration\u0022, and it\u0027s in no way an insubstantial contribution to delta-V. When we get to the surface on the other side, we\u0027ll have an even higher velocity than at the centre, whereas the other craft launching from here will have 0 vertical velocity. So, from here to the intercept will take us less time than the other craft - and our gravity losses from here to target will be lower - even though the other craft didn\u0027t have as far to travel in the beginning. Although to the other craft 1 unit of acceleration is worth more than it is to our craft, we simply have much, much more of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow putting the physical planet back in, the amount of dV it takes to move around the planet/moon does eat into the net gains from the assistance of gravity, but most of this energy is stored as angular velocity because it is mostly applied perpendicular to gravity (except for the little bit used to climb to the high atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point 3 was intended to restate the argument in a clear way and simplify the points over which you disagree in a way that can be measured.

Assuming 640 m/s is correct for a 14 km parking orbit, the entire escape would take approximately 840 m/s. Even with this upward bump, this is still ~ 12.5% lower than arkie presented in the OP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be noted the overall dV cost of the parking orbit escape increases as the parking orbit altitude increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDIRECT ELLIPTIC ASCENT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal direct assent was calculated assuming an instant, prograde acceleration from sea level that would create an eliptic orbit that would reach the SOI. The dV calculated for such an assent was calculated to be 766.7 m/s, and, IMO, should be considered as an absolute lower bound for a Munar escape from sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONCLUSIONS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the simulation isn\u0027t perfect, I think the time resolution should be more than sufficient for these purposes. The alternatives to these simulations are either demonstrations on YouTube or busting out differential equations. Anyone that wants to present such evidence is welcome to it. I also think it\u0027s perfectly reasonable to compare the results of the different methods side-by-side. Anyone who wants to demonstrate anything above is incorrect, is welcome to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut any dissent that doesn\u0027t provide contrary evidence is a complete waste of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese results show that the vertical ascent reaches towards an asymptote near surface escape velocity as TWR increases. If the dV maps are to be believed, then a vertical assent from sea level will \u003Cem\u003Eprobably \u003C/em\u003Ebeat a 10 km parking orbit if you can manage a TWR of 6 or greater off of sea level, given the assumptions above. And frankly, this seems perferctly reasonable. Should some greater velocity at SOI be desired, the results may change. I leave it to others to bicker about what significance that might have, or, preferably, present reasonable evidence to the contrary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simulation results should, if anything, be over-estimates of required dV, for two reasons. First, this method required the vessel to still have \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E vertical velocity when leaving the SoI. This was not the case for the calculated escape transfer dV costs. Second, the simulation applies force to the vessel prior to the mass of the fuel being removed as exhaust, not simultaneously. Hence the accelerations and resultant velocities are slightly lower than would be observed in practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, after all this math, it really looks like the vertical assent is pretty reasonable option in this case, since it provides an escape with dV costs comparable to reasonable parking orbits.

When accelerating vertically, your acceleration is reduced by 1.63m/sec each second you burn, whereas if you burn horizontally, it\u0027s not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I were to accelerate at (say) 2G horizontally for \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E200 seconds, it would give me 652m/sec \u002B 9 m/sec for the rotation. If you burn vertically at the same rate, you only get 356.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... you can reduce this disparity by increasing acceleration, but the difference between the two methods can only approach zero as acceleration approaches infinity. it can never exceed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s no good reason to add the mass of bigger engines, since the prograde burn will get optimal results with engines producing exactly local G acceleration at liftoff. There\u0027s no benefit to adding thrust in a prograde launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding thrust in the vertical mode will reduce (but not eliminate) the disparity between the two modes in theory, but in practice any gains you get from increasing thrust will be erased by the penalty of the big engines required to produce it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor such a low TWR, of course, burning vertically will not pay. The discussion must involve high TWR (even if you would have had more deltaV had you chosen a lighter engine and lower TWR). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven for an infinite TWR launch (i.e. impulse burns), as you pointed out, horizontal is probably \u003Cstrong\u003Ebetter \u003C/strong\u003Eor, at worst, \u003Cstrong\u003Eequal \u003C/strong\u003Eto vertical launch. I have admitted this. However, on the Mun, you cannot perform a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehorizontal burn unless you are a daredevil... That is the basis for this thread!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Mun case, unless you land on a hill, you probably want to burn vertical first to avoid crashing. I\u0027ve seen that 10 km is a safe altitude, so if you first burn vertically to 10 km, and then turn over and burn horizontally, you will end up using more fuel, as i have calculated in OP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, granted, shooting straight up to 10km is inefficient; it is more efficient with the horizontal approach to burn horizontally the whole time and raise apoapsis via centripetal acceleration. In addition, 10km is a bit high, since you can burn horizontally with a slight inclination and visually inspect to avoid hills. And the closer you are to the ground the entire time, the less fuel you will use, but also the more dangerous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better result might be to know the balance point i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003Eif you first climb vertical, at what altitude will it use less fuel to continue going vertically than to turn horizontal and burn to LMO.
