It\u2019s measured geometric albedo was found to be no greater than 0.03 at a 95% confidence. This indicates the plant reflects almost no visible light and will appear darker than charcoal. WASP-104b is one of three \u201CDark Planets\u201D with very low albedoes: TrES-2b (which reflects 0.04-1% of all visible light that hits it) and WASP-12b (it reflects only 6% of received light). The study also mentions that HAT-P-7b, the planet with the ruby and sapphire rain, also has a very similar geometric albedo to WASP-104b.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05334.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05334.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
