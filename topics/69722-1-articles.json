I think it would look better on the stations I am building. Having a girder with batteries and power panels hooked to them with no means of power transfer looks silly to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to mod a part so I can put the landing legs inside the ship. When you toggle them, a panel opens and the legs lower. Launching a ship and have it fly with landing legs hanging all over the side of the ship also looks silly.
