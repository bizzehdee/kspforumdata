A properly made hyperbolic heat shield is more effective than any spherical heat shield. Think about it: during reentry, a tumbling spherical heat shield will almost certainly leave sections of the heat shield undamaged (and therefore just about useless). A hyperbolic heat shield will be more evenly, and thoroughly, ablated. Besides, if there is an uneven mass distribution in a spherical capsule, the area with more mass will come to face downwards, just like a hyperbolic heat shield. Compensating for this means that the heat shield mass is higher than it could otherwise be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a very few ways that spherical heat shields are better. For example, they don\u0027t experience the sorts of oscillations that can develop with hyperbolic heat shields: In the early days of spaceflight, some astronauts reported extreme oscillations as their craft fell through the lower atmosphere. Regardless, this problem was not a difficult one to fix. I suppose that the biggest advantage of spherical heat shields in the early days of rocketry were that they were more predictable. But now, with our new-fangled computers and such, we can predict what capsule shapes will be stable with a high degree of accuracy. There really isn\u0027t any need for spherical heat-shields anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T14:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Soyuz is still more spherical than the US capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T16:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit might look unrelated but (from an ondulatory\u002Bair resistance\u002Ba few more that i prefer to let you find by yourself) bell make sphere , and sphere make bell what\u0027s the point in vs ? yup yup i miss an egg and a chicken\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C.A.Sizemore","CreatedById":111232,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T23:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite bit of trivia about the Russian Space capsules is the rifle that is part of the standard kit in case the tundra wolves get to aggressive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
