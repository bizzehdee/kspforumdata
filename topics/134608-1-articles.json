I am trying to get a working version\u00A0of SSTU for Windows 7 64-bit ksp. In early 1.0.5 i had one, but can\u0027t find the copy. :-(. I have tried versions as early as December of 2015, and many after that, but the closest i have gotten is an empty category on the parts category (underneath science) saying \u0027SSTU Engine Clusters\u0027. It shows different SSTU parts being loaded, but they simply are not anywhere. Anyone have anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
