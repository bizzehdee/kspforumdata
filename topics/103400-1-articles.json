Sits in a corner, and shows the general area around your craft, and your heading. Maybe even zooms out as you go faster, GTA-style (though of course not necessary).\n\nIs there anything like this available, or is this even possible to make with the current system?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T19:58:18Z","Content":"Hmm...I guess we can have it as part of SCANsat. SCANsat can already make a big map. The only thing is how to make the map center on the active vehicle...hmm"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T16:10:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ve made requests in the SCANsat thread (to DMagic) about that just recently; If nothing else, with the BTDT scanner display, to note a relative bearing to the selected object. But I too would like to see an active terrain map while driving my rover - *we need a GPS!* Thing is, with what SCANsat is and does already, all the pieces are there... they just need to be assembled."},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T06:19:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 to note a relative bearing to the selected object. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nWaypoint Manager does that bit. \n\nI agree, it would seem like all that is left is to put the pieces together, but not being a programmer, I couldn\u0027t tell you how practical that would actually be."}]}
