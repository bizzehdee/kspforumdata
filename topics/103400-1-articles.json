Sits in a corner, and shows the general area around your craft, and your heading. Maybe even zooms out as you go faster, GTA-style (though of course not necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything like this available, or is this even possible to make with the current system?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T19:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...I guess we can have it as part of SCANsat.
