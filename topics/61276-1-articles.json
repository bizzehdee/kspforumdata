Messed up a rendezvous (read: accidentally ejected an engine) and ended up with an extra passenger on another craft. It depends on how well your craft can autoland (will it spiral out of control with the engines running and no input) and how comfortable you are switching to the Kerbal a lot during landing. You\u0027ll have to constantly control the EVA and move the Kerbal back up the ladder or they\u0027re gonna fall off, which means your lander is going to be descending, engines on, and you aren\u0027t going to be controlling it a lot of the time. You\u0027re also going to need a lot of fuel to keep it to a safe speed (you need to slow down \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore you deploy chutes\u003C/strong\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt you could do it with more than one, maybe two per ladder though. They slide pretty fast once the engines are running, and you will need to be able to control the lander for at least a two or three seconds at a time to make adjustments and switch back without them falling off. If you have six, you\u0027d be better off trying to establish a circular orbit and sending another ship to rescue them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
