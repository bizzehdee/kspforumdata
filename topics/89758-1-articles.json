Granted, it is possible, but time consuming and rather boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to set out to make a mod! Air to air refuelling mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this in mind for a long while now, however due to not having a functioning computer I have not been able to do any of the making for this mod, and this is where I need your help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModellers, Unity Importers, .cfg file writers, I need you all! I would love to make this mod a reality and I\u0027m sure there are others who would appreciate it as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what ideas are there currently?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probe Drogue Refuelling System;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xR_3H0qaTE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see here, there are two main parts, the probe, which sits aerodynamically flush until needed, which then when refuelling commences extends out to meet the \u0027bucket\u0027 or drogue, and the drogue, which extends out and meets the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to have both these parts animated and working, and can share the little information I know;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the .cfg, under the line \u0022nodeType = size1\u0022 the \u0027size1\u0027 part doesn\u0027t actually mean size, but size1 is a type, and will only connect to other docking ports with \u0022nodeType = size1\u0022; therefore if the docking nodes on the probe\u0026amp;drogue hade the line \u0022nodeType = airrefuel\u0022 they would only connect to eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the drogue, no wire is needed to be modelled, this is intended to be used with KAS (with permission, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Boom stick refuelling (\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxf1P-BM0Gc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E)\u003Cp\u003E- Some sort of angled landing gear?
