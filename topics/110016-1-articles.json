Unlike most plans, it has nothing to do with decreasing costs from earth\u0027s surface to low earth orbit. Instead, it reduces payload mass by making missions to the moon (and potentially beyond) easier and less Dv intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how expensive would one be to create, with current technoligy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Based on this pdf (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf\u003C/a\u003E) building an elevator who\u0027s counterweight is entirely cable, assuming a constant-stress exponential taper (it gets wider closer to L1 because it\u0027s holding more weight), is on the order of 300,000 km. (edit: fixed an order of magnatude error) That is also the minimum mass that would need to be launched from earth to bring the system online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once the system is online, you can build a counterweight out of lunar rocks, reducing the amount of cable needed to keep the system functional. This lets you repurpse those strands to reinforce the main cable, allowing the tram to carry more mass to orbit on each trip. So the initial Tether needs only to have enough strength to bring the tram down with a small excavation bot and back up with a load of lunar rubble- it can be reinforced after construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe existing math assumes modern high strength composits, such as Carbon Fiber, Kevlar, or M5 Fiber. Page 21 of the PDF posted earlier shows the densities of canidate materials, and their stress limit. I have not been able to find costs per KG for these materials, but we can estimate the mass of cable needed, and calculate the number of launches needed- however mind boggling 300 km of rope is, the launch vehicals are still probably going to be the majority of the price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn page 15 of the linked pdf there\u0027s an estimate of the mass of an entirely cable lift, presumably made from M5 Fiber, the selection that is givin the most weight in that paper, somewhat shy of 1,000,000 kg, or one thousand metric tons. (rounding up to include spools and such to manage the fibers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Falcon Heavy has a promised price of $90mil for 6.4 tons to GTO. lets round that down to 5 tons to L1, so the elevator will need on the order of 200 Falcon Heavy (or equivilant) launches to build. That works out to 1.8 billion dollars to launch the elevator, plus bulk material costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, rockets get cheaper the more they\u0027re flown, and a lunar elevator would be buying launches in bulk. it\u0027s concevable that the effort to build a Lunar elevator would itself drive the launch prices down. And once it is in place, it would help stimulate demand for lunar missions, including surface mining, refining, and production of space-rated equiment that would be far cheaper to \u0022launch\u0022 than anything bade earthside.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T20:01:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rakaydos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow heavy is 300km?
