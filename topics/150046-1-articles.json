I want a moon with low gravity (roughly 1/10th of a G) and an atmosphere of 1.5x Kerbins in pressure. This would closely match Titan and would be very fun to explore. I would also want a trojan moon somewhere, maybe Phoebe analogue, Phoebe is a moon around Saturn that might have been spherical once but was beaten out of shape.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just what I want.

thing i dislike with the current planets is the lack of actual unique features.\u00A0 I know its unlikely we will get that much detail because of performance requirements, but stuff like valleys, hills, cliffs, ect is majorly lacking in the majority of KSP planets.\u00A0 Take Duna, aside from horrific stock textures, it is just too flatish and lacks any stand out features or anything (yes im spoilded by sci-fi movies but at least give us something to make those low altitude dogfights more sci-fi movie like, trench runs, lots of terrain that you need to dodge).\u00A0 A few planets are actually decent imo.\u00A0 Kerbin is good minus a few terrible textures such as the snowy coast north of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E being jagged squares.\u00A0 Mun has its share of trench systems, cliffs, bumpy terrain, and flat as well for when you get bored of dodging rocks while trying to bomb something.\u00A0 Pol is very nice with its low gravity, really neat rock formations, and just lack of flat period.\u00A0 Most planets could be fixed by just giving them better textures and normal maps (im looking at you Jool, terribly terrible texture, pretty much forces you to use cloud mod to stop eye bleeding), but land modification would be welcome even if it did ruin save game compatibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for new planets, id love one more planet with a jet engine capable atmosphere but something completely different from laythe and kerbin, perhaps with lowish gravity like Duna or even Mun and not sure what for terrain.\u00A0 Id also love to see a volcanic planet (not sure if lava could be implemented but itd be really neat if that was doable, as well as the thermal effects of landing in lava), with lots of volcanos and stuff.\u00A0 Finally, while i have no expectation of it, id absolutely love something that looks like it was abandoned by aliens or whatnot and contains synthetic constructs (preferably with glowing bits here and there).\u00A0 The planet would have leftover structures, perhaps post apocaliptic to make the lack of any life plausible, with lots of wiring on teh ground, lanch pads, spaceports, houses, factories, ect (some destroyed some intact), maybee even a few with power leftover (glowing windows, ect).\u00A0 Actually, now that i think about it, some sort of basic city like formations would be very nice if they were implemented in a future game version.\u00A0 Im not saying tons and tons of detail, but something like 2-4 cities on kerbin would be super cool, even if they were very low poly and didnt have much building variety.\u00A0 Just something to change up the complete lack of synthetic constructs (and while we have easter eggs they are way to minor to count) would really make the game much more enjoyable imo (sadly the mod that lets you do this isnt updated to new versions)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T03:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRings, Enceledus, Weather, active
