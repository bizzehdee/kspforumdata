If you weren\u0027t seeing any Oxygen rate or CarbonDiodoxide rate when right clicking I\u0027d assume the mod wasn\u0027t working, but If you are seeing values there then the mod should be working since it sends those values to the display module immediately after requesting them from the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne possibility is the launch-clamps are still attached, they supply a ship with O2 so you won\u0027t see any drop while they\u0027re still attached.

I was just curious and I thought that would be a good simple stat on them. I am planing on a deep space mission and I wanted to know before I launched because it would suck to run out of oxygen. (and yes I know about the less than 100% efficiency, I built a collector part that gathers CO2 from space, a bit cheaty but not too cheaty).\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small recycler (LS-19A Life Support Electric Algae) consumes CO2 at the rate of 4 Kerbals and produces O2 at the rate of 2 Kerbals.

If you have enough free CO2, your limiting factor is the O2 conversion rate which will be 2 and 10 Kerbals respectively. If your free CO2 is the limiting factor you\u0027ll be able to support 1 Kerbal for every 2 CO2/h with the small recycler and 1 for every 1.67 CO2/h with the large recycler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote though that others have reported errors in the consumption rates that I have yet to look into so these values may not be the same in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YX33A\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YX33A\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, I\u0027m working on a stupid part which I deemed useful for Space Stations.

Next, a solar nursery that has windows all the way around (for more possible orientations), but is structurally weaker. After that, a nursery globe for nearly-360-degree coverage, but only one attachment point on the bottom (and even heavier what with all the glass).

I just want to say THANKS for making this and especially for making it work with so many other mods and letting us configure it.\u003Cp\u003E(personally I think being able to land on the Mun before finding the air is a bit stale is too easy, so I increased the oxygen/CO2 rate of kerbals by x100 and also speeded up the recyclers by x100 but made them use 100x as much power too - now its something you actually have to consider)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on what exactly? Why not use the Apollo data? Or research how it\u0027s handled on modern space flights? Research the International Space Station. 100x???? That\u0027s pretty arbitrary and unrealistic. I mean, if you wanted to make the oxygen resource more massive I could understand that; unless my math is wrong the amount of oxygen consumed in kilograms is pretty low (nearly 100 times less dense actually...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut leave the rate of consumption alone, let that be equal to the amount of oxygen being used by one Kerbal in an hour, the way it\u0027s calibrated now. Also, recyclers shouldn\u0027t take so much energy. The power is mostly just for fans to move the air around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ymir9","CreatedById":68199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T04:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this simple mod, but since .21 it seems like my Kerbals take forever to die; over a Kerbin week on average.
