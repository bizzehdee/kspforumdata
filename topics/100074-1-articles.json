The (space)planes are still flyable with this although I have to correct for this the whole time. It also drifts right on the runway leading me to believe that the aerodynamics are not the reason this is happening. The wheels come with an alignment guide and are perfectly aligned. All my craft are 100% symmetric and I can\u0027t fathom the cause of this so any help/ideas would be appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that comes to my mind is that the intakes (that are thankfully getting reworked in the next patch) asymetrically supply the engines and make them produce slightly different thrust.

(But I\u0027m not 100% sure on the stability derivatives, so take this with a pinch of salt). A slight perturbation, probably just due to floating point error, will increase instead of self-correcting, producing the behaviour you experience. A slight dihedral angle on the wings can help this, as can raising them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkarounds include using FAR\u0027s wing leveller, or dialling in a little roll trim.
