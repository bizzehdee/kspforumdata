They have naturally high heat resistance, they are very low mass, and great surface area. Its a win, win, win scenario. \n\nI have been running some test of cooling the nuke engine. Each of the screenshots was taken when the fuel tank at the center maxed out at the temperature and started cooling down. The lower left corner is the control. As you can see, one of the wing sections actually managed to cool the tank down WHILE the nuke was still firing. the beam section(top left) only seems to be working great, but I quickly found out that they are only good at accumulating heat, and they are very bad at radiating it.
