The order of ascending max speed was consistently 1 engine, 3 engine, 7 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously more engines just meant reaching the 2400 m/s limit sooner. But now you\u0027ll never be able to reach that limit, so more engines actually does seem to result in a higher potential top speed. (Sure, you might get to the same speed eventually on one engine if you empty all fuel tanks and turn on infinite fuel, but it will take an unreasonable amount of time).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T02:51:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eallmhuran,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m not knocking your achievement, so apologies if it came off that way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My point is that the difference is very little as compared to where you need to be to hit orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Since we need to be at 2.3 km/ sec and 70km altitude to establish orbit, the difference is relatively small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The extra thousand-odd m/sec DV to make orbit requires fuel and rockets.
