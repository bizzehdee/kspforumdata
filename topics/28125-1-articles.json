I did suspect that it may be a bit of a dodgy design. One thing that I have not been able to figure out is how you attach struts to a rocket like that. i.e what type of strut would you use and how you would place them. Most guides suggest you use a strut but doesn\u0027t really go into detail how to do it. I have tried using the EAS-4 Strut Connector by clicking on a upper part of the rocket and attaching it to another part further down - but it doesn\u0027t seem to attach properly. Is that roughly how you do it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry - dumb question but been looking at it so long I\u0027d like to know how finish it now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaddyJ","CreatedById":67142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T22:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Kinky I think you just answered my question!!
