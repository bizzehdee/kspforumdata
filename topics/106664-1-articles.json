Is there a time limit for those contracts now? The contract window claims the deadline is 4 years. I was approaching a stranded kerbal in an orbit half way to the Mun, I had matched speeds at about 1 km away and when I fired my engines to cut that distance, the capsule suddenly blew up.\n\nIs that expected behaviour, a stock bug or maybe a bug caused by some mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:57:15Z","Content":"Could be a stock bug.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117856-Random-Exploding-Space-Rendezvous](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117856-Random-Exploding-Space-Rendezvous)\n\nIt may have been fixed in the latest patches."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:07:37Z","Content":"Maybe.
