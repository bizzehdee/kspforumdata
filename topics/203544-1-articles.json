Second there could be salt lakes in the salt flats of minmus, 100 meters deep but extremely buoyant. Third there could be a thin ring orbiting it at a 45 degree inclination and finally, a moon half the size of gilly, but twice as dense as minmus mabye?\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nheck call the sub-moon minminmus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheeky_Gaming10","CreatedById":212416,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-02T23:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere probably is a mod but yeah that would be very cool especially as it is one of the most plain planets/moons even with the special structures in breaking ground dlc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso stock game this isn\u2019t happening since the last major update came out so it\u2019s very unlikely they will do something along these lines for even other planets\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is a mod you\u2019d have to wait / check if it is compatible with 1.12 or see if it is compatible with breaking ground dlc since I know a lot of planet revamp mods aren\u2019t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
