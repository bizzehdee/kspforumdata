This creates a problem for any equitorial orbiter above and below GSO and increases the risk greatly, like 1000 fold relative to mass of a collision with any orbiter below the platform that crosses the equator. What if the tether was perfectly thin, it matters half as much as you think, the ISS is a footbal field long, so theres a good chance at some point it would crop the cable at 300 miles up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we equip the cable with episodic manuevering jets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is power, this appears to be benign problem it is not, if you send voltage from the earth to the platform, you have to send it back, round trip is 60,000. That only works with a super conductor, and we dont have any that work at ambient temperatures. The alternative is a very high voltage high frequency ultrathin wire, the problem is that the neutral is close a power is lost due to ionization of gas aound the wire, which btw happens in space withou 100kv voltage differential. In either case the insulation on the wire has to be probitively heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK so the carraige has to be solar powered as such it will be traction driven. Lets say the panel is 1M^2 and it has only to lift 100 kg, a man and his life support, so a perfect panel is 1KW \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE joules = force times distance = N * M, so to lift 100 kg 1 meter =mgh = 100 * 9.8 so at best you are lifting 1 m/s. But its actually worse since solar efficiency is a third, and thus you would actually be falling backwards unless the device is regeared to get about 0.25 meters per second, at least for the first 4000 miles. This means the carraige should also carry a battery, which means it stores power, lurches up 100 feet and then rests while it recharges. Alternatively it needs several square meters of solar panels that increase weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next problem is life support, your rider is now going to be in the carraige for half a day, he will essentially need an EVA suit as the carraige. So that is going to double the weight and then the solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we return to the cable, which now has to support about 300 kg in panels, personell, and life support, it needs a tractor, to work friction needs both pressure and surface area, that perfectly thin wire aint going to cut it. So add some sort of replaceable coating the can wear under traction, this means that the cable itself has to be wide orthe tractor has to be long and heavy. But if the cable has to be wide and coated then the platform needs a larger balast mass and it then becomes impracticle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T23:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Findthepin1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Findthepin1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe cable doesn\u0027t need to be very wide.
