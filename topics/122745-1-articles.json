The more I use them, the more I come to the conclusion that these parts should be included in a stock KSP install. Airbags have been used in several Mars landers. Floaties have been used in lots of craft that land in the water when they return to earth. These are parts that provide a different option to landing gear and an accessory to parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EasyAce","CreatedById":62958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T14:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAirbags: I agree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloaties: i don\u0027t know if they are necessary? The pods are floating, aren\u0027t they? I haven\u0027t landed bigger ships and don\u0027t know if they sink.
