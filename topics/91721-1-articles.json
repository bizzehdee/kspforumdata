I once was as stubborn to not wanting to use FAR. But I really prefer it over NEAR. For starters you have the flight assistance. Wich helps steady your aircraft. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But also helps banking to left or right more careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you are yawing to hard, while at higher speeds yawing is not a great idea in general. Check if you have assigned your control surfaces by right clicking them and disable options for them they don\u0027t do, for example your elevons (those flappy things on the wings) only are for roll so disable all other options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA slightly better way to turn would be first roll with Q and E and slowly pull up, preferably with care or else you will spin out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helped! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukeoftheaura","CreatedById":124144,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T16:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might get FAR.

My approach to flying planes is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS off. Fine controls on for most planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse pitch trim (Alt/RShift\u002BW/S) to maintain level(ish) flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two things are IMHO key to flying planes in KSP. SAS works to hold your orientation, but in manoeuvres a plane needs to smoothly and freely change orientation in response to its aerodynamics, and SAS prevents it from doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, to make a normal turn, roll so the wings are at an angle then let the plane curve round by itself. Use small rudder inputs if I like to keep the prograde marker below the direction marker (many planes don\u0027t really need this), and small pitch inputs or a little more trim to keep the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a sharp turn, roll so the wings are nearly vertical then pitch up strongly but smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on the desired heading, level the wings. If FAR is installed its wing leveller can help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T00:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love FAR, I have used it since my first day with the game. I can say that you can fly with or without SAS on, but if you have it on I highly suggest getting the Pilot assistant tool plugin. It is great because it lets you fine tune the SAS module so you don\u0027t get the rollercoaster affect when flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
