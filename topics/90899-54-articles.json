In the dev version, all the engines share the same set of failsafe altitudes, which is one-half a planetary radius; a \u0022braking factor\u0022 has been added that slows the drive down considerably in close proximity to failsafe (I\u0027ve found that the data I provided in my earlier navigation guide is still very much usable in the dev version). Depletion of consumables has been stepped up considerably as well; I can only speak about stock power consumption, but adequate power for the drive\u0027s operation has gone from 4 RTGs in the current release version to a number of Fuel Cell Arrays in the dev version, with the number you need dependent on the engine you\u0027re using. My understanding is that if you\u0027re using community power sources, the electrical charge requirement is far greater; somebody else may need to fill you in there (I\u0027d appreciate that information for the sake of my own knowledge, actually).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-31T21:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EIf you\u0027re using\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(36,41,46);\u0022\u003EFarFutureTechnologies, NearFutureElectrical, MKS, DSEV.
