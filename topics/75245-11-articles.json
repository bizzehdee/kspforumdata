Being career games, it requires to climb the tech tree to unlock some essential parts so to build my network properly. Early communication is handled with probes I consider temporary, to be replaced as soon as proper communication relay satellites are buildable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy typical \u0022proper\u0022 communication relay satellite is what I place in KSO, each of them with one Communotron 32 Omni, two DTS-M1, two Communotron 88-88, one GFX-128 dish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe minimum configuration I use is three such satellites at 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angles in KSO, and ideally covering longitudes 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 more than KSC, or 014\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W, 106\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0E, 134\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W. The Comm 32\u0027s provide continuous and redundant coverage for all crafts on Kerbin (poles excluded) and orbiting up to altitudes of 5100 Km; the DTS-M1\u0027s are pointed at Mun and Minmus; one Comm 88-88 is used to keep contact with another of the relays; the other 88-88 and the GFX-128 used to follow deep space vessels or for interplanetary coverage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as needed I put another similar relay in KSO and tweak orbits to make a square configuration (that way, distances among the relays are just below the range of the Comm 32, and they don\u0027t need any dish to link them). The DTS-M1\u0027s are then paired between opposite satellites, so two DTS-M1 (from opposite satellites) are pointed at Mun, and two at Minmus. That leaves a total of 4 DTS-M1, 8 Comm 88-88 and 4 GFX-128 available, to be used in pairs (again, coupled from opposite satellites) for each deep space craft or planet I need to connect to (total 8 such connections available). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoles on Kerbin are covered by other probes with just a single Comm 32 in a high-inclined orbit, their primary mission of a different nature (e.g. SCANsat or Kethane scanning).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I start making interplanetary missions, I send probes with communications capability early on, at least two to orbit each body (often on the same orbit, their anomalies at 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 distance, inclination at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from the ecliptic). These satellites must have one long-range dish (to connect back to Kerbin), one Comm 32, one DTS-M1 for each moon to be covered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat parts require management?

When both functions are to be performed \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eat the same time\u003C/span\u003E, you can\u0027t use the same antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadio systems IRL are classified into Transmitters (TX), Receivers (RX) and Receiver-Transmitters (RTX). Most of the high power systems use totally independent channels (TX \u002B RX), unless your system is designed to transmit only in time bursts, and to receive between bursts. Same for radar systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, most used and popular radio sets are RTX. They certainly always use the same antenna for both functions. In radar technology, a couple of internal devices (the TR and ATR switches) protect the receiver when the transmitter is \u0022On Air\u0022, and avoid losses of the received radio energy closing the way to the trasmitter. With older RTX radio sets, users had to wait for the frequency to be free before transmitting, or they would not receive anything in the meantime. More modern radio sets (professional ones) use time bursts, so their trasmission cycle is very short and may not be noticed from the user. They receive bursts from other RTX devices, decompress them and the user experiences an almost continuous signal on the receiving end. Some radio networks even sync the timings for each transmitter to send its data (Roll-Call mode) so to ensure no data are lost in a transmission cycle for any of the radio systems in the network (while the normal broadcast mode could leave two or more radio sets transmitting at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T13:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56399-Now-defunct-thread-that-should-not-appear-in-google-search?p=866915\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post866915\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56399-Now-defunct-thread-that-should-not-appear-in-google-search?p=866915\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post866915\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Comm16 antenna isn\u0027t going to reach from stationary orbit....you\u0027ll want 32s for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T15:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jivaii\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jivaii\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA Comm16 antenna isn\u0027t going to reach from stationary orbit....you\u0027ll want 32s for that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I said that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T16:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sandworm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sandworm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis mod is going through the same cycle it did last time.

I\u0027m a little curious about the interplanetary relays, though -- in the first screenshot, it looks like you have a cone pointing from Dres(?) to Duna, and in the second you have one between Eve and Duna. What was your reasoning for doing that in addition to direct links to Kerbin?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theory with those is to create multiple possible paths from different perspectives. This solves a couple problems. (1) The lower the orbit, the more likely a probe will loose LOS with the relay. Bouncing the signal off another planet, in a radically different part of the sky, greatly reduces this dark time. (2) Sometimes the distance between Kerbin and the target is too great for whatever antenna you are using (career mode here). Relays on inner planets (eve) make possible longer connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a fan of exacting orbits. They aren\u0027t realistic imho. Every realworld communication sat does some degree of station keeping but KSP\u0027s \u0022on rails\u0022 model doesn\u0027t allow for this.

So, if I have to reach for any craft by clicking on it on the map screen, that action is far less easy than it should be, due to all the other crafts close by. But, the target selection menu accessible from the map view (to assign an antenna) is absolutely fine. I would imagine however to have another menu available (possibly with Mission Control, as those Github comments suggest) where all available antennae from all communication sats in orbit around a body can be controlled together. Multiple antennae may be assigned to specific groups, and then may be activated and assigned targets with a single group command. Like on a spreadsheet, with rows for available antennae (or groups) and columns for possible targets, and the user may select a specific target for each antenna (or group), all in a single place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave to say, the above is not actually an original idea from me. It is how complex comms network assets are managed in real life (the \u0022spreadsheet\u0022 is implemented in a real device, in my local reality it is called the \u0022matrix\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout Active Vessel. I am not fond of it, and almost never use it (or, could say I never use it unless for testing purposes). My personal reason is I don\u0027t feel it enough realistic, while its logic also makes nasty troubles (I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t need hints about those, you sure know very well). Actually, ActiveVessel works, and well, if what I need is just a temporary two-way link to any deep-space probe I sent. I would never allow a manned (kerbaled) mission to be out of good continuous comms however. And when a ship or probe is close to a body or any maneuver node, I want to have comms links firmly established (realism indeed, as my feel is Mission Control would want to in reality).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am definitely not among those who wanted to see ActiveVessel removed (reference to the previous RT2 thread). It works for some users. But, my realism need also requires something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf at all possible, I would like to see some automatic search and linking algorithm implemented, for any antenna that loses its primary (defined) link, as a way to re-establish comms whenever needed. My feel is it would be far more realistic than the current system (with or without ActiveVessel). But, this proposal got a lot of dissent when discussed in the previous RT2 thread, so it will have to be examined again here. And, in the end, that is something that requires some serious work to implement: I am happy if you keep RemoteTech working and possibly implement new things a bit at a time, rather than risk to block everything with a very ambitious rework \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
