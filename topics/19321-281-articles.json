Looks like your craft is losing a bit of yaw control at low speeds. And you have some serious side slip issues at mach 1 at 25km. I would almost suggest canting your tail out a bit more, it may fix all of that. I would also ad a bit more wing to the craft, mainly at the tip or give them a bit more of an angle to them this should help a bit with your higher speed performance issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise those are great looking fighters, and look like they would be quite agile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T06:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarge38\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarge38\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere are the pics\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/fzusy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/fzusy\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/lMlYO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/lMlYO\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, most of your wing surface is behind CoM, so the increased mass will have shifted CoM backwards, closer to CoL.
