Create empty transforms in your model, positioned and rotated properly, and reference that transform name in your config.

Create the empty transforms in your model positioned where they should be, and note their location coordinates; copy these coordinates into your node definition, and manually calculate the axis (works best for axis-aligned nodes... calculating off-axis node angles can be a PITA) (might need to swap and or invert Y/Z coordinates, depending upon your modeling program and rotations). It is not in-game; but in-model-editor... which I generally find to be more precise and easier to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as in-game tools, I am unfortunately not aware of any...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info.
