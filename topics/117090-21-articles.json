I would then add a third custom module that would watch for a staging actions, or watch for the part being detached from the craft, and it would activate the MultiModeEngine switch and/or force-activate the secondary jettison engine module.

Allowing layout swapping by the mount-option definition for any layout with the same number of engines (cannot add/remove engines, only reposition them; stock limitation that I cannot workaround without introducing incompatibilities with tons of mods). This would allow for several mount/layout options for, for example, a 3x rs-25 cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Allow per-mount-option overrides of the layout spacing. This would allow for, for example, the SLS mount to be rescaled and re-used at 6.25m for the 4-engine cluster all within the same part, as well as potentially combining it with any other 4-engine variants/mount options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...snip...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two enhancements have been implemented in the dev-branch and seem to be working quite well. Still have a bit more testing/verification to do on them, but so far, so good. I made a test engine cluster using 3x RS-25; and have it swapping between several mounts, with different spacing and engine-layouts on a per-mount basis. Seems like it was a good addition, and was very clean to implement (as opposed to hacky).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T16:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s what I was saying, but are you going to fix that issue with the ICPS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
