There is a more cheaty/risky way, That\u0027s to use your jetpack to get into orbit and do a space walk to kerbin, But then stay in orbit around kerbin and rendezvous with the kerbal, Have the kerbal spacewalk to the ship and board it then go home like you would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all i can say, Kerbals don\u0027t have parachutes so don\u0027t try to land with an EVA on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlowThought","CreatedById":109317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T01:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bearsh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bearsh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is a more cheaty/risky way, That\u0027s to use your jetpack to get into orbit and do a space walk to kerbin.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS on, jump, mash Shift and W, and away I go!
