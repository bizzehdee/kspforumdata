Just 4 wheels. I\u0027ve spent hours experimenting and looked at every likely Google result and haven\u0027t gotten any closer to figuring it out. The closest I\u0027ve come to having the wheels move in the right direction is following one advice to build the wheel frame at 90 degrees to the starting module, using 2-way symmetry, and then returning it to the original position. The problem is some wheels still seem to be moving at 45 degree angles to the others or some nonsense. When I rotate them in VAB they end up either turning in the wrong direction or rotating the opposite way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a right-the-first-time way of placing 4 wheels on a vehicle? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"troyn123","CreatedById":72967,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T18:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHold the shift key and play around with the WASDQE keys... Sometimes, just depending on the part, it won\u0027t ever automatically snap into the direction you want without some finagling of the angles. Those six keys will let you rotate it on any axis, and the shift key just lets you do it in smaller increments. 2x symmetry done twice has given me my best 4-wheel results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T05:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could build your rovers in the SPH and then move the .craft file into your VAB folder manually--plane symmetry is much more useful for rovers (I wish you could do it in the VAB too!).
