However, the illumination in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is already dimmer that in its prequel, and the lights out mod in the first game makes things pretty dark unless you add lights. Maybe the developers can add additional lights to the building, but I believe that until then, the lights out idea won\u2019t be very popular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-05T10:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncould be good for designing landers with landing lights too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
