You get 3).\n\n![screenshot25.png](http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot25.png)\n\n![screenshot26.png](http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot26.png)\n\nDon\u0027t let KER fool you, there\u0027s way more DeltaV here than 5k.\n\nIn LKO:\n\n![screenshot27.png](http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/screenshot27.png)\n\n[The craft file](http://www.mmudforums.com/images/ksp/Duna)\n\nFeel free to give me any suggestions you might have.\n\nEDIT: Ahh, damnit, I can\u0027t edit the title typo.
