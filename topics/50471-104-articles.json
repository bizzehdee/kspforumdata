That cutoff (~13.8 * scaleheight) is true for any planet using the legacy atmosphere model (i.e. Duna, whose 11.1km scale height led to an atmosphere cutoff of 154km, or stock Kerbin whose 5km scale height means 69km or so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth\u0027s atmosphere now ends at 180km because we switched to modeling atmospheres with KSP\u0027s new way of modeling them, pressureCurves (first with Starwaster\u0027s curve, in RSS v6, and soon eggrobin\u0027s updated curves). I selected 180km because that allows two things: first, it means that the transition from 0 pressure is gradual enough that even on an interplanetary trajectory you won\u0027t be hit with a \u0022wall\u0022 of drag (as you would be in the old days), and second, that the 185km (100 nautical mile) \u0022reference\u0022 orbit used for measuring the payload of launchers (and Apollo\u0027s parking orbit) would still be warpable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregex: Given that since I have to include cached meshes for scaledspace RSS v7 will depend more on just RealSolarSystem.cfg for each solar system, I think it makes reasonable sense to offload launch site settings into a separate file. Certainly it makes sharing it easier! (I want people to be able to swap launch site configs; I don\u0027t want that to depend on their version of RSS, or have the chance of breaking the whole RealSolarSystem.cfg).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said Starwaster has a reasonable argument in opposition, and it\u0027s *also* true that maybe we *don\u0027t* want people using *different* RSS.cfgs to be able to swap launch sites without switching system cfgs (and then have that break in-game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emetaphor: I\u0027ve played with 400 in the curve for Earth and had no trouble, so at least that.

Even Earth with 2048x1024 normals is acceptable, so I would suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth/Mars/Venus: 4096 color, 2048 normal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoon (and other moon-size things): 2048 color, 2048 normal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hirez versions would be 8192 for terrestials, 4096 for the Moon (8192? Maybe worth it), and similar rez normals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Moon, does a 4096 heightmap provide sufficient resolution? That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been using so far (especially since except for converting raw DEM data the 5760-wide Kaguya map was the best I could find, and that needs to be made power-of-2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so here\u0027s where I stand right now... I have all of the 8192 resolution maps ready to go (and yes the Moon is definitely worthy of that resolution with the color map I\u0027ve got and I think 4096 is sufficient, but 8192 is still better). I\u0027ve tried using everything with the small 2048 normal maps and, while they do the job, they don\u0027t do it that great, leaving things blocky and pixelated. That being said, this may be an artifact of the fact that I simply down sampled the 8192 normals to get the 2048. Right now I\u0027m creating new normals based off of the 4096 height maps to see if the smaller drop in resolution results in a better visual effect. That all being said, I\u0027m thinking about just releasing three packs now, one with everything 8192, except maybe normals, at a whopping 1.16GB (unpacked), one with everything small (4096 height, 2048 everything else), and one in the middle with 4096 height and color, and 2048 normal. There are some exceptions to this, for example, Venus is blurry on purpose, being raging clouds anyway, so I\u0027ll probably only offer 2048 for color and maybe even 1024 normal since all it is is a grey surface anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reasoning here is that the 8192 color and normal maps together look just fantastic, but as I said above, they are very memory heavy, so I want them available for anyone who\u0027s system can handle them, or if they want to pull in one of them for a specific planet. On the other hand, the 2048 normal and color look pretty junky, but also save a huge amount on memory, so if that\u0027s what people need, I want it available, and then of course if Mac users can only handle 4096, then I want the best they can handle to be available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with all that being said, I\u0027m not going to be able to do any more work on this tonight as I have some important homework to finish before tomorrow morning that I\u0027ve been putting on the back burner to try and roll this out ASAP.
