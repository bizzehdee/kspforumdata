The node position and coliders for the control surfaces are misaligned, therefore seriously hampering any FAR config.\n\nThe delta wing is also impossible to model with one single part, as its a complex shape that FAR can\u0027t emulate if it\u0027s monolithic, afaik.\n\nI\u0027ve helped with the current CSS RO config, I am currently contributing to a CSS fork along with a few others. It is focused exclusively for release with Realism overhaul and all of its dependencies.\n\nYou are doing some cool work here, and the modeling is nice(I especially like the cockpit); however the configuration is a little hazy, such as xenon, an inert gas, being used to somehow generate electricity? -Just read it was a placeholder, disregard!\n\nYou will need alot more than a MM config, but its possible of course.
