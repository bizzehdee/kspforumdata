Pretty much as I play and find things out of place.\n\nThese are Module Manager patches, so of course MM itself is required. \n\n**Current Tweaks**\n\n- the smaller plane wing has liquid fuel capacity, as every plane on earth has\n- moved to simple ladder to an earlier tech\n- the Mk1-2 pod and sepratron earlier as well\n- experiments like the thermometer that only reads data have full transmit capacity\n- balanced the excessive weight on the airplane tail\n- brought back the old swept wing\n- fixes for Sounding Rockets for both FAR and RC\n- lots of balances to Sounding rockets boosters\n- some better values for the stock chutes in Realchutes\n- A bit tweak on the stock physics\n\n**Download**\n\nIf can find the download releases, as well as full project on github.\n\n[https://github.com/Gfurst/Gfurst-KSP-Patches/releases](https://github.com/Gfurst/Gfurst-KSP-Patches/releases)\n\n**Physics!!!**\n\nI intend to to tweak on the stock physics to make them a bit more realistic and challenging.\n\nCurrently all I did was a mid point on what was for 1.0 and what is currently in 1.0.2 stock.\n\nI\u0027m planning more severe stalls lift and drag, stuff, but these more likely will take a bit of time.\n\n**Configure it**\n\nPretty much everything is done by MM, it designed so it will check if a required mod is needed for specific compatibility, and as such it will have minimal impact.\n\nStill if there is something you don\u0027t want active, you can just take the file and change its extension \u0027.cfg\u0027 to \u0027.disabled\u0027 or \u0027.old\u0027, so the game won\u0027t read it.\n\nFiles have been organized in a way to what mod it patches.\n\n**Help me out**\n\nI\u0027m simply doing these as I\u0027m going along playing and noticing stuff. But I can\u0027t check out everything to balance out. \n\nSo if you see something out of place, report here too so I can check it out and add. \n\nSame thing for physics stuff, if you find a setting that will make gameplay better please suggest it to me.\n\nThe project is now on Github, if you so want to, you fork and make your own alterations, if there are suggestions make a merge request.\n\nCheers!\n\n**Changelog**\n\n    Changelog* v0.1 Initial release\n\n[INDENT]  \n What this release patches?  \n \\* The old swept wing is back  \n \\* both wings have a little fuel capacity  \n \\* balance to the airplane tail weight  \n \\* balance to the mk1 cockpit weight  \n \\* science that should be transmited now can be for full  \n \\* EVA from biome only in surface  \n \\* simple ladder is now not rocket science  \n \\* move the mk1-2 pod somewhere more sensible  \n \\* Universal storage, fixe the empty bay  \n \\* US balance of the fuel tanks  \n \\* Sounding Rockets several balances to SRB parts  \n \\* SR Realchute and FAR compatibility  \n \\* Some small RemoteTech tweaks (stayputnik starts with antenna)  \n \\* Some better stock values for RealChute compatibility  \n \\* Modular Rocket Systems, moved around some parts in tech tree  \n \\* Initial balance for KAX (aircraft expansion)  \n \\* Initial physics balance[/INDENT]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T19:21:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gfurst**\n  \nupdating"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:24:23Z","Content":"**Trying for better physics with stock aero**\n\nThanks to Claw, he made extensive explanations on how stock currently works, [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119108-Overhauls-for-1-0?p=1922658\u0026viewfull=1#post1922658).\n\nWe try to make some patches to adjust the physics and better handling of of certain stuff, initially I would tack on the simulated Stall happening,\n\nit depends on this section (and probably drag too)\n\n    name = Default\t\tlift\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 1.965926\t\t\tkey = 0.258819 0.5114774 1.990092 1.905806\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.9026583 0.7074468 -0.7074468\t\t\tkey = 0.7071068 0.5926583 -2.087948 -1.990095\t\t\tkey = 1 0 -2.014386 -2.014386\t\t}\n\nThese keys describe curve of lift as it travels through X(AoA), the angle of attack it self is a inverse Sin function, that is: Sin 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 = 0.5 , the 0.5 being the third key in the example above.\n\nFor each key, the first value is X, second is Y (the actual lift multiplier), the other two tangent in and out, to make smoother curves, I do not know how use them though.\n\nIn the example above, the curve peaks at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA ( the 0.5 key), but it does not lose much value after that, 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA seems a reasonable maximum but it should crap lift afterwards and produce big drag after this point.\n\nAny suggestions?
