Warp kills all relative velocities between parts, but if two parts are misaligned they will remain so, and exiting timewarp will again create physics forces meant to re-align the two parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Unity physics engine, parts are allowed some \u0022freedom\u0022 but each time they move from where they are supposed to be (in relation to the next attached part) a force is created to bring the two parts towards the correct position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrouble like wobbling shows more when massive parts are attached through something smaller. In particular, through a couple of docking ports, as such ports don\u0027t even disperse energy, allowing movements to keep going for very long times. In the worse situations, using time warp at the wrong time with a long vessel already subject to such forces between parts, often the vessel breaks apart when exiting timewarp (as the forces recreated at the moment would even be greater than the maximum allowed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unsure about how to easily explain this mechanical phenomenon. You may consider two attached parts to be able to oscillate like if one is a pendulum in relation to the other. The more massive, and the farther away the center of mass of the two parts, and the less the reaction provided by the attachment (very little with docking ports), the longer the oscillation and more intense the forces can get at the max displacement. Like with all pendulums, there is alternation of potential and kinetic energy, the first when the two parts are the more displaced from the rest position, the second when the wobbling speed is largest. You may be able to think at each form of energy like it was flowing with time, like a wave. And if more modules were tied that way, a wave of energy could be \u0022seen\u0022 to move across the whole structure, from one side to the other and then back. That\u0027s how such things work in reality, just like with a guitar cord.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat to do then to fix the problem? well, building so to avoid large massive parts being attached only by small ones. Struts help greatly to reinforce structures, though they also contribute to make forces, so could even worsen the issue if linked at wrong angles. While docking heavy modules, be extra careful to avoid misalignments (ports would still make the docking, but then the single resultant vessel would start wobbling because the physics engine has to cancel that misalignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T23:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222929910\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485036480\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002293700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022diomedea\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, diomedea said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat to do then to fix the problem? well, building so to avoid large massive parts being attached only by small ones.
