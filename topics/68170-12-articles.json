If SRB\u0027s patches to those parts were allowed to run after FAR\u0027s patches, unpleasantness would happen. Fortunately, all of those patches are protected by a :NEEDS[!FerramAerospaceResearch], so they don\u0027t conflict with FAR. Looks like a separate test for NEAR will have to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T21:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried this with 0.25?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theonegalen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theonegalen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas anyone tried this with 0.25?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot yet, but I know some of it will be broken.
