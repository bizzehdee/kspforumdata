This may be useful to knowing how much time you have until a certain burn or transfer must be made, or even when or where to splash back down in the ocean.\n\nLet\\\u0027s find Semi Major Axis First: My own little KSP formula is the following:\n\nA=AP\u002BPE\u002BPd/2\n\nA: Semi Major Axis\n\nAP: Apoapsis\n\nPE: Periapsis\n\nPd: Planet diameter\n\n/: divided by (of course!)\n\nSo, we can now easily calculate a semi-Major axis. Let\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s hypothetically have an orbit of 160x83KM around Kerbin.\n\nThe SMA of this orbit is 160\u002B83\u002B1200 divided by 2.\n\nOr: 721.5 kilometers.\n\nEasy enough. Finding the Period is just as simple.\n\nYou\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll need two things:\n\n1.) A scientific calculator\n\n2.)The gravitational parameter of the desired body to orbit.\n\nKerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s gravitational parameter is 3530.461km^3/s^2. Ignore the unit, for these calculations, we won\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t need it.\n\nThe formula is simply\n\n?(2)?(A^3/U)\n\n?: Pi\n\nA: SMa\n\nU: Gravitational Parameter\n\nI\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll calculate the period of this orbit manually and show you.\n\nFirst off, our SMa is 721.5Km\n\nNow, we cube that.\n\n=375585663.375\n\nNow we dived by the gravitational parameter (3530.461) of Kerbin.\n\n=106384.3116734613\n\nNow, we do the part of the equation that you\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll need a scientific calculator to complete.\n\n?(2)= 6.283185307\n\n6.283185307?106384.3116734613\n\nIn seconds, our orbital period is: 2,049.351406 EXACTLY.\n\nTo find this in minutes, simply divide by sixty.\n\nAt the altitude I mentioned above, it will take exactly 34.15585677 minutes to complete an orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T02:33:30Z","Content":"I personally use **2 ? ?(a^3/u)**\n\nWhere:\n\na = semi-major axis\n\nu = gravitational parameter; 65.136 km^3/s^2 for Mun and 3530.461 km^3/s^2 for Kerbin.\n\n? = pi; it looks horrid\n\nFor example, orbiting Kerbin @ 100km altitude:\n\n2 ? ?(700km^3/3530.461) = 1958 s = **32.6 minutes**\n\nA slight difference from the OP\\\u0027s calculation.\n\nThe OP\\\u0027s method is easier to understand.
