Tons of people use mods. Since KSP is still in Alpha and heavy development, there are a plethora of things that could be added later, but mods can offer now. If a mod just adds more parts, you can still experience the vanilla game. Still, Mec Jeb is not really cheating, but it removes the value of the game and the most important part, flying your craft. Mec Jeb is best for things that would be humanly impossible to do, like hovering over the moon, etc. Other mods, I don\u0027t remember the name, but you can save launch stages and go between SPH and VAB. These are just handy things that would most likely be implemented eventually. I\u0027d say it\u0027s up to you what and how many mods you want to use, but I prefer the vanilla mechanics.

Every game that allows modding benefits from the dedication that modders have for making a game better by developing new assets, utilities, and tools.
