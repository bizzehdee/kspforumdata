It takes about as much time to go from the edge of Niedon\u0026#39;s SOI to the middle, or from Niedon out to its farthest moon Nissee (which is out near the edge), as it does to get from Kerbin to Eve. So you\u0026#39;re talking [I]several years [/I]within the Niedon system just to get in, visit both moons, and get out again. And then another 25-30 years to get home.

Also contains a probe core and solar panels, for unmanned missions, which take all the space in the cargo bay: so no payload other than crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuite manoeuvrable, although it lacks some pitch authority, but it remains very flyable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IHNLuKC.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/87k26a12o1ses1w/SSTO%20Temperance.craft?dl=0\u0022]Download link here[/URL].\u003Cbr\u003E\nAction groups are:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1: Toggles Whiplashes and switches Rapiers\u0026#39; mode;\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: Toggles bay doors;\u003Cbr\u003E\n3: Toggles solar panels.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T13:43:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded download link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaticFringe","CreatedById":146646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T02:10:10Z","Content":"\nHad a contract to build up my space station. Had to add a module and a cupola so that it could support as many as 12 Kerbals. Nice design and added a hub so that I can continue to expand further. I had to move the orbital adjustment module to the opposite port to clear room for docking second module. In the future I plan to deorbit the OAM when it get low and fuel and I want to try to recover it after reentry. So far, no problems and my station looks great.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter completing docking of both modules, I successfully deorbited the orbit insertion stage of the second module.
