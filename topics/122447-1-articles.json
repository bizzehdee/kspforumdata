Mirror mode attaching is broken: the mirrored side is rotated 90 degree CCW. On top of that, these seem to be offset to the side (CCW) a bit.

I have this odd feeling that the model needs to be rotated 90 degrees and one or 2 of those numbers should be zeroed out. Mind you, I\u0027m no modder or modeler, so I could be utterly wrong. It\u0027s just that the SEM-24 is just PERFECT for my small SSTOs, so I\u0027d like to use them. As it stands, they\u0027re a bit inconvenient to us on SSTOs (since they rely more on mirror symmetry than radial). The offset is just irking my mild OCD-ness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd something seems weird about the engine nozzle. Maybe it just an illusion from the texture, but the placement looks offset.

The little bit of swirl in the texture by the nozzle plus KSP\u0027s camera view in the editor could very well be playing with my eyes. (And maybe the node placement as well... Not really sure.

I imagine some intrepid users will use the angled thrust versions for something fun. (Like a RATO cargo SSTO...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you had the right idea for the attachment node, but filled out too many numbers. Assuming those are just XYZ coordinates (no idea how Unity does this internally), what you did was (for example) offset it a little forward (okay, still centerline), outward (okay, moving out to the casing/surface), and to the side (\u0026lt;\u0026lt; Offset.) You have a better idea of this since you\u0027re the modder, but looking at the numbers and knowing how a 3-axis (Euclidean) coordinate system generally works is what made me think that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea about the symmetry issues though.
