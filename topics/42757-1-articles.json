KSP uses the latter format, as do most real world rockets because it eliminates any possibility of unit confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, posters above got it right: The Isp rating of an engine is not affected by any other engines attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine two identical car engines, attached to the same fuel tank. Turning on the second engine while the first was already running doesn\u0027t affect the fuel burn rate or power of the first engine. It just empties the fuel tank faster because now you\u0027ve got two engines burning it instead of one. But you\u0027re also now producing power twice as fast, so it comes out to the same efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Delta-V of the rocket however *will* be reduced by the second engine. Delta-V stands for \u0027Change in Velocity\u0027, the greek letter delta (which looks rather like a triangle, but we don\u0027t have that on our keyboards so we just type it out) stands for \u0027Change\u0027, and \u0027V\u0027 is short for \u0027Velocity\u0027. Delta-V is one of the most important things on a rocket. It indicates how much it\u0027s able to change its speed. Changes in speed are required for every single type of maneuver (even just changing directions is classed as an acceleration), so Delta-V measures how much movement you\u0027re able to accomplish. Extra Mass decreases Delta-V because of the extra inertia that has to be overcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractically, in some circumstances the Delta-V reduction doesn\u0027t matter: During a launch, if you don\u0027t have enough thrust, all the Delta-V in the world won\u0027t save you from falling back into the body you\u0027re launching from. Thrust will. More thrust can also actually IMPROVE efficiency during a launch by reducing drag and gravity losses, potentially by more than the Delta-V cost of adding engines (or using less efficient ones with higher thrust and/or lower weight).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T18:44:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Herbert McCheese-Wang","CreatedById":68660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T22:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, so it turns out, that each engine should have it\u0027s own fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will change my designs alot, thanks for tour help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T00:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Herbert McCheese-Wang\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Herbert McCheese-Wang\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, so it turns out, that each engine should have it\u0027s own fuel tank.\u003Cp\u003EThis will change my designs alot, thanks for tour help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot necessary.

I didn\u0027t explain that about the Thunderbolts; sorry. With the Heavy 7, all five engines feed off the central tank. The four outboard tanks use fuel lines to feed in, and so they all drain first. The \u0027bolts are meant to be reusable, so they have no provision for dumping off the empty tanks (which would help with thrust/acceleration). A better system than what I have would probably utilize radially mounted docking ports; dump off the side tanks when they\u0027re empty, put new ones on when you get back to Kerbin.

Specific impulse as time is a historical convention because the conventions we use today in rocket science mostly came out of the US. Weight changes with location, Isp doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s really introducing more unit confusion than it solves, to be honest. You can think of specific impulse as thrust times time divided by weight-at-standard-gravity of propellant, but that\u0027s a mouthful. I prefer thinking of specific impulse in this way: first measure the \u0022effective exhaust velocity\u0022 which is thrust times time divided by mass of propellant, but express it in units of pound-force seconds per pound-mass (or equivalently kilogram-force seconds per kilogram). Specific impulse in seconds is this quantity, multiplied by one pound-mass per pound-force (or one kilogram per kilogram-force) just to convert the units to seconds without changing the numerical value. The unit conversion of one pound-mass per pound-force is equal to one over the standard acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant that comes entirely from the units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T06:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsp in seconds does have a meaningful (if less-than-useful) interpretation. If a motor would output a constant thrust equal to the weight at sea level on Earth of some particular quantity of propellant, the Isp in seconds is how long that motor would be able to provide that thrust given that quantity of propellant. So, for example, that nuclear engine could provide, say, 1 kN of thrust for 800 seconds if it had about 102kg (a mass that weighs 1 kN at sea level on Earth) of reaction mass to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
