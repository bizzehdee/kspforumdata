If it was placed poorly to begin with, it would actually turn into a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit before it completes one revolution, and just leave the system entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy definition, a circular orbit can only exist if all points of the orbit are equidistant from the center of the sum off all gravitational bodies exerting influence on it, which is roughly the center of the star, or the center of gravity of all the stars in binary and trinary systems. A circular orbit can be maintained on a trajectory where the center of rotation is not also the center of gravity, because gravity will always work to move the center of rotation to it\u0027s own center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way around this I can think of would be a biunary system with both a magnetar and normal neutron star, and you have a planet made out of a ferromagnetic material (iron being the obvious one). While gravity would be between the two stars, the magnetic interaction between the magnetar and iron planet would easily trump the extreme gravitational forces, and the planet would be able to center on the magnetic force instead of the gravitational force. Of course, in such a system the planet would be torn apart instantly from magnetic and gravitational sheering, right before the neutron stars consumed each other/tore each other to pieces and reformed as a singularity (black hole).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if somehow the system didn\u0027t tear itself to pieces, the magnetar and neutron stars would actually rotate around each other, causing the center of magnetic influence to move. This would probably give the iron planet an orbit looking more like it came out of a spirograph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Tought about this a bit more, and it probably wont work. Even with all the magnetic force that a magnatar has, I\u0027m not sure it would be able to trump it\u0027s own immense gravitational force, seeing as neutron stars and their variants (magnetars and pulsars) are secong only to gravitational singularities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of .17, I quite like the idea of planet cool aid, though I might have gone for lime green instead of neon red. Minimus and the Mun are already quite dull, so I think it\u0027s time to change it up and give us a neon planet. When all is said and done and we have our 8 planets (I think that\u0027s their plan), I would like to have 2 or 3 neon planets with neon moons, because we can. The other 5 or 6 can be all washed out, though I hope we get a washed out green planet as well (planet Matrix!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T18:03:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
