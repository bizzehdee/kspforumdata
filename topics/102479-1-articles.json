As many of us, I love mods. They make life easier, mostly, and provide a variety of parts. I love to recreate historical missions and it is much easier to do with mods. But we play KSP not because it is easy, but because it is hard. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSo, that is why I present you komrade **Niemand\u0027s Integration Facility #1**! roll credits\n\nI will do historical (and sometimes fictional/cancelled) ships and space stations, so you can fly Soviet style.\n\n[**DOWNLOAD ALL CRAFTS**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2yvpyvqg71ynsxz/NIF_v1.zip?dl=0)\n\n**N-1/M3 Kerbiet Munar Komplex!**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
