Hence why most of my Mars/Duna plans hinge on the flotilla concept, with several craft making up one mission, many of which precede the crew. Ground supplies gets launched with precursor ground equipment, return supplies launched at some point (usually with mapping/comms probes, though it could also just be a straight separate launch in of itself), and of course the journey to supplies are launched with the crew or the habitat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, as much of my habitats would be using large ion engines \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E wouldn\u0027t be an issue, just burn times.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmetman","CreatedById":181322,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-28T17:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not that much of a fan of ion engines because of their burn time also.
