However, as soon as I tried to land amongst the tree laden ground, the closer I got to the ground the more trees were visible, the higher the memory usage went up, and it crashed when it hit close to 4gb private working set.\n\nNeed to find a way to reduce the memory usage. Any way to turn off trees?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:20:19Z","Content":"Trees are terrain scatter and can be reduced or turned off in the settings screen."},{"CreatedByName":"jestrjk","CreatedById":143446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:29:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Trees are terrain scatter and can be reduced or turned off in the settings screen.\n\nSo turning off ppfx and turning off the heat guages allowed me to land amongst the 60% terrain scatter trees and recover the craft at about 3.5ish gb.\n\nI\u0027ve turned down the scatter now to about 30%. Hopefully the combination of these things will keep it under the limit.\n\nToo bad the x64 version doesn\u0027t work, we could mask all these memory inefficiencies with MOR POWA."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:33:25Z","Content":"PPFX?
