After launch and one orbit, on reentry, both Mk2-R chutes refused to deploy, even after trying with the right-click menu option. The message given was: \u0022Cannot deploy while stowed!\u0022 (see image #1 below).\n\n![hm19ClC.png](http://i.imgur.com/hm19ClC.png)\n\nAfter attaining more parts and science experiments, a second (updated) version of the rocket was built with an Mk1 Command Pod with two Service Bays stacked beneath; Again, the Mk1 had two Mk2-R Radial Mount Parachutes attached with a Mk16 Parachute on the nose. Twice (because of unrelated catastrophic failures, reverting back to Launch) when attempting to deploy chutes, one of the Mk2-R\u0027s refused to deploy (and again) even after trying with the right-click menu option. The same message given was: \u0022Cannot deploy while stowed!\u0022 (see image #2 below).\n\n![0UOtwdM.png](http://i.imgur.com/0UOtwdM.png)\n\nAfter these two events, I began to prepare to submit this (potential?) bug report, but then remembered it had been suggested I try opening the Service Bay and then trying to deploy the chute(s) again ... because perhaps the game thought the chutes were stowed in the bay. {This suggestion resulted from a previous post I made the other day on the subject: which is [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117532-Radial-Mount-Parachutes).} So, I went back into the game to repeat the event for a third time to test this. *However*, when I did, all chutes deployed without a problem ... as if exiting the game and then reentering magically solved whatever the problem was.\n\nI figure I will submit this none-the-less; Maybe it is a bug, maybe not, perhaps someone can take a look at it. In the mean time, I will continue to use this rocket and will report back here if it begins doing it again.\n\nMy persistent file and craft file are linked below, saved and uploaded for this report *before* I tried to repeat and test the Service Bay open test. The output\\_log.txt file is also linked below, but, unfortunately, I didn\u0027t grab it until after the third test (sorry).\n\n[**Persistent**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jk4t5k5oqq0f5q3/persistent.sfs?dl=0)\n\n[**Craft**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9n3il0jig5j5lo/Progress-1.craft?dl=0)\n\n[**Output\\_log**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fq025703e537qbl/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n**System Specs:** ASUS laptop with Intel i7-4500U cpu, 8gb mem, Intel embedded graphics *and* Nvidia GForce GT 745M graphics.\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T17:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:56:13Z","Content":"This is possibly caused by the chute being too close to the service bay.\n\nCan you reproduce this reliably?

While I did not do a quicksave/quickload test, as I said - exiting the game and then reentering did *seem* to fix it... but I\u0027ve not really tested that out thoroughly. So far, with another flight I did late last night, the chutes all successfully deployed. As for an .sfs file, I posted a link to the persistent.sfs which was saved right after the problem occurred; It was after saving it that I reentered the game to find it mysteriously \u0027fixed\u0027.\n\nCorrect, no fairings are used other than the auto-fairing of the new heat shield, and no other cargo bays / Service Bays other than what\u0027s seen. The rest of the rocket was the lifter stage.\n\nNo, I did not use the Offset or Rotate tools while assembling in the VAB. Both radial chutes were placed manually, but the Angle Snap was active."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:14:00Z","Content":"It appears the community has come up with what will likely be the only answer to this ... see the results [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117532-Radial-Mount-Parachutes)."}]}
