After launch and one orbit, on reentry, both Mk2-R chutes refused to deploy, even after trying with the right-click menu option.

Twice (because of unrelated catastrophic failures, reverting back to Launch) when attempting to deploy chutes, one of the Mk2-R\u0027s refused to deploy (and again) even after trying with the right-click menu option. The same message given was: \u0022Cannot deploy while stowed!\u0022 (see image #2 below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0UOtwdM.png\u0022 alt=\u00220UOtwdM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter these two events, I began to prepare to submit this (potential?) bug report, but then remembered it had been suggested I try opening the Service Bay and then trying to deploy the chute(s) again ... because perhaps the game thought the chutes were stowed in the bay. {This suggestion resulted from a previous post I made the other day on the subject: which is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117532-Radial-Mount-Parachutes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.} So, I went back into the game to repeat the event for a third time to test this. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EHowever\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, when I did, all chutes deployed without a problem ... as if exiting the game and then reentering magically solved whatever the problem was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure I will submit this none-the-less; Maybe it is a bug, maybe not, perhaps someone can take a look at it.
