To make any complex folders you will have to do some cfg edits to change rotation speed and how far the hinges bend. Don\\\u0027t count on the plane looking all the way folded or unfolded in the SPH, most of mine start out sort of half way and I unfold them on the runway before starting the recordings. Try to go one hinge at a time, go to the runway and check it\\\u0027s orientation, then go back to the SPH and change as needed.. use the arrows on the servo controls in the SPH to change the direction of the hinges. Finally the base of the hinges is always connected to the parent part, if your hinges flex in odd ways, they are probably backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
