It is NOT in the Recycle Bin and I am really at a loss as to what to do. I need to know, is there any way for me to recover it? I would also take this time to suggest that there should be a \u0022recover deleted save\u0022 option in KSP, where all deleted saves are moved to a separate folder within the saves folder into which saves marked for deletion would go where they would spend at least 3 days in before being deleted permanently. Please, if I don\u0027t recover this save I will have essentially lost several months worth of work. Please help me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T18:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, avoid making any new files wherever possible.

Every time a write-operation is done to the drive, changes are that the space on the drive where the actual data is, will be overwritten.
