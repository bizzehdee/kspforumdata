This problem has really annoyed me. Loading times with some mods take about 2 minutes for KSP to start, and with some of the mods turned on, the game will crash very often when switching from the hangar to in game, 1 crash every 20 minutes perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather the developers fix some of these major bugs first before continuing to add features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T02:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me put it simple, as you\u0027re kinda new to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game has a 4GB ram limit, which is imposed by Unity (KSP\u0027s engine), and there is nothing the KSP developers can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you chose to install mods, you agree that you\u0027re not guaranteed anything.
