This is usually if your mouse cursor is slightly left or of the green snap ball.

I described exactly where your mouse needs to be to observe the red highlighting and reproduce the issue. Regardless, it\u0027s one of those things that until you realize what is happening, it just seems like an intermittent \u0022sometimes my decouplers disappear\u0022 and can be very confusing, and I only figured out what was happening because I was taking the time to figure out how to reproduce the issue so I could report it. It was pretty frustrating until I took the time to figure it out. I think it should be considered a bug. Bottom line, the logic that snaps the part should be consistent with the logic that connects the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
