Heavy objects put on it will curve it and objects will be attracted to it because they \u0022fall\u0022. Well it\u0027s the same for spacetime. Except spacetime in that case is the trampoline itself. If you have a big bowling ball at the center of the trampoline and you throw a bunch of marbles in they\u0027ll start falling towards it. If you add a second bowling ball in the middle, it\u0027ll act as a twice as massive object. In that case, the force on the trampoline will propagate at the speed of sound as any force in a physical object does. That\u0027s the same idea here. The curvature of spacetime will \u0022spread\u0022 at the speed of light, because that\u0027s the speed limit. But the curvature of the trampoline is not affected by how curved it is unlike the marbles that will be attracted twice as much, and it\u0027s the same for spacetime. The curvature is not affected by it\u0027s own precense unlike light and matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then again, you don\u0027t get the information of how massive a black hole is from the black hole itself. You estimate it by looking at how it affects it surroundings. It doesn\u0027t mean any information is leaving the black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T08:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason arguing about gravity is so much fun is it\u0027s made of crazy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read a recent article about this. Here\u0027s what I can remember...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe article said we \u0022know\u0022 that changes in gravity propagate at lightspeed. So if you hooked up a warp drive to something supermassive, then dropped out of warp 10 light seconds from Earth, it\u0027d be 10 seconds before Earth started be accelerated by the object\u0027s gravity.
