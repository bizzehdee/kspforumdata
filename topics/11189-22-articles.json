Also it landed with plenty of jet fuel to spare so it can be easily flown to KSC. It also has two refueling ports on the sides for land based refueling ships.\n\n[![screenshot1125.png](http://s19.postimg.org/rczn8phfn/screenshot1125.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot1127.png](http://s19.postimg.org/dkl8d2qo3/screenshot1127.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot39.png](http://s19.postimg.org/slniuc9dv/screenshot39.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot42.png](http://s19.postimg.org/xgh7sm7pf/screenshot42.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot46.png](http://s19.postimg.org/ylb9xzu6b/screenshot46.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[![screenshot49.png](http://s19.postimg.org/6jx8kaow3/screenshot49.png)](http://postimage.org/)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T09:29:45Z","Content":"Thanks for some interesting and amusing mission reports. I have updated the OP and cpt\\_nosh regrettably refuelling while perfectly legitimate spacefaring activity disqualifies a mission with respect to the K Prize as the intention is to compare the intrinsic capability of reusable space planes. So I have linked your mission on the gate crashers list of infamy ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) because it deserves to be included. Concept 4 is still a nice looking craft though and clearly capable of completing a K Prize mission so I hope you will give it another go and omit the refuelling next time.\n\nzekes, big ship! I am going to include ZoPL Endeavour in the v0.20 reports but will not include it for consideration for the maximalist record as it took off in v0.19.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T09:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"}]}
