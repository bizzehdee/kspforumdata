According to the author, it can be used to create textures up to 64 Terapixels and stream them at runtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if a plugin like this can be used with KSP, to load better textures for planets, and eventualy load textures dynamically, to reduce RAM consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plugin is not free, but it comes with a trial version (didn\u0027t try it yet). I need confirmation (or at least some hints) from someone who knows Unity (and KSP\u0027s code) better than I do: According to the website, all you have to do is to create your texture, load it from an asset, and apply a script to the scene\u0027s camera. If it\u0027s even possible to apply this, can it be done at runtime?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T12:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA quick read of their doc show that you need to add a component to the scene, and doing so at runtime can range from trivial to impossible (depending of the component). Furthermore their spec show you can only have 16 megatexture per scene which is quite limited, and they recommends Unity 5 (only in beta for paying customers atm).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would need some testing to be sure, but I have serious doubt a plugin could use it.

I\u0027m more interested in the \u0022proof of concept\u0022. I think the component could be created with the Editor and imported in the scene, but textures needs to be converted to a specific format.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the tutorial, it\u0027s done with a tool in the Editor. Even if I manage somehow to create the Texture Manager and add the script to the camera, I don\u0027t see how I could call this tool at runtime. Or maybe this must be done only once, in the Editor? I\u0027ll take a closer look at this ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, somehow I forgot KSP has moons too... That 16 textures limit could be a problem... Let\u0027s keep those textures for planets for now... (a workaround could be to store several textures in one gigantic texture, but this will bring many other problems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for answering!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T13:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lilleman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lilleman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the component could be created with the Editor and imported in the scene, but textures needs to be converted to a specific format.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I know to do that is with asset bundle and it require Unity Pro.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lilleman","CreatedById":112321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T18:06:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t even test this: importing the trial package makes my Editor crash...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think you\u0027re right. It won\u0027t be done with a plugin, I\u0027m not even sure it can be done at scene creation at lower level: after some reading, it appear that MegaTextures (or virtual texturing) can have a huge impact on RAM and VRAM with large landscapes (like KSP\u0027s)... Definitely not what the game needs at the moment...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin is quite young, though, maybe virtual texturing will be easier and more flexible in future versions of Unity (I believe DX11.2 has some functions to handle this, Ultra-HD textures are just a matter of time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the quick answers, at least I didn\u0027t spent too much time on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
