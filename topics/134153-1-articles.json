(Also 4n\u002B2 orbital is missing). For hydrogen that electron in a d orbital would be in an extremely excited state and quickly decay to the orbital in the first panel. Hydrogen atoms when given a chance like to place two electrons and share on 1s-1s orbital. This is because each orbital can hold 2 electrons of opposing spin, which he did not mention. So in nature hydrogen generally looks like a proton and an electron whizzing disassociatively in space, or you have this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ned = electron density, * = proton\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ned * ED * ed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital#Molecular_orbital_examples\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital#Molecular_orbital_examples\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_diagram#Diatomic_MO_diagrams\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_diagram#Diatomic_MO_diagrams\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts one thing to tell people its wrong, its another to tell them why.
