You might have seen me around the forums as a newbie. But today, I earn my stripes as a fully fledged kerbonaut! Today, I landed on the moon with my Delta XV rocket. It was a large amount of quicksaves, but I did it! And, what was most important to me was the fact that I did it with my own rocket design! (Pictures below) It was an interesting journey, as I didn\\\u0027t plan on going to the Mun at all (though I did plan on testing the aircraft to possibly land on the moon on a later date)! It was a sunny day. I decided to launch my new design of the Delta XV rocket, an improvement over my current only orbiting rocket, the Delta XIII rocket. As a brand new rocket, I wasn\\\u0027t sure if it was going to work at all. So as i lifted off, I noticed my pilot was usually happy. I looked at the nametag, and there it was: Jebediah Kerman. So as I went into a terrible orbit, I decided to try modifying my orbit. You have to understand that this was all new to me and getting a perfect orbit was unheard of. So sure enough, after burning at the periapsis, the apoapsis went into the Mun\\\u0027s orbit pattern. After a few adjustments, I was on a course for a flyby with THE MUN! I was ecstatic! This was the first time I have ever seen this yellow line! I quickly burned at the apoapsis. Then I realized that the burn only made the flyby worse. Then I burned in the periapsis and connected it. BAM my first orbit with the Mun! Then, as a challenge, I decided, \u0027Hey lets make this a perfect orbit!\u0027. So I did. After making my perfect orbit, it was time to try it. I burned and went into a crash course with the Muner surface. After numerous attempts (quicksave), it was time to give up. After all it WAS 4 AM. I waited until today and tried it. I took less than 5 tries and then it happened. Touchdown. Amazement. Success. Though I have fuel to get back, why go back when your on the Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Delta XV rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n0YX3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n0YX3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy touchdown (too excited to press F2 ;D)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dEg7W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dEg7W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy lander, take note of how skinny (and \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EHARD \u003C/span\u003Eto land) the craft is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iPJ1L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iPJ1L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vcZgM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vcZgM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh-Oh...
