The basic design \u0026amp; philosophy is the same, but the extra boosters provide a bit more oomph at lift-off and make sure that the bottom section of the craft is able to propel the final 2 stages all the way out of the atmosphere. The booster package accelerates the rocket to ~100m/s to an altitude of 6000m, after which the 3 remaining LFE\u0027s take over. They take the remaining rocket up to about 30-40.000m at ~450m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design requires even more fiddling with the staging though, but nothing too difficult I\u0027d reckon.

This high COG will also induced some movement, so it\u0027s important to wait for the pod to point straight up before launching, otherwise the rocket will take off at an angle. This is similar to \u003Cem\u003Ethe twang\u003C/em\u003E the Space Shuttle performs irl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be mentioned that both rockets -though stable- have a slight tendency to roll left \u0026amp; bank right (at 90\u00C2\u00B0) with the SAS turned off until the tri-coupler is jettisoned. The roll can be easily overcome by small control-inputs, as can the bank. Or if you do not correct the bank angle it will actually help pick up horizontal speed to make getting into orbit even easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finrandojin","CreatedById":1598,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-18T18:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeverytime I see people mount SRB\u0027s on their top stage I die a little inside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaHitch","CreatedById":1140,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-18T18:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe so, but they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to come up with several other designs (without boosters on top) and I\u0027m simply unable match the performance of Freedom 7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m trying to construct an SSTO, but things aren\u0027t going as smooth as I\u0027d hoped.
