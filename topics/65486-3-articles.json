One of our most reliable probes is a mere 36 years old. With current or even realistic future technology we need to span \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E more years than that. It is nice that we have a 100 year old lightbulb, but building a highly complex spacecraft that can reliably do the same is another matter completely.

The larger your transistors, the less advanced/quick they will need to be and the more power they will consume. Not great in an interstellar void without many external energy sources. Sending a probe out on a journey for hundreds of years means going very big when it comes to transistors and die size. And let us not forget that transistors have only been around since 1947.

Could you give us some insight into the difficulties to be expected? And for what kind of timespan are specialist longlife Earthbound systems built, for what application? I can imagine that systems that are hard or impossible to maintain (sealed or dangerous environments et cetera) are designed for longevity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh-oh, you know what they say about experts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, a couple of caveats: I\u0027m not an electronic engineer, although I\u0027m more gripped up on electronics/MEMS than most of my mechanical brethren. So you might want to consult your electron-herding friends anyway. Second, ensuring reliability over the kind of timescales we\u0027re discussing here is not something I\u0027ve ever had to do professionally. From a bit of a scrounge around the libraries I suspect that\u0027s because nobody else has either. Papers discussing extreme lifespans don\u0027t seem to be jumping out at me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can tell you is that commercially available electronics (even those intended for aerospace or military use that we deem \u0022high reliability\u0022) are not up to scratch. Part of the problem is you\u0027ve got priorities pulling in opposite directions: you\u0027re going to need a spacecraft with a high level of autonomy, which necessitates substantial processing power, but the way you achieve increased processing power and efficiency in integrated circuits is by shrinking them. As structures get smaller and smaller you get all sorts of problems, including \u0022Weird Quantum ****\u0022. For example, sputtering a thin film onto a substrate invariable puts atoms into the wrong places in the wrong energy states. That causes intrinsic stresses in the film, couple that with current flow causing thermal stresses and you get unavoidable mechanical processes within the film. Eventually it will fail. Just like with corrosion, we\u0027re talking about devices that only work if their atomic components are in a state other than what nature would prefer them to be in. Eventually mother nature will reorganise your work back into a chemical or electrical state that she\u0027s happy with, and your gizmo stops working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way we get around this in practice is to not make things any more complex than they need to be. Despite 22nm chips being commercially available a lot of what you\u0027ll find in even brand new industrial kit is built at the 130nm node. It\u0027s well-understood and reliable. It still wouldn\u0027t last 100 years in a hostile environment like space, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProfessionally I\u0027d be really interested in how the QA and design bods would tackle the problem of testing kit for a 100 year service lifespan with no chance of repair. AFAIK no one has ever done it with electronics. We have really good predictive theories for mechanical reliability that work over those kind of lifespans which we use on things like bridges, and even aircraft (some DC-3s are pretty old, and the USAF is planning on flying their B-52s until they\u0027re nearly 100) so I\u0027m confident we could design a spacecraft that would handle that life structurally. But designing electronics for that kind of life isn\u0027t something that anybody seems to have ever done, so it would be a whole new field. We would have to wind the scientists up and get them to do some fairly fundamental research to map out the way forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T08:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread took an interesting turn. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I know of being engineered for the really long haul is this stuff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://longnow.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://longnow.org/\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA clock designed to work for 10.000 years and a record of human languages on some sort of microfilm disc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T08:49:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by 78stonewobble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T10:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erest assured the computers we use in space long term will have more in common with a computer from the 80s than it would with your gaming rig. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know there are things like the elevator hoists and the water pumps at the empire state building are all original equipment, installed in the 30s, and still work so good that the though of replacing them with something modern is outrageous. then there are various steel bridges and buildings that have been around a long time, even ancient structures like the pyramids and roman aqueducts teach us something about long term engineering. concrete is known to last a long time if you dont reinforce it with steel. steel structures also last a long time. we know if we build a structure more robust than it needs to be, it will last a long time. and we know stone structures are pretty much immortal. now granted we dont think of these things as space faring tech, but they are important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can also get around the problems of radiation if your ship is really big, by burying critical system deep within the bowels of the ship. when i say big i mean asteroid/ice dwarf scale, using much of the object\u0027s mass as propellant. charon would make a good candidate for such a ship. with it you could take a city sized population and enough industry to fix anything along the way utilizing the natural resources of the object. the other side of it is that its going to be a very long trip, so the idea has merit even if its an emergency evacuate the solar system type mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T10:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002278stonewobble\u0022 data-cite=\u002278stonewobble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA clock designed to work for 10.000 years\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that they\u0027ve gone mechanical for this.
