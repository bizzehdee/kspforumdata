I would ranked it higher than Civilization.\n\nI don\u0027t know about that. It\u0027s hard to say with franchise games that change like Civ but while Civ 5 was pretty rudimentary, Civ 4 was incredibly detailed in micro management. You could play for a very long time and still find things you didn\u0027t know.\n\nI would have put SimCity as #10, StarCraft doesn\u0027t really have a steep learning curve at all... it has tutorials in-game! And why no Minecraft? I mean you can\u0027t play that game without going to the Wiki or youtube or some other source. It just isn\u0027t possible to figure out the recipes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T20:54:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:30:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is ranked higher than Sim City.

Simplified. Civ 1-4 however had steep learning curves and required a ton of micro management.\n\nEdit- Still think Eve had the stronger curve. There is a reason I no longer play it..."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T00:08:14Z","Content":"I play Simcity, Civilisation 5 and KSP.
