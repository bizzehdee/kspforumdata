So before this happened, I was going to undock my little space station in Kerbin Orbit. I\u0027ve never had this issue and at the time I had RealPlume mods enabled.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was going to undock my command pod, and as I did it, my KSP crashed. I initially thought it was just a small crash. I restarted my KSP and this is what I came back to: (check video)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1r1KLc8hII?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried everything, restarting my PC, uninstalling every mod, terminating the station (or command pod that was bugging) and then loading back via save, and it still has the same problem. I sent a rocket up there my self without using the tracking station, and as soon i get near the station, it explodes. Please help, but luckily it was a pretty small station.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is the part I undocked before it crashed. You can see it is bugged out. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.51\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u0022773\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733001410089844806/784492415176015929/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpdate: 6hrs and this weird ring has showed up, here\u0027s the log as well: \u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.00\u0022 height=\u0022455\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778234105074548766/784590984037138472/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-05T01:25:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2020 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Anthonyplayz18\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
