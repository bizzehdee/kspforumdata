There was definitely something about DLC though. But, either way, I think this game is way too early as far as development to be monetizing with DLC. It needs alot more base content before making dlc worth it. They should add alot more and do enough to the base game that it simply brings in more players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd more of everything and make the game revolve around options. Make the mods for alot of purposes just be adding onto it. Or have the stock game be more or less preset choices and then use mods and things for changing that. There is endless room to improve the core game. Lots of stuff that arguable should have been in 1.0 and earlier. It\u0027s not really good to try to make money from DLC when you can still develop the core game. You can simply develop the heck out of the game and make money from core sales until the game has all the stuff you would think was originally supposed to be in game and then when sales max out from a greater value like world wide potenial sales then consider dlc potentially. The game is not finished. I would not want to pay for stuff that under better circumstances should have already been in game and including in my purchase. It\u0027s not right on the users end. Always run game sales from the standpoint of benefiting the player the most and money should not be an issue. the probably just need to get themselves past the engine limitation or do as much as possible until they can get around it or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry lots of smaller stuff like my idea on graphs. Maybe little random generated things on surfaces or add robotics to go with it. Stuff to maximise and expand on the game to give it more playability all around. Keep doing that to get player numbers and consistant play up. Then after going overboard on features monetize dlc potentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the development stunted by an engine then dlcing is a bad combo all round. With the chage to the new company could they get more work on getting around engine limitation or finding ways to get the game to be unhindered by software issues and get more base stuff in the game that was supposed to be in it? That might be enough to start getting more sales in general and get more people in the game and not need to dlc stuff. How many people have they sold to out of the 7\u002B billion. This game is interesting enough(as it is currently the only game trying more fully use physics atm.) and has the potential to bring in lots of people. It just need to get around it\u0027s current problems and could bring people in. They should probably consider that too. If they don\u0027t work on physics before it becomes common it might be harder to compete(maybe) they can get stuff done now and either makes lots of early money or help make it more common and improve things in general which itself will bring in competition and more ideas for development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe older philosophies on game development by the best companies were always make money off of as much development as possible(IE maximize work and the community will take care of you!), as opposed to making as much money as possible off of as little development as possible. Always work to the max towards the users benefit and the user will always give in return. That is especially for something like this that should be like an educational community(not college, real world). It\u0027s about access and work more than other things. That benefits the community best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never liked the idea of DLC. There is no real reason until you max out sales at good bulk of world population or gaming population. This game taken far enough could and should be able to bridge game genres and hobbies when developed to the max because it\u0027s potentially a progressive actual physics game and something that should have been possible a long time ago in general. It should ultimately be sellable to anyone and everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: They also shouldn\u0027t dlc and minimum until my game stops becoming unplayable every version update. It\u0027s worse this time than before... They need to get some fundamentals down first... Whether those are related to engine limitations or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink how many things can be stock still. They should do a DLC after they maximize stuff for this solar system.
