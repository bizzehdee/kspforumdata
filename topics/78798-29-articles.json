However I\u0027m somehow forced to use landing gear from mod, in order to place extractor correctly... my thought, I would rather have just adapter where I can place whatever legs I need (i.e. stock one) with whatever configuration, lastly legs from this mod doesn\u0027t react on G button...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks - and no worries, it was a part saving measure (and folks on the MKS/OKS side have been asking for it), but what I can do instead is swap it out for two of the cage modules - one with four trusses and one with three.

Sometimes a bit slow if you are on a low yield spot but this is expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current extractor drill is a little unwieldy unless using the landing leg frame.

But the planned radial drills will overcome this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversion works, at least for monoprop and LFO if it is all in the same stack. I seem to have run into an issue where my side tanks did not get fueled, but it was easy to work around by using fuel transfer from the main tank.
