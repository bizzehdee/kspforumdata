However no matter what I try, I cannot get it to connect to the second vertical tower structure. I have tried: radial attachment points, docking ports, cubic struts in various configurations, and screaming at the screen in frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the connection I want to make.

I don\u0027t know the technical term for the problem in the VAB but it boils down to things that allow radial attachment of other parts to them sometimes don\u0027t themselves like to be radially attached to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build parallel towers in the VAB, you either need to connect the towers at the top or bottom instead of side by side (if using parts that won\u0027t radially attach) or make the side-to-side connections with parts that WILL radially attach AND have stack connectors as well (like fuel tanks), then stack the parts that won\u0027t radially attach on these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T17:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could build the lab as a subassembly, making sure the docking port is the root part. If you can\u0027t build it starting from the docking port, build it as you can and use the select root mod to change the root part. Be careful with it, though, as abusing it can corrupt the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
