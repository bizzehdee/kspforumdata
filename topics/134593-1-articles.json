I did one launch using a standard gravity turn and one launch going straight up at full throttle. And as stated, the \u0022standard\u0022 rocket could be a lot more efficient still, but I didn\u0027t want to bias the test so I made the first rocket slightly less efficient than it could be, and the second rocket had slightly less TWR than it could have.

In such a case\u00A0please point it out. In both cases the only mod installed was Engineer Redux, and I used that to get my TWR and deltaV readings, simply deducting the deltaV left from the starting total once I reached an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest 1: Using a gravity turn The Average Joe managed to get a M\u00FCn encounter with 621m/s left, for a total of 4,476m/s spent. Launching straight up while slightly ahead of the M\u00FCn, it had 198m/s left, meaning it used 4,899m/s to get there. In other words, it saved 8.6% deltaV by using a gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest 2: The Consumer of Fuel did it\u0027s gravity turn surprisingly well considering how dumb it is, and reached an encounter after spending 4,246m/s, leaving 915m/s in the tank. And as we suspected, it did even better launching straight up (using the same angle as the first test), with only 3,866m/s spent and 1,295m/s left in the tank. That\u0027s pretty much the same ammount of deltaV saved, but with reversed efficiency with launching straight up using 8.9% less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in comparison, it might appear that The Consumer of Fuel is the winner, because it\u0027s best result (straight up) needed 21.1% less deltaV than the best result (gravity turn) of The Average Joe.

Let\u0027s compare the crafts in raw numbers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to get it\u0027s 21.1% increase in deltaV efficiency, The Consumer of Fuel had to spend 340% more fuel, with 336% the mass, for 326% of the total cost compared to The Average Joe.

The maneuvre node should be placed on your orbit just where the Mun first becomes visible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow turn the map so you are looking down on the orbits, and drag the prograde pointer until you get an encounter - you should get one with around 800m/s, but it certainly won\u0027t be a very good one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow click the inside circle of the node and drag back and forth along the orbit until it gives an optimal encounter (i.e. the path marked as being within the Mun\u0027s influence is longest).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow mouse over the \u0022Mun periapsis\u0022 marker and add prograde to the maneuvre node until it gets very close - about 50km or even closer is ideal. Mouse over the Mun periapsis from time to time to check that it\u0027s actually decreasing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf ever it is not decreasing, click the centre circle again and drag gently back and forth until it looks closest (you should see a shadowy Mun next to the Mun periapsis marker).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWait until you\u0027re about 1 minute away from the node and burn precisely at the indicator. If your \u0022burn time\u0022 shows that it\u0027ll take less than a minute or two, stop burning and wait until you\u0027re about half that time away from the node.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T16:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome engines don\u0027t get full thrust right away, so the best idea is to set the launch clamps to release when you light the SRBs. \u00A0Start the main engines first, wait about 1 second and then light the SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T20:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like you have a heat shield on the lander can but I don\u0027t see a decoupler.\u00A0 If you make no other changes, at least add a decoupler between the Rockmax adapter and the 1.25m heat shield.\u00A0 Also, the Mk16-XL parachute should be enough, I don\u0027t think you need those radial parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
