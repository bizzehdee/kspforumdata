But what are some ways we can record our achievements? Flags are a good start, but you don\u0027t have to come back to put a flag down, which is substantially harder to do. The ability to recover your ships is nice but it doesn\u0027t write down what you recovered anywhere so that\u0027s no good either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my suggestion then: Allow space ships to get covered in various colors of dirt from being in the atmospheres or landing on other planets. Nothing like returning to kerbin in your reusable space plane covered in green dust from your awesome Jool aerobrake or having your landers be covered in streaks of variously covered dirt, proportional to how well you managed your landing! Or maybe you skidded to a stop in your rover and now it\u0027s covered in Duna-dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would add a lot to the game graphically, immersively, and just overall awesomeness. It\u0027s a great incentive to reuse your designs because now you can have a space plane covered with the dust of several different planets, how awesome is that!? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on your ship the dirt would gradually fade away, maybe leaving just a slight trace of color so your ship doesn\u0027t end up looking like a ball of mud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoomtrainInc","CreatedById":67379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this idea.
