I usually break my save game with constant mod installing and deleting long before I can develop a sensible progress, so I more look in missions as standalone, without any context, so after I get unmanned crafts to Eve and Duna back in 24.2, I thought I wouldn\u0027t do it ever again. Also I feel myself really constrained by current grindy Science and Career modes, so yeah, I play mostly Sandbox and try to roleplay things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I have motivation to put survey sats onto every planet and it\u0027s grandmother every time I start new savegame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other possible example is Asteroid Day mod (and I do think it should be stock!) with it\u0027s asteroid mapping processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also look forward for stock satellite telemetry (not sure if it counts as sandbox-rated science, but it really put more sense into unmanned missions in sandbox).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther possible sandbox-scientific activities could be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOther types of mapping (biomes, elevation, flatness)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESandbox MPL functionality (ability to rise precision of mapping results for the orbited body? even more precision with using surface examples?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think? Does KSP need more sciency things to do that are meaningful in Sandbox too?

It sounds promising but only way I can imagine on the spot is to bring special part (chem lab?) to the atmosphere/the ground. Other ideas sounds promising.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
