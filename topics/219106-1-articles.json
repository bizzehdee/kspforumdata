Example: \u003Cstrong\u003ESilicates\u003C/strong\u003E (which I treat as irl Metasilicates, SiO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E) exists in CRP but for very certain reasons, I want to also have \u003Cstrong\u003EQuartz\u003C/strong\u003E (SiO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E) and not use Silicates as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E output. I have access to, and understanding of molar mass and have made calculator spreadsheets for resource converters (using kilograms and using molar mass), and I\u0027d like my invented resources to be accurate and useful in those calculators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
