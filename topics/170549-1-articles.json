I\u0027ve actually used this method twice.

Somehow I lost it along the way. I had landed right next to my return ship, so I just switched focus and then switched back. The light was lit again and, after a few seconds, the contract completed. Not exactly F5/F9 that time, but AI think the concept is the same. Sometimes reloading the ship can get things back on track. If you\u0027re having an issue with a contract, I think it\u0027s always at least worth a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
