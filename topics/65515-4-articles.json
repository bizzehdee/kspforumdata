Mine has 2/3 legs on a girder attached directly to a tank, yours looks like it has 6 legs on girders attached to a radial decoupler. Radial decouplers are very weak, especially against shear forces. And no amount of struts can replace strong connections. (In my last image of my new ship, the top wobbled like crazy no matter how many struts I added. Then I added 6 docking ports on girders around the outside and no more problems.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI knew the decoupler was weak so I strutted the girders directly to the tanks.

I didn\u0027t aim for any particular spot aside from a dry one, and ended up about 950m ASL at a latitude of 42deg. It took a few quickload launches to sort out the details, like making sure my stages would fire at the same time they decoupled (I had so many stages to sort out when I stacked it on my launcher in the VAB, I gave up and decided to sort out the lander\u0027s stages once I made Eve orbit), as well as constantly throttling back to stay within 5% of terminal velocity then firewalling it at staging. The final \u0027Ah-ha!\u0027 was remembering that the most efficient ascent would pitchover onto a heading that was the same as my latitude, which is the best I could do since I didn\u0027t land at the equator (now that I think of it I may have been lucky that I started near 45deg, maybe I needed to pitchover to 90deg minus latitude. Hmmm).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I ended up in a 250km x 125km orbit with 750m/s to spare. My orbiting tug had to burn over 3km/s to match orbits, but that\u0027s no big deal, it had 11km/s available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, I cheated slightly by just using a Ext Command Seat. The lander massed 153 tons fully assembled, about 140 tons after dropping the landing gear and \u0027chute trusses. That doesn\u0027t include the drop tank that let me fire a few engines while the drogues opened, I then transferred fuel before dropping it. I ended up making a 28-point landing on top of the engine fairing at a leisurely 7m/s, luckily that didn\u0027t damage anything. I had 8 asparagused twin-\u0027spike SOB\u0027s on a Mainsail core, with an LVT-45 second stage and 48-7s top stage that had 1/3 of my total dV. No reaction wheels meant I had little control authority, especially when throttled down. It flew like a lawn dart; trajectory changes were gradual. Altogether I was at 740 parts on the launchpad, 280 of it the lander. The transfer tug launched separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my second mission to Eve, the first one failed horribly. But all it needed was MOAR STRUTS! Now I just have the routine task of returning to Kerbin with the science that I really have no need for. I also realized the drawback of doing the landing and ascent from a command seat: I could only do one EVA report and no crew reports. I suppose I could have put a lander can (2 for balance) on the landing trusses to stash reports in.

It helped launching from 900m ASL; I wonder how much dV that saved me. The outer SOB\u0027s feed the inner ones, which are asparagus-fed into the core.

In the end I found it much easier to just spend a bit of fuel on landing (my 300t lander has 12 drogues and 12 radial parachutes). I could land at 3 m/s, so the parachutes would put me to around 10 and then under 50m I\u0027d use the engines for a safe landing.
