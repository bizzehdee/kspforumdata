It\u0027s very small stress but if the connection is particularly weak and in wrong direction, it will bend. A ship docked to horizontally oriented docking port Jr will very likely not stay horizontal, for instance. But for docking ports oriented upwards and normal ships that should not mean any problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
