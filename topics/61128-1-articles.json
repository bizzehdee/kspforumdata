I\u0027ve got very good results from testing my KSE-1 spaceplane and now I\u0027m pushing it to the limits. I\u0027m going to try landing it on Duna. With Deadly Re-Entry. It was never desinged for this, although it does have a very high lift. Its dual nuclear engines give it a nice thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the mission so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tq32C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
