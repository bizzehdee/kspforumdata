I think a neat little add-on would be a small golden plaque you could attach to any section of any craft with your own message, written in the VAB. Maybe an explanation of Kerbal psychology on a probe headed out of Kerbol\u0027s SOI, or a little inspirational message on the descent stage of your Munar lander. Anyway, just a little idea I had.

They\u0027re just a fun little thing that you plant down somewhere just to show you were there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sure, they would take up a tiny bit of space, but not much more than, say, than the single solar panel squares. Probably less. I don\u0027t know about you, but I usually have at least that much space left on a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You know how when you inspect an already-planted flag, it says read, then it displays a golden plaque in a text box in front of you? That\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about when I say you write stuff on it. You\u0027d have to right click it to read, not try and read it from the part\u0027s texture itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
