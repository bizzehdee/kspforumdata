If that doesn\u2019t help, try checking the game files (if you got it through Steam) or uninstalling and reinstalling the game as you might just have a bad installation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T10:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also might just be your computer. \u00A0 My old laptop used to take 20-30 minutes to load up. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnough time to boot up KSP, cook dinner, and sit down with a plate of food to a fully loaded game. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy new rig only takes a couple minutes (if that) with a heavily modded game. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u2019ll need to confirm it\u2019s actually stick and just not loading really slowly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
