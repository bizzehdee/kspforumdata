That way, you can concentrate on working the camera and not on a gajillion things at once! I think that KSP needs that. It\u0027d make making cinematics easier.

Making a video you always want to capture different angles of the same action and it\u0027s a pain to have to re-fly whatever you\u0027re doing if you want to get a new angle on in. Not to mention keep things consistent between shots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
