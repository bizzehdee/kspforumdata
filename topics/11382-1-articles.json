The Minmus transfer was a failure necessitating a series of mid course burns to bring us to the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital insertion was aborted at the last minute as the pilots realised they were going to be orbiting in the opposite direction to the target ship, and in their panic they failed to take advantage of the oberth effect and had to burn more fuel than necessary to perform the turnaround into a new capture orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapture was performed manually, and the orbits were aligned, then the pilots couldn\\\u0027t figure out the mechjeb orbit syncing which was probably going to have problems with the eccentric orbits anyway. So the orbits were manually synced and the second stage was ditched on a minmus colliding trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was a case of flying slower than the orbit wanted the ship to fly using periodic radial burns to maintain altitude, and finally within 1km the rescue vehicle deployed its capture apparatus and final approach was intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the crew caught a good look at the stranded ship they realised that the stranded pilots hadn\\\u0027t jettisoned the final stage and were carrying more mass that was desired, so a quick exchange was needed to trigger the stage separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the rescue vehicle, the approach continued and initially was a slight miss, a second attempt was made and all things looked good until Danner Kerman realised he\\\u0027d been holding the mission plan upside down, which is very easy in space where concepts like \\\u0027up\\\u0027 and \\\u0027down\\\u0027 are subjective, the approach was coming in the direction needed for a retrograde de-orbit burn rather than the required direct boost burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, everything flipped around and on this third attempt contact was made, the pilots struggled to control the rotation the new capsule induced, becuase it was unable to land perfectly centered. You see the original plan had MechJeb doing a lot of work, and that needed a liquid engine for maneuvering it wasn\\\u0027t rated for flying via RCS, so that engine was sitting in the middle of the capture aparatus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was known to be a problem prior to launch but after consideration the engineers accepted this despite the drawbacks. In retrospect, mechjeb would be left behind for future rescue flights in this configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, having achieved contact the pilots checked that the orbital alignment was conducive to a return burn, and after Jeb yelled \\\u0027get on with it\\\u0027 over comms the RCS burn was initiated. The off center mass required a lot of control corrections to control the spin, but thankfully, the crew were able to enable MechJeb to control the spin, although this hardly qualified as a successful use of the system since the induced rotation was entirely due to the design compromises made to fit MechJeb in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 1.5 RCS tanks worth of fuel the 2 ships found themselves on a Kerbin return trajectory, and at t\u002B40:09:49:48 the bold pioneers, Bill, Bob and Jeb Kerman returned home after their ordeal\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T18:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERescue missions are the extreme challenge of KSP.
