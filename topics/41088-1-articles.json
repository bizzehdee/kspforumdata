Using mechjeb, docking struts, and many other mods, I proceeded to do this, only to learn that even with stabilizing struts, my ship cannot do anything. Worse yet, with even a single docking strut link, my ship starts spiraling out of control. I am now unable to build my behemoth, and I have nothing to do. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T05:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat parts compose the spine of the craft?

The wider spread the ports are the better, but getting things perfectly aligned when spreading the ports across a wide area can be challenging. If using a tricoupler or quad-coupler the ports are easier to align, but being so close together they do not provide as much resistance to wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T06:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on your definition of \u0027very long\u0027. You could try to pull your ship instead of pushing it. Alternatively, go through every part of the ship individually to see if there\u0027s any single piece that makes it act wonky. There are bugs that can result in phantom forces which will make your ship spin, if even a small component of your ship has that it\u0027ll end up spinning the whole ship. I had that happen on a recent mission where a small probe had some conflicting pieces (likely cubicstruts) and made the whole ship spin. Removed the probe and the rest of the ship was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T07:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis works fine for me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/%5B/color%5DniWAk#0%5Bcolor=%23333333%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
