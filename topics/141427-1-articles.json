If you look really really close, landing legs never come to rest. They vibrate vertically, and the vibration never ends ... never damps down. And in real life, if you vibrate a sloped surface, it will act frictionless. So the landing legs all vibrate their way down any hillside. There are many other things you can use in place of landing struts -- I like swept wings, and wing components, myself. Generally, they work a little better in the current version. It\u0027ll all get fixed eventually, and it\u0027ll be great. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T09:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s damping that\u0027s the issue would locking the suspension legs solve it?\u00A0Or retracting the legs after landing so they cushion and initial\u00A0impact but then you rest on superstructure to prevent sliding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0My workaround has been to make sure the door is facing up the slope so my Kerbonought can chase after it once he\u0027s planted his flag and got a surface sample \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T18:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve\u00A0tended to use landing gear rather than struts for a while now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have more crash tolerance, weigh less and you can put the Brakes and Friction Control settings to max to glue them to slopes when the brakes are on.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T04:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this is a 1.1.x issue.\u00A0 The legs are more \u0022slippery\u0022 than they used to be, rather comically so.\u00A0 I assume they\u0027re working on a fix, it\u0027s a pretty widespread problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
