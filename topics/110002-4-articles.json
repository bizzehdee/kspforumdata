Right now you can reenter pretty easiuly from a minmus trajectory with a command pod\u002Bparachute combo, this really should burn unless you make multiple braking passes without a shield on the bottom! i know 1.0.3 is planned, but we dont exactly know what will be in it and if whats in it will actually fix both the super ANNOYING mem leak as well as the aero that is arguable a little too much closer to 0.90\u0027s souposphere then i personally like. 1.0 was not perfect, heat was a tad over the top, and perhgaps the atmo was a hair too thin, but 1.0.2 felt like an overreaction that was too much of a decrease to heat and too much increase to drag.

This is no longer the case. Now, if you have two rigidbody objects, both mesh colliders have to be convex. At first glance, this seemed fine, as all our parts are already convex, and the terrain isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a rigidbody object, so it can still have a con-convex mesh. So all is good then\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 except asteroids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids are the one exception to this new convex collider rule. They have to be able to collide with other parts (for obvious reasons), and they also have to have rigidbodies, otherwise they wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be maneuverable. That put us in a bit of a quandary, because using a single convex hull around an asteroid is just not accurate enough. Asteroids can be very large, compared to spacecraft and Kerbals, and we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want objects hitting (or grappling on to) invisible walls over and around the rock surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe half expected we might run across problems like this, which is the reason why we couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t take this upgrade as a small job, or even estimate how long it would take. This one issue in particular did have a solution, which took two days to implement. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a piece of code I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m actually quite proud of, 700\u002B lines to procedurally generate solid collision geometry, and all it does is make asteroids behave no differently from before. It can be a thankless job sometimes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But it was a lot of fun to code, in a geeky, procedural-mesh-enthusiast kind of way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo would this lend itself to other uses within KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike say Surface features on the planets that could be interacted with like appear on the wish list all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore so I\u0027m thinking buildings around the space centre having more natural looking ground interactions that change with each upgrade.

This is no longer the case. Now, if you have two rigidbody objects, both mesh colliders have to be convex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one issue in particular did have a solution, which took two days to implement.

It can be a thankless job sometimes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But it was a lot of fun to code, in a geeky, procedural-mesh-enthusiast kind of way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Isn\u0027t it more logical to make asteroids procedural a bit, building them from multiple parts, each having a convex collider? It could affect performance a bit, but it could also add a bonus feature of partial/gradual destruction on impacts or reentry.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10 pages and noone reacts to the audio revamp?!? *weeeeeee*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes that mean Chatterer will get to be stock finally? my favourite and absolutely essential mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
