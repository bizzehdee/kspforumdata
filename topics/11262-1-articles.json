I know you guys worked weekends, long hours, and I am sure it was extremely stressful. \n\nHere is some specific positive feedback (sorry if I missed anyone):\n\n**Harvester**: You have been great at communicating the current state of patches, especially .15. I am very impressed with the patched Conics! There have been many maneuvers to the Mun and Minmun I wouldn\\\u0027t have been able to do without it.\n\n**C7**: Your blog has been amazing to follow, you are great at communicating! Please continue writing. The parts you created have been so much fun to use.\n\n**Jacob, Marco and Harvester**: The Space Plane Hanger Facility is really great! I like the animations in the background, it makes the facility feel alive.\n\n**Alex**: I downloaded .15 in about 5 minutes on patchday with no disconnects. ;D Thank you!!!\n\n**Mu**: I don\\\u0027t know what the Part Model Toolset is, but could someone chime in on what they like about this?\n\n**Daniel**: I also dont know what the Kerbal Model Setup is, can someone chime on what they like about this, too?\n\nI don\\\u0027t know who made Minmun but it\\\u0027s AWESOME!! I like how it is a challenge to find a good spot to land. Wonderful surprise. Could the community know who made it so we can give them positive feedback?\n\nPlease let the team know what you like about this patch. I would like this thread to have what people specifically enjoy about Squad\\\u0027s .15 patch!"},{"CreatedByName":"Resender","CreatedById":18274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T11:10:04Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve been waiting for this kind of game since I first got a computer back in 1995, so good job"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T11:16:16Z","Content":"The best thing is the wide range, when you let loose your fantasy you can imagine how much KSP can end up being useful for, it\\\u0027s mind-blowing, and when it gets there, it will be much bigger community wise, perhaps we can even reach an early minecraft stage of attention."},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T13:12:23Z","Content":"I love the spaceplane hangar so much, and I\\\u0027m warming to the Patched Conics display now that I\\\u0027ve worked out how to use it.

Furthermore they can now specify multiple colliding objects for one part. So things like bay doors become possible.

Here are three features that brought me the most of fun in 0.15:\n\n***-Space Plane Hangar***. Bilateral symmetry, incidence/dihedron angles fine tuning (\u003Cshift \u002B=\u0022\u0022 wasdqe=\u0022\u0022\u003E keys) and trims finally allowed me to build a \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Estable airplane.

Wheeeee-he, slingshots rock! A couple of \\\u0027em and you\\\u0027re out of Solar system! I doubt I could ever perform a *single* slingshot maneuver without a patched conics display. 8) \n\n***-Part Tools***. Yep, mainly the normal mapping support. Twice as much details in my future models... *with twice as less efforts* ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) (\\\u0027cause imitating a surface structure with generic *Diffuse* shader was a real pain in the butt; *Bumped* shaders allow for much easier solutions).\n\nThanks guys! :thumbup:"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T20:43:39Z","Content":"I feel the desire to join this cheering section.

The patched conics system is also good. \n\nA tip, to everyone, go into the settings text file in your KSP folder, and change the patched conics patch number to 3-4. That way you not only get to see the next path, but the path after that. in other words, you can see in real time how a munar flybly will actually effect your orbit after the fact. Really neat."}]}
