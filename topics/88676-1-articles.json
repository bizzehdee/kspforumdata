Has anyone else ever run into this problem or have an idea of what might be causing it? My first part used multiple meshes as well but worked fine, I have tried deleting some of the meshes and reimporting it to see if I hit some kind of cap on the number of separate meshes however that still didn\u0027t make the engine body mesh show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IGRqQya.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IGRqQya.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nIyRK4e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nIyRK4e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolved: Joining the Engine Body Mesh(which wasn\u0027t showing up in Unity) to the Attachment Plate Mesh (which was showing up in Unity) in Blender and then importing the .blend file again fixed the issue.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
