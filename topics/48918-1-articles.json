Whether I\u0027ve got a Kerbal in the 1-man Gemini, the three man pod, or the two man can, it can store one copy of any given sample or EVA report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reason we couldn\u0027t expand that to be one copy for each kerbal it can hold? Ie, if I send a three man pod to the Mun, each one of the crew can store their own sample and eva report without walking miles to get different regions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin Von Braun","CreatedById":67234,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T15:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like that would only matter for the crew report, a sample\u0027s a sample\u0027s a sample, if it comes from the same place its worth the same amount. However I could definitely see different kerbals having different views on EVA or inside-the-craft reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T17:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that a sample is a sample is a sample. However, there IS a difference between 10kg of mun rock and 50kg of mun rock, especially when you plan to recover them. I wouldn\u0027t mind if the samples decayed as if you\u0027d went and recovered three times, but I think there should be a way to reflect that your three-man lander can simply hold more dirt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
