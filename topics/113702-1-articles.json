In KSP, liquid fuel \u002B oxydizer are a much denser form of energy storage than batteries, by a ratio of either 8 or 4 depending on whether you compare LFO to small batteries or to the 4k variant. But whether this ratio is enough to compensate the extra mass and complexity of lugging fuel cells and tankage around, versus the operational simplicity of batteries, may depend on the use context. Let\u0027s find out !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFO converted to electricity by a fuel cell is 80,000 energy / ton\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatteries hold less: 10,000 (small batteries) or 20,000 (Z-4k) energy / ton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, batteries are not constrained by power requirement, whereas fuel cells only output 30 (fuel cell) or 75 (array) energy/second for each additional ton. This means that, in the energy-intensive uses found in KSP, which are ion propulsion and ore drilling \u002B ore conversion, the extra output-constrained mass may obviate the better density edge of fuel cells, in some contexts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, in ion propulsion you need 94414 energy to expend an entire PB-750 Xenon tank. That amounts to 4,8 tons of Z-4k batteries (96k charge), or 1.18 ton of LFO, which is 1.31 ton of actual tankage. But then you need at least 6 fuel cells or half a fuel cell array to power a single ion engine at full thrust from LFO, for a total of 1.5 or 1.6 ton, and that is still ahead of batteries. You may use lower throttle settings off a single fuel cell for better efficiencies, but that lowers a LOT the already paltry TWR of the whole contraption. Smaller Xenon tanks require the same power (and same mass of fuel cell) but less LFO/battery mass, so there is a balance point at which batteries become more efficient: this tipping point is at 197 Xenon, which is less than half of the smallest tank in the game. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you have no power source to recharge the batteries, in ion propulsion the fuel cells \u002B LFO will beat batteries everytime.\u003C/strong\u003E IF you do have some form of external power (solar panel / RTG) then you might recharge batteries between two maneuvers, in which case you\u0027d have to calculate how high a deltaV this precise amount of 197 Xe would give your ship, and how it compares to the deltaV maneuvering you\u0027re planning to need at most, in order to decide between batteries and fuel cells. FYI that\u0027s equivalent to 96 seconds of ion thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo recap:\u003C/strong\u003E if all your maneuvering will always be done in less than 96 seconds of ion thrust, you should favor big batteries, or else use fuel cells and a LFO tank containing about 20 times less LFO units than you have of Xenon (1 Round8 for each PB150, 1 FLT200 \u002B 1 Round8 for evey PB750, and so on). Simply said, \u003Cstrong\u003Eif your TWR times 96 seconds is more than the maximum amount of deltaV you\u0027ll need in any single maneuver, go with batteries, otherwise go with cells.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOre drilling and processing is more energy intensive: 15 energy/sec per drill and double that for conversion of a single unit worth of fuel (1 LFO is 0.005 ton, 1 monoprop is 0.004 ton). The thing is, with an ISRU the fuel cells basically become rechargeable. According to wiki data, mining 0.5 ore yields 1 LFO unit, at a total energy cost of anywhere between 12 and 6000 energy for mining, and 30 energy on top of that for conversion. The same unit of LFO gives off 400 energy once converted by a fuel cell. This means that you can only \u0022refuel at a profit\u0022, energy-wise, using a level 3\u002B (advised 4 or 5) engineer off a moon (assuming ~5% ore concentration) operating a single drill, or one unmanned drill off an asteroid (75% or better ore concentration). In these conditions, battery size is meaningless and fuel cells must instead be compared with whatever panel and RTG setup you may consider in their place (and applying the squared distance from Kerbol to your panel output, using Kerbol-Kerbin distance as unit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo recap: if your mining conditions clear the thresholds above (\u0026lt;400 energy per half unit of ore mined) go with fuel cells, otherwise you will need panels or RTGs.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you see any mistake in the maths above please let me know \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T13:38:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame as real life, isn\u0027t it ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T14:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t get a word.
