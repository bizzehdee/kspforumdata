I\u0027m sure this one\u0027s been answered loads of times before now, but y\u0027all know how whacked out the forum search function has been for...well, forever. It\u0027s been a while since I had a question I needed to ask anyways...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so here\u0027s the sitrep: I\u0027ve got a Class E asteroid headed to a 2.3 million meter Apoapsis in about six days. It\u0027s already in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I\u0027d like to try to capture the thing. This would be the first time I try to capture a rock (let alone one of that size class), so I\u0027m thinking I just want to do something simple and try to put it into a stable orbit. I\u0027ve got about 2,000,000 funds. Heaviest engine I\u0027ve got unlocked is the Mainsail, I\u0027ve got the Claw and NERVAs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main question - how much delta-V should I plan for, and roughly how much thrust should I plan for the payload? What kind of mass should I expect a Class E to have anyways? For that matter, is there anything that lists out the range of masses of each type of asteroid (i.e. Class A is X tonnes to Y tonnes, Class B is W tonnes to Z tonnes, etc.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask mainly because I have a Class C on a collision course in a little over a month, and I\u0027d like to try to avoid it landing on somebody\u0027s rear bumper if at all possible...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done the first tutorial (and I went ahead and docked with the rock), I\u0027ve got loads of experience with rendezvous and docking and I understand the mechanics involved with all the piloting, so I\u0027m mainly asking for design help here, but any help y\u0027all can offer would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-04T13:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2014 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Echanged thread status to \u0026quot;awesome\u0026quot;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T08:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESix days from periapsis?

Six days is not as much time as would be ideal, but it could work if you get there quickly enough with a very large rocket. Some simple math shows that it can\u0027t be traveling more than about 175 m/sec right now. A delta-v of maybe 10-20 m/sec might be enough if applied very soon in the optimal direction (use maneuver nodes to explore which direction accomplishes the most). But hurry, before it speeds up much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Just use rockets to slow it down enough to capture it into an elliptical orbit around Kerbin (i.e. so it\u0027s not on an escape trajectory anymore). This will take about 35-40 m/s of delta-v if you do the burn exactly at periapsis (to maximize Oberth Effect), if I\u0027ve guessed your orbital parameters right. So if the asteroid weighs 5000 tons and you have a 50-ton rocket, the rocket needs to have about 4000 m/s of delta-v without the asteroid attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Do a combo of (1) and (2). Get something out to the asteroid right now to lower the periapsis as much as possible, even if you can\u0027t do enough to aerocapture. Then, do a second push at periapsis to slow it down and capture into an elliptical orbit. By lowering the periapsis, you will greatly enhance the speed at periapsis and thereby greatly enhance your Oberth Effect benefit when you do your periapsis burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps and good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-03T22:55:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2014 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T13:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your advice, y\u0027all; I can report that I was successful in my efforts to put the rock into a stable orbit around Kerbin.
