As for the exploding jeb, was there something placed on the capsule near the hatch? or maybe the capsule was glitching through the terrain due to low terrain settings and jeb collided with the terrain? Or maybe jeb just got too happy and exploded due to overjoy, completing his first munar orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deanak","CreatedById":119017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T04:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

When I started playing KSP and walked away like 20m from my ship I just heard *puff* and my Kerbal.. Exploded?
