I will have to come back to it later. I am trying to put a rover on the Mun with a skycrane and I have had about 10 failed launches in a row. Last time I almost made it but the mainsail overheated and exploded while in map view. I don\u0027t know if my rocket would have enough oomph if I throttled back for those last few seconds before I circularize.
