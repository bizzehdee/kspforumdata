I\u0027d seen some great vid\u0027s on \u0027you tube\u0027 and thought that i\u0027d love to try it out.\n\nI\u0027ve made two flights so far, one suborbital and the other tonight got into a 390 mile orbit, not quite what i was planning but wow never the less! \n\nI have an interest in engineering both areonautic and space and i\u0027m a model maker two so assembling da bitz is no problem for me.\n\nNow i need to work on much wider trajectories (tonight was straight up and almost straight back down again) and practicing steering the stack.\n\nHere\u0027s to saving up for the full game, btw i can\u0027t find it anywhere but steam and that at \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A329.99, and nowhere else not even Amazon, anybody seen it elsewhere?\n\nsee you up there."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:48:53Z","Content":"Go to [www.kerbalspaceprogram.com](www.kerbalspaceprogram.com), you can buy it there.
