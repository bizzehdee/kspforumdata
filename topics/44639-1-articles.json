I have nothing to show for it but space junk. I would love for there to be a way for kerbals to take pictures and collect samples from the planet to bring back. These pictures and samples could then be viewed in a museum that serve as a testament of your accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be expanded to have a camera part that could be added to sattelites and rovers to enable them to take pictures as well. I know I could do this documenting manually using screen captures but it seems more exciting when the pictures are taken by kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that this isn\u0027t seen as simply being the already requested \u0027more cameras\u0027 feature. This feature is more about giving your space program a history and a legacy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing a game developer I understand a museum is not a simple thing to add to the game, but if this is a feature the developers think is worth adding I would love to see it added piece by piece over the releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T00:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested and actually the developers have even mentioned a KSP museum as a potential feature to showcase your achievements in the future. I think it\u0027s still a maybe, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they did add the museum at some point. First will be the knowledgebase, though...which is kind of like an interactive encyclopedia you seem to access from the map view. I suppose you\u0027ll be filling that out with science data and what-not. Maybe. I don\u0027t know \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, Harvester mentioned something about camera arrays once, though it might\u0027ve just been him thinking out loud about something modders could make. He seems to think out loud sometimes. But I\u0027d love to see a little handheld(or chest-mounted, like real life) cameras for missions and such. I\u0027d even be okay with placing cameras or having them on probes, even using probe cameras in place of an IVA view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut such things have indeed been suggested before. Let\u0027s just hope the developers like them enough to implement them into the vanilla experience at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"awsomejwags","CreatedById":105043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T06:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a fixed camera mod. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hullcam-vds/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hullcam-vds/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
