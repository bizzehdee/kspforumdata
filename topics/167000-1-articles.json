Many of them were emperors or dictators at one point that simply faded with the passage of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously the big ones stayed. Jool, Eve and Duna, lesser gods like Vall and Bop. Some others. Those last two weren\u0027t even mythological idols. Even Duna isn\u0027t really a god, is he? Something, something Roman general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s one in particular... Eeloo. In the big black book it says he was born from the remains of Eve\u0027s failed creations, a husk of a soul with a broken skeleton. A keeper of order, the judge of where souls wander to in the afterlife. It says right here, III Iaelohn 5:49,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The sir who holds the souls neither pure \u0027r rotten, Iaelohn. Hail that Light, f\u0027r his arms hold the balance of worlds! Hail that Light, f\u0027r that Light holds the sky to the ground, the silver disk to the sky, and the minty dough hence from our mouths! Hail Iaelohn, for his contempt f\u0027r life wilt bringeth the end of the world in many far years!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaken out of context, it sounds really bad. Honestly, I\u0027m not understating it when I say that virtually every other god threatened to destroy the world or the universe or some realm nobody could care less about. So, what\u0027s the point? Shouldn\u0027t we check the calendar? What is today\u0027s date? What year even is it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
