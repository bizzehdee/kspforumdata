Do you mean that you are on a debate team, or do you mean \u0022future arguments\u0022 with family or neighbors or friends or classmates or coworkers or just anonymously online? If its the former, an image will always be secondary to your debate skills. If its the latter, arguing will never prove anything. However, people who discuss things in earnest will be willing to listen (and this must \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E true for people who have opposite points of view too). This implies a respect for each other\u0027s viewpoints also. Unless a discussion environment possesses both showing respect and being willing to listen to the opposite point of view, there will be no teaching or proving anything to anyone, regardless of point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since you are sharing a resource which you find useful and are seeking yet another more complete one, I prefer this reference page at Wikipedia; its a small but comprehensive collection of graphs and charts.
