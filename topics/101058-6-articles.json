The waterz are in a 60 degree cliff face...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe availability of resources is thus determined by the root of the whole base rather than the location of the drill on the base (may be a decent request for a Regolith change). The plus side is that so long as you\u0027re recycling water you don\u0027t actually need to grab new water so you can truck it in instead of KAS\u0027ing the drill platform to your base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach civilian kerbal consumes 1kg of water per day. You need to match their consumption in recyclers/farms. Each newly born kerbal will expend 105kg worth of food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically to maintain a colony of 100 kerbals you\u0027ll need a minimum of 1 metric ton of water and food so long as recyclers are active. This works out to 2 of the biosphere farms or 2 of the biodome farms. The biodomes provide for a population of 60 each, so 2 farms are needed in this colony. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you expect a colony to grow from a population of 50 to a population of 100 you\u0027ll need\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Enough farms to supply the 100 population\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- an extra 5.25 tons of food (50 * .105) for each kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fully stocked biosphere farm (the large one) has if i recall 15 tons worth of food available (im at work so I don\u0027t have the configs in front of me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resource conversion path is a simple one: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esubstrate to biomass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebiomass to food\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efood to waste\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewaste to biomass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater is used during the substrate to biomass and biomass to food production and is consumed directly by the kerbals, producing waste water at each step. The water is not consumed when a new kerbal is born. I could have split up the mass between the two but I assume that some part of water is in the food to keep the system easy enough to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically while mining water is necessary at the start of base you\u0027ll rarely have to get new water once it\u0027s operational. You\u0027ll need substrate (the extractor is on the laser drill) to grow new biomass for food. Substrate is pretty much everywhere.

This guide will help you build in situ biodomes of all kinds. If you plan to launch and land a biodome then you don\u0027t really need this.
