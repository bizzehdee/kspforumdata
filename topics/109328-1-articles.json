My designs yesterday were completely unable to break mach 1 on airbreathing mode. I have some ideas now on how to streamline the designs, but I do wonder: Has anyone been able to go SSTO spaceplane or even super/hypersonic with MkIII parts? Almost all the SSTO spaceplane designs I\u0027ve seen so far use MkII parts. And that makes sense: they\u0027re streamlined, flat and pointy and create a ton less drag. But I do wonder: can we still efficiently push stuff into orbit with MkIII parts and is it worth it?\n\nFor the most part, staged rockets seem vastly superior, but I\u0027m not giving up on my spaceplanes!\n\nI do so like it when my spaceships have wings ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:07:58Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119655-Yet-another-mk3-SSTO-UPDATE?p=1925036\u0026viewfull=1#post1925036](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119655-Yet-another-mk3-SSTO-UPDATE?p=1925036\u0026viewfull=1#post1925036)\n\nEven VTOL SSTO:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121328-Mk3-VTOL-SSTO-with-rotating-engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121328-Mk3-VTOL-SSTO-with-rotating-engines)\n\nI think you should forget the \u0027super heavy\u0027 part of your idea. A medium sized Mk3 seems to work pretty well, but anything larger than what I built has substantially more drag so also needs more (jet) thrust. There is no way to add these engines in an aesthetically nice way except if you want to double-clip engines or stuff like that...\n\n4 Rapiers and 2 turbojets seems to be the sweet spot for me, and that limits the craft weight to about 70 tons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T09:13:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris\\_2**"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:12:36Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nyes, it\u0027s hard. I kinda stacked 12 or 14 (can\u0027t remember) Reapers together. I used as few parts as possible to reduce drag and part count (my cpu...). I used the big wings as fuel reserves to reduce fuselage fuel tank count. In the end, i had a craft with a big cargo bay that could deliver a brown fuel tank equipped with RCS and docking port to be used as a refuelling station. I made it barely to orbit and back to KSC, but i am yet to touch down safely. Almost made it yesterday, but the balancing of the COG is very tricky once the very heavy payload is missing.\n\nHere\u0027s the basic build:\n\nI use the Big-S Delta wings instead of horizontal stabilizers at the back with a big elevon as control surface, the big Boeing-Style main wings right in front of them, and an assembly of basic wing parts to balance centre of lift. One of these basic wings was tilted a little bit to provide extra front lift (like a fixed pitch elevon). So you need 8-10 main wing sections, 4-5 on each side. Your milage may vary. The most important thing is to balance the lift in such a way so you don\u0027t have to pull a lot back to pitch up. Pulling up means your back elevons provide negative lift, your AOA will rise and so will your drag. you want to face all parts as straight as possible in the airflow.\n\nNow for the flight profile, and that\u0027s as important as everything else: The main trick is to break the sound barrier and to get the Rapiers to run at their optimum efficiency.\n\nAfter liftoff, which should occur after 2/3 of the runway or before, pull up to 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. You should accelerate to about 280\u002B m/s while climbing to 10.000 metres.\n\nAt 10.000 metres, enable PROGRADE SAS. That\u0027s very important, because by doing so, you minimize drag. Your craft now should fly ballistic and pitch down. At 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, or maybe -5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, enable attitude hold SAS so you don\u0027t lose too much altitude. If your Reapers are not able to push you beyond the sound barrier now and accelerate further, go back to the drawing board.\n\nOnce the sound barrier lies behind you, gently (!) pull back to pitch up to around 15-20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and raising, maybe a little more (depends). Climb to 20.000, controlling throttle so you don\u0027t risk a flameout. Try to achieve at least 20-25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch at 25.000 metres, when the Rapiers start to fade out. Make sure your have plenty of speed right now, at least 1200 m/s. If you have less than 1000, your climb was too steep. If you melt before your reach 25.000, your climb was too shallow. \n\nYour fuel should balanced in a way that you have slightly more liquid fuel that oxidizer left when you switch Rapier modes. Switch modes at 25.000, pitch 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002B and 1200 m/s\u002B, when the Rapiers fall below 50kN thrust or when your craft starts to decelerate. Try not to pull too much AOA between 25.000 and 35.000 to minimize drag, but don\u0027t let your nose fall below 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. Your goal is to raise apoapsis to 80.000, cruise through the atmosphere and circularize as usual.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:13:21Z","Content":"MK III parts are no different to MK II. You also just need to apply the old rule of thumb that one Rapier/ Ramjet can lift around 10 tons, depending on your design even more. \n\nYou can get up to a 30% payload fraction with an SSTO spaceplane and also haul big landers or mining rigs into LKO. \n\nI wouldn\u0027t build an MK III plane to go far beyond LKO, because you could easily build a smaller vessel with an LV-N or Ions to go further and carry it inside the cargo bay.\n\nTry not to use the big airplane wings that can only stand 1200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 heat, they will always be at the edge of collaps going in or out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe Rapiers have a weak spot right around 320 to 360 m/s, where you seem to be stuck and reached a point where you cannot go higher and faster at the same time.\n\nYou need to level or dive at 12 to 15 km height and get over 400 m/s, pull up to 10 to 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and let the rapiers \u0022load up\u0022 to 350- 400 kN of thrust.

In the end, for that one, I simply removed the engine, closed the fairing, and then put the engine back on, so it sort of clipped through the fairing... I hope I still get the drag reduction. My next version (which carried more liquid fuel, and had a FL-T100 instead of FL-T400 tank on the center LV-T45), I was able to close the fairing... its pretty frustrating.\n\nIn both these designs in this post, you\u0027ll notice center engines attached to the rear of the payload. They are not part of the payload. Instead, the payload is released, and then the center engine redocks up front where the payload previously attached.\n\nIn the large design, its a cluster of LV-Ns that shifts forward.\n\nIn the smaller design, its a LV-T45\n\nThis also helps solve a common design problem: Engines at the back lead to tail heavy designs when the fuel tanks are empty.\n\nShifting some engines forward definitely helps.\n\nI don\u0027t like that nuclear tug solution, because it seems a bit inefficient to me: It takes up cargo space (meaning more dry mass needed to extend the cargo bay), and its dead weight for most of the flight.\n\nMy LV-Ns are lit as soon as the jet thrust cant maintain my speed and climb rate.\n\nWhy wait until one is suborbital, with very little dV left, to use the nukes?\n\nThe earlier they are used, the more you benefit from them. As soon as my LV-T45s fire, or the rapiers go to closed cycle, I want my Nukes firing."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T12:17:44Z","Content":"A small but very useful MkIII for FAR:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

And with the sort of loads that this is intended to haul, nuke burns are painfully slow.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T13:54:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:06:31Z","Content":"Meh...\n\nIt can\u0027t lift the train components, so its just a SSTO tug with inefficient engines.\n\nI think your earlier design which has LV-Ns is better for that purpose.\n\nLong burn times? slap on more LV-Ns.\n\nSure they are heavy, but compared to the train mass, its fine.\n\nA lot of LV-Ns aren\u0027t good on a spaceplane? then make a dedicated space tug that gets refueled by spaceplanes...\n\nI just don\u0027t see the point of a SSTO tug, when the rest of the stuff isn\u0027t SSTO\u0027d, and the tug has poor vacuum dV."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:27:51Z","Content":"Well, there\u0027s also the point that if you can build one of these, you can also build a cargo SSTO capable of lifting the train segments.\n\nIf you were really attached to the idea of nukes, you could probably strap another pair of engines outside the lateral tanks; tuck them into the gap between the RAPIERs and put angled long nosecones on the front to blend them in to the structure. Put \u0027em on intercoolers to help control the heat.
