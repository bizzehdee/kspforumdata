My designs yesterday were completely unable to break mach 1 on airbreathing mode. I have some ideas now on how to streamline the designs, but I do wonder: Has anyone been able to go SSTO spaceplane or even super/hypersonic with MkIII parts? Almost all the SSTO spaceplane designs I\u0027ve seen so far use MkII parts. And that makes sense: they\u0027re streamlined, flat and pointy and create a ton less drag. But I do wonder: can we still efficiently push stuff into orbit with MkIII parts and is it worth it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, staged rockets seem vastly superior, but I\u0027m not giving up on my spaceplanes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do so like it when my spaceships have wings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119655-Yet-another-mk3-SSTO-UPDATE?p=1925036\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1925036\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119655-Yet-another-mk3-SSTO-UPDATE?p=1925036\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1925036\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven VTOL SSTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121328-Mk3-VTOL-SSTO-with-rotating-engines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121328-Mk3-VTOL-SSTO-with-rotating-engines\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you should forget the \u0027super heavy\u0027 part of your idea.

I kinda stacked 12 or 14 (can\u0027t remember) Reapers together. I used as few parts as possible to reduce drag and part count (my cpu...). I used the big wings as fuel reserves to reduce fuselage fuel tank count. In the end, i had a craft with a big cargo bay that could deliver a brown fuel tank equipped with RCS and docking port to be used as a refuelling station. I made it barely to orbit and back to KSC, but i am yet to touch down safely. Almost made it yesterday, but the balancing of the COG is very tricky once the very heavy payload is missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the basic build:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the Big-S Delta wings instead of horizontal stabilizers at the back with a big elevon as control surface, the big Boeing-Style main wings right in front of them, and an assembly of basic wing parts to balance centre of lift. One of these basic wings was tilted a little bit to provide extra front lift (like a fixed pitch elevon). So you need 8-10 main wing sections, 4-5 on each side. Your milage may vary. The most important thing is to balance the lift in such a way so you don\u0027t have to pull a lot back to pitch up. Pulling up means your back elevons provide negative lift, your AOA will rise and so will your drag. you want to face all parts as straight as possible in the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the flight profile, and that\u0027s as important as everything else: The main trick is to break the sound barrier and to get the Rapiers to run at their optimum efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter liftoff, which should occur after 2/3 of the runway or before, pull up to 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. You should accelerate to about 280\u002B m/s while climbing to 10.000 metres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10.000 metres, enable PROGRADE SAS. That\u0027s very important, because by doing so, you minimize drag. Your craft now should fly ballistic and pitch down. At 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, or maybe -5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, enable attitude hold SAS so you don\u0027t lose too much altitude. If your Reapers are not able to push you beyond the sound barrier now and accelerate further, go back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the sound barrier lies behind you, gently (!) pull back to pitch up to around 15-20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and raising, maybe a little more (depends). Climb to 20.000, controlling throttle so you don\u0027t risk a flameout. Try to achieve at least 20-25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch at 25.000 metres, when the Rapiers start to fade out. Make sure your have plenty of speed right now, at least 1200 m/s. If you have less than 1000, your climb was too steep. If you melt before your reach 25.000, your climb was too shallow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour fuel should balanced in a way that you have slightly more liquid fuel that oxidizer left when you switch Rapier modes. Switch modes at 25.000, pitch 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002B and 1200 m/s\u002B, when the Rapiers fall below 50kN thrust or when your craft starts to decelerate. Try not to pull too much AOA between 25.000 and 35.000 to minimize drag, but don\u0027t let your nose fall below 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. Your goal is to raise apoapsis to 80.000, cruise through the atmosphere and circularize as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMK III parts are no different to MK II.
