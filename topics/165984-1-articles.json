The idea was to simulate the pushing of a stock propeller on an airframe using a jet engine. Just in the same way a prop-shaft is restrained to the airframe of a stock plane or helicopter by a bearing, a jet engine would be restrained to the airframe of a Mallard by a \u201Ccage\u201D once again composed of cubic struts. The idea being\u00A0that a\u00A0jet engine would stand in for\u00A0a propeller shaft. If the collision effects ignore Newton\u2019s 2nd and 3rd laws in the way Geoschosskopf theorized, then a jet held in a cage should make the plane move much faster than one directly attached to the plane, because the jet engine doesn\u2019t realize that it is pushing the big heavy plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rUHjW2h.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rUHjW2h.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nI didn\u2019t take many pictures of this one because I didn\u2019t have an autopilot installed to allow me to hold a certain altitude precisely, so as to be able to quantitatively measure the performance of the plane.\u00A0 However I testify that it performed nearly if not exactly the same when the engines were decoupled and trapped in the cages as when they were still directly connected to the plane.\u00A0 The only difference was that with the decoupled engines, I could not reduce throttle for landing afterwards.\u00A0 Good thing the Mallard was a seaplane! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Another experiment I proposed, but did not perform, was to attach a 5 ton trailer to a 3 ton rover using a stock pin-in-hole joint. If the collision physics work correctly, the setup should behave exactly like what it is. A rover pulling a heavy trailer, with all the associated performance losses.\u00A0 However if the collision physics are wonky, the rover should still have the same performance as if it were driving on its own, and pull the trailer along as if it is nothing.\u00A0 I\u2019m guessing the people I see on here building semi trucks every now and then that a truck most definitely is affected by carrying a trailer behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 So, the collision physics didn\u2019t seem to be the root of the problem, so another idea came up. That was that KSP didn\u2019t know how to properly get the thrust of a stock propeller, however this was quickly disproved by the point that a propeller is quite literally a number of wings moving a circle. KSP doesn\u2019t have to do anything to find the thrust of a propeller or lift of a rotor that it doesn\u2019t have to do to find the lift of a plane going into a slip-turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 So then there was my hypothesis that the 1EC = 1kJ standard was incorrect.
