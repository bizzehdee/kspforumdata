The most likely candidate to have a working update is the fork with the commit graph that extents right the most. Just click on the last node in that graph (usually labeled \u0022master\u0022) and Github will take you to the corresponding commit view page on the fork\u0027s repository. There, just click on the \u0022\u003C\u003E Code\u0022 tab to get to the main view, and there click the sub-tab \u0022Release(s)\u0022. Sometimes, there are no releases in the repository. Then there\u0027s usually a \u0022GameData\u0022 or \u0022Output\u0022 folder in the repository containing the release folder structure you need to put into GameData.
