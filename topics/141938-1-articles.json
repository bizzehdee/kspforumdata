Here is a screen where you see an aircraft built for Eve. it is balanced properly CL being a little bit behind CG.\u00A0The tank behind with its speed brakes is for retrograde braking and\u00A0acts like a pendulum for atmosphere entry in prograde while the front shield protects the whole ship. Then between 30 and 10km I eject all and the plane flies by itself but if you look at the screen you can see that pitch is up and stab and ailerons have moved the wrong side (moving down when pitch indicator is up), they are inverted and i think it\u0027s because when the tank is behind the aircraft the CG of the whole thing is behind the CL.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=924097screenshot347.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022924097screenshot347.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/924097screenshot347.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when i launch my plane in space when coming back to Kerbin, as soon as it is release from the tank, flight controls are inverted.\u00A0\u00A0You can see there is a remote control unit on the tank and if you select \u0022control from here\u0022 that solves the pitch issue when you release you craft from the tank, but the ailerons are still inverted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInactivating the flight controls have no effect on issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you experienced this inversion when launching a plane on top of rockets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what is the purpose of the tab \u0022deploy direction\u0022 = normal or inverted?

If the CoM of the entire vessel is in front of the surfaces, then they deflect in one direction. If the CoM is behind the surfaces, then they deflect the other way. So the fact that you have all this other stuff attached to the plane is affecting the CoM (moving it way back), and that is flipping your control surfaces while you are trying to test them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry placing\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ejust the airplane part\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0on the runway, and see if the surfaces work correctly then.

Ack! Sorry, I guess I didn\u0027t read your initial post closely enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe deploy thing can be used for flaps, or it can be used in other situations to force a\u00A0control surface to \u0022full on\u0022. Inverted forces it to \u0022full reverse\u0022. But you basically can\u0027t control the surface anymore when\u00A0\u0022deploy\u0022 is active, so that won\u0027t help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other possibility for dealing with inverted controls is the \u0022authority\u0022 slider in the context menu, which may be the answer to your problem.

But you can get some spooky effects if you have a surface that controls more than one thing -- both pitch and roll, for example. So you may also have to disable some axes on some control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pretty much always launch planes on top of rockets. But my planes are all canard designs. So after they come off the top of the rockets, the canards are still at the front and the controls all still work the same way as they did during launch.
