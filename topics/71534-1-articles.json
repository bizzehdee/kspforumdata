I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while now but I have never been able to get from to kerbin to Laythe with a stock rocket. I am trying to take all I need with me and I follow the moto \u0022go big or go home\u0022. So I started out with a small lander for Laythe and one thing led to the other and now I have a huge rover that can cross laythes oceans, a ton of science instruments plus a six manned lander (in total, everything weighs 220tons). So I have been wondering, what is the best kind of engine that could give this ride to Laythe. I would also have to be able to bring back 90 tons to kerbin. I have a design that might work but it is so slow that the burn takes 2 hours and I still can\u0027t manage to get it in an orbit that\u0027s higher than 75 km. Can anyone help me? Is it even possible to do this? How much Delta-V would it require? How much fuel?
