Considering KSP has broken into full release, it could really go anywhere from here. Would you be interested in seeing station parts? Or more capsules? Perhaps 5 metre rockets for those crazy buggers who want to do single launches.\n\nPersonally, I would like larger and more diverse capsules, specifically a 3.75m Command Service Module and associated parts such as crew container, science lab, monoprop tank, reaction wheel, yada yada.
