Laythe is a pain, mostly because Jool is cruel mistress. If this were an FPS, Jool has racked up enough kills across all my saves ever to get the chopper gunner, the warthog, and almost the tactical nuke. (thats about 20 confirmed kills total, not to mention the dozens of probes that have been eaten as well)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:25:50Z","Content":"My gosh I love Laythe!\n\nThat place rocks!\n\nGO LAYTHE!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T16:46:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"Macdaddy42","CreatedById":145262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:44:01Z","Content":"That was a goddang amazing metaphor and ja Laythe is smexy"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:02:01Z","Content":"That would easily be the time when I probed every body in the Jool system, back in 0.18.
