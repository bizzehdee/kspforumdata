In my own designs, I calculated how much fuel would be burned by SRB separation, and looked at where the CoM was at that point when the SRBs detached. That became the \u0022full\u0022 CoM, so the average CoM was between that and the dry CoM. I then minimized the thrust torque on the average CoM by tilting the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve found that moving the tank up results in a smaller overall change in thrust torque (because it causes the CoM shift in a straighter line along the engines\u0027 thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then minimized thrust torque for the first part of the flight by following a similar procedure (except that the \u0022empty\u0022 CoM is when the SRBs burn out). I set the fuel levels to the midpoint between launch and SRB separation, and attempted to minimize the thrust torque. I changed the CoT at that point by simply moving the boosters up and down (it also changes the CoM, but since the fuel was all set at the average point, I was still minimizing the average torque).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still ended up using Vernor engines for extra pitch control simply because the engines don\u0027t have enough gimbal (I just had to put 1 on each side of the nose of the craft), but I found that I could get through 90% of the flight without needing to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T23:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T20:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESaturnianBlue,\u003Cp\u003E Have you examined how the main tank drains and where you\u0027re feeding the engines from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You want it set up so that the CoM shifts towards the SSMEs in a straight line along their center of thrust as the main tank drains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a fuel line going to the cockpit.
