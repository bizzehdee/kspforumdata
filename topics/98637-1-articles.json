The Kerbal Community is a strong community of science and of course space. Hopefully what I have to say might interest you. UTS has been selected to be a high school participating in the SSEP: The Student Spaceflight Experiments Program. This is an opportunity for students (Grades 7-12) from UTS to design experiments, one of which will be flown to, and be conducted on the ISS. So far there has been lots of enthusiasm at my school, however one of the challenges is raising funds for the mission. The details of the project and the necessary funding can be found on our kickstarter page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1817096536/help-uts-students-get-into-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1817096536/help-uts-students-get-into-space\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDonations would be greatly appreciated, and even if you can\u0027t donate, we would really love it if you helped to spread the word!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, donations may end up being conducted on the Canadian Space Society\u0027s Website, for which tax receipts will be given.
