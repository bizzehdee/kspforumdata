Of course it\u0027s going to look like that. And the Vanguard satellites were of course designed just to be placed in orbit, not to actually act as controllable probes. If you use a decent-sized probe core (like the Hex or Cube) and, say, the LV-1 or LV-1R (LR11R and Equiso \u00AE respectively) it should be a better match. Also AIES has tons of small engines, as Visari mentions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right of course, the problem for him comes from the new probe tree layout in ML19a I think. You get WAC, explorer, sputnik and resizes thereof but nothing else. All the other probes which are easier to build with are in \u0027future probe bin\u0027 - which is fine since I love the progressive use of the probes in one-off experiments but it does mean having to use weird little things until you find that node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I also find planes really easy to build and fly.

Another, and by far the one I learned from most, was building a helicopter using IR\u0027s free moving docking washer, with jet engines mounted on the Pwing rotors powering the thing.
