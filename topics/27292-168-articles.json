First thing I did was add another habitation module, although this one is empty right now for testing purposes. Second part of the of the process so far was deciding on keeping or dropping the single nuke engine that was on the craft. While it will remain on the build screen craft I think once it is orbit it will be released to float away. Last bit was deciding to put a tug on to the station, this will be used for rescue mission in the depths of space. Also by doing this I will not have to launch another craft, I can just switch and go on the rescue mission. As the need for larger tugs is needed the smaller one will be replace, or maybe a new piece will be added to the station. Here is a picture of the nuke motor being decoupled from the station, and where the tug will be placed until it is needed for a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img849/6014/934c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022934c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulsar","CreatedById":83347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T17:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETesting rockets design with FAR. guess I need bigger parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjpalmer","CreatedById":94802,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T17:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally managed to make a plane get into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding,however, isn\u0027t working as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sickboy","CreatedById":32225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T19:28:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Benjpalmer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Benjpalmer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFinally managed to make a plane get into the air.\u003Cp\u003ELanding,however, isn\u0027t working as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eodds are, if it can take off, it can land, it\u0027s just a matter of trying to keep your horizontal speed around 100 mp/s or slower, but not too slow because you want your vertical to be real slow, try to touch with your back wheels first.
