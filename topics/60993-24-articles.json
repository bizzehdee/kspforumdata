They seem to have about twice the surface area so having them yield at least 4.0/s seems reasonable. I guess that the look of cool and the utility of the antenna somewhat compensates the lack of tracking, but if you would want to further advance their use, having them yield 4.5-5.0/s could be an idea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI\u0027m going to have to agree that the panels seem underpowered. even with the ability to retract and extend the lack of magic 360degree turning tracking hardware should mean a greater EC/s to weight ratio not a worse one. Its E/kg ratio should fall some where between single fixed panels and tracking panels\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DevL","CreatedById":98041,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T22:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MK3424\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MK3424\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s because the actual Soyuz solar panels won\u0027t track the sun.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAbsolutely, and not at all the point I\u0027m trying to make.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T23:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DevL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DevL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbsolutely, and not at all the point I\u0027m trying to make.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes i know, the early solar panels weren\u0027t efficient either, they were temporarely removed and replaced by greater battery packs with the early Salyuts but later readded when solar panels became more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T00:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone made a Long March or a \u0022Short Step\u0022 (thats what I am going to call mine)?
