So I stationed a \u0022base\u0022 on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I decided to try it out against some fighters. The Turrets work just fine, I\u0027m having trouble with the radars. It works just fine for the first few minutes, but after green text appears and says \u0022Radar requires EC\u0022 and shuts it off. No matter what you do, it will not activate the radar again. The screen pops up for a half second before disappearing and then displays \u0022Radar requires EC.\u0022 This has never happened before, so I have no idea what\u0027s wrong. Could someone offer me a solution?

I thought it was both. It worked previously. (Or maybe jet engines have alternators. I\u0027ve never checked in my 500 hours of ksp.) But there\u00A0must have been electricity, because the turret was firing. I don\u0027t know if it is a RAM issue (I only have 8 gigs) or if radars interfere with each other.
