When I tried copying over the mod as it was from 0.19, it gave me an error and said the parts were missing when I tried to load any spacecrafts with it. I noticed that the mod was updated for 0.20 so I downloaded it, but the problem still exists for any old crafts that had quantum struts. I can add them to new craft without issue, but unfortunately this means two of my spacestations have disappeared. Is there any way to make it compatible with pre-existing crafts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: hmm I probably posted this in the wrong place.

For saved craft you should be able to do the same thing, but edit the .craft file for each ship you are wanting to change. You should be able to open these files in any text editor. I use PSPad Editor but note pad should work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the persistence file each ship is located in a VESSEL{} block. You\u0027ll want to find the PART{} children that correspond to each of the quantum struts and delete that entire PART{} block. The .craft file is the same, except the entire .craft file is the VESSEL{} block so you only need to locate the PART{} blocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m nearly 99% positive this will fix your problem. That being said, create a copy of your persistence file and any craft files you edit and place those in a safe/temp location, like your desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
