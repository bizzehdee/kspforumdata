The craft would then draw any available fuel from tanks on the station-side of the port into its own tanks. It would allow you to completely refuel a craft in two clicks, including any hidden tanks (eg ones inside structural parts) without all the hassle alt-clicking individual tanks and hoping you haven\u0027t missed any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T14:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s doable or not\u00A0I don\u0027t know, but on the face of it it seems relatively feasible. \u00A0It\u0027s\u00A0a nice idea that I could find useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current stock feature of being able to keep the right click menus open help a lot with this, but this could be a very handy extra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T15:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell they have improved the fuel flow system for the next update.
