The exit velocity is 7km/s? And the thing is 300m in diameter? Centripetal acceleration is v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/R, which in this case works out to 326,667m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. Over 30,000G of acceleration. Most materials you\u0027d want to launch wouldn\u0027t be able to withstand their own weight under these accelerations. A soda can would have to hold nearly 400 atmospheres of pressure to survive that. For larger objects, the pressures involved are simply absurd. There is simply no way to build a rocket that can survive this, and you need a rocket if you wish to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the question of construction of the track itself to survive all this. The system effectively has the mass sliding \u0022down hill\u0022 around the track. If it picks up 7km/s over a 150m \u0022descent\u0022, the track itself is accelerating at 163,333m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2=2gh). That\u0027s over 16,000G that the entire 300m diameter structure needs to withstand. The requirements for tensile strength of the track material are roughly comparable to tensile strength requirements of a space elevator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this entire fund drive is a scam or just a deluded dream of somebody who failed college mechanics, but there is no way in hell this will ever work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T12:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand canon shells can face even higher accelerations and you both has rocket assisted and smart shells. However they are all pretty small (12-15 cm) expensive 50-100.000$ and the most of the weight is the casing. More important they are subject an linear trust and some rotation for an short time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think the track will get far more serious problems, remember that to get this useful you must past 20 cm shots, probably close to 30. the only way its possible to get this to work would be to kind of send one or multiple counterbalancing projectiles \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something who work nice in small scale but scaling up 100 times is like making an mouse you can ride on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T15:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems even less feasible than a railgun type launcher.

There\u0027s the fact that in ANY orbital maneuver, you can\u0027t move your current point on the predicted ellipse path - you can only reshape the rest of the ellipse, but the ellipse MUST still pass through the point you currently occupy as one of the points along its curve. I.e. if you thrust prograde, you raise the OPPOSITE side of the ellipse, not where you are right now, and the path will still come back down again to where you are right now. So basically, if the only point at which you accelerate is at the planet\u0027s surface in the launch gun, then your orbital path will come back down again to that altitude again, unless you\u0027re planning to leave the earth\u0027s sphere of influence entirely from one launch. In other words you can only use this idea to get things out into the solar system away from Earth, NOT to put objects in orbit around earth. If you try to put an object in orbit by just firing it from the surface and having it entirely be ballistic after that, then even if you manage to get it to go up really high its elliptical path will still bring it back down to the surface again unless you have the ability to thrust the craft later on after launch, to circularize the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T21:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, they talk about need for the final burn to circularize the orbit.
