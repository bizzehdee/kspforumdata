Today I begin my first attempt at the Elkano circumnavigation challenge. This attempt will take place on Kerbin and I have decided to take a marine-based approach with as little driving over land as possible. This will be continuously updated as I progress through the challenge. Given that I started this at about 1:30am EST, Day 1 will most likely be a shorter distance covered than the rest. Without further ado, the day one album!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/y4uvKjJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/y4uvKjJ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy apologies for having launched at night.
