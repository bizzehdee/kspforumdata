However, I do not really enjoy playing career with having to upgrade buildings and such the whole time, so might I add the suggestion that in the career difficulty menu, or in the alt\u002Bf12 menu, you can toggle having to upgrade buildings on and off? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure why but I really prefer the way .25 career was. I didn\u0027t have to worry about if my facilities could handle things first and I could just do what I needed to, if I had the cash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else with me on this? Or am I the only crazy one? lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
