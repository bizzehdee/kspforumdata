Naturally, by \u0022better\u0022 they mean \u0022able to lift more.\u0022 However, some of the engineers have apparently been going on strike on account of suffering eye damage from having to weld together 500 struts in some of the heaviest pieces of equipment currently available. Thusly, they decided to enlist your help to design lifters that aren\u0027t composed of 1000 parts that have to be welded together. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a side dispute that may or may not interfere with the initiative, Jeb and Bob Kerman had an argument regarding the sensibility of using jets for a vertical lifting platform just the other day. A nearby engineer actually made things worse by constantly complaining about the stronger rockomax engine\u0027s annoying maintenance characteristics and overly loud noise. Long story short, much ado was said and done, and many kerbals present at the time got into the resulting brawl. Several of the kerbals apparently are serving as judges for this competition, so do be aware that size and simplicity aren\u0027t the only things being measured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock and mechjeb only. In fact, we strongly recommend mechjeb or a non-parts plugin that similarly tells you your current mass so you can see the final mass of your orbital object. If you lack any such tool, You must instead show that whatever you used as the \u0022proof payload\u0022 does not have any fuel missing from it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules and such: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must get into an orbit in which the lowest approach to Kerbin is at an altitude of 100k or higher. Then, look at your vessel\u0027s mass after achieving this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour end mass multiplied by your multiplier is your score. i.e. if you get a 60% multiplier (from, say, 4 \u002B20%s and 1 -20%) and get 100 tons into orbit, your score is 160. Your multiplier is determined by what you see below, cumulative for all that apply. In other words, if you have a 650 parts, you incur both a -10% and a -20% penalty (and the reverse for a 350 part vessel). As mentioned above, some of the judges may still be cranky about minor details from yesterday\u0027s incident. Just think of it as some fun guidelines to follow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(for parts counts, if you by some odd chance are off by just one and have mechjeb onboard, you can pretend mechjeb isn\u0027t there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500 parts or less. \u002B10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E400 parts or less. \u002B20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E300 parts or less. \u002B20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E200 parts or less. \u002B20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 parts or less. \u002B30%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more then 550 parts. -10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more then 600 parts. -20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more then 700 parts. -40%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more then 800 parts. -60%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUses no Jet engines. \u002B20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUses a solid booster. -20% (sepatrons are not counted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse no \u0022mainsail\u0022 engines. \u002B20%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse no rockomax-size engines at all. \u002B10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent decoupled stages do not enter stable orbits. \u002B10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas docking ports, is capable of being refueled by other vessels. \u002B10% \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas not only docking ports, but also RCS systems and remains controllable for any duration.

This does not have a \u0022set\u0022 criteria, and is decided by the the space program executives. Things that will factor into this include whether or not the ship can serve as more then just a fuel bucket or an interplanetary tug. For instance, can it land on another planet? Can it get off said planet when done there? Can it do anything else particularly interesting? Note that for this criteria, it CAN make use of other vessels to accomplish them. For instance, it CAN be towed to another planet to land on and explore by another ship, and doesn\u0027t have to make it under its own power, and it CAN be refueled before it flies off to/lands on another planet under its own power. You will most likely be seeing 10s and 20s here. We will only award a 30 for something truly exceptional. If you qualify for this, we will mention when we update the scoreboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvidence of the functionality performing as intended is recommended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, there is also: \u0022Jeb is on board. \u002B999%.\u0022 As well as \u0022Jeb is on board. -999%.\u0022 But at that point we told them they were getting ridiculous and pointed an ion engine at them to scare them off. I love how superstitious they get about that thing. Hell, even Jeb gets freaked out by the thing ever since we put that dark flowing cloak on it. Jeb has also been eating a lot of garlic recently. We think he may be confused about which superstition he is supposed to be applying to the engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we\u0027re getting off track. You have the criteria.

Who knows how that would affect things during the burn over a particularly wide vessel. Gimballing or not, it would also be difficult to turn this massive thing.

Removed the nuclear engine penalty (which no one currently has incurred yet anyway). Also, the spent stage de-orbit bonus is now 10% down from 20%, but there is a new bonus of 10% if you have ports and can refuel or be refueled. Scores up to this point will remain valid, partly due to the fact that they could effectively remain the same by sticking a few small docking ports on them. Also changed the first high-part penalty to 550, so there is a little bit of buffer room between the bonuses and penalties. Also added a lower-orbit penalty so I can properly count polecat\u0027s submission (and to make the 100km requirement a little more visible). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated the scores section with what is currently done (m1x misinterpretted the part count penalties slightly, so I adjusted for that).

Making some changes to account for changes that came with .20. Naturally, previous scores will retain their validity, with one exception noted below. From henceforth, the mainsail criteria have been altered such that they now are 20% for no mainsails, and 10% for no rockomax-sized engines, period (i.e. no poodles and skippers). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new 10% boost is added. Basically, the previous docking port thing has been verbally altered slightly to reflect that it means it can be refueled by other vessels, as opposed to its previous description which indicated it can be both refueled AND do the refueling to another ship itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new boost is for ships that can viably do the refueling as well. In other words, it has at least some RCS thrusters, an RCS tank, and remains controllable for the forseeable future (i.e. it has either a probe with power generation systems available, or it has kerbals controlling it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne special new criteria, which isn\u0027t as well defined as the other, is the new \u0022functionality\u0022 boost, which is either 10, 20, or 30% and determined by me. Basically, its based upon the orbital vessel\u0027s usefulness for things other then just being a fueler or interplanetary tug. For this criteria, I have made a single retro-active scoring upgrade for Innuce\u0027s ship, and assumed that it can indeed release that lander-thing to land on the mun with a 10% boost. I felt it was safe enough to do this without issue, as he currently has the lowest score regardless on account of not actually designing his ship for this challenge (and as such I will make the assumption it ended up working well-enough). Nice looking lander-thing by the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust be aware that for future applications, some evidence of the functionality in question working is preferred. Also, do look at the actual fence-o-text regarding it in the updated main post, as it allows some special actions, such as the use of another ship in order for it to actually use its functionality (just note that functionality scores are based on the ship you got up, not the helper and any features it may have). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, nice min-maxing there tavert. The skipper really is surprisingly awesome (a realization which resulted in me altering the scoring slightly, though your entry is naturally not effected). Its not super-powerful, sure, but it doesn\u0027t burn as fast or dangerously as those mainsails. In the lower atmosphere, excess power is actually a bit of a waste on account of air resistance, so mainsails are actually more wasteful then their ISP indicates in some cases. That can be dealt with by not using them at full throttle of course, but skippers are a nice alternative way of dealing with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T19:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ryu Gemini\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Innuce","CreatedById":42593,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T21:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the compliments on my craft.
