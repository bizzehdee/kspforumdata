Exactly how hard can, fortunately, be specified on a very individual basis, which I consider one of the strongest selling points for KSP.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou just want to build humongous propulsion devices? Sandbox is for you\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere should be some kind of progression to be made, starting simple and getting new stuff over time? Science mode.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nonsider \u0022smart\u0022 approaches to problems instead of MOAR BOOSTERS, like having something to do? Career.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nManned vs unmanned should be a hard decision? Install a Life Support mod (to make manned harder) and RT in conjunction (to make unmanned harder as well, but in a different way, so that you\u0027re not tempted to just go unmanned for convenience)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\nMany other mods (FAR, SETI rebalance...) go into the same direction - \u0022aspect \u0026lt;x\u0026gt; of the game is too easy/simplistic for my taste\u0022. Also, I wouldn\u0027t personally make a distinction too much on wether a playing style is implemented through a stock gamemode/difficulty setting or a mod (for example, my personal sweet spot is playing either sandbox, stock career or career\u002BUSI LS\u002BRT). Also, it\u0027s a great practice in my point of view from Squad to include popular mods into the next stock versions - way to listen to your community, yay \\o/\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, what is your approach on KSP? What kind of emotions to you expect to get from playing? Which kind of challenges tickle you the most? What type of in-game tasks rather annoys you? Which gameplay mod\u0027s usefulness would you, personally, question?\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Domfluff","CreatedById":64903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T22:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I really like about KSP, as opposed to Orbiter, Microsoft Space Simulator or whatever, is that there\u0027s a wonderful mix of hardcore\u00A0simulation and accessibility. The scaled-down solar system and the amazing way that Harvester managed to translate pages of orbital information into the navball\u002Bnode system is nothing short of brilliant.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo... I tend to make things as difficult as possible for myself (e.g., life support mods, using the patches from Near Future Technology to make nukes use Hydrogen Fuel and downgrade the ion engines, etc.) but everything is a lot closer (and generally easier to get to)\u00A0than it would be in RSS.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m after in KSP is the chance to solve the same kind problems as in the real world in the general sense, rather than trying to get to the very specifics of the thing. For a manned Duna mission, you should still have to weigh the various options for getting there (Chemical/Nuclear/Electric engines), and the different types of mission architecture (Mars Direct-style ISRU and surface rendezvous, or an \u0022all-up\u0022 approach with a larger spacecraft, for example).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, at the moment, I\u0027ve been diving into Nuclear engines, and what purposes they are actually useful for, given the vast volume of hydrogen tanks. At present, I find that the equivalent of a \u0022nuclear third stage\u0022 for a Saturn-V class super heavy lift vehicle isn\u0027t all it\u0027s cracked up to be - there is a payload increase, but it\u0027s fairly marginal, and it\u0027s debatable whether it\u0027s worth the effort. Nukes make a lot more sense on a large scale, and especially when you start talking about gas core or LOX-augmented designs.\u00A0Likewise, playing around with electric engines has made me realise quite how important T:W ratio actually is for electric engines, since charge depletion is relative to burn time, engines can quickly outgrow the power of solar panels or reactors to (sensibly) support them, so using ion engines and the like for large-mass craft quickly becomes difficult to justify.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat kind of design/research/re-design cycle, and the associated reading it provokes is a large chunk of what I get out of KSP - it\u0027s problem solving on a large scale, when the problems are mostly of your own devising. I recently dropped non-essential supplies to a Mun base with airbags, just to see if that was a good idea, and how best to do that. They bounced for several kilometres, and ended up rolling around the rim of a crater, so a couple of Kerbals left the base in a Karibou rover to drive over and load them up. That\u00A0whole expedition, including the problem of navigating across the surface, and driving into and out of steep crater walls, was entirely caused by my choices, actions and design - that\u0027s not something the game had set up for me in some kind of\u00A0scripted sequence, and it was genuinely difficult and dramatic, in and of itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T22:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a couple of months I\u0027m still trying to figure out how I like to play.

my enjoyment (or rather what i liked out of the game) has changed some from the time i started playing to now, but its currently and for a long time was military based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started out making very simple ships, trying to get something to not explode in my face (these days i consider getting to orbit a joke, but back then it wasnt all that easy).\u00A0 I then took the time to try and land a 2 way mission with a kerbal to every planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter i finished with that, i got into military styled gameplay, since there wasnt all that much left to explore (and i have always enjoyed military or combat games the most of everything ive played), so i started to experiment with various ways to destroy stuff.\u00A0 This was ~0.21 or so, so i wasnt the first to create the idea of massive capital ships and missiles, but it was before i even started using any forums or online stuff, so i actually started out with little experience and had to think of how to make both armor and weapons that worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAround this time i also discovered mods, such as the gattling gun by DYJ made ages ago (and i actually went so far as to create my own weapons mod roughly based on that minigun mod but better in every way), i used B9 alot (back when no real good large plane parts), damned robotics pack (which was before it was called infernal robotics) for stuff like turreted capital ships, mech suits, you name it.\u00A0 Overall i started to use mods to fill holes i felt the stock game had, and to make certain designs easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that i got into SSTOs extensively, since the idea of single-stage-to-anywhere really got stuck in my head, and i started experimenting with various ways to make them work.\u00A0 I was a habitual abuser of RAM intake spam (like 30 intakes on a 20t ship), and well i got used to the pre-1.0 aero and how you could take advantage of it to get incredible ranges.\u00A0 Nukes/ions and turbojets were most of my builds at this time, and many of them also had weapons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also continued constant military development, got into vehicles, especially turreted tanks for some time (spent a while developing both replicas and just overall cool looking turreted tanks that were combat useable) throughout this time, although i did focus way more on SSTAs (single stage to anywhere) then anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen 0.90 hit i basically gave up on most mods, since i actually started to enjoy the challenge of stock constrcution, and especially stock combat.\u00A0 Mods made combat easier, but it was more satisfying to destroy a hostile ship with stock weapons (which actually required a share of engineering and not just strap a missile-cannon onto a ship and point it a a target).\u00A0 I started getting into some forum combat too, where i found alot of people made some very good ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter 1.0 hit, my SSTAs had to be redone so i focused alot on those and tried to recreate the glory days.\u00A0 I succeeded in 1.0.4 where i made a craft that had 7.9K dV after reaching LKO, and it could go to most planets minus tylo, jool (landing on jool doesnt seem to work), eve (i think we all know why thats impossible with a SSTO that has to launch from kerbin and return), and moho (too much dV needed there and low TWR doesnt work there either).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce 1.0.5 hit, my SSTAs all suffered majorly, and i just got fed up with the constant nerfing to SSTOs and only SSTOs, so i basically completely got over my obsession of sending single stage designs to anywhere, and gave up completely on anything that had excessive range and didnt use a regular staged launch to get in orbit.\u00A0 I finished development of my final long range SSTO that i had to keep around, but teh rest of my SSTOs were basically intended for refueling when needed and not go anywhere on a single gas tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i focus alot on a good variety of combat with capital ships, fighters, bombers, tanks, buildings, ect.\u00A0 I kinda focus more of appearance and sci-fi style then anything else, and just build a variety of primarily combat vessels, and then use them for combat, and learn from mistakes, flaws, and constantly improve my builds in both armor and firepower.\u00A0 I also have learned alot of tricks to lower part count without killing off performance, an have been using those to try and keep my ships below 300 parts, and most else ~100-150 max.\u00A0 I do still enjoy the occasional peaceful exploration mission, and do send those too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, i never got into science or career mode as i came from a time where sandbox was the only thing, and i have more then enough of an imagination to set up my own goals and scenarios.\u00A0 ive often enough used hyperedit to say leave a stranded ship somewhere, and then sent a mission to save the crew, with the occasional mix of random pirate attacks and running into hostile factions along teh way (so even my rescue ships are armed).\u00A0 I dont knwo why, but i cant seem to find any fun in 100% peaceful stuff, KSP is a military sci-fi space combat game and not a peaceful exploration game!\u00A0 career and science modes i view as artificial tasks that i can just as easily set myself.\u00A0 i do actually look at the price of craft (especially when i do faction vs faction so that one side can have cheaper but perhaps weaker ships but another more expensive/heavy/powerful but not numerical superiority).\u00A0 I also impose my own technological limits that i see fit (the stock tech tree is crap anyways, why is the bloody armor plating so far up the tech tree, a ibeam or stuctural panel is stuff that we had before the 1800s), but do limit tech to say no nuclear engines (for pirates or primitive factions), or say no ions, no RTGs, limited negine oiptions based on ISP or cost, ect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhh, and my current mods are mostly limited to cosmetic or utility stuff only.\u00A0 I feel that 1.0 has enough parts to make almost every one of my builds doable in stock, and since i gto into DMP where i occasionally hang out, i like to keep my game and ships as stock as possible so that i can actually use them in multiplayer.\u00A0 The only mods i still uyse that are not purely cosmetic are occasionally KAS, BDArmory (although less and less so as i like stock combat most), and sometimes the robotics pack when i want to make some whackjob walking robot or something completely stupid and unrealistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
