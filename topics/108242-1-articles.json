My landers thus far have been a command module with drone for SAS (scientist-flown), a Science Jr., 200 fuel tank and a 909. The contraption is rather tall, and my only kerballed landing tipped over on landing. Also ran out of fuel, but that\u0027s a different story.\n\nAnyway, I have unlocked the Mk1 lander module, and thought of trying that. Just wondering what lander designs you all would recommend for a beginner that are fairly easy to land and stay upright, can collect a reasonable amount of science, and have enough fuel to get back home?"},{"CreatedByName":"Orange_Slime_","CreatedById":109168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:22:06Z","Content":"My system was a large SRB for getting to the moon, a few smaller ones to slow down enough, landed, then SRB\u0027d my way back.

The tricky bit is getting it into orbit; these days you can do it by putting the whole assembly into a fairing; I use Procedural Fairings myself and haven\u0027t yet tried out the stock fairings to see how well they\u0027d work (if at all). I\u0027ve also started placing a service bay between the cockpit and the girder and putting all the extra instruments and in there; heat shields go under the sci jrs and another one goes on the bottom of the girder. The beauty of the Sci Lander design is that it puts a lot of mass up towards the top of the rocket inherently, making any booster less prone to flipping out of control. Does make the rocket wide, which is in general a no-no, but in this case it works (in my experience at least)."}]}
