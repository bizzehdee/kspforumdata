The tricky bit is getting it into orbit; these days you can do it by putting the whole assembly into a fairing; I use Procedural Fairings myself and haven\u0027t yet tried out the stock fairings to see how well they\u0027d work (if at all). I\u0027ve also started placing a service bay between the cockpit and the girder and putting all the extra instruments and in there; heat shields go under the sci jrs and another one goes on the bottom of the girder. The beauty of the Sci Lander design is that it puts a lot of mass up towards the top of the rocket inherently, making any booster less prone to flipping out of control. Does make the rocket wide, which is in general a no-no, but in this case it works (in my experience at least).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
