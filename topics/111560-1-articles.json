The cargo bay contains a fuel tank attached to a decoupler and a docking port (it goes 1. Decoupler, 2. Docking Port, 3. Command Module, 4. Fuel Tank). First, the decoupler is supposed to block fuel flow from the fuel tank in the cargo bay, but it doesn\u0027t. Second, turning off \u0022enable crossfeed\u0022 on the docking port has no effect either. There is no way to stop fuel from being drained out of the tank in the cargo bay."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T04:45:55Z","Content":"Jet engines like to suck fuel from every available location, even if you turn off crossfeed in places.
