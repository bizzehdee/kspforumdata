She got herself in a clockwise orbit around Duna. And I didn t realise her direction until I was parked in low orbit around Duna. In the right direction of course. On that subject I think it would be unbelievably helpful to get the direction of an orbit like we get with satellite mission. I had a quick look and couldn t find a mod that does that. Is there one? The only way I know to find out the direction of an object is to time warp.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_KarenSit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_KarenSit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see brutally inverting my orbit will cost me more than 1758m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the best I could do so far is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_KarenMn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_KarenMn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis adds up to 792m/s if it goes according to plan.. which is unlikely.
