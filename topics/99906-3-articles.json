I remembered KAS and had a thought (this is the first time I\u0027ve used that mod, and I added the winch just cause it was cool, and the right height for the wheels). I EVAed, and decided to try to fix the rover. I ended up attaching the 2 small rover wheels to the side of the rear 2 aircraft gear fairings, then retracted the rear gear. The rover was able to function, and made the 10km back with a little juice in the batteries to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d still prefer to be able to have them be more, well, stable, and right now the gyros flipping them is at least as goofy as them flipping so easily. Every rover I have made has had a nasty crash at some point---though I only make small rovers that I can transport on rockets that look like rockets with reasonable fairings, so that\u0027s a caveat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T18:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Renegrade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Renegrade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some weird lag involved with brakes (if you set them and leave \u0027em on for a while, they seem to take forever to disengage). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a thought on this-- I think the issue is that design for the wheel brakes was intended for aircraft, not rovers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can remember playing my first semi-realistic flight simulator, many, \u003Cem\u003Emany \u003C/em\u003Eyears ago, and for the life of me I just \u003Cem\u003Ecould not\u003C/em\u003E get the plane in the air. How hard could it be, really? Point it at the end of the runway, throttle up and pull back on the stick, right? It worked in other games. But no matter what I tried, the runway provided was just too short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere along the way, I realized that in the real world pilots \u0022stand on the brakes\u0022 to hold their aircraft in place while the engines come up to full power. I think the release delay on the brakes in KSP may be the game\u0027s way of giving jet engines a little bit of extra time to spin up before the aircraft starts rolling down the runway on take off. Kind of like the way rockets rotate 90 degrees when they move out of the VAB. . .the game is trying to say, \u0022Hey rookie, you need to pay attention to this!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T18:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I did some fiddling with rovers and cranes yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110972-A-tale-of-two-rover-cranes?p=1742653\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110972-A-tale-of-two-rover-cranes?p=1742653\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gerandar","CreatedById":136705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T19:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy waste time with rovers when you can get more science for your buck with a just as easily planned manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T21:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gerandar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gerandar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy waste time with rovers when you can get more science for your buck with a just as easily planned manned mission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s many more things to do than get science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
