But the detachment torque on the detachment mass projectiles the detachment parts against the outer tanks. In short terms it explodes the rocket. If possible I want to set the torque to the lowest possible setting which I think is a 0.1 Kn force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you can configure the part settings. But that changes the torque on all the TT 38K decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words I need a mod with radial decouplers, one which supports radial decouplers where you can set the detachment impulse on each individual radial decoupler. Possibly one with varies sizes of radial decouplers or otherwise being procedural since the detachment mass is very low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T15:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is actually a stock bug with the radial decoupler.
