I understand that eventually the wings on the ports will serve to automatically align them during docking. As currently designed, they can be toggled between two different angles to provide complementary interlocking shapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of toggling the wings between 0-degree and 45-degree angles, however, would it be easier to fix them at 22.5-degrees? This would still allow for docking ships at 0, 90, 180, and 270-degree orientations, but use a static collision mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/oZ2bn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
