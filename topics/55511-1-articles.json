He never liked to be woken up before he was ready. He tried to grab the dream he was fast forgetting--something about fighting the Kraken on Bop. Failing to save the dream, he sighed and opened one eye. He saw his brother, still shaking him furiously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nellas, is it time for school?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is something on fire?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Then let me sleep.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe rolled away, but Nellas threw off the covers and dragged him out of bed. Seeing no point in resisting at this point, he went down the stairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All right, why are you dragging me down here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Science Man is on Minmus!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You mean Bill?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESid suddenly came fully awake and ran down the stairs. He looked at the TV just in time to see Bill Kerman, pilot of the Armstrong 5, become the first kerbal employed by the Jedi Space Program to step foot on another celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old television was raspy, but he was able to make out the first words. \u0022That\u0027s one small step for a kerbal, one giant leap for kerbalkind!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESid squinted hard. The whole thing had an unreal quality to it, like watching a dream from the outside. He watched as Bill made huge jumps and long strides. He gaped in awe the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENellas pointed at the screen. \u0022When I grow up, I want to be just like him.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESid smiled. \u0022Yeah. Me too...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI hope you enjoyed this very short backstory chapter.
