Early access means we get to play around with alpha and beta builds, not that we are alpha or beta testers of the game. Squad have a bunch of people (a few odd comments in Scott Manley videos suggests he is such an individual) who do actual pre-release testing of the software, and they most definitely are beta testing the new features (and are not allowed to talk about it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen access and the kind of rolling release that common in a lot of software these days means the paradigm of alpha and beta versions doesn\u0027t really carry the meaning it used to. Each release, including all the versions we have had to date, will have gone through an internal closed alpha and beta test phase before we got our hands on them. Just because we don\u0027t get our hands on these builds doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t exist, and doesn\u0027t mean there isn\u0027t proper testing of them. In terms of stability and bug fixes, 0.90 is definitely beta in quality, but in terms of gameplay and content, I have played full release games that were far lower in quality over the years. If all they had done was fix bugs and give us 0.90 with a few stability enhancements and bug fixes, it would be a great game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to appreciate is that software development is mostly under the hood. What is difficult to execute in software, and takes time and effort to debug and get working right is stuff that, from a user perspective, is frankly unimportant and would warrant perhaps a single line in release notes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the hard part in modelling the physics in KSP is being able to assemble a large complex spacecraft out of components, model their interaction under flight conditions, and have the thing stay together and be controllable with user input (and fly through space in a way that deals with a huge range of orders of magnitude of distance and time interactions). That is something that we take for granted because it works now, and it works pretty well. What is not hard is tweaking the values of individual forces, masses and so on of each component so that they make gameplay better. We, the user, see \u0022full parts re-ballance\u0022 and think, \u0022this is a huge change to the game\u0022. What the developer sees is, \u0022this is a day or two with a spreadsheet to tweak some numbers on an already working system\u0022. We see \u0022massive aerodynamics change will fundamentally change gameplay\u0022, developer sees, \u0022one function is changed from F = m * v to F = k * A * v^2\u0022 (A is cross sectional area, k is arbitrary constant). We see \u0022full resource system\u0022, they see \u0022a handful of new parts and some surface maps\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things that will need sorting out to bring the quality of 0.90 up to 1.0 standard are things like memory leaks and stability. There have been statements on Tuesday developer posts indicating these are being worked on, but when we, the forum community see \u0022big effort at stability and bug fixing\u0022 on one line and \u0022new aerodynamics model\u0022 on another, we think the second one is the huge big deal, but actually, from a software development perspective, and from the point of view of getting the game to 1.0 standard, it\u0027s the first one that is way, way more difficult to achieve and way more important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Squad has done a damed good job so far with getting releases out to a high standard so far, I trust them to do it again.
