Unless kerbals evolved to enjoy the smell of aluminium perchlorate combined with mystery goo, of course.\n\nAll kidding aside, this is fantastic and becomes even more relevant with conformal decals released!"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-21T10:33:18Z","Content":"Updated some things.\n\nInfo in \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
