I have an Apollo-style craft (craft file \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/sjgkccvdzhxf0kb/bZ%20-%20Apollo.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E *) that lifts off perfectly. The first asparagus stage also separates fine. But shortly before the second stage separation, this happens.

Posting it here just in case. Contact me for a list of plugins needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I think the lines visible are 3 fuel lines and 6 struts, stretched quite some length.

The outer tanks are attached using 3-times symmetry, with fuel lines going into the middle tank. Please also note that the lifter section (not visible in the screenshot) does not use stretchy tanks, but only stock. Also on a different note, there seems to be some Z-fighting going on when attaching a LV-909 to the bottom of a stretchy tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YCeEt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
