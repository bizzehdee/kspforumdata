A very stable and insoluble fuel form, strontium-titanate, was developed and widely used in terrestrial power systems. Because Sr-90 and its daughter Yttrium-90 emit high-energy beta particles, they give off significant bremsstrahlung radiation and require heavy shielding. However, shield mass is not as critical for most terrestrial power systems as it is for space power applications. \u003Cp\u003E[...] The amount of Pu-238 that could be produced has always been a limiting factor in its use in space missions. Therefore, several other radioisotopes have been thoroughly evaluated for space use over the years. Sr-90 and Po-210 fuels were considered for use in higher powered military satellite constellations for which there were insufficient quantities of Pu-238 available. These programs were cancelled before they were completed, so these fuels were never used in space by the U.S. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] At that time, however, the radioisotope fuel of choice, Plutonium-238 (Pu-238), was unavailable due to AEC restrictions, and APL refused to use beta-decaying Strontium-90 because of the excessive weight associated with its necessary shielding. The AEC eventually acquiesced and agreed to provide the Pu-238 fuel. The SNAP-3 was converted from use of Po-210 to Pu-238, and acquired the new designation, SNAP-3B. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(pdf, 39pp.) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/schmidt.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/schmidt.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lST8dSn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lST8dSn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EORNL-TM-3382\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(pdf, 346pp.) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1971/3445606041903.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1971/3445606041903.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-24T15:53:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2015 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T15:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere?\u003Cp\u003EWhat about radiation sheilding requirements?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote, polar sea lighthouses and buoys, often the ones established by the Soviet Union.

A leaded ceramic lid with a hole for the other electrode, insert the wire, and fuse the lead to the device with clamps.And there you have it, a completely less dangerous way of making electricity than a solar panel could otherwise make more safely.
