Have the vanilla Windows 1.0.3 version. \n\nRecently started the career mode after fooling around with the tutorials and figuring out basic rocket behavior in sandbox mode. Now I want to start with the community generated campaigns but how to activate those? Install like a mod or..? Used the forum search function, searched the internet probably missed it.\n\nAnyway thanks for the input, appreciate it!\n\nKind regards,\n\nLmascha"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T09:54:23Z","Content":"Hi, welcome to the forums.\n\nWhich campaigns do you mean?\n\nIf you are thinking of the ones from the wiki ([here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Campaigns)), then there is nothing other than the informtaion there.\n\nThese campaigns are designed to be self challenges, losely based on real-world space flight developement; they aren\u0027t loadable campaigns.\n\nIf those are not what you\u0027re thinking of, then I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you."},{"CreatedByName":"lmascha","CreatedById":147007,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T11:44:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi, welcome to the forums.\n\u003E Which campaigns do you mean?\n\u003E \n\u003E If you are thinking of the ones from the wiki ([here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Campaigns)), then there is nothing other than the informtaion there.\n\u003E \n\u003E These campaigns are designed to be self challenges, losely based on real-world space flight developement; they aren\u0027t loadable campaigns.\n\u003E \n\u003E If those are not what you\u0027re thinking of, then I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you.\n\nHi Alexin,\n\nCorrect those are the campaigns I\u0027m refering to.

Many of those are milestones that you\u0027d probably tried to accomplis on your own too.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027d suggest you to give career mode a try. It\u0027s really helpful to learn while only the most basic parts and functions are available."},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T13:00:42Z","Content":"The contract packs offer something along the line of \u0022campaigns\u0022.\n\nI did one of those myself called SETI, including some rebalancing and a techtree.
