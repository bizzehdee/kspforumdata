Once you get into one point some biome, you basicly get whole biome. There is no need for travelling over surface of planet as long as you stay within biome. \n\nPossible solution for this problem is to generate procedurally surface objects and places wich you can visit and explore for science. These could be diffrent rocks, soil patches, geological phenomena, etc. Driving (flying, jumping) around landing sites could become rewarding.\n\nTwo requests:\n\n1. Please, give me feedback for this idea.\n\n2. Is it possible with current game mechanics to implement procedurally generated objects that emerge and disappear on border of \u0022player physical sphere\u0022 as it moves?\n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:23:02Z","Content":"This is something I\u0027d like too.\n\nSo. Very. Much. \n\nBecause exploring a planet should be more than making those brief first steps.\n\nBecause rovering can be fun. \n\n[![kVcYQJnl.png](http://i.imgur.com/kVcYQJnl.png)](http://imgur.com/kVcYQJn)\n\nLooking at strange dirt can be fun too.\n\n[![J5YylH3l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J5YylH3l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/J5YylH3)\n\nIdeally, you\u0027d get to hunt them down by looking for changes in your instrument readings- the closer you get, the larger the change. \n\nAdding extra parts would be awesome, and perfect for this- a little magnetometer, a geiger counter, maybe even a regolith analyzer which you need to give a sample. Atmosphere composition data could be modded into the atmosphere analyzer. \n\nI, am a few others are probably quite willing to discus theoretical planetary regolith and atmosphere composition.\n\nAwesome as it would be, to make these fit in with the other instruments, they\u0027d need to have something to measure through the whole solar system. This is why I\u0027d really like something like this be stock.\n\nIt could just use the stock instruments (temp and/or pressure increase/decrease, seismometer reading oscillating, despite the rover being still,), but any changes to these readings would have to be small to stay believable. (Unless you\u0027re approaching an active volcano or something).\n\nThe more boring way would be to have just the one scanner, or to only be able to locate then visually. \n\nIMHO, it would be nice if the objects where persistent within a save, making the planet fell more real. But some things that change after time could be nice."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:24:34Z","Content":"In general the planets and moons should be more interesting.
