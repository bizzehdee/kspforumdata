My question comes down to wing placement. I was understanding that a col above the com would at stability and self righting characteristics for level flight. My setup has the main wings mounted low and angled up as well as a fairly high incidence. My thoughts were that this would help stabilize re entry and keep it fairly easy to maneuver, but it\u0027s been a bit tricky on final approach. I was also wandering about the stability of a v shape tail instead of the traditional fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought was my tail and wing sections being the same size, delta wings, but my col and com are properly placed. I figure with the v shape tail, I should only really experience a partial loss of yaw control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try and get pics later, but for now any ideas on the setup I\u0027m using?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T01:14:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ForScience6686\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T17:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that it\u0027s generally not worthwhile to try to put the CoL below (I.e.ventral to) the CoM.

The only stability that\u0027s ever an issue, in my experience, is pitch stability, for which all that matters is the fore-to-aft position of CoL along the ship\u0027s axis, relative to CoM. And putting the CoL below has the potential to make it harder to keep the center of drag and of thrust coaxial with the CoM, which can complicate control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally prefer to keep my wings on-line with the ship (I.e. symmetric about the axis), with CoL just slightly behind the CoM.

I\u0027ve found that an/dihedral wing arrangements tend to add uncertainty to steering input, causing wandering and drifting on other axial rotations than the one you want, even when control surfaces are configured properly. They can also leave the lift platform with \u0027flat spots\u0027 where it tends to settle somewhat off-upright. Also, V-shape tails can cause similar unwanted pitching and rolling issues when yawing, which the SAS fails to properly correct because you\u0027re triggering it\u0027s \u0027stability assist\u0027 mode through control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relative size of your main- and tail-wings probably doesn\u0027t have much to do with it if, as you\u0027ve said, your CoM/CoL are correctly placed.

That should balance out any steering vaguery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: another thing to note is the position of your dry CoM compared to wet CoM, and also it\u0027s generally a good idea to disable engine vectoring if you\u0027re having control issues - rely on the control surfaces to keep you pointed right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T18:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ForScience6686\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ForScience6686\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I have it backwards, I currently have col above com.

Landing is fundamentally less stable - real landings are after all just controlled stalls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStability when flying slowly is all about having a good aerodynamic platform, whereas climbing is just about not having too much drag in crazy places. Also, when returning your plane is much lighter so it \u0027floats\u0027 as a body rather than \u0027hanging\u0027 on the wings - like a feather on the wind, rather than like parasail. You can see any issues in your lift platform will become much more apparent when landing - it\u0027s not that the plane is good during ascent, it\u0027s just that u don\u0027t notice it\u0027s flaws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t underestimate the importance of the CoT to this either. In your plane I\u0027m guessing the CoT is inline with the CoM and at the back, but in a trainer it would be in front. The relatively high drag of the mainwing would cause a natural pitch-up moment at high throttle settings, another safety advantage for stall recovery. The relative positions of CoT and CoL around the CoM create pitch moments - this is how commercial airliners are able to fly despite the engines being almost at the bottom of the aircraft, under the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T19:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"interface","CreatedById":122370,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T19:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like angled twin tail fins, yes they do create pitch or off axis yaw, if you actually use yaw for anything...

This plane is designed to fly out to duna and return my crew, it is launched partially filled and then refills in orbit before heading out and again before launching from Duna surface. The boosters are not staged together as they have separate purposes, top booster fired ~300m/s to break mach1 for useful thrust. Bottom booster fires ~1000-1100m/s to help with low twr of nukes, it must burn out before jet flame out. The ride up after that is a bit slow with the nukes.
