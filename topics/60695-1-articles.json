This got me to thinking about building an application which has to execute OUTSIDE KSP, since it deals with looking up DLL files. I read the rules, and it only makes mention of the addons, no mention of anything else. So long the code is provided, is it still allowed to post links and such to it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T03:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at the Tools and Applications subforum of addon releases.

It was the trigger, yeah, but, there are a couple of other mods out there that package older mod DLLs (Permitted or not, I don\u0027t know) into their own package, which causes grief for other mods. It just seemed like a theme the other day, reading through the active threads that conflicting DLLs were a source of problems. So, brain storm, a day of coding (due to a LOT of interruptions from kids and wife, and I\u0027m sure the dog would have got involved if she hadn\u0027t been in hot water with me for the past 6 years), and I have a working product that picks off commonly named DLLs. Some tweaks need to be done, and I\u0027ll post out the links for download.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cnnrduncan","CreatedById":30396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T01:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a good idea, would you be providing executables for operating systems other than Windows?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
