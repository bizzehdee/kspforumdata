I\u0027ve been reading the forums for a long time but this is the first time I\u0027ve actually posted anything. I did a quick search to see if my question had been answered, but there was nothing obvious (as you can imagine, searches for \u0022crew transfer\u0022 come up with a whole big mess of results).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve flown a fuel tanker full of kerbals out to Minmus for the collection of science, and to serve as a fuel depot for missions outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I managed to dock this terrible monstrosity, but now I can\u0027t seem to transfer crew from one section of the station to another without using EVAs. This is a problem, since kerbals leaving the command pod of my fuel tanker can\u0027t seem to do anything other than re board (it looks like their heads spawn inside the RCS wheels!). Without crew transfer I won\u0027t be able to use the lander or the orbital lab until I fly even more crew out here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: Is the crew transfer interface buggy? Am I using it wrong in some way? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft click the crew hatch, get the crew transfer window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect a kerbal to transfer.

It definitely seems worse at some times than at others. I\u0027ve played around with it a little bit, and I have a theory of what\u0027s going on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think that when they coded it, they didn\u0027t code the \u0022click\u0022 event very robustly: that the mouse press and mouse release have to happen right on the same spot, i.e. you can\u0027t press down, move the mouse slightly, and then release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When the game slows down (e.g. if you have a big craft with high part count, or your video card is having trouble keeping up with a high-def render of planet\u0027s surface), so that the frame rate is lower, it checks for mouse-down and mouse-up more slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This results in the impression that your clicks aren\u0027t getting anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- However, you may be able to make it register if you press the mouse down, are \u003Cem\u003Every careful not to move even a millimeter\u003C/em\u003E, wait a moment or two, and then release the button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYMMV.
