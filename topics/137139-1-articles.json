I\u0027m having a bit of a problem with one of my rockets rolling when I try to do its gravity turns. It doesn\u0027t continually turn...only when I\u0027m hitting D. I\u0027ve read many, many threads about it, and I try to make sure I go no further than 45 degrees until my boosters burn out, but she continually rolls as I turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667311729\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667311729\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T07:08:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 07:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jesentra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T08:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rolling\u0022?

My first thought was that the struts running diagonally from the SRBs to the center stack are causing torque, but it could also be the 3-way symmetry causing uneven drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
