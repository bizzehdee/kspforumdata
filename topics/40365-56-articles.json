I\u0027ve read the last three pages just to see but I\u0027d like to suggest something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know science is an upcoming project in the stock 0.22 that\u0027s due... whenever, but the science upgrades in this might be done more like a traditional tech tree with some minor modification. I take it you still have to click \u0027upgrade\u0027 on a component to upgrade it to a new version? Why not move this functionality to the science lab itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIE a lab would now have two buttons. One \u0027Upgrade science facility\u0027 and \u0027Upgrade components\u0027. The first would use science accrued, and basically would make the lab the \u0027next level\u0027. How many levels it should have would be a good question. The second button would display a second menu with a list of components the lab could upgrade. Along side each item would be a \u0027highlight\u0027 button that would make the actual item highlighted in the same manner (perhaps a different color?) as when you move the mouse cursor over it. That way you could tell which of the vessels currently docked to the science facility you are affecting. Next to this button for each item on the list would be multiple \u0027upgrade buttons\u0027. (EDIT:forgot to add, if the science facility isn\u0027t high enough for this tech this upgrade would be grayed out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple? Why start with antimatter reactors being able to be built from scratch? It\u0027s rather advanced tech after all. Start with something else that could be upgraded to antimatter (a specialist reactor? Maybe inertial confinement fusion? Barely believable that that could be upgraded to an antimatter reactor) Basically any item could be upgraded to it\u0027s next option (nuclear reactor Mk1 to Mk2) or to something else (nuclear reactor Mk1 to Toroidal Fusion Mk1... yeah, not a good choice. Totally different tech, but you get the idea). Thus a tech tree of sorts is born. Not every thing would have multiple options, but anything you think would be too advanced for Kerbalkind to start with could be put as an upgrade on an existing piece of equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis component upgrading could use a second resource (development rather than science? As in Research and Development) or could be time based. IE when you click \u0027upgrade\u0027 to whatever you have chosen it changes to something else, a default \u0027non functional\u0027 version of the unit to represent the ongoing work. Then, as long as the component stays docked to the science lab, it will be upgraded after a fixed span of time. At the end of the time it would be replaced by the finished item.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would mean that it would take time and effort to make a lab capable to upgrade components, but once it\u0027s there you could upgrade craft relatively easily, with perhaps time or other resource costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem this might bring would be size/shape compatibility between upgrades of different types. Are the models for fission reactors similar in size/shape to fusion reactors?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if someone else has suggested this previously but once the idea occurred to me I had to put it down before I forgot about it.

Since I\u0027m comitted to having rocket engines that actually don\u0027t require more energy than they consume, I\u0027m constrained by an absolute limit on the performance of the nuclear rockets.
