Just to draw one example on how these differ from spaceplane wings for anyone unfamiliar with Starship (or the KSP 1 re-creations by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/YlLTkKSNFKk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScott Manley\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/fY1pthlEk7o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMatt Lowne\u003C/a\u003E which recreate this mechanic), the way a set of spaceplane wings will tilt in order to roll doesn\u0027t really work when attempting a bellyflop. One set of wings need to fold inwards in order to increase drag on a particular side whereas standard control surfaces twist in a way that provides little control at high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E. KSP 1 at least had robotics so you could jerry-rig Starship wings together, but even then and even if KSP 2 had robotics, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E corrections are restricted to reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the wings only adjusting for manual input. Proper support for these types of aerodynamic surfaces is well needed given that KSP 2 is going to be putting more emphasis on reusability as time goes on, and with that comes people wanting to fly mission profiles similar to Starship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
