Right now most are at 1.0.2, KSP is at 1.0.3. So CKAN will read this as the mod being incompatible - which is why so many mods are \u0022incompatible\u0022 even though very few really are. CKAN just indexes the info the authors provide, and then install/uninstall and tracks what you have.

All that aside, it means the CKAN metadata cannot be automatically updated via the .netkan file, unlike KerbalStuff or GitHub mods. That\u0027s what originally stopped me from this - I only knew how to generate netkan meta files and was unsure about copyrights of making a CKAN file (unlike many other aposs, this is All Rights Reserved, not an open license or GPL, so what you can do with it is somewhat constrained by law, including the DMCA - which kept me from mirroring it over to KerbalStuff).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I found out it was not a copyright violation to reference the location (Google does this all the time), I coded ckan file for this and submitted it. Thats why its showing up on CKAN. But I also included the version I knew it ran on (1.0.2), so that\u0027s why its marked as \u0022incompatible\u0022 - if this does work with 1.0.3 (I haven\u0027t tried it yet and nobody has posted definitively), I\u0027ll update the metadata file and put in the pull request to get CKAN updated.
