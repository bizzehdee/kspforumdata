Squad took the approach of loading everything because games that load on demand use loading screens (well more than KSP does anyway). Loading textures takes time to do, regardless of where you do it. Loading textures on demand means you will be waiting on a load screen or lag while it loads in-game, loading them ahead of time prevents that but then everything must be stored in RAM. Wolfenstein has a load screen for every level if I recall while KSP you can fly from Kerbin to Eve to Duna, to Jool without a load screen. It is a design choice, plain and simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there are areas that Squad could improve. All of the textures are separate objects because of the way they were added in phases by multiple artists. Ven\u0027s Stock Part Revamp on the other had re-uses textures, making for less textures. In fact his pack adds around 30 new parts that do not have associated textures at all, they just re-use textures from the other parts that he \u0027revamped\u0027. So there is room for improvement, but it\u0027s not as simple as just \u0022Load on Demand\u0022. Load on Demand users might have machines capable of reducing load lag to minimal amounts, but not everyone does so if Squad were to implement it then many people could be excluded even from the Stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T14:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts a fair reason, the continuity of the kerbol system is part of the charm.

Also, dynamic loading like this can be done very well - In skyrim, with 30gb of mods (Textures mods, model replacers) I rarely ever got above 2.6-2.7 gb used, sprinting with a heavily sped up horse across the map, and texture pop-in wasn\u0027t too noticeable. This is on a $30 250gb hard drive. I don\u0027t expect that kind of quality from Squad, nor from a mod - that would be totally unreasonable. But just getting LoD back to working would be awesome, especially with Opengl. Oh, I wasn\u0027t really hoping for someone to update it before the upcoming update - I was just hoping that a modder might find it an interesting project to eventually resurrect.

KSP scene changes often take a while - not at all second-to-second, and there is no need at all to load a hundred\u002B parts into RAM when your vessel has, say, 30 unique parts. Like LoD does - just load a thumbnail image, when another ship gets within, say, 100km, load the parts it uses. Simple, effective. KSP , in timewarp, uses an on-rail system - it\u0027s simple to predict what you need to load. If your trajectory goes near a ship, do as I said last sentence - if it goes within visual range of a planet, load it. The only reason KSP really has the system it does is that it is low effort, and somewhat performance saving, and was implemented in Alpha. Stock KSP does not need a dynamic loading system at all - it goes nowhere near the limit, so I doubt Squad will ever implement dynamic loading, sadly. Unless some miracle happens and Unity 5 has some arcane -make-it-easier-to-load-dynamically magic that I as a non game dev don\u0027t understand, I think heavy mod users are up a creek without a paddle, unless LoD gets resurrected, or someone else makes a similar project as time goes on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T18:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lagcity613\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T17:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo quote mid-message, use [\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9quote=username;PostNumber]Quote goes here[\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9/quote] with username replaced by the person you\u0027re quoting\u0027s username, and PostNumber as the actual post number.
