I can do a powered landing from launch to Kerbin orbit and back again, but that damnable Mun Kerbalizes everything I try getting back on a powered landing, and .16 has made it even more difficult for me (probably just not enough practice, but oh well). I know a few of you have done so, but I\u0027m beside myself trying to figure out how. I\u0027ve hit rock bottom ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooooo, the challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign me a stock rocket (mechjeb allowed, but nothing else; MechJeb allows me to see orbital and surface info without having to resort to the map, which has caused me a few mishaps switching back and forth due to FR lag), that will fly me to the Mun, land safely, do an EVA, and return via a powered landing to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all, nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t include MechJeb, please include a few tips and tricks for a Powered Kerbin Landing newb like me. The Mun is a no-brainer at this point, so you can skip that part of the journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinner is the person with the easiest craft to complete the challenge (by me).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T15:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKay, well, powered landing on Kerbin is easy, just free fall until 2000m and then point straight up and burn till you slow down enough. The atmosphere already cancelled out lateral movement for you. For landing twice, I would put drop tanks on my lander, three or four, attached radially, without engines. Then you can put landing legs on the radial tanks and the inner stage. If you are a GREAT pilot, then you can use a single half tank, but that is incredibly difficult (see optimal descent challenge). After you have your lander, make a TLI stage and an ascent from kerbin stage, then add boosters till it gets of the ground and you have a fairly workable craft!

I\u0027ve been working with a three-radial design for the lander mostly, but occasionally a four-radial. My biggest problem is that by the time I get close enough to the ground to start the landing burn, one of two things happen: Either I run out of fuel before touchdown, or I don\u0027t have enough thrust to come in at a safe speed.

Wow, what are you doing!?! I have a 4 stage lander that has 4 3/4 full tanks left on the moon and I can land it with over half fuel left. I have no idea how to help you other than redirect you to the Optimal descent challenge (once again) where we determined the most efficient landing profiles. Lowering your periapsis first will save you gas, then at your new periapsis, start your landing burn and do a reverse gravity turn. Remember if you are bringing more fuel do longer burns sooner, otherwise the mun will have a new crater named after you. . . thats the best I can do for you unless I start posting .CRAFT files, but I would have to wait until I am back home for that. . .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T05:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlazingAngel665\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlazingAngel665\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, depending.
