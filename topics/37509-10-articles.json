What happens to me is I like keeping the hot key on \u0022H\u0022, but when docking the HUD pops up when translating forward. I like using the HUD when I\u0027m in IVA, but not when I\u0027m in the default 3rd person ship view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T18:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current version should have changed the hotkey to Alt-H, which you are much less likely to hit when using RCS.
