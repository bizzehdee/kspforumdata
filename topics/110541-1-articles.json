As you can see in the three views of my rough sketch. I picture this as holding two kerbals in tandem with an EVA hatch at the front. I think it would be great for rovers, landers, and space only craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second idea here is a \u0022command Deck\u0022 module for those deep space interplanetary missions we all like to build. I\u0027ve just become frustrated with the looks of using the cuppola or a capsule in this capacity. I think there should be a part that fits the end of a hitchhiker and gives the impression that the ship is run from there. You can see a rough idea for it in the image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just a couple of ideas for parts I thought I would throw out there for anyone of our talented modders to get ideas from.
