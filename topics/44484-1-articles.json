It was made to honor the brave pilots that brought every module to the Mun, the crew and the whole project together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few years, the government brought the three agencies together and funded a project to make a link-up point which would enable us to transfer crew to the mun without actually landing. It would be a long crew module docked to Base One that would come up to orbital level of the Mun, and hence crew could be transferred in orbit. After years and years of researching, building and theorizing, Smitzel Kerman with his team finally made and saw the docking of the craft. Then the Population of Kerbin slowly inhabited the Mun in the inhabitatant module. The operation was a huge success and everyone involved in the Mission was rewarded and honored. The number of people that were on the Mun was about 1.2 Billion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2035, 30 years after BaseOne was established, it was predicted that there would be a massive solar flame which had the potential to wipe out the planet. Everyone from Base was evacuated and only the ruins of the houses and base was left behind on Mun. The Kerbal race could not survive it. The Mun collided with the earth and they went shattering millions of light years away into other planets. They all collided and nothing ever was seen again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of time later, a solo star was seen forming. It resembled Kerbin, it\u0027s appearance was astoundingly similiar to Kerbin\u0027s. It was disovered that there were other beings there. Some sort of gigantic rovers, but without wheels. The size of a rocket going to duna but it would run. The being was called Dino. Dinosaur. Years later the planet flourished with wonderous inventions and rockets of their own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Revolution of the Human Race had just begun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T02:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat did the rest of the story have to do with the ending?
