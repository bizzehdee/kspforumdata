Then holding the middle mouse button you can shift arround your view and by holding Alt \u002B Scrolling you can change the camera lens focal length. A wide focal length is cool fo fisheye effects (good for some action shots) and a very narrow angle is good if you want to blow the background up in size.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo then actually record something you need a screen recorder. A good free one is for example \u0022Open Broadcaster Studio\u0022 but it has a little learning curve. it\u0027s not like most other where you just press a button and go. It is once you set it up though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have all the footage you need comes the video editing where the true magic happens. I personally would suggest to avoid you to spin the camera view around in the video. Rotary motions can be used as a tool sometimes but get quickly too much. You can switch between different camera angles while recording and in video editing simply cut the parts out where the camera rotates.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to really dive into\u00A0video making I can highly suggest to try\u00A0the freeware Blender. It\u0027s a very powerful tool to create all sorts of animations you can use to complement your videos. However, it takes a while to get the hang of it but it does not take as long as one thinks when starting out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s probably not the kind of video you are looking for but here is one of mine:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc5uUfe1lds\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc5uUfe1lds\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: I forgot, if you want to get back to your standard camera stup double press the middle mouse button. Another cool thing: Enabling the \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 in the settings you can actually lock your camera to a certain part. Just rightclick a part and press on \u0022set camera\u0022 or something like that.\u00A0Normally KSP focuses the center of mass of a craft which can be weird for making videos from time to time. You can also lock the camera to a part which is not on your current craft. This means you can control your craft and use a secondary one as a \u0022camera car\u0022 lol. if you put the camera car on plane wheels it will simply roll in a direction while you perform some action with another around it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-16T21:01:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2017 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LukasKerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
