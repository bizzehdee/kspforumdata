The problem is, the station looks like a patchwork weave of various ships and parts at all different angles and such. For example, two sets of solar arrays are not lying in the same plane, and it just looks unprofessional. The problem is, while docking i cant seem to get the camera to focus around my docking port. It always seems to center on what appears to be the center of mass of the ship, or at least a bit of distance away from the docking port. This, as you may be aware, makes docking more difficult because it creates poor camera angles in relation to the target docking port. A first person from the docking port would be great. Is there a way to remedy this or am I just being too weak willed in the art of docking? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T05:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDocking Camera\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Dulas","CreatedById":59172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T02:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, it helps out.
