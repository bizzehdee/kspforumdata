It doesn\u0027t need to look too much better (I use city lights/clouds and parts packs that may skew my idea of how it looks. I haven\u0027t seen Kerbin without clouds for a considrable amount of time). I definitly think though I prefer realism and playability over \u0027pretty,\u0027 after all it wasn\u0027t the graphics that attracted me in the first place. It was the use of real physics that appealed to me at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittle did I know then, that this game would ruin 95% of the science fiction movies and books for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying KSP as a science fiction fan, is a little like finding out Santa Clause isn\u0027t real........\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
