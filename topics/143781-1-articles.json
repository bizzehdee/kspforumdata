Now my question is, how do I use for example a specular map in Unity? (\u003Cem\u003EYeah yeah I know I probably should have figured that part out first \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/em\u003E). When I set the shader to \u0022Specular\u0022 or \u0022Bumped specular\u0022 in Unity I only get 2\u00A0texture slots. Logic would dictate that one slot is for the diffure texture and the other for the normal map. Where to I put the specular map?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read something about alpha channels and RGB and so on, but that makes absolutely no sence to me. I was hoping it was as easy as simply dropping a specular map into a texture slot and that was it, but I guess not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any KSP specific tutorials on how to do what I am failing to do? I want some of my fuel tanks to look more shiny and reflective, but not to the degree that the reflective module from Texture Replacer makes them. Simply setting the shader to specular and using the diffuse map makes the parts look like plastic rather than metallic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T12:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am no expert here, BUT I think that you somehow have to combine the specular map with your diffuse colour, so you need to adjust RGB, intensity, transparency for areas you want to be more shiny.

If you\u0027ve ever looked at a texture and noticed that most of it is invisible or nearly-invisible to the naked eye, that\u0027s an alpha blend (I think), and that\u0027s how I make things shiny or dull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use GIMP, so I don\u0027t know how similar the process is in other editing software.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I will create a new transparent layer on top of my texture. On this new transparent layer I will draw (or area fill, mostly) areas in varying degrees of opaque white. 99% opacity will result in the shiniest of area, 1% in the dullest. 100% and 0% have always resulted in a blank spot on the texture for me. Anyhow, once you\u0027ve drawn or otherwise denoted your shiny versus dull areas, create a layer mask on THIS layer and select \u0022greyscale copy of layer\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow create a layer mask on your texture layer, and select White or Full Opacity.
