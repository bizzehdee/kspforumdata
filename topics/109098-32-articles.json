Also, longer leading and trailing edges reduce drag as well (at least I suppose they reduce it - definitly not making it worse either way, except you can carry less fuel). And the wings seem kinda thick, might want to reduce at least the tip thickess too.\n\nAs for the turning, are you trying to turn with full fuel load? Pretty sure you don\u0027t need that much for an interceptor (assuming both white fuselage parts are LF tanks). Is the weight anywhere near the RL weight of Interceptors of that time? (max takeoff weight for the HA-300 would\u0027ve been about 5450kg, and it\u0027s 8625kg for the MiG-21 F13)\n\nStill no idea \u0027bout the wobble though.

I know that is an unrealistic amount but this configuration is required for balance as the empty center of mass is right between two sections and the plane does not have a lot of tolerance for the center of mass changes at all. Probably best way would be to try and replace both of those with structural parts and stick as much fuel in the wing as possible as it would be in real life.\n\nIt was never actually expected to fly with the full load all the time though.

If you attempted low speed high G maneuvers it would buffet violently till it stalled hard.  \n\nIf you are flying with SAS turned on it will bounce in game due to the way SAS works in KSP.

I\u0027m not sure what exactly is responsible for damping it, but it seems to be less severe with a smaller horizontal stabilizer farther from the center of mass, compared to a big one close to the CoM.  Unfortunately, it\u0027s difficult to avoid exciting it if you\u0027re controlling your plane with a keyboard.  The usual suggestion is to avoid sudden stick movements, but the keyboard only gives you full deflection or no deflection.  If you\u0027re PWM-ing with a keyboard, I think you\u0027d be less likely to excite that mode if your PWM frequency was well above the frequency of the oscillation.  You might try moving fuel toward the nose and tail, away from the CoM, in order to increase the moment of inertia and therefore the period of the oscillation.\n\nRemember lift is roughly proportional to the square of speed, so at high speed you don\u0027t need much wing to produce a lot of lift (and a high g-load). But also remember centripetal acceleration is v^2/r, and rate of turn (\u03C9) is v/r. For a fixed g-loading limit (either of the plane or of the pilot), if you double the speed, you have to quadruple the turn radius, which means you halve the turn rate. Conversely, you can double the turn rate by halving the speed. If you want a high turn rate without ripping the wings off or chunky salsa ruling the pilot, you can turn at lower speed, but you need more wing to produce the same g-loading.  Interceptors were mainly designed for climbing fast and flying fast, with less emphasis on low-speed maneuverability.  At high speed, maneuverability is going to be limited by structure or physiology."},{"CreatedByName":"NotAnAimbot","CreatedById":151034,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T23:39:23Z","Content":"How do you place struts without your plane looking like Frankenstein?

Big elevator and low stability means you need less deflection to reach high AoAs - small elevator and high stability means you need high control surface deflection. A low wing-loading plane may also be able to get away with lower AoAs, and lower elevator deflection. And you can also use engine gimbal to assist you, if you somehow manage to pull enough when landing (maybe additional deflection as flap or stuff)."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul_Sawyer","CreatedById":152646,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T21:49:05Z","Content":"I\u0027m having spaceplane fever ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n![DVTecJ0.png](http://i.imgur.com/DVTecJ0.png)  \n  \n![FDpNumz.png](http://i.imgur.com/FDpNumz.png)  \n  \n![PRcvkGQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/PRcvkGQ.png)  \n  \n![2L8MxO4.png](http://i.imgur.com/2L8MxO4.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T13:00:55Z","Content":"Ive been working on a new aircraft :\n\n![Sstu8Zd.png](http://i.imgur.com/Sstu8Zd.png)\n\n![XeBFDXh.png](http://i.imgur.com/XeBFDXh.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T13:05:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Good_Cat","CreatedById":137286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T23:50:19Z","Content":"Has anyone got a working Skylon lookalike working.  \n\nI\u0027m a FAR noob.  \n\nI\u0027ve got the basics like area ruling down but i\u0027ve nothing to compare mine to in terms of Cl and Cd figures along with what speeds / altitude should be stable at.

However that\u0027s the \\*science\\* of it.  What you really need to know is the \\*engineering\\* perspective of it.  Here\u0027s the quick guide to FAR plane design:  \n\n1. Go into the FAR menu in SPH and open the static analysis.  Click \u0027run analysis\u0027 and make sure there are no red numbers at 0.35 and 1.35 mach.\n\n2. Lower the 0.35 until red numbers appear.  Never go below this mach # when flying.  (make sure to have the FAR window open in flight - also set your airspeed indication to indicated knots EAS.   This is what real aircraft use and is critical to knowing how much lift you\u0027re getting.  Your surface speed is pretty much irrelevant when you want to know your V speeds and stall speeds).\n\n3. Now open the transonic design.  click the middle radio button for the yellow line.  The flatter it is the less mach buffeting you will get in the transonic zone (0.80 to 1.20 mach), and the less likely you are to have serious aerodynamic issues at high speed.\n\n4. Are you using adjustable landing gear?  If not get it immediately.  This part isn\u0027t really FAR related but if you can\u0027t get the plane off the runway, FAR doesn\u0027t matter.  Use adjustable landing gear and never touch stock gear again.  ALG gives you an alignment indicator.  Make sure your wheels are not aligned to point away from the craft centerline.  If they are, use the rotation tool to fix that - about 1 degree of \u0022toe in\u0022 towards the centerline will make the craft stable on the runway.  This does not apply to the nose gear.  Leave that alone as far as rotational alignment, but make sure it\u0027s shorter than the mains - you want 1 to 5 degrees of pitch down when sitting on the runway.  Set your spring and dampers to almost max on all gear.  Set main gear brake torque to between 60-100 depending on craft weight, and set the brake torque on the nose wheel to half of what you\u0027ve set on the mains.  Turn shielding on for all gear.  Now FAR is relevant because you won\u0027t crash on takeoff or on your landing rollout ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  \n\n5. Use the FAR yaw stability helper when flying in atmosphere, even if you\u0027re using an autopilot.  This is like the yaw damper on real jets.  It helps.\n\n6. Mechjeb even with the FAR helper module is not that great.  Kramax autopilot is a million times better than mechjeb for flying within atmosphere.  It is however completely useless in space, so I use both MJ2 and Kramax.\n\n7. Kramax likes triangle shaped planes.  It can\u0027t follow a glideslope worth a \\*\\*\\*\\* if you have a plane with horizontal stabilizers and wings placed like on a commercial airliner.  Especially if you 1. have flaps and 2. use the flaps.  So you may need to control pitch yourself unless you have a triangle shaped plane (like the US space shuttle, with no independent elevators).  \n\nFollow the above tips and you too can have a fun and stable SSTO spaceplane that can land safely back on the KSC runway.  I also recommend KSP Interstellar Extended, because who \\*doesn\u0027t\\* like antimatter-powered thermonuclear hybrid turbojet/rocket engines giving you 80k dV in a Mark3 spaceplane?  I know I do ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nHere\u0027s a picture of one of my most successful designs.  This shape works well, and at about 25% fuel has a stall speed well under 200kts EAS, making it easy to land.  It\u0027s also got ATILLA arcjet VTOL engines with enough thrust to do a VTOL landing \\*anywhere\\*, even Eve.  The engines are also from KSPIE.  If you make a spaceplane using this layout (modify to suit), you\u0027ll have good results aerodynamically.\n\n![yynrej2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yynrej2.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-19T09:03:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2016 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ss8913**"},{"CreatedByName":"Good_Cat","CreatedById":137286,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T12:13:08Z","Content":"I\u0027ve done a lot of reading but the information I\u0027ve got nothing to apply or relate it to.  \n\nWhat the difference between the Cross Sectional Are Curve and Curvature Cross Sectional Area curve.  \n\nI understand how the Green line is calculated by lateral cross section area not the yellow, does it have something to do with Sears-Haack body.  \n\nThe Blue line is air pressure so im expecting a positive spike at the nose followed by negative then shouldn\u0027t there be another positive spike on the leading edge and trailing edge, im thinking where the mach cones would be created or has this line something to do with aerodynamic drag??  \n\nWhy the large spike on the trailing edge  \n\nI build this in stock and have tweaked it in FAR\n\n![mt9JCBa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mt9JCBa.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"darkracer125","CreatedById":159295,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T18:09:34Z","Content":"it seems that stock airplane parts do not work in my game. \n\nc7 aerospace does not provide lift.

Can you tell me where the chain brakes:\n\n1. An increased \u0022q\u0022 means a faster pitch up rotation around the center of mass. The command pod will go (faster) towards up and the wing parts (faster) toward down.\n2. When the increased \u0022q\u0022 makes the wing parts move (faster) downwards the lift of the wings is increased.\n3. The increased lift makes the entire craft (center of mass) accelerate upwards.\n4. Upwards is \u003Cu\u003Eopposite\u003C/u\u003E to the positive Z-axis direction; the acceleration caused by increased \u0022q\u0022 is thus negative."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T00:32:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Good\\_Cat said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve done a lot of reading but the information I\u0027ve got nothing to apply or relate it to.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E What the difference between the Cross Sectional Are Curve and Curvature Cross Sectional Area curve.  \n\u003E \n\u003E I understand how the Green line is calculated by lateral cross section area not the yellow, does it have something to do with Sears-Haack body.  \n\u003E \n\u003E The Blue line is air pressure so im expecting a positive spike at the nose followed by negative then shouldn\u0027t there be another positive spike on the leading edge and trailing edge, im thinking where the mach cones would be created or has this line something to do with aerodynamic drag??  \n\u003E \n\u003E Why the large spike on the trailing edge  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I build this in stock and have tweaked it in FAR\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E [![mt9JCBa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mt9JCBa.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/mt9JCBa.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nHave you tried the mod Dynamic Deflection ?
