Interstellar goes a little further down the realism spectrum and has a LOT of moving parts to play with, but Near Future is a lot more stock-like.\n\nAlso, check out the Karbonite and Asteroid Recycling Technologies mods if you\u0027re interested in ships that can refuel themselves by mining. There are others but those are my favorite. ^^\n\nAs far as stock equipment, you\u0027ll generally burn less fuel getting to orbit by building a jet-powered ascent vehicle. In space, atomic and ion drives have the highest fuel efficiency of any drive. Sometimes, however, the more efficient options surprisingly may not include either of those components, especially if you keep your payload as light as possible. ^^ It\u0027s a fun challenge getting places the \u0027conventional\u0027 way using as little fuel as possible.\n\nEDIT\n\nI think Interstellar has/had a Solar Sail, though it packs more oomph than it realistically would for the sake of not being boring as heck. =P"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:10:42Z","Content":"There is a proposed type of propulsion called a magsail. It\u0027s similar to a solar sail, except that it uses magnetism instead of light, allowing it to be pushed by the solar wind.\n\nThe \u0022sail\u0022 is actually a huge loop of high temperature superconducting cable. When deployed, the cable is uncoiled and magnetically repulsed into shape. Using high temperature superconductors means that once electrical current is flowing through the cable, it will keep going indefinitely, meaning that the spacecraft doesn\u0027t have to generate huge amounts of power to maintain the field. The power to get the current going is provided by solar panels.\n\nOnce the magnetic field is up and running, the spacecraft is generating it\u0027s own magnetosphere. This protects the crew from solar flare radiation and allows the spacecraft to be pushed along by the solar wind. Steering can be achieved by varying the current in the cable, which would affect the force balance between the push of the solar wind and the pull of the Sun\u0027s gravity. Steering cables can be used to pull on the magnetic cable to distort the shape of the cable loop and thus distort the shape of the magnetic field.\n\nMany planets have their own magnetosphere, which blocks the solar wind. In this case, a spacecraft in a polar orbit can use the sail to push against the planet\u0027s magnetic field each time it passes over the poles. This would allow it to perform a series of periapsis kicks to make it\u0027s orbit more and more eccentric, eventually escaping into solar orbit.\n\nThe advantage of all this is that once you\u0027ve got your spacecraft into orbit, it can perform propellant free spaceflight to wherever you want to go.\n\nIf you want an eco friendly way to get it into orbit, you could consider using methane derived from biomass as the rocket fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:11:13Z","Content":"I can also recommend KSPI. It\u0027s not terribly realistic that it calls liquidfuel hydrogen, because liquidfuel is quite a lot denser than hydrogen is, but it works. For the most part, I think the complexity of getting the mods various engines to work (combined with their truly ludicrous mass) makes them relatively balanced, but I think NFT is still a better (albeit far less realistic) option if it\u0027s game balance you\u0027re after. \n\nAs for eco-friendliness, it\u0027s your call whether or not nuclear rockets are eco-friendly. Sure, they don\u0027t use fossil fuels, but then neither do HLOX rockets. They often need less propellant than chemical rockets, but they also have that pesky radiation thing going against them. \n\nIf it\u0027s really electric rockets you\u0027re after, I recommend Interstellar\u0027s beamed power mechanics. It can be a little tricky to figure out and set up (and nobody who\u0027s worked on the mod to date, be it the original creator or anyone else, as managed to squash all its bugs), but it does indeed let you launch things to space with quite low propellant costs, and no dangerous nuclear fuels carried on the beam-powered ascenders. \n\nAnd, of course, it opens the door to [planes which can reach escape velocity at one and a half kilometers above the water](http://i.imgur.com/X5Tq4Bu.png)."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:53:14Z","Content":"Use a K-drive?

Conventional rockets do this by releasing chemical energy stored in the bonds of molecules, thereby heating the matter and expelling it out a nozzle. Ion drives expel ionized Xenon using an electrostatic or electromagnetic field instead, but this still spits ions (which is matter) out at high speed. Ion drives have a TWR of less than 1 in Kerbin\u0027s gravity, meaning that no matter how many Ion drives you put on a craft, it will never lift it off the surface (because the engine can\u0027t even lift itself).\n\nI guess the Alcubierre drive (warp drive) works by warping spacetime instead of expelling matter. I think that\u0027s the only drive that fits your criteria of using only electric power, strictly speaking, but it is only a theoretical device at this point. I also have not installed this mod so I don\u0027t know if it can be used on the launchpad.\n\nSo I guess I actually would like to ask you to expound on your goals here. By \u0022ethical means\u0022 do you mean that you want to minimize the carbon footprint of your launch vehicle and payload? Many real life rockets use solid boosters which contain caustic chemicals, so you\u0027d definitely avoid those. Many liquid fuel boosters use kerosene and liquid oxygen, which releases CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, so you\u0027d want to avoid that too. But the conventional rocket with the highest Isp today happens to be liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. That chemical reaction creates heat, light, and water as the only products of combustion. Ironically, water vapor is in fact a greenhouse gas, but it\u0027s not nearly the concern that CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is today, as water vapor condenses into clouds and later falls as rain. Sequestering CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E takes a little longer via photosynthesis or dissolving into the oceans, but I digress.\n\nDropping spent stages is arguably more ecologically unfriendly (or \u0022unethical\u0022 if you prefer the term). You\u0027re basically littering, but also wasting all the energy that went into producing the rocket, the tanks, the electronics, the lubricants, etc. Consider parachuting them to the ground and recovering them, or only building SSTOs that are based on liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen rocket engines. The \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 burned by the KSP turbojet/rapier/etc I am assuming is a hydrocarbon mix of some kind, like kerosene."},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:41:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In order to produce thrust in a vacuum, you must throw matter in the opposite direction you want to go.\n\nA solar sail theoreticly does not require the craft to expel mater for a velocity change.

With that mod you could potentialy get into orbit with no fuel, just a crap ton of reactor power. A craft could use a thermal turbojet to put it on a suborbital trajectory, basicly sucking in air and spiting it out the back faster. Once up above atmo kick in the quantum vacuum thrusters to reach orbit and you could then go wherever without need for fuel as long as your reactor held out.

Nasa is runing tests on a prototype but they are geting inconclusive results. The prototype did generate some small amount of force but strangely so did the supposedly inert control test.
