It\u0027s similar to a solar sail, except that it uses magnetism instead of light, allowing it to be pushed by the solar wind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022sail\u0022 is actually a huge loop of high temperature superconducting cable. When deployed, the cable is uncoiled and magnetically repulsed into shape. Using high temperature superconductors means that once electrical current is flowing through the cable, it will keep going indefinitely, meaning that the spacecraft doesn\u0027t have to generate huge amounts of power to maintain the field. The power to get the current going is provided by solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the magnetic field is up and running, the spacecraft is generating it\u0027s own magnetosphere. This protects the crew from solar flare radiation and allows the spacecraft to be pushed along by the solar wind. Steering can be achieved by varying the current in the cable, which would affect the force balance between the push of the solar wind and the pull of the Sun\u0027s gravity. Steering cables can be used to pull on the magnetic cable to distort the shape of the cable loop and thus distort the shape of the magnetic field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany planets have their own magnetosphere, which blocks the solar wind. In this case, a spacecraft in a polar orbit can use the sail to push against the planet\u0027s magnetic field each time it passes over the poles. This would allow it to perform a series of periapsis kicks to make it\u0027s orbit more and more eccentric, eventually escaping into solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of all this is that once you\u0027ve got your spacecraft into orbit, it can perform propellant free spaceflight to wherever you want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an eco friendly way to get it into orbit, you could consider using methane derived from biomass as the rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can also recommend KSPI.

Conventional rockets do this by releasing chemical energy stored in the bonds of molecules, thereby heating the matter and expelling it out a nozzle. Ion drives expel ionized Xenon using an electrostatic or electromagnetic field instead, but this still spits ions (which is matter) out at high speed. Ion drives have a TWR of less than 1 in Kerbin\u0027s gravity, meaning that no matter how many Ion drives you put on a craft, it will never lift it off the surface (because the engine can\u0027t even lift itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the Alcubierre drive (warp drive) works by warping spacetime instead of expelling matter. I think that\u0027s the only drive that fits your criteria of using only electric power, strictly speaking, but it is only a theoretical device at this point. I also have not installed this mod so I don\u0027t know if it can be used on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess I actually would like to ask you to expound on your goals here. By \u0022ethical means\u0022 do you mean that you want to minimize the carbon footprint of your launch vehicle and payload? Many real life rockets use solid boosters which contain caustic chemicals, so you\u0027d definitely avoid those. Many liquid fuel boosters use kerosene and liquid oxygen, which releases CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, so you\u0027d want to avoid that too. But the conventional rocket with the highest Isp today happens to be liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. That chemical reaction creates heat, light, and water as the only products of combustion. Ironically, water vapor is in fact a greenhouse gas, but it\u0027s not nearly the concern that CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is today, as water vapor condenses into clouds and later falls as rain. Sequestering CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E takes a little longer via photosynthesis or dissolving into the oceans, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDropping spent stages is arguably more ecologically unfriendly (or \u0022unethical\u0022 if you prefer the term). You\u0027re basically littering, but also wasting all the energy that went into producing the rocket, the tanks, the electronics, the lubricants, etc. Consider parachuting them to the ground and recovering them, or only building SSTOs that are based on liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen rocket engines. The \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 burned by the KSP turbojet/rapier/etc I am assuming is a hydrocarbon mix of some kind, like kerosene.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn order to produce thrust in a vacuum, you must throw matter in the opposite direction you want to go. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solar sail theoreticly does not require the craft to expel mater for a velocity change.
