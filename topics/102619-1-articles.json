Both times I\u0027ve attempted this, near the top of the arc, I lose control of my capsule, I can\u0027t command Crew Reports, No Mystery Goo Reports, No Science experiments. The game still steems responsive, I can click on capsule components and get status reading which appear normal, my pilot seems happy, I can select parachute deployment, but I have to get to a lower altitude before things start working normally. What am I missing?
