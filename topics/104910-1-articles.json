Duna is only about 1,000m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to get to, you can aerobrake and parachute so capture and landing is free, and getting back up and home again is only a couple of thousand. A couple of FL-T800\u0027s will do it with a single nuke to push them.\n\nWithout nukes, whatever it takes you to have 3,500\u002Bm/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV in LKO. Still not a huge rocket if you build efficiently.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T05:06:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T05:27:23Z","Content":"The left hand side of this craft (i.e. dump the lander) will get back from Duna with a full tank.

The delta-v budget was rather tight, but getting rid of the heat shield would probably fix that and let you get away with a lighter launch stage as well.
