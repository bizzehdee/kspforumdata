You can turn them on or off either by right clicking or with action groups. They only strut across one vessel so if you have some reinforcing a decoupler or docking port, once you detach, they will be put in \u0027standby\u0027 until you reattach something that hits their line of sight. Don\u0027t point them at each other or massless parts because Bad Things happen. If you use them reinforce an Infernal Robotics joint, be sure to deactivate them before moving the joint or Bad Things will happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strut gun and quantum strut are functionally the same thing, they just look different.
