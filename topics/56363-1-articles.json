Or, recovering a heavy capsule plus its Kerbals from one of Kerbin\u0027s poles, or mountain tops might take several days and lots of cash (representing heavy-lift helicopters, mountaineering expeditions, and/or long range transport aircraft flights).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps further down the line, this could be fleshed out - you could see the tug boats leaving a dock in the Space Centre view, for example; or have pre-positioned recovery boats to get things back quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not suggesting the player should have to build the vehicles involved, you could maybe have stock boats, which are more like moving buildings from a developer\u0027s perspective, with tow lines for dragging large floating parts and cranes for lifting valuable smaller parts (i.e. capsules and their contents).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore recovery options, and there should be some sort of cost to pressing the recover button, depending on the location.
