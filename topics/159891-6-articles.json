So probably it would stay clean, and you would have the car go to a service site every few hours to be detailed and put back on the road. One of the solutions my family had that saved time and money (particularly for you people) was they would park at my house and I would drive 3 or 4 people to work. Given the cost of parking it smart to spread the cost out. But another solution to the crowding problem is to put a higher value on living close to work and put a higher tariff on living far from work. Even if you have autonomous cars being shared it does not get rid of the commute problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere we had nice farmland south of the city, prone to flooding but people would build these planned communities. The houses got built and then all of a sudden, within 4 years traffic went from being a small to a huge problem. Many people I knew that moved into big houses in new suburbia, moved into much smaller houses more expensive houses in town. Big houses can be big head-aches there are intangible cost to complicating your life with big commutes. The reason this happened is that cities manage development, typically if a metro sprawls out of its county then there is essentially no planning in the adjacent county for a decade or more. There are no trains that go to those areas, no public buses, . . . .IOW people get forced onto the road or very expensive private transportation systems. So the solution is really reactive mass transit, 6 people need a ride from points A,B,C,D,E,F close to point P to point Q close to destination U,V,W,X,Y,Z,\u00A0 where between P and Q is some overcrowded corridor. So cars are dispatched picking up A\u0027B, C\u0027D, E\u0027F (you could even have people bicycling to point P) and brings them to P where they get in car, use the HOV lane, get off, head to destination point Q again redistribute the passengers (maybe a bike-share in centers) to U\u0027V, W\u0027X, Y\u0027Z and then to final destinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother benefit of a properly structured route is that you can use all electric cars, they drive a set distance, recharge, drive the same set distance back, recharge . . . . . .Thus you can get rid of pollutants. And because they are small they don\u0027t have the problem of trains (traffic obstruction in redesigning unplanned cities) and buses (obstruction of traffic).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIM all for this but the problem is that people are married to cars, and they really don\u0027t think about this kind of economization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-27T23:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223279370\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517096747\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIM all for this but the problem is that people are married to cars, and they really don\u0027t think about this kind of economization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey won\u0027t have to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay you buy a self-driving car. Your brand is tied to a ride-sharing app (or apps) of your choice (uber, lyft, whatever). As the car owner, you have a setup for your vehicle. You might say that you don\u0027t want it used at night (drunks, etc). You free the car only after 8:30 am or something (it drives you to work, via the kids\u0027 school, for example). It then takes rides for $$, but it is set such that it takes no rides that cannot guarantee it is back in your office parking lot at 5:30. You might have it tied to your calendar app, so that on a given Tuesday it makes sure to be at one school to take one of your kids to practice, then back to work, then it takes you to see the last 30 minutes of practice OTW home, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be made really easy for people to customize.

People put subways in Tokyo, which doesn\u0027t seem like a problem until you realize that most of the subterranean part of the system is below sea-level _AND_ it is one of the most seismically active places in the world _AND_ the soil in Tokyo is notorious for undergoing liquefaction during Earthquakes. But with the right clearances and engineering you can get it to work and survive Earthquakes (although the great Kanto is yet to come). I been on Tokyo subway a few times, you can see some of the mitigate engineering, its a rather utilitarian system. . . not much of\u00A0 a tourist thing, but it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I hit the nail on the Head. People wonder \u0022how do people survive in Japan without cars\u0022. If you lived in Japan a long time you might wander why people in the US go everywhere in their cars. In Japan you get out of your house, you walk to a train station, meh 6 or 7 minutes later your at a distribution center, and then maybe a shinkansen after about 3 minutes buying a ticket,\u00A0 . . . . .and then you are within an hour at a destination 250 km away, and then you stop, grab your gear, walk or take\u00A0 a taxi to your final.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the US, you get in your car, drive 30 minutes to an Airport, 15 minutes or more to park your car, wait for 1.5 hours to get on a flight, fly for 45 minutes, wait for the airplane to unload, go through security and/or retrieve your bag, hail a taxi drive another 30 minutes to your destination. You spend twice as much time, and probably paid in total (time and expense) 50% more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes Japan is surreal. I remember a trip one time between Kochi and another city along the inland sea, you get on the train, and then the train stops, and you are dropped on a makeshift platform in the middle of nowhere (and if there is a nowhere in Japan, I found it). And you wait, and wait, and wait . . .a farmer walks buy and offers to sell you some oranges. .and you wait some more, and wait. And then a rail-bus comes (a single car slightly bigger than a school bus) and you go off\u00A0 into the \u0027late paleolithic\u0027 and for an hour or and then you see a person, then another person, and finally at your destination you see more than afew people. BUt even that, despite the apparent backwards-ness of it all, still works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems get solved when people have a great desire to solve them. Some times the solutions are simple and sometimes sophisticated, but with no planning there is one solution, every man for himself . . .and inevitably your have freeways with intersections that are 20 x 20 lanes wide with the highest hiway death fatality rates per mile that one can dream of.

Not everyone has cars, one of the neighborhoods I stayed in only 2 of 5 houses had a car, 2 had a motor scooter, one was an elderly woman. Its different, if you want to go to the shopping mall, most of these are integrated with the major train stations (so no benefit there). If you want to go out to dinner, alot of them are either walking distance, close to a train station. Grocery stores, usually there is on close to the train station, but they are in walking distances, smaller, more compact, and more of them. We wanted to go to a restaurant (one of those hole in the wall 5 star things) we had to take a bus, you could park, thats not the problem, but its just so much of a hassle to drive. Also you need to have a car park, because the streets are a US\u00A0 drive way wide and there is no room on the side to park. The cars are quite a bit smaller than ours, this allows them to fit in make shift driveways. Then there is driving in the country, and it can be a real chore, speed limits on Japanese hiways are typically 40 to 50 km/h which is 25 to 30 mph, and you might think that is bad, but some of the roads are like a bucket of snakes, i takes hours to go short distances some time. So you pay.\u00A0 Typically when we drove, we had an agenda, we went to this open market, that park, this restaurant, that seafood house, this specialty shop . . . . . . Once your are out and on the move you connect the dots. When you travel they will tell you, take this bus, its faster than train, or don\u0027t take the bus, takes five hours (its stops at residences along the way) and train takes 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-28T03:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223279346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517095135\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany, possibly most autonomous cars will in fact be shared, that\u0027s kind of the point. 99.99% of the time, every car is idle.
