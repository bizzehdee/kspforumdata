Fanworks subforums are one of the most brutal areas on the Internet, not because they are unfriendly, but because of the fact that the people on these subforums have high expectations and detest change, no matter how interesting, ambitious or quirky that change may be. Being a fan fiction writer myself(kind of) I haven\u0027t had much sucess, mainly because of certain barriers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first major barrier is the fact no matter how much you update, people are going to lose interest. Some people don\u0027t have the time or energy to write or draw everyday, and even if you want to some event is going to get in the way. The damage is not done to the object of interest, but the creator of said object. It can be quite disheartening to see people essentially ignore your work, even if they are interested. People don\u0027t seem to realize how important a comment on work actually is. A bit of praise or constructive criticism can fuel people\u0027s desire to work because they feel like they have made a difference, a change that has affected someone positively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second barrier is people\u0027s expectations and customs. There is little to say here except that people should attempt to be open minded and read what they normally wouldn\u0027t. Not only for the people who are writing these, but also for yourself. You might like something you though you would hate, or vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thank you for essentially reading me rant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rewdew2","CreatedById":26388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T23:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, i agree with this (mostly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to write a fanfiction for KSP, however, people quickly lost interest, and I sort of gave up on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow i mostly make 3D pictures, because they\u0027re easier for me to make than a 3000 word story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I think about it, I haven\u0027t really been ready many of the writings, and I guess that\u0027s on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, now that I think about it.

I like to think that I\u0027d be persevering with my own story regardless but being honest with myself, at the least, I would probably have been a lot slower to release updates.

The fan-art crowd is normally pretty small, and worse, insular. So there is only so much traction a piece can get when its released in a small art club every week. Two things help with this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, write/draw/design for yourself first. This is good advice for any situation.
