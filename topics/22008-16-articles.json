Usually I do not add textures until it is almost done. When you are doing the UV unwrap, are you doing box or something? I would think that would work after the rest is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pfpants\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pfpants\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to display the inflatable balloons in their packed form in VAB? I\u0027d like to tuck them away for easier visibility. I know some of the B9 parts (cargo bays) allow you to modify their state in the VAB by using the action groups tab, but this doesn\u0027t currently work with the balloons. Maybe something in the .cfg? Thanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I do not plan on implementing that.

I think my main issue before is I was doing all my selections for unwrapping in vert selection, so much easyer if you do it in face selection. I still cant seem to get a part to show in KSP strait from blender, my guess is im adding colliders wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
