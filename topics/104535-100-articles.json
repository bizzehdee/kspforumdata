The fact that bunch of other users are properly installed mod and use it without issues does not mean that you don\u0027t have any. But it is hard for any developer to help you without enough data. Several things could help others to be able to help you.

Even if you install this mod properly it can always be conflict somewhere with any other mod. That is a reason that is good to start with clean install of KSP and add only IR mod and dependencies (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E, Firespitter and IR mod) - all provided in wraped package from Zodiusinfuser. You can make a copy of KSP in separate folder to make a clean install just for test purposes.\n\nOnce you have only IR mod and dependencies installed try it in game. Provide some screenshots that would reveal what parts you are tried to use. There is some free moving parts and powered ones. You can\u0027t influence how free moving parts would move, only motorized ones. Also, there was some issues with old legacy parts, screenshot would reveal if that is issue too. If you are able to have IR parts moving properly (you need battery and power source on your craft for that, make sure that IR parts have crossfeed connection to power source).\n\nIf everything works, add other mods you use one by one, until you find culprit mod that cause issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T12:39:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On \u200E21\u200E.\u200E01\u200E.\u200E2018 at 5:11 PM, Rryk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t seem to build anything that would have two Flat Hinge Pivotrons attached to the same part and work.
