I am 99.9% sure the original models and textures are just the ones off of NASA\u0027s website as they look identical down to poly count and texture pixel density, so you should be thanking NASA/JPL.\n\nReally ?

The SRBs need to be slightly smaller. Only because one you put on nosecones then they would seem too tall. An inaccurate way of measuring is the tip of the nosecones should be right before the dome begins on the ET.

You are doing great work on the Shuttle. It will wonderful when everything is said and done. However what\u0027s the point of having a shuttle without payloads? So........the ISS community pack has atrophied and although it is mainly a parts pack, it just doesn\u0027t work right. It throws a whole bunch of null references, the docking ports seem to not be working properly and the solar arrays cause games to crash. I was wondering, since you are working on the shuttle maybe when you are 100% done with it you could take a look at the ISS pack. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a lot of work but seemingly is just some cfg work because the parts are just parts. Then if Dragon fixes the Soyuz and balances it. Real world infrastructure can finally be working in game again. Just a thought...."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:28:12Z","Content":"yeah id be happy to have a go at it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wuwuk","CreatedById":138928,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:33:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yeah id be happy to have a go at it.\n\nWe will help you to work on ISS ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ."}]}
