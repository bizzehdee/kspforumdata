If the part reports a small crew capacity, Kerbals will be refused admittance even if the internal model is filled. On the other hand, if the part reports a larger capacity, the internal\u0027s seat count will dictate the refusal. This is straightforward to deal with, if it\u0027s what I cared about. I can tweak the part\u0027s field directly, and can remove and add seats from the internal model\u0027s data structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, in the editor, automatic crew filling is governed by the prefab data. This means that in order to change the way the crew filler behaves, I have to change the prefab. This is undesirable: because the prefab is the \u0022master\u0022 data for all future instances of the part, and because the editor does not entirely start parts up the way flight does, changing the prefab has very extensive interactions with future instances of parts. I\u0027ve found suitable places to reset the prefab value, but it still produces behavior that IMO users will find confusing or unacceptable. Just because I can do something doesn\u0027t mean I should. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think about it, the more I think that the right way to do this is to use a partless plugin that just gives a \u0022Disable automatic crew assignment\u0022 toggle in the editor; on the Toolbar or near the crew assignment button, perhaps. From there the process should be simpler; if I don\u0027t care about assigning specific values, I ought to be able to deal with the problem from a different perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T08:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MKI\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MKI\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...
