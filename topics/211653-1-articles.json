Bill EVA and could not deploy anything so I saved and restarted. Bill could no longer be selected or controlled. I EVA Bob. He could not deploy anything either. I exited completely and restarted. Now both Bill and Bob are standing on Mun and cannot be selected or controlled. They have no portraits. I really don\u0027t want to start over.
