I think I now have it fixed so that doesn\u0027t happen without a bit more effort. However, if you find new ways to bash into the site, I\u0027d appreciate you letting me know in private rather than making it public so I can fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the difference is, popularity. Kerbal Stuff is based on the number of followers and/or number of downloads. While either of these give some indication of a mod\u0027s popularity, that\u0027s still not a lot of information to determine if it\u0027s a good mod. FAR is top on KS... I\u0027d never use it personally. Kerbaltopia will (eventually) present a number of pieces of data that users can determine the \u0027value\u0027 of the mod. The one I consider most valuable, each mod will have it\u0027s own separate user comments and no, you don\u0027t have to log in to leave them but they are moderated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere Kerbal Stuff presents raw facts and figures, Kerbaltopia will present opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, do you really want your mod host to get into the business of comment debates? I\u0027m pretty sure that SirCmpwn has the ability to code comments into Kerbal Stuff and could have at any time. But I get the feeling that he didn\u0027t so that he can remain unbiased about being the host. And, in my opinion, and it\u0027s just my opinion, he should remain unbiased. I, using his data, am not under that obligation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also thought it might be nice to let those that create the mods see what an anonymous opinion of their mod is. I can think of nowhere else they can get that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no \u0027perfect\u0027 solution to determine what makes a good mod or a bad one. I\u0027m merely trying to offer an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Mods are just a starting point.
