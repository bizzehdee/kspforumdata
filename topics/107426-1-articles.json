A gravity turn has your engines firing prograde 100% of the time after the initial tilt of a few degrees. Whenever you aren\u0027t flying straight up or down, gravity will cause your prograde to move downwards. Thus gravity alone literally turns your velocity vector, the engines can then apply all of their thrust prograde with no steering losses while still following a good ascent profile. The shape of the profile can be tweaked by adjusting thrust, going faster will cause you to turn downwards more slowly, and vice versa.
