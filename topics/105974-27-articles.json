I\u0027d like to have some grand story to justify my absence but i don\u0027t. Truth be told I\u0027ve just had a very rough few months of school and other life related issues have gotten in the way of KSP modding. Heck i stopped playing KSP for quite awhile. However some new adventures in game design with some friends at school has convinced me to return. And lets just say i have some grand plans. However before i unveil them i do have some sad news.\n\nP.E.W is dead. I am allowing the continued version to remain up until Version 1 of its successor arrives. Please do not ask for an ETA just yet but Trust me it is coming. (insert George R.R. Martin joke here)\n\nMost of the Weapons currently in P.E.W will return in the new mod however i intend to update the textures and models to my standards before this.\n\nI will need to converse with the other major players in this little community of ours first so if you guys see this post send me a PM i need to get up to speed on the changes and have a few proposals of my own to make.\n\nA new thread for the coming mod will be posted once i have settled on a name.\n\nSpeaking of which cast a vote if you feel like it\n\n[https://strawpoll.com/bfgd27r](https://strawpoll.com/bfgd27r)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-30T19:54:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2017 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LORDPrometheus**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T20:14:23Z","Content":"Welcome back, and i look forward to handing the reins back to you.
