There exists only one launch vehicle IRL with a real cryogenic first stage: the Delta IV. And only the Heavy configuration actually flies in pure, unassisted hydrolox mode without boosters.

The low-thrust sustainer stage ignites on the pad together with the booster stage, which is generally made up of large solid rocket motors, and burns all the way to orbit. Examples for this are the Ariane 5, the STS (space shuttle), the HII-B and the planned SLS. The vast majority of launch vehicles meanwhile - Proton, Soyuz, all of the Long March\u0027s, the PSLV and GSLV\u0027s, Atlas V, Dnepr, Rokot, Safir, Simorgh, Falcon 9, Pegasus, Vega, Angara, Antares, Minotaur, Unha, Zenit etcetera etcetera all use kerosene, solid fuels or hypergolics in their ascent stages. The world-famous Satrun V moon rocket also used kerosene in its first stage, while both upper stages were cryogenic.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Someone really should make a high-tech composite LH2/Ox tanks mod ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) so that player could unlock 40% lighter LH2/ox tanks thus making cryogenic engines much more viable in later game.\n\nThe problem with composite tanks is that they dissolve or shatter when loaded with cryogenic fuel ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNo, really. The industry has desperately sought to make them work for a long time.

And they will not use them for \u0022hard cryogenic\u0022 fuels like hydrogen, but rather for the moderate to soft oxygen and methane. Nobody knows what they\u0027ve done to make it work yet, because they keep their secrets closely guarded and the rockets aren\u0027t flying yet.\n\nComposite tanks for cryogenic fuels are a future technology, and while that doesn\u0027t rule out a \u0022high tech\u0022 mod like you suggest, I just wanted to point out that it\u0027s far less simple than you think it is ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The tallest 3.75m tank has a cost of around 49k, just for the tank itself!\n\nNear Future engines, tanks and other equipment are all absurdly expensive because they outperform stock propulsion by so much (especially the hydrogen engines, which are statted up too good right now), and because they\u0027re not meant for expendable use. Those are not launch vehicle tanks, which are just barely sufficient shells around the fuel that only need to survive a couple minutes. They\u0027re things you\u0027re supposed to launch into space and then keep using over and over in orbital tugs, or to fly mission profiles so aggressive that no other solution can give you the dV.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E IIRC, the dry mass for LH2 tanks in this mod (and many others, except KSPI-E and possibly RF) includes the mass associated with the extra insulation, tank wall thickness, and machinery required for a *zero boiloff* LH2 tank.\n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps having some sort of boil-off would be usable? And if NFP is installed, maybe a module that takes a bit of power to keep the LH2 from boiling off.\n\nThis is correct. The LH2 tanks are inspired by those described by NASA in their Mars Design Reference Architecture for multi-year storage of hydrogen. That\u0027s why their mass ratios are around 3:1, while launch vehicle grade tanks can get as high as 15:1 - 20:1.\n\nThere will be no boiloff mechanics implemented unless Nertea changes his mind, because he has stated in the past that he doesn\u0027t care for it. It would require extra plugin coding just for a function that complicates things unnecessarily and potentially aggravates players. Near Future is not a realism mod, it is a stock extension. The amount of extra mechanics it has is already very large as is. And Cryogenic Engines is mostly a stand-alone engine pack that Nertea made because he randomly got inspired to model engines one day and people poked him to release them. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-22T07:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T08:12:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem with composite tanks is that they dissolve or shatter when loaded with cryogenic fuel ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E No, really.

These pay a mass penalty for insulation and active cryocooling, all of which are handwaved into a static tank with a certain dry mass for simplicity.
