Those are not launch vehicle tanks, which are just barely sufficient shells around the fuel that only need to survive a couple minutes.

The LH2 tanks are inspired by those described by NASA in their Mars Design Reference Architecture for multi-year storage of hydrogen. That\u0027s why their mass ratios are around 3:1, while launch vehicle grade tanks can get as high as 15:1 - 20:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be no boiloff mechanics implemented unless Nertea changes his mind, because he has stated in the past that he doesn\u0027t care for it. It would require extra plugin coding just for a function that complicates things unnecessarily and potentially aggravates players. Near Future is not a realism mod, it is a stock extension. The amount of extra mechanics it has is already very large as is. And Cryogenic Engines is mostly a stand-alone engine pack that Nertea made because he randomly got inspired to model engines one day and people poked him to release them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-22T07:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T08:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem with composite tanks is that they dissolve or shatter when loaded with cryogenic fuel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, really.
