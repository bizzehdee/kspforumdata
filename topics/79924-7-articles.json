If only that \u0022feature\u0022 was better documented, not just a generic \u0022Orbital telescopes also now become fundamental to discovering asteroids.\u0022 that tells nothing about why they aren\u0027t spawned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the while (but that is a KSP issue actually) asteroids should exist even if not visible, instead of being forbidden from existing because there are no tools to see them beyond some distance. If the feature (in KSP) existed so to be used properly, discovery odds should increase the closer an asteroid is (that could mean, a few asteroids may have acceptable odds to be spawned at closer range, instead of no chance at all when spawned at a greater distance). That also means, the moment a telescope is put in orbit, it can discover already existing asteroids, instead of just raising odds for new ones to be spawned.

The stars and galaxy are just pixels instead of points. Also, the galaxy on the skybox has the same inclination as all the planets. So whenever you try to take a snapshot of a planet there\u0027s always a giant grey pixel in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple solution is to use Texture replacer to get a different skybox (One with more black). A more elegant solution (on the side of the mod) would be to use the code from Distant Object Enhancement that blacks out the skybox and use that to hide the skybox when zooming the telescope. But that means extra work for Raven.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T18:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re my hero!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I am very much looking forward to you release! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
