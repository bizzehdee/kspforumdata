Before that I hadn\u0027t had any trouble since initially learning how to dock. \u00A0I have since\u00A0built a new pc and hooked up the x64 version so that I could play with a lot of mods (my modlist is in an image in the following dropbox folder link)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oiax7tjiritjigl/AABBT2QASW00JLElCZDVNrRJa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/oiax7tjiritjigl/AABBT2QASW00JLElCZDVNrRJa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I created the post I played around a bit.

This example shows the trouble I was having when I tried to connect any other ports on the station I started. The weird thing now is when I flip the tug around it connects with no trouble to the pod using a clamp o tron on the backside(circled in the image with the letter B).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I also uploaded a save with fewer\u00A0vessels (no luck docking.sfs) so maybe looking at the save something will stick out on the part, within the text, to more experienced eyes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what else I can add to make more sense!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T14:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBojc,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to be quite a naughty one... After several minutes of research, I can\u0027t find anything to point my finger at for your bug. The closest I\u0027ve found was a bug related to Hullcam VDS that would prevent you from docking, but you don\u0027t have that mod...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027ve found this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142382-clamp-o-tron-not-working-v113/\u0026amp;page=2\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some workaround in this, you\u0027ll need to try it.
