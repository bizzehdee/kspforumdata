They could walk around and do things, for sure- Their three-fingered hands were deft enough to manipulate tools, dig in the dirt, and of course open the little plastic wrappers on snacks. They could walk and talk and dream big about such things as flight, operating ground vehicles, and most importantly of all, going into space. However, it seemed that Kerbals could do no more than look up at the starlit night sky, watching the bright dots soar far overhead and lay just out of reach, and watch in awe as Kerbin\u0027s two moons dance in everlasting celestial harmony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, until Wernher von Kerman came along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVon Kerman was a revolutionary young Kerbal, with a knack for things that go \u003Cem\u003Eboom\u003C/em\u003E. Intelligent and charismatic, von Kerman had the sense about him to do what no other Kerbal could: Actually do something about going to space. It was, after all, the Kerbal\u0027s birthright. Von Kerman came up with the idea for the rocket, a great fire-spewing hunk of metal and dangerous explosive chemicals that theoretically had the power to punch through the atmosphere and send a payload into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVon Kerman assembled a team of the greatest Kerbal minds of the age (which is really saying something). Some childhood friends, some like-minded business associates, and some who were just along for the ride. One, however, had exactly what von Kerman needed: Funds. Glorious, glorious Funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaxwell Kerman was a true businesskerbal. The owner of a successful franchise of snack bars, he was drawn to von Kerman\u0027s big dreams and big plans, and luckily followed von Kerman\u0027s words and promises. With the help of a collaboration of savvy Kerbals the world over, the Kerbal Space Program was formed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocated on a flat, seaside plot of land on the southeastern tip of an empty continent, the Kerbal Space Center was built to house the fledgling Program, complete with all the necessary amenities: A launchpad for launching rockets, a Vehicle Assembly Building to assemble them, a runway and accompanying hangar for jet aircraft, a Mission Control facility to oversee operations, a tracking station to pin down where all their rockets ended up, a Research and Development laboratory for analyzing mission data and coming up with cool new space stuff, and to top it all off an office building for housing important Kerbal functions known as the Kosmonaut Complex. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaxwell Kerman, as the primary financial benefactor, was delegated the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Space Program, and as such made von Kerman his second in command. He promptly hired a board of directors, overseeing the several departments of the Program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the Kerbal Space Program was born! Its facilities constructed, its objectives set, its snacks delivered and categorized by name and color, the Program has already garnered the attention of the Kerbal press and promises the entire Kerbal species a new place in the universe. Only time will tell if things will work according to plan!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E-Back to top-\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2: Flying First\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Kerbal Space Program was set up and constructed. But who was going to fly first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the question that was on everybody\u0027s mind when the doors to the Kosmonaut Complex opened up to the public. There were crew quarters set up and all the facilities in place to support them, but the fact of the matter was that there were no Kerbals ready to go to fly yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher von Kerman, of course, would dearly have loved to fly into space, but he himself deemed his eyesight too poor to reliably function during a space mission, particularly in the early days when things \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ewere sure to go wrong\u003C/span\u003E had a higher chance of failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso not flying was the staff of the Kerbal Space Center, who were either too afraid to fly first or simply did not possess the correct qualities for operating such advanced and revolutionary technology. One day, however, von Kerman found two little r\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9sum\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s sitting in his inbox. Two r\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9sum\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s that would forever change the Kerbal flight crew roster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first belonged to Jebediah \u0022Jeb\u0022 Kerman. Jeb was a Kerbal who knew exactly what he wanted to do, but nobody else seemed to know what he wanted to do. Jebediah was more than a little crazy, but he wasn\u0027t afraid of anything. On the contrary, Jebediah loved explosions just as much as Wernher von Kerman did, and knew how to make things blow up better than anybody. He reveled in danger and new opportunity, and signed up without hesitation. It wasn\u0027t to prove a point, or to damage himself, he signed up because he wanted to, and it\u0027s as simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second r\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9sum\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 belonged to Valentina \u0022Val\u0022 Kerman. Valentina was almost the polar opposite of Jebediah: Calm, collected, always professional and always pretty. She had the capability to work with and analyze mechanical faults, and had been interested in science and engineering from a young age. More than anything, though, she wanted to fly. Normally, female Kerbals had next to no place in the so-called \u0022hard sciences,\u0022 but she was here to prove them wrong, and wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo von Kerman signed both of them up immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the board of directors felt that the first edition of the Kosmonaut Roster needed something else, something more. The Program had two capable pilots ready to go, but needed Kerbals to head up a different side of things. Two more picks were picked: Bill and Bob Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman was a very smart Kerbal. He was the appointed head of the Research and Development center, and knew how to do science. He loved collecting samples and looking at data, that wonderful data! He was the perfect choice for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman was just as intelligent, but headed up the Engineering department instead of the Science one. He loved to build things, and was especially interested in wheeled vehicles. He helped design the majority of the little roving vehicles seen transporting materials around the Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese additions to the Kosmonaut Roster were vital ones, and to designate their significance in the future of the Kerbal species, these four Kerbals were given orange spacesuits, indistinguishable from other spacesuits in everything except color. The Program was excited to have such an accomplished and eager crew, and nothing was going to hold them back!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E-Back to top-\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T14:33:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
