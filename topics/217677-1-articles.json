That said, I\u0027m curious which of these two part failure mods is better these days? I\u0027ve played with the old version of DangIt! (pre-continued) a decent amount, but back then OhScrap! was either not a thing yet or had just barely been released so I never had a chance to play around with it. Anyway, normally I\u0027d start with a search on the topic, but apparently all of the relevant results are on the reddit and, well, right now is not a good time to be looking for information that\u0027s only on the reddit sadly, so I\u0027m hoping to get a least a few opinions about which people like and why so that I can make an informed decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: So it turns out that I haven\u0027t actually played with either of these because the failure mod I used the last time I played was BARIS. That said, I\u0027m still interested in people\u0027s opinions on these two as BARIS is no longer supported and its successor doesn\u0027t interest me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-12T13:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2023 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-24T14:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEver looked into Kerbalism?
