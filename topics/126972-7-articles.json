The network was abuzz! And nearly saturated, to be honest. There was some concern that such a large network would tax the efficiency of the Universe and slow down all life to a crawl, but so far none of the kerbals had noticed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160124_ksp0151_grid.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160124_ksp0151_grid.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160124_ksp0152_grid.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160124_ksp0152_grid.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe newly acquired network was still connected to several old facilities. In particular a space station orbiting the M\u00FCn, and yet another found orbiting Kerbin. Three communications backbone satellites were identified orbiting the M\u00FCn, and the documentation indicated there were another three around Minmus (though none were forthcoming).\u00A0The ground controllers made note of all this new hardware, and added them to the list of Things. No doubt future missions would fully explore or exploit all of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack at Baile Speir it was time to move some pieces around. Or rather, one piece. The original original plan was for the Nitrogen TA-9 to dock where the Oxygen supply craft was currently resting, allowing for the crew to use the access tunnel to reach the inhabited parts of the station. That would\u0027ve required the Oxygen to move both itself and the docking adapter it was docked to onto the docking port at the end of the expansion module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delay caused by the F9 event meant the Oxygen had not moved, and so the Nitrogen TA-9 took its place instead. So, during a bit of downtime between tracking their new satellite grid, the ground controllers moved the Oxygen remotely. (They would\u0027ve had Sieta do it, but communications delays were negligible in low orbit and none of them trusted her to not somehow fire the craft into the Sun.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160125_ksp0169_oxygen.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160125_ksp0169_oxygen.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOddly the station\u0027s computer freaked out when the Oxygen undocked, claiming the station was running out of Oxygen. Despite having more than 74 days worth.

Exactly what the next project would be was a matter of some debate. The Aluminium Project was quickly gaining traction, while the scientists wanted yet another space telescope or three (and had some ideas for them too). Lots of folks were submitting lots of bids for things they wanted the Agency to do, leaving The Boss with more than a full plate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would they end up doing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime alone will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit (auto merged into this post by the\u00A0forum.... bah):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222379114\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453758539\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152665\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketSquid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/25/2016 at 3:48 PM, RocketSquid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GUI doesn\u0027t even open for me, regardless of processor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be a screen resolution thing.

Kerbals were free to pursue any career they liked, even three of them at a time. Birds still took wing and flew. Kerbals were unconcerned with the cost of things. Now? Now the entrenched education industry was producing credentialed undereducated robot-like kerbals that were only good for one particular job.
