There\u0027s a lot of new players trying the game, and judging by the questions on the forums (and discussions on Reddit) a lot of them are having difficulty with the controls, especially things like docking.

KSP is not the only program that works that way. The \u0022back for up, and forward for down\u0022 standard is VERY old, and dates back to the very first areoplanes, and makes sense if you think of the control stick as rotating around a ball rather than moving in straight lines. When you push the stick forward, it\u0027s not just moving straight forward. It\u0027s a lever rotating at the fulcrum, and that rotation is rotating downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr to put it another way, imagine a flat board on which you\u0027ve painted a silhouette of an airplane, and you glue a stick to the board sticking up normal to the plane of the board.

It raises my hackles every time a video game\u0027s settings screen describes doing it the correct way as \u0022inverted\u0022, when it\u0027s not. Back-means-up is normal, BOTH historically, AND by the geometry of what the stick represents. The NEW standard where forward means up and backward means down is an inversion.

For some reason, after many years of knowing people who don\u0027t, and also after some flight-sim-free time, I tried non-inverted mouse control for the heck of it and I just couldn\u0027t go back anymore. From literally - and I mean it, I\u0027m not just throwing this word in for emphasis - one match to the next of the same game (CoD4 I believe), pushing the mouse away to make the view tilt up became so natural as it had been unnatural all those games before, and I have never been able or even wanting to go \u0022inverted\u0022 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, I wouldn\u0027t give intuition that much weight when arguing about what\u0027s right as it is so subjective.
