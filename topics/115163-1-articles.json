Power plants generally use natural or slightly-enriched uranium as their fuel. Only a small proportion of natural Uranium is U-235, which can sustain a chain reaction. The rest is U-238, which can be split if it is hit by a neutron of the right energy, but doesn\u0027t produce enough neutrons of the right energy when it splits to sustain a chain reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This has to be surrounded with many tonnes of moderator (graphite, water, or heavy water most usually) which slows down neutrons so they can actually interact with the fuel. Without the moderator, most neutrons are too high-energy to cause fission, they just bounce off things until they escape. Even with all of this moderator surrounding many, many tonnes of fuel, it is only just about able to produce a sustained nuclear reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nuclear weapons don\u0027t have the advantage of being able to surround their fuel with moderator, as they have to be deliverable, so the fuel has to be highly enriched. It needs to be mostly U-235. As an example, weapons-grade uranium is enriched to about 90% U-235. The power station where I worked used uranium enriched to 4.2% U-235, which is absolutely useless for building a bomb. Enriching uranium is very, very hard to do, which is why only a few countries in the world have nuclear weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it helps, imagine nuclear reactions along the same line as chemical reactions. A lump of coal and a stick of dynamite both can undergo exothermic chemical reactions. Coal needs a lot of heat for a sustained period of time to burn, and even when it does, the release of energy is relatively slow and controlled. Dynamite explodes in a chain reaction when exposed to a naked flame. Nuclear fuel is like coal, nuclear weapons are like dynamite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there is the possibility of a dirty bomb using the waste from the reactor. This would be an issue if an even moderately industrialised country wanted to cause some mischief.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Everten P.","CreatedById":103089,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T12:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom OP: Most of the information here was from the question itself and not personal knowledge, this was from a social studies book and understandably it wouldn\u0027t be entirely accurate on nuclear physics.

He chose from forty dishes, served on gold and silver plate. It took a staggering 498 people to prepare each meal. He was rich because he consumed the work of other people, mainly in the form of their services. He was rich because other people did things for him. At that time, the average French family would have prepared and consumed its own meals as well as paid tax to support his servants in the palace. So it is not hard to conclude that Louis XIV was rich because others were poor.\u003Cp\u003EBut what about today? Consider that you are an average person, say a woman of 35, living in, for the sake of argument, Paris and earning the median wage, with a working husband and two children.

Power plants generally use natural or slightly-enriched uranium as their fuel. Only a small proportion of natural Uranium is U-235, which can sustain a chain reaction. The rest is U-238, which can be split if it is hit by a neutron of the right energy, but doesn\u0027t produce enough neutrons of the right energy when it splits to sustain a chain reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This has to be surrounded with many tonnes of moderator (graphite, water, or heavy water most usually) which slows down neutrons so they can actually interact with the fuel. Without the moderator, most neutrons are too high-energy to cause fission, they just bounce off things until they escape. Even with all of this moderator surrounding many, many tonnes of fuel, it is only just about able to produce a sustained nuclear reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nuclear weapons don\u0027t have the advantage of being able to surround their fuel with moderator, as they have to be deliverable, so the fuel has to be highly enriched. It needs to be mostly U-235. As an example, weapons-grade uranium is enriched to about 90% U-235. The power station where I worked used uranium enriched to 4.2% U-235, which is absolutely useless for building a bomb. Enriching uranium is very, very hard to do, which is why only a few countries in the world have nuclear weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it helps, imagine nuclear reactions along the same line as chemical reactions. A lump of coal and a stick of dynamite both can undergo exothermic chemical reactions. Coal needs a lot of heat for a sustained period of time to burn, and even when it does, the release of energy is relatively slow and controlled. Dynamite explodes in a chain reaction when exposed to a naked flame. Nuclear fuel is like coal, nuclear weapons are like dynamite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there is the possibility of a dirty bomb using the waste from the reactor. This would be an issue if an even moderately industrialised country wanted to cause some mischief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery good answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to point out, however, that there are much easier sources of radioactive material than nuclear waste.
