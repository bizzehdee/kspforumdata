I downloaded this last week to see if I could build a rocket, launch it into orbit, and bring my poor Kerbals back alive. At that time TAC-LS was listed as highly recommended and now it says required. Did anything change (the version is still the same) or was it listed incorrectly and changed to the correct category? I have not yet had any issues running RO (other then killing all my Kerbals) an thought I should ask before I try a moon landing and have it go all bonkers on me due to a missing mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might want to change Procedural Parts to highly recommend (I tried with a minimal install and found that I kinda needed it) and also note that for KWR Procedural Fairings should be used as the auto fairings were removed and the interstage fairings are not working well with the resized engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T21:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are converting the stock Generator to TAC-LS because of a bug in the stock version.

For any non-interplanetary missions it\u0027s impact is negligible, so there is really no reason not to use it - for simple LEO missions the default amount of TAC supplies that Realism Overhaul adds to all pods is perfectly sufficient, for moon missions all you need is a small (and light) container of supplies, and only with long-term stay at space stations the weight of supplies starts to get substantial, and even then it\u0027s still tiny in comparison to the weight of the space station itself. What\u0027s more, the supplies in TAC never spoil, so you can just send a 10-years worth supply of food to the space station and never have to think about supplying it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you really don\u0027t want it to kill your kerbals, you can just disable that option in TAC LS settings.
