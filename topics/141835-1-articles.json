However, I did determine that if my budget is 1000m/s, I could have a window as large as 25 days large to initiate\u00A0the transfer to Duna.\u00A0 It would be better to catch the low-delta-v trajectory, though.\u00A0 All launches were conducted with a standard, 2.5m launch platform that was originally developed to conduct Minmus landings.\u00A0 Reuse of components has a benefit of

now I wanted to put up the album.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssembly was not super difficult. \u00A0The main thing about moving the front-part of the core instead of undocking and moving the

descriptions in the album, they\u0027re all pretty self-explanatory. \u00A0I did get the whole thing assembled in orbit a few K-days before the start of the trans-Duna burns, but I had to shell out for accelerated assembly in KCT. \u00A0It\u0027s worth it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll put images up of the KSPTOT-MA plan soon. \u00A0In order to avoid a 10-minute burn that would almost certainly be wildly inefficient, I used the MA features to split the maneuver into 6 equal burns. \u00A0The first burn is 1 minute, 55s long, and then each one is a little shorter since mass is being removed from the vessel but the thrust is constant. \u00A0I had to sort through how to adjust the burn-time for the first burn since now there are 6 orbital periods of different lengths to account for, but in the end the overall delta-V to hit Duna is not much different than in the single, idealized burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSPTOT-MA says I should employ a 21km aerobrake maneuver to catch me into an orbit near Ike\u0027s. \u00A0 That\u0027ll be fun!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Added the images from Mission Architect to the album as well as the first burn to Duna and the final approach orbit at Duna, projected from just outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0All the burns are conducted manually since I don\u0027t use MechJeb. \u00A0The trick I used to making things match with KSPTOT was to make sure I matched the SMA as closely as I could achieve. \u00A0The burns in KSPTOT are timed to periapsis and are expecting a certain SMA for the orbital period, so I made sure to match this. \u00A0Inclination and eccentricy varied out at the 3rd digit, but I got SMA correct to about 5 or 6 digits. \u00A0Even so, time-warps and the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E mucked things up a bit so I had to do a couple of correction burns and small adjustments (9 and 13m/s correction burns) but I was always very close. \u00A0Precise Node helped catch exactly the right maneuver adjustments. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
