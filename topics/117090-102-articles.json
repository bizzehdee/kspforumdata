The concept was a good one, but the implementation into KSP is.... troublesome.  It doesn\u0027t like hollow parts and it really doesn\u0027t like attach nodes in the same place, even if they are facing opposite directions.\n\nAm going to look into cleaning up the current iteration of those parts during the 1.1 update, to at least make sure they are working as-is after I fix all the other module stuff.  Don\u0027t expect fuel switching/etc... as the modules driving all of those parts are.. ancient and full of cracks (read: terrible coding); if I look at them funny the whole thing will probably collapse. \n\nHave already planned to rework them entirely (to add fuel switching/etc), but that is likely several months out.

There will be several which are basically just frames-with-fairings; others which are more stock cargo-bay like, and...well... thats as far as I\u0027ve gotten on the concept dev on that stuff :).  Will be tackling these, at least a few variants, shortly after 1.1 and the mod is updated / stable.\n\nRound tanks are also planned (MFT-C is actually the round/spherical tanks, MFT-F is the cylindrical single-fuel cryo tanks).\n\nSo... that would be very doable, but would require 1 extra part for the cargo-bay ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T18:21:45Z","Content":"Did a quick check on the LC stuff; it all appears to be working as it should.
