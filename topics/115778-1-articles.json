Open up your KSP folder (look for how to do it in another tutorial) and click on [GameData](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/GameData). You should see two folders if you haven\u0027t modded your KSP version yet. Now drag your \u0027MechJeb2\u0027 folder into the game folder and **tada**! You have now successfully installed an addon. Close the KSP folder and the addon folder if you wish and now you can start the game and enjoy the addon!\n\nTaratajum !\n\nwhere is game folder ?\n\nOther\u0027s ive serach in google say install the machjeb2 folder inside the gamedatata folder ....i tried both options each time when i start KSP is says not responding , before it was working fine\n\nplease help me ..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T11:01:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by phobus10**"},{"CreatedByName":"ShuFF","CreatedById":118083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:00:51Z","Content":"It should be a very easy thing to do. In the root directory of KSP (usually C:\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\, if you have the Steam version) you can find the GameData folder. You have to put the mod folder inside that one. Maybe you\u0027re pasting the .zip folder you downloaded. If that\u0027s the case, just extract the .zip inside the GameData folder.\n\nYou should end up with something like this: C:\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\MechJeb2\n\nAnd, inside GameData, there should be three folders and one file: GameData\\Icons, GameData\\Parts, GameData\\Plugins and GameData\\LICENSE.md\n\nCheck if you did everything OK. The game should automatically detect and load any mod in the GameData folder. If the game is not responding, try deleting the MechJeb2 folder inside GameData and launch it again. When it works, try it again from the beginning.\n\nPlease tell us if you solved it! Good luck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T15:05:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ShuFF**"}]}
