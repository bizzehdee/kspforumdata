Knowing Unity, you can\u0027t really change static models. I\u0027m positive, though, that you can move the KSC. Look at KSC switcher. The real issue is changing the models entirely. I do think that you might be able to move the transforms of game objects. I don\u0027t quite know how, but you might be able to do that, and move, say, the VAB into the ground, and spawn your own model there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
