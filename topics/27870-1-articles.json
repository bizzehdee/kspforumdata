Well done! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on heading to Duna for my first time with kerbals with my next mission when the phase angle comes up soon. I already have my vessle to go there in orbit, I just need to send up the crew, because I didn\u0027t use Kerbal Mainifest. I didn\u0027t have the mod installed when I launched the it into HKO intially, and I don\u0027t want to do the launch again since it took several tries to do it the first time. I didn\u0027t plan on bringing them back though. (HOME mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m impressed by what you did to make it there and back.
