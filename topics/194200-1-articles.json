Staying there requires you to point sideways. When launching, try to turn gradually to point east, which will build up your orbital velocity and will also mean you don\u0027t gain too much height and drop back into the atmosphere at high speed and a steep angle which causes a lot of re-entry heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few tricks that you can use to protect your precious science payload, and parachutes too:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Put science stuff in a service bay. They\u0027re low drag, very resistant to heat, and yet can be easily accessed when you need to; some experiments won\u0027t work when enclosed in a service bay though, just keep that in mind. And parachutes won\u0027t deploy when they\u0027re inside a closed service bay either, but they might if you open it, though it\u0027s been a while since I used one so I can\u0027t really say for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Attach your parachutes near the top of your re-entry stage, which should not only be better shielded from heat but will also mean it lands pointing the right way up, reducing the chances of blowing up your crew pod with a hard landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Try to make your re-entry section base heavy i.e. the centre of mass is close to the heat shield, and not close to the pointy end. If it\u0027s top heavy, it can easily flip backwards and expose the important stuff like parachutes and crew pods to the heat of re-entry rather than the heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re just launching solid booster powered rockets on sub-orbital flights, then turning to go sideways rather than up will probably help you most and there won\u0027t really be a need for a heat shield; if you\u0027re returning from the Mun/Minmus/another planet, it\u0027s OK to dip into the atmosphere more than once to bleed off some velocity before finally coming all the way down. Just make sure you packed enough ablator!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-27T20:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223791583\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590539917\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204905\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cant think of a username\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Cant think of a username said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am just a new player, so I don\u0027t know much.
