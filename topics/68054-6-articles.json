Combat in space won\u0027t exist for the sake of itself, it\u0027ll occur because it confers a tactical or strategic advantage on the ground. Even current combat doctrines urge senior commanders to consider themselves operating in a 3-dimensional battlespace that includes space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main role of space assets in the near to medium future will remain the same as it is now: they\u0027re C4I assets. Their primary role is reconnaissance, navigation and comms. The main role for space combat vehicles would be to protect the satellites, and to destroy enemy satellites. The main threats against satellites will be ASAT weapons and interceptors in orbit. Ground fire can be mitigated by surface or atmospheric assets, or by a strike platform in orbit (as ASATs are likely to be deployed very deep) and orbital interceptors would have to be tackled by friendly ASATs or interceptors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to deployment ASATs would operate as point defences, but would probably only be effective against fairly low orbits. To protect or deny a low orbit or to go an get a satellite in a GEO orbit you\u0027d need a combat vehicle capable of manoeuvring. You could deny a big chunk of useful low orbits by deploying interceptors into retrograde orbits so that they\u0027d encounter anything in a prograde one quite quickly. They could just sit there orbiting indefinitely until they were required to engage. If approaching from interplanetary it wouldn\u0027t even be expensive to get them into those orbits, unlike the poor sods on the ground. Engaging targets in GEO orbits would have the advantage that if they manoeuvered to avoid you then that\u0027s a mission kill in your favour, so they\u0027d be a sitting duck really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krona14","CreatedById":90751,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T18:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce again, a ship with only a very limited number of heavily-shielded semiconductor chips- not a ship without electricity.\u003Cp\u003EMany of the systems you named can easily be run on little besides a steady supply of electricity and analog controls.

These platforms could be supplemented with drones or a few small unmanned escort-class starships for a low-maintenance defensive solution...
