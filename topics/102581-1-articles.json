The problem is that when I load it as a sub-assembly, it won\u0027t let me attach it in the desired orientation. As the pic shows, it will only allow me to attach it on the ends of the Lab module, which I don\u0027t want to do. I\u0027ve even added a radial attachment point on top of the Science Jr on top of the thing, but it still won\u0027t allow it.\n\n![Assembly%20issues_zpswz6ds2o2.jpg](http://i626.photobucket.com/albums/tt349/snafu666/Assembly%20issues_zpswz6ds2o2.jpg)\n\nIs there any way to do this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:05:32Z","Content":"Use the Reroot tool (the rightmost of the four small square icons at the upper left) to change the root part of the subassembly to the part that you wish to attach it with, then save it as a subassembly again."},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:28:42Z","Content":"When dropping a subassembly in the subassembly-creation-box, the node you disconnected when picking it up in the first place is the only node that can be attached when trying to use that subassembly later.\n\nWhat i normally do when making subassembly is to first place some small fuel tanks or the like to have as a root part, and then build the subassembly onto that. \n\nIn your case, do this:\n\n1. start a new vehicle\n\n2. place a fuel tank to have as root\n\n3. attach the science assembly any way it\u0027ll let you.\n\n4. place some fuel tanks onto the docking node you will actually want to use (the radial one, i guess)\n\n5. use the reroot too onto the fuel tanks placed in step 4\n\n6. remove the fuel tank placed in step 2\n\n7. pick up the subassembly by the radial docking node, and drop it into the subassembly creator\n\nThis way you get the connection point where it should be.\n\nA note on the reroot tool: From what i\u0027ve seen, you need two parts to create a new root part. I\u0027ve never understood why. But that\u0027s why i used the plural \u0022fuel tank**s**\u0022 in step 4 and 5. Click reroot, click both of the fuel tanks in any order. I might be doing something wrong to necesitate this, but it works for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:38:40Z","Content":"I usually solve this by attaching the subassembly however it\u0027s possible, picking up the part I want to \u0022repair\u0022 and reattaching it back where it was. It usually gets all the nodes right back. If not, just replace the part. \n\nNot a particularly elegant solution, but it works."},{"CreatedByName":"Black Talon","CreatedById":139093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T11:18:59Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies. I\u0027ll give it all a go.\n\nI guess my problem started when I made the mobile lab as a separate ship, and then saved it as a sub-assembly. I started with the actual Lab as the root part.\n\nI did manage to get the thing attached to a rocket the way I wanted, but I had to build the rocket around the Lab, rather than attach the Lab to the rocket. Then I simply swapped control to the pod at the top on the launch pad.\n\nI got the thing to The mun too by the way. It works, but it\u0027s a little unstable. I have to be really careful driving it around."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T13:54:38Z","Content":"The re-root tool is your solution here. That\u0027s the only sane solution for assembling several sub-assembly. I\u0027ve only recently understood how to use it (or so I think).\n\nApparently after selecting it, you should select an adjacent part to the new root you want, then the part you want to become the root."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:25:19Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it matters which part you click first, you can click the same part twice so long as you move the mouse between the clicks."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T01:59:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think it matters which part you click first, you can click the same part twice so long as you move the mouse between the clicks.\n\nThis is correct, I\u0027m not sure the purpose of the first click, but the second will set whatever part was clicked as the new root part. My method to building something I know is going to be a subassembly is to build it as a new craft, ensuring I know where I\u0027m going to attach by, then set that attach point as my root part."}]}
