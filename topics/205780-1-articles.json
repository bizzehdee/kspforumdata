An old, small red dwarf star with 7 terrestrial planets, the farthest away has an orbital period of less than 19days (450 hours). Astrum has a nice video on it, if you\u0027re interested. The fun bit is that the Trappist-1 system makes the Kerbol system looks humongous in comparison. All the planets would fit between Kerbol and Kerbin easily, with the most exterior (Trappist-1h) being only 9ish million km away from the star, while Kerbin sits at around 13 million km. The funnier bit is that the Trappist-1 system could very well harbor one (or more!) habitable world.
