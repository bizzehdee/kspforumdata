consider living on a desolate rock an upgrade. despite the grittiness of life on an airless industrial rock, their income would be a lot more significant than on farm world, and their access to space would be more available and a lot cheaper.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngetting your own ship opens you up to a broader economy. you can now run goods, passengers, etc. on your first voyage you might be taking a load of ex factory workers looking to\u00A0take a cushy administrative job in one of the orbital stations.\u00A0 cash in your script at the warehouse and take a load of stuff to farm world. this trip would pay for itself a couple times over. pick up a load of grain, meat, and other farmables, while the locals gawk at you for being a rich snob. run it back to your former industrial jobsite. do that a few times and you might be able to expand your trade routes. do that for a couple decades and you might be able to build your own station or at least get a plot on a big ring station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere might also be a whole subset of people who get to the top by swinging stocks and other financial vehicles all without turning a single screw or picking a single ear of corn. they are the ones who buys a ship and then hires a crew, mostly to sit around in space dock until its owner wants to go on a pleasure cruise. in all cases your wealth really is represented by your upward mobility, taken literally.\u00A0 every planet will get to a point where it just cannot support any more population and people will start taking a hit to their quality of life as the available resources get split up more and more. so being planet bound will be a strong hallmark for poverty. each planet may have its fare share of rejects who never advance much further than the most menial of jobs, and everyone will still have a homeless problem.\u00A0 living outdoors may be an option on farmworld. but on industrial worlds they might be rounded up for \u0022airlock maintenance\u0022 as there is no room for those unwilling to pull their own weight. corporate may be unwilling to pay for their air or even opt to ship them off world and sell them to slavers in some backwater.\u00A0 but for most, life is what it is now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-26T23:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCulture essay
