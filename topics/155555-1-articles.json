It can be calculated for a specific manoeuvre or more generally as the total ability of a vehicle or rocket to change its velocity by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsp is specific impulse. It is a measure of engine efficiency - basically how long in seconds an engine takes to exhaust a weight of fuel equal to its thrust. Longer is better because it means you get to burn longer for the same quantity of fuel. It\u0027s directly proportional to exhaust velocity, and you\u0027ll often find the rocket equation written in terms of exhaust velocity instead of Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ng0 is the acceleration due to Earth\u0027s gravity, and is required for the conversion between exhaust velocity and Isp. It may seem weird that we use Earth\u0027s gravity no matter where the rocket is, but that\u0027s because we\u0027re implicitly converting from kilograms to Newtons and Newtons are defined in terms of Earth\u0027s gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nm0 is the mass before the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmf is the mass of the rocket after the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nm0/mf is therefore a measure of the mass ratio, or how much of the rocket you\u0027ve used as fuel. The more fuel you\u0027ve used, the greater this number, the faster you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nln(m0/mf) is the natural logarithm of the mass ratio. It\u0027s a non-linear function, but any calculator or spreadsheet can work it out. The reason it\u0027s necessary is because the fuel you burn first also has to accelerate the fuel you burn later before that can be used, reducing its efficiency. Burning the 1st kg of a 1000kg spacecraft changes the velocity by less than 1/600th of the amount the 999th kg will get you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere m0 is the total mass of a spacecraft topped full of fuel and mf is the dry mass after all fuel has been exhausted, the rocket equation gives you the total ability of the rocket to change its velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E required for a manoeuvre, and the Isp of the engines, then the equation can be rearranged to tell you either how much fuel you need to bring along on top of dry mass in order to perform it, or if you have current mass, what your end mass will be after the manoeuvre (And therefore fuel required - but better hope end mass is higher than dry mass or the manoeuvre is impossible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rearranged form is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nm0/mf = e ^ (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E / [Isp *g0])\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere e is the exponential function (opposite of natural logarithm) and ^ means \u0022to the power of\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s basically all you need to know.

as more rots, it exposes more tree to be rotted, so while it starts breaking down very slowly, the tree\u0027s structure completely collapses\u00A0seemingly\u00A0all at once at the end. \u00A0This is accelerating decay. \u00A0An example of decelerating decay is cooling; a piece of red-hot iron can cool by hundreds of degrees in minutes, but once it gets close to room temperature, it can take a very long time for the temperature to lose the last few degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003Enatural\u003C/em\u003E logarithm (given \u0027\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003Eln\u003C/span\u003E\u0027 in both written and calculator notation) is a special sort that describes\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Econtinuous\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0decay. \u00A0Continuous growth and decay can either accelerate or decelerate, and it appears in a lot of natural processes, such as radioactive decay and population growth. \u00A0These two processes are, in turn, described by\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehalf-life\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoubling rate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0respectively. \u00A0The importance of these terms is that they are constant values that have nothing to do with the actual amount of sample--in other words, to use population growth as an example, if you start with one bacterium, after a single doubling period, you\u0027ll have twice as many (in this case, two). \u00A0If I start with 100,000 bacteria, then after one doubling period (assuming room and nutrients for them), I\u0027ll have twice as many, as well (in this case, 200,000). \u00A0It\u0027s also important to know that for a given doubling period, you cannot predict exactly\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a specific bacterium will double; you only know that it will happen, but for the colony, there are \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E doubling bacteria, which means that for any point in time, the population is \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E growing, even though you cannot narrow the process\u00A0down to specific cells. \u00A0In other words, this process describes the whole of the system, but without paying a lot of attention to the individual parts of that system or what they are doing at any specific point in time while the system operates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis idea of growing or decaying whatever you have without paying attention to how much is actually there or what each piece is doing at any given time is the core of the logarithm\u0027s importance in the rocket equation. \u00A0In this case, the individual pieces are the drops of fuel; you don\u0027t know whether any given one is going to burn next. \u00A0You also don\u0027t care how many drops there are (well, you do, but not for this) in the sense that if you were to add triple the mass of rocket (copy your rocket and send three\u00A0docked together) you end up going exactly as far with three\u00A0identical rockets docked together (or three\u00A0hundred) as you could go with one rocket alone. \u00A0It\u0027s easy to say that in this case, it\u0027s because you\u0027re using three\u00A0engines instead of one, but it doesn\u0027t work that way: \u00A0if you were to shut off the two outside engines and only run the middle engine, it would still work the same way. \u00A0One engine, one hundred\u00A0engines--it doesn\u0027t matter, because the number of engines is irrelevant.\u00A0 To call back to an earlier example, if I start with two identical red-hot pieces of iron, they both end up at the same temperature after the same amount of time--the rate of cooling doesn\u0027t depend of how many pieces I have, because if they start at the same temperature and end at the same temperature, then they both have to cool by the same number of degrees. \u00A0I can\u0027t add their temperatures together and say it\u0027s the same as one piece with double the extra heat; it doesn\u0027t work that way. \u00A0Yes, there is more total energy involved if you have more hot parts, but they all have to cool by the same amount, and that\u0027s the important part here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMass Fraction\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can abstract this idea of a system to rockets: \u00A0at the end of the day, the important thing is that there is a minimum amount of mass that has to be pushed around. \u00A0This is the pod, engine, empty tankage, experiments, Kerbals, and basically everything that isn\u0027t thrown out the engine bell. \u00A0We call that dry mass. \u00A0The other important thing is that there is a maximum amount of mass that needs to be pushed around. \u00A0This is everything just\u00A0mentioned, plus the stuff thrown out the engine bell, i.e., fuel and oxidiser. \u00A0We call that wet mass--note that wet mass is dry mass plus fuel rather than fuel alone. \u00A0This is important because it gives us both the start point (the full rocket) and an end point (the empty rocket); mass of fuel alone doesn\u0027t help us because it doesn\u0027t relate to the rest of the rocket until it is actually added to the rest of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the fuel burns, it is continuously consumed.\u00A0\u00A0As you have less and less fuel, the better and better that fuel is able to push the rocket around because each particle of the mass remaining in the rocket receives a larger and larger share of the energy of motion: \u00A0in other words, the most efficient drop of fuel is the last drop of fuel--it doesn\u0027t matter what your rocket looks like\u00A0or how big it is;\u00A0for all rocket systems, this is true. \u00A0This situation in reverse is what the decay in the rocket equation describes: \u00A0as you add more fuel to the rocket (wet mass), the fuel you add becomes less and less effective at pushing that mass. \u00A0It still adds capability (you\u0027re producing thrust regardless) but the amount of capability you add per drop of fuel keeps falling\u00A0because each drop of fuel you add has to push all of the other drops,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eplus\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the dry mass of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing back to the equation, the logarithm part is of the ratio of wet to dry mass; that is, wet mass (which will be higher) is the numerator\u00A0and dry mass is the denominator. \u00A0This value of wet mass divided by dry mass is called the mass fraction. \u00A0The dry mass is constant for a given rocket, so we can ignore it for now;

the other part is the exhaust velocity of the engine. \u00A0KSP converts this to specific impulse which is a measure of exhaust velocity working against one gravity of acceleration (that is, engine exhaust velocity / 9.81 metres per second per second), but both refer to the engine\u0027s efficiency. \u00A0I will use the traditional version (exhaust velocity) because it\u0027s easier to understand intuitively. \u00A0The idea is that if a rocket engine functions by throwing mass out the back, a more efficient engine will throw that mass out with more energy: \u00A0rockets function by Newton\u0027s Third Law (equal and opposite reactions), so a more energetic exhaust means more energy of motion to push\u00A0the rocket. \u00A0The energy of motion, in turn, depends on two things: \u00A0mass and velocity. \u00A0If two different engines are running on two test rockets with the same dry mass and with the same amount of propellant, then the mass is constant between them, so the only way for an engine to give more energy to the propellant\u00A0mass\u00A0is for it to give that mass more velocity. \u00A0Therefore, the more efficient engine has a higher exhaust velocity, which gives its test rocket more final velocity, which, by definition, is more delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tie-in to the y-axis of the graph above is that there is some mass fraction that has a natural logarithm of one. \u00A0This is not the same as the mass fraction being one--this is the output, not the input. \u00A0What it means is that there is some amount of wet versus dry mass that gives the total rocket a delta-v equal to the engine\u0027s exhaust velocity. \u00A0For a test rocket--or any rocket--this mass fraction is the same, and no matter what the engine is, if it has\u00A0this mass fraction, the delta-v will equal the engine\u0027s own efficiency in terms of exhaust velocity.\u00A0 The value of this mass fraction is a number called\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and that is equal to approximately 2.718. \u00A0The applications and theory behind the number\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are many and whole university courses can be devoted just to the study of this number, so I will simplify it by saying that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the base rate of decay for all continuously decaying functions. \u00A0Why this is true is not a subject to discuss here, but suffice it to say that it is true, just the same as \u03C0 is the ratio of circumference to diameter of all circles of all sizes.\u00A0 Thus, it not only makes sense that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0should appear in the rocket equation (said earlier to be a continuous decay function), but it also makes sense that, if it is the \u003Cem\u003Ebase\u003C/em\u003E rate of decay, that using it in the rocket equation will output the rocket\u0027s base efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo finally define the y-axis, then, you should understand that it represents the delta-v of the rocket, but expressed as multiples of the engine\u0027s exhaust velocity. \u00A0This makes it somewhat similar to the half-life of a radioactive isotope or the doubling rate of a population. \u00A0In other words, a mass fraction of 2.718,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E, will yield a delta-v of one engine exhaust. \u00A0What the means in terms of metres per second depends on the engine you\u0027re using;

its mass--9 tonnes!--is pretty crippling\u00A0for operations that don\u0027t need the thrust), but let\u0027s assume that we can make a Poodle with zero mass. \u00A0The Poodle\u0027s exhaust velocity is 3433.5 m/s (350 Isp * 9.81 m/s/s),\u00A0so theoretical maximum delta-v is then about 7540\u00A0m/s. \u00A0Actual, achievable delta-v on a useful rocket at the far end of tank-heavy (thus at the far end of useful;

For a single stage. \u00A0Incidentally, this is the proof that Eve single-stage-to-orbit from sea level is impossible, but that\u00A0is not the case with multistage rockets. \u00A0It turns out that you can cheat at the rocket equation a bit by getting rid of your extra tanks as soon as they are empty. \u00A0While they don\u0027t count as propellant mass, once they are gone, they don\u0027t\u00A0count as dry mass, either, so what happens is your mass fraction jumps up every time you stage. \u00A0Generally, the payload is more than just a fuel tank, so the mass fraction never jumps to quite the level it was before staging. \u00A0In other words, as you stage away empty tanks, you end up with a better mass fraction than you had but still a rocket that is more and more payload, so the mass fraction gets smaller and smaller until you get to the last stage, which, if it\u0027s a drifting free-fall satellite, may well have a mass fraction of one because it\u0027s never supposed to go anywhere again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ideal version of staging is to discard your empty fuel tank\u00A0as soon as it is\u00A0empty--in essence, we\u0027re looking at a tank that burns away as we use the fuel in it--and that would be another continuous decay function. \u00A0In KSP, that can be approximated with the Oscar-B, the smallest fuel tank. \u00A0Ten Oscar-Bs make one FL-T400 ... but ten stage-able Oscar-Bs require nine more decouplers than that one FL-T400, as well. \u00A0There is eventually a point at which the mass needed to handle discarding the fuel tanks overtakes the amount of propellant saved by discarding them more frequently. \u00A0What this means in terms of practical application is that it is slightly more efficient to have a single fuel tank with a two-engine cluster at the bottom of the rocket that is staged by one decoupler than it is to have two half-sized fuel tanks, each with a single engine and\u00A0staged by\u00A0radial decouplers on either side of the rocket, provided that the masses of the radial and inline decouplers are the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-26T17:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222934523\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155555\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485383494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zhetaan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Zhetaan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/173613-codatheportalmaster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022173613\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/173613-codatheportalmaster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CodaThePortalmaster\u003C/a\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ant, however, is not a terribly efficient engine;

If your engine is incredibly efficient (800s) but you cannot circularize your orbit in time, well thats something we will all enjoy watching on U-tube. There is a caveot, which is the seat of your pants scenario in which you put just enough fuel in to get close to orbit and then after entering space run the ion drive engines to assist and then finish off the orbit with ION drives (or faster with NTR). I have done this many time and you have to launch essentially perfectly and maintain a perfect launch trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you are in orbit, you can have ION drives stacked with a new elements lets call it Mg and give the ION drive 150000 ISPvel (instead of ISPsec). So the basic problem here is that in orbit you are at perigee \u002B/- 20\u0027 for only a few minutes. And your ION drives are producing at this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E are producing mN of thrust so basically you are kicking and an oblongated spiral out of orbit. This is not very time intelligent or efficient, its better to have enough thrust that in one kick and a 40\u0027 span you take advantage of oberth-like physics to get you from your circle to the desired. In fact with the New Horizons mission, one of the fastest space craft leaving earth, the best dynamic really involves kicking before circularization. IOW your take off pitch rolls you onto a holman trajectory that takes to deep into interstellar space and flies by pluto, its not a verticle shot but also never circularizes. Think of New Horizons as having a trajectory after its final LEO burn as intercepting the surface of the earth, not several 100 kilometers above the earth. The closer your (-time) trajectory is to the point mass that defines the gravitational body, the more impact the oberth effect has.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 So in this circumstance you want an engine and an efficiency most of the time that does not require more than say 3 or 4 kicks (IIRC orbit around kerbin is 30 minutes, earth is 80 minutes). So the engine should burn about 900dv acceleration at least in 15 min or your match and planning is going to be nuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 So now lets change the argument, lets suppose you are at on mojo and you want to then return back, we all know how difficult that is because it requires costly plane changes also. But with ion drive you have the benefit of sol, mojo you can change planes around mojo in the manner you lift off and then after circularlization use the ion drives to essentially drive the craft along a polar orbit until it suits a transition to whatever planet. Then of course you have to exit mojo. At the point you leave mojo you can forget about the planet and consider the position at perigee around the star (though depending on Mojo\u0027s perigee it may not be, but for a highly efficient low mass ION drive the good thing is mojo\u0027s period is 80 days, not 30 minutes which means a slow burning engine has an advantage of oberth-like physics on a long orbit and Ion drive has advantage of being close to the Sol. If you are deep in space and trying to leave the system, you have very long orbital periods and a long time to conduct burns, but the problem is that you have a tiny amount of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a clever idea for getting way out in space fast is getting a very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E engine \u0026amp; fuel very close to sol, doesn\u0027t need to be on a circular, estimate how many burn days it would take, start the burn days/2 before perigee and burn all the fuel and wee you will be souring into deep space with no hope of return. Heres the problem in reality, in KSP the ION drives produce way more thrust than Earthmade ION drives and require way less energy. In reality if you had a really efficient ION drive, you would need dozens of heavy football field size solar panels to power it to burn that fuel fast enough to take advantage of oberth physics, even relatively close to the sun. At earths orbit the power requirements and weight and structural issues with the panels are too high, you really need something like nuclear power (which currently fission power offers the same weight problem and not as reliable in space as solar panels). So that leave fusion and fusion drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo NTRs are the thing they expend nuclear fuel but they run on hydrogen that is difficult to store. In the game the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is around 800, in reality a modern age NTR the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E would be close to 1000. In the game the tank holds reductant and oxidant side of the tank is wasted weight. In reality you would have for space circular shaped hydrogen tanks to minimize surface area to weight ratios and they probably would be mounted on a lattice of somesort that would release tanks as they expired. In the game tanks can hold the reductant indefinitely, in reality you would need a wrap around each tank and fuel lines that captured the hydrogen that leaked out and repressurized the tanks with it, and this would not last indefinietly. SO NTRs would only give a decent mass ratio but if used relative soon after lift-off, so if you wanted to use oberth affect around say jool, you need another less efficient propulsion system (fusion coupled to ion does not have enough thrust). I actually designed an NTR that could land and take off from the mun more efficiently than any in game rocket, the engine was large and tanks were mounted around the engine instead of above, and essentially I assumed that Kerbals were immune to radiation sickness or high gamma burns of any kind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-26T17:28:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2017 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
