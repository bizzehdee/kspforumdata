So, for the exoplanets I observe, I want to create good images of them with online and computer-based programs. Just one teensy little issue: I\u0027m TERRIBLE at using programs like GIMP to create any good image! I\u0027m good at hand-drawing exoplanets, but that doesn\u0027t help so much. Besides, who has a hand-drawn picture of an exoplanet with their exoplanet\u0027s discovery/observation info?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, is anyone good enough at this stuff to help me out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T00:39:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ProtoJeb21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T00:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, no, maybe you could google \u0022Free graphic design software\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T15:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never done planets, but I\u0027ve made posters, Facebook banners amd posters for uni clubs, mermaids, the odd genderbend, and once fooled a fair amount of my year at school with a fake poster campaign, before I even shelled out for photoshop, so....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGimp is an excellent program. Some things it even has advantages over photoshop. It looks much friendlier for a start, and it\u0027s free of adobe\u0027s weird keyboard shortcuts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike basically everything, the trick to getting good is a partly studying how the program works, and some reading up on art theories, and how digital images work, but mostly it\u0027s practice, and experience. You\u0027ve got to start somewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome tips - Get the hang of layers, layer groups, transparency, and then maybe blending modes. Masking can wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo different types of things on different layers. Like, have a layer for clouds, or for vegetation, or even multiple for different layers, and different types, and achieving different effects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about lighting. Some layer modes lend themselves well to creating highlights or shadows. This comes in handy because - The dodge and burn tools in Gimp aren\u0027t that amazing, and you can easily change the highlights or shadows without altering the underlying drawing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, colour to alpha tool. Leaves other methods of clearing backgrounds for dead, even photoshop\u0027s fancy tools. Learn this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to also learn a little Blender. A minimum, you\u0027ll get some shapes and lighting to start with. One trick you can use is multiple of the same layer serving different roles. It could be useful having the same rendered ball as a lower layer to to draw over, then again on a higher layer in a mode like darken only to create matching shadows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you looking to make them photorealistic? The trick is to star with actual photos. Drawing in lines can be useful, but it will take a bit of blurring and clever smudging to hide them. Get yourself some good photos to work with - best to avoid using anything which which someone may be unhappy if you used their images.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo for high resolution images from the start. The results are almost always going to be better. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a graphics tablet, but tbh, most of the time I prefer to use the mouse when drawing digitally. Unless I really want that hand drawn look, I can do better with precision placement of path anchors, distortion tools, shape tools, etc. Gimp isn\u0027t the best for this type of art though, it can loose track of the pen. There are other programs out there which are Also free, but more drawing specialised.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do it though, most of my\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72128-from-a-childhood-dream-latest-chapter-part-six/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas drawn in Gimp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk that\u0027s probably enough for now, I should probably sleep.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T23:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T20:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKrita is an excellent free painting program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlender will allow you to texture paint right on a sphere and create nice 3D renders if you want to go a bit more in depth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, oil paints \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T19:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSend me the color maps, And information on the star size, color, distance, and the color of the planets atmosphere, I can have one done in a jiffy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
