The HDD is not the issue as I launch KSP from a RAM drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is there such a difference? Could that be because of DirectX 11? I am using SEVEN and I know most of you guys switched on Windows 10 \u002B DX12 but, well, could that really be the problem?? Why would the CPU be caped at 34% btw?
