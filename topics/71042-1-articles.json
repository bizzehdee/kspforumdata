The concept intrigues me. And it seems that the Russians seem to take a liking to the process. For those of you who don\u0027t know the process of hot staging involves firing the upper stage engines before the lower stage cuts out and separates. This raises a good amount of questions for me. First of all.. why do it? Most rockets stage, then drift for a good amount of time as the two stages fall away from eachother. But as on the Russian Soyuz the 3rd stage fires iirc a good 30 seconds before the main stage separates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does this not damage the rocket? I imagine the exhaust hitting the lower stage tank and rebounding back up into the engines causing huge damage. So why do this? Also.. drifting raises a few questions too. What determines how long the drift is before the next stage fires? The Saturn V for instance drifted a good amount of time before the J-2s ignited. Again im guessing so the exhaust is clear of obstruction? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again iirc the Russian N1 was to be ALL hot staged... saying if it ever got to that point. So what are some good examples of this? Do any present day rockets other then the Soyuz hot stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a bit of an off topic question.. why is it I cant do this in KSP? Drifting I mean... Even with FAR stage separation in ksp is never as clean as it is in real life. The stages tumble, the rocket dips... its just not clean.

The rule of thumb is to look for Warren Truss interstages instead of solid ones. Proton does hot staging, so does the Zenit. Long March also does, and Titan IV did when it was still flying. The only US rockets to use hot staging were the Titans, in their case they had vents cut out, not truss interstages, but the idea is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHot staging is a lot simpler than standard method, but you do waste some fuel that way. Basically, you can get rid of all the separation pyrotechnics, retrorockets and ullage motors. Instead, the thrust from the upper stage just pushes the lower one off. However, if a coasting period is required (as is often the case when not launching to LEO), this kind of staging simply doesn\u0027t work. Also, the savings decrease if your upper stage needs be restarted in orbit, since then, you pack ullage systems anyway, and ones that would be restartable as well (they\u0027re often combined with the upper stage\u0027s RCS). Not to mention you\u0027re putting additional stress on the lower stage tank, which means it\u0027s also unfit for reusable launchers. A \u0022big dumb booster\u0022 would be better off with hot staging, but two stage, restartable designs (most modern rockets are those) are better off with standard staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T10:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is still pyrotechnic bolts for the separation between the stages.

It is extremely reactive with most inorganic and organic materials, including glass and teflon, and will initiate the combustion of many otherwise non-flammable materials without any ignition source. These reactions are often violent, and in some cases explosive.\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to surpass the oxidizing ability of oxygen leads to extreme corrosivity against oxide-containing materials often thought as incombustible. Chlorine trifluoride and gases like it have been reported to ignite sand, asbestos, and other highly fire-ret@rdant materials. In an industrial accident, a spill of 900 kg of chlorine trifluoride burned through 30 cm of concrete and 90 cm of gravel beneath. Fire control/suppression is incapable of suppressing this oxidation, therefore the surrounding area is kept cool until the reaction ceases. The compound reacts violently with water-based suppressors, and oxidizes in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, rendering atmosphere-displacement suppressors such as CO2 and halon completely ineffective.

But heat alone won\u0027t do that, it takes UV-C to split the molecules in the first place, so theres no runaway exothermic reaction with just O2. That kind of thing can only happen with unstable molecules which want to split into more stable products. High explosives, for instance, work this way, usually they have a lot of nitrogen atoms which want to form N2 molecules, which releases lots of energy.
