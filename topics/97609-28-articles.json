This single question will signify if the game is \u0022scope complete\u0022 or ready for 1.0 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDO NOT install any addons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch career mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow tell me...how much fun you having with the game? With no addon support at all. How about 5-10 hours into it, when the newness of early career wears off? Still having fun with the stock game, stock parts, stock features, grinding through career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine this as a new player. Using only stock craft grinding through career mode, lack of a useful tutorial and incentive outside of just getting more money to get a bigger hanger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this with no addons....that is a feature complete game when it is fun and playable long term with zero outside support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You should not have to have players RELY on addons to complete the game for them. Addons should CHANGE functionality or add small things (like parts and such) . Addons should not be the only means to incorporate what many feel are required features, like rentry or life support or an ACTUAL list of parts. (Currently without addons, many many craft will look identical because there are so few options and only so many effective ways to make an efficient craft with such a small library of parts). SO your putting in a new aerodynamics model and refueling, that replaces two of the most popular mods. BUt what about Rentry? That is ignoring a huge portion of rocketry. I love the game, but what I really mean is I love that community of modders. Without them, I would not be around still. I always assumed that before release, the need for many of these larger addons would not be needed as things were rolled into the base game. I assumed wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the very lackluster career mode. It needs more. How about some GOALS to reach, long term that the player chooses and dictates the types of contracts he gets. The contracts are the means of funding, but something like \u0027Build a colony on the Mun\u0027. Not the procedural \u0027Build a base on the Mun in this amount of time that must have this part\u0027 but a goal the player can choose, and contracts are geared towards that. If they want to build a Mun base, then they should be getting missions to explore the Mun, research it, start a small base, expand it, etc. Rather then the player deciding themselves they want to build a Mun base, but in order to get funds they have to fly way the hell to Eve, because that is what the game decided to throw at them. I don\u0027t care about eve now, I want to build a Mun base. If the player has no goal the want, then they can get whatever contract the game wants to give them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is career mode in general. It is far to grindy and random.

Apparently this happens as 32bit applications can\u0027t address over 4Gb of RAM (or 3.5Gb or something along those lines). A 64bit version of the game would be able to make full use of the memory of these computers, thus solving a lot of problems for players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64bit might not be the holy grail for most games but for KSP it would really be useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this issue is not on Squad\u0027s hands but rather on Unity. Until we get Unity5 we\u0027ll have to make do with what we have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes me wonder if having assets load on demand (there was even a mod that did this) would be a better idea. Or maybe Squad should consider using Unity5 beta? Some users on the unity forum report using it without horrible consequences. Maybe the gains would out-weigh the new issues. Maybe not... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this only really addresses one issue. I think the game still lacks some content to be Gold worthy. Most \u0022problems\u0022 can be addressed with mods, be it lack of content (plenty of content mods for every taste) or game bugs (there mods that fix stock game bugs like the decoupler bug, the EVA ejection bug, etc) but I don\u0027t think a game should rely so heavily on mods. It should be able to stand more firmly on its own and have mods enrich the experience. That\u0027s just an opinion though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand maybe squad is addressing most of these issues in the form of undisclosed features for the upcoming update. Then I can\u0027t help but feel sorry for not trusting them enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis only leaves the question of balance. The upcoming game makes so many changes I think it\u0027s hard to be perfectly balanced without a bit of (beta) testing. And while I can tolerate a couple of bugs and little content on a launch day of a title, an unbalanced experience is something that simply kills my perception of a game for me (and a lot of people).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that KSP stayed in alpha way too long. Maybe this scared Squad and they felt intimidated by their 4th anniversary. But the Beta phase is shaping up to be far to small and I fear this might have a negative impact on the popular perception of the game.

My statement is a commentary on software development in general and not Squad specifically. No matter how talented the developers at Squad, things like that do not happen. As someone earlier said, bug fixes come last. It\u0027s not that you can (or should) \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eonly \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Efix bugs at the end, just that you would have to have zero software development experience to not schedule time at the end for bug fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, we are mostly on the outside looking in. This product was in \u0022alpha\u0022 and is now in \u0022beta\u0022 but both are superficial designations. For an \u0022alpha\u0022 build, KSP has been remarkably stable (too stable IMO). For a first release \u0022beta\u0022 build, KSP is remarkably feature poor but with expected (perhaps average) stability. If this were a \u0022real\u0022 final beta build I would say the stability is not where it should be. I\u0027ve experience game killing issues 40\u002B hours into every game I\u0027ve played. Why say anything when the game is still in alpha as that is expected in alpha. But in beta I\u0027m having the same problem with no solution and now Squad says they believe it\u0027s ready to go? So far, Squad has not shown a product close to feature complete (by their definition and most of those here) nor release stability (by everyone\u0027s definition). But there are development cycles internal to Squad as well as external to Squad (but still \u0022inside\u0022 the general public release cycle). Any commentary on this board can only be on the clearly \u0022fake\u0022 build information available to the board. From that perspective, the answer is \u0022no\u0022 but Squad can do this if they change their development model (less back and forth with the customers and more behind closed door development cycles). Personally, that sucks because feeling like part of the development process has been one of the things keeping me interested. If Squad shuts their doors and disappears for 6-12 months to pull this off it will be a pretty disappointing change.

It wouldn\u0027t satisfy the people who want even more out of 1.0, but it\u0027d be better than launching a game with unresolved issues. Those issues will pop up, because some people just hate Early Access and thus so 1.0 will bring in thousands of new players spending dozens of hours each on the game and breaking it in previously unknown ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yakuzi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yakuzi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs mentioned eloquently by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0?p=1697286\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1697286\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ejedensuscg\u003C/a\u003E above, a new player that will launch career will most likely not have fun due to frustration/boredom/lack of incentive.

Jedensuscg joined in July 2013, so he\u0027s probably evaluating the current state of career mode with some experience. The veterans experienced much of what the game has to offer solely through sandbox and people who\u0027ve been with us for a year or so experienced it through the career mode now called \u0027Science Mode\u0027. Only those who\u0027ve played it starting with 0.90 have some inkling on what it\u0027s like for a newbie to play 1.0\u0027s career mode.
