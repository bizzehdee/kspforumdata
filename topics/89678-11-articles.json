The Proton was designed as super heavy ICBM and was test launched in 1965. So although it would be expansive maybe a possible miniseries could be launching the rockets as ICBMS and showing just how devastating they might be. It might be an intresting challenge to launch an ICBM from Russia and try and hit NYC or Washington DC. Useing Kerbal Konstructs and the nukes in BD Armory.
