We humans are, however, used to the concept of up and down, and our instruments are projecting this - most of the laptops, instruments and texts aboard the ISS are aligned, giving the impression that there is a floor and a ceiling, so the human occupants are usually aligned as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are of course situations where you would find yourself talking to someone who is upside down relative to you. Here on Earth that would be really weird - not many people will talk to you while doing a handstand (although I have met a guy who did - it was weird as hell). All of our natural facial recognition would get scrambled and you wouldn\u0027t be able to easily guess the emotions of the other person, for example. Lip reading would also be really hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we can probably get used to it if exposed often to such a situation.
