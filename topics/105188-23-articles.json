I bought it for 28, but I could have bought it for as low as 16 if I had waited for a sale. This game should be the standard $60 for a game. In an industry where people pay $70 for crappy games, KSP stands alone as an Early Access that provided many times over its value in content than originally promised. If you don\u0027t like the price of KSP, don\u0027t buy it. You are the one missing out, not Squad.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is actually missing out. KSP is not big and good enough to cost $59.99, like other AAA games. The current price is not accessible to everyone, and it is the reason why KSP has a steady 5k active players.
