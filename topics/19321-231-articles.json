Turned out to be that I had to reverse the controls (a right click tweakable on the engines) before this behavior would correct itself. Only really applied if you are using SAS. Also, with RCS build aid, you can check to see if you have any torque being generated by your engines in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Subasean","CreatedById":115468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T15:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing with building a Venturestar SSTO more in concept than form, (IE: Flies like, does not look like) and have run into some fascinating lifting body effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, the ship: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PDqzm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
