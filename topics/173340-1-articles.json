How about a new functionality or mod to add duty stations to space shops or stations. So while any given manned craft would function fine with just a general crew, you could optimize its functionality by assigning certain crew members to certain functions (aka duty stations). This could be for instance the science station, which would boost generation of science points, an engineering station, which optimizes engine performance and reduces part failures or a command station, which increases the overall performance of all other Kerbals on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could see a whole range of mod interaction with life support mods, part failure mods and the like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso anyway, just an idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nregards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSebastian\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T03:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda like what you are talking about, but the Stations and bases contract pack adds similar functionality...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
