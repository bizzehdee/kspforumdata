Provides a nice change of pace and gives a good amount to do without worrying about long planetary transfers.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the science contract config. I was using DMagics contract reward configurator thingy and considering what I was doing with it I thought it was overkill. So in a effort to reduce mods I looked around and discovered that if you have Contract Configurator you can have a super simple config (below) to alter the reward science you get.

My probes just evaporate long before reaching this planet from overheating.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can, but it\u0027s pretty tricky. Ernus sits in a sma where the ambient temperature is 1500-1600K, you really need to build your ships to suit. Kerbals only get about 10 seconds on the surface before they blow up! It seems impossible, but it can be done. You just have to make sure all your external parts can withstand that temperature range.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tynrael\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tynrael\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat makes sense! I was wondering why the blue side was coming very fast at my face with not much atmospheric speed reduction- I did not take note of the elevation. There is a diminishing return to how much the chutes can slow you down though, the gap between when they cool down enough to deploy from the insertion and hitting the ground can be pretty brief.
