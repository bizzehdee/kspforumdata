Eve poses an interesting challenge to ascend this way. There is ample power (165% more than kerbin), but you can\u0027t use large solar panels in the atmosphere without being very careful too keep them pointed parallel to the wind. If you stick to static panels, You need 7.27375 times the number of ion engines you have. You can\u0027t go crazy on the panels or you will kill your framerate, and you can\u0027t skimp on the ion engines if you want to be able to gain altitude. more wings lets you use more weight, but too many wings in that thick atmosphere and your craft will spontaneously explode due to runaway oscillations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few of my failed designs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m giving up on it now, but if anyone wants to pick up the legacy, you can have all 11 craft files \u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/5CCpD.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xrha1jC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xrha1jC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nN2OeLH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nN2OeLH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pe8dByX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Pe8dByX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R433tzF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R433tzF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sx02Ubz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sx02Ubz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cLHuu1Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cLHuu1Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NR26KqC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NR26KqC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ac5364p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ac5364p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a5YvOq0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a5YvOq0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T11:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some impressive looking vessels there, a pity the concept didn\u0027t work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice you\u0027ve stacked the ion engines in one of them.

But that proved to be pretty time consuming so I just started strapping a pile of rockets to them and burned straight to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: lol whoops, I thought you asked \u0022how do these crafts get on eve\u0022. Anyways, None of them ever got higher than 1km when starting from the surface. The rate of climb was too slow to get very high before the xenon ran out. However I did have opportunities to test them at higher altitudes by pulling up after aerobraking, and I found that at least my final design was capable of stable self-powered flight at 22km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-05T18:18:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2013 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
