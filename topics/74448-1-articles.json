I do remember that I had to use a lower periapsis than with stock. Part of it is that if you\u0027re coming in at higher interplanetary speeds, you\u0027ll want to aerocapture in multiple passes (I aim for the first pass to be lower than the Mun\u0027s orbit, just to avoid getting thrown out of the Kerbin system). Also, if you also have Deadly Reentry installed, you\u0027ll need a heatshield for all but the most gentle of captures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T01:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Kerb in, depending on speed and mass (which is why your asteroid didn\u0027t slow down) 20km is sufficient. (70 km for Eve if you are wondering). The reason your asteroid didn\u0027t slow down enough was simply because its so massive. There\u0027s lots of inertia there, and quite frankly an aero capture at 29km is difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T04:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this even possible?

In my experience, 28-35 km is where atmospheric drag \u003Cem\u003Estarts\u003C/em\u003E to be significant. If your lowest point is 29 km, your Class E asteroid isn\u0027t spending enough time in the zone needed to slow its ginormous butt to orbital velocities. Go lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may also want to try some drouges to increase drag in the atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you can burn against it\u0027s motion at periapsis, you\u0027ll kill more orbital energy (Oberth, etc) than higher up. You do, however, risk getting ripped off due to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d recommend quick saving (F5) as high above periapsis as possible so you can try different altitudes. If one depth doesn\u0027t cut it, quick load (F9) and try a deeper periapsis. If you can\u0027t reload to a point previous to the asteroid being above periapsis, I\u0027d just let the asteroid go, chalk it up to a learning experience, and find a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T04:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend between 20-25Km.
