I felt that Exclipse was actually mistaken, and that 1.0 was actually closer to the Skylon model. So I tested it out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the Skylon graph, the last point is roughly where I cut off the main engine, before the orbital insertion burn. Skylon uses OMS engines to circularize it\u0027s orbit, and both of these SSTO\u0027s carry OMS engines because of that. Probably not the most efficient design, but it works! Here are the results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP 0.9\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 18.3t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: 2 Rapier engines, 2 OMS engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.9 ascent was fairly traditional. 45 degree climb, leveling off between 10-20k to build up to about 1300m/s before kicking up to 45 degrees again between 20-25k to raise the apoapsis to about 75k. Circularized to a 85x85 km Orbit, with plenty of deltaV to spare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EJuarLml.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EJuarLml.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oD3l036.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oD3l036.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP 1.0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 26.6t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: 2 Rapier engines, 4 OMS engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 1.0 my strategy was to either maintain or increase airspeed. Took off at about a 20 degree angle, lowering my climb to about 10 degrees to maintain airspeed when i hit the drag wall at Mach 1. Stayed at about 10 degrees until I started picking up speed past Mach 1 at about 5km altitude. At about 10km altitude speed started coming on fast and I started pitching up to about 30 degrees off horizon going 540m/s. Slowly pitch down in a gravity turn to about 25 degrees (Velocity vector is at 20 degrees, so 5 degree AoA) at 24km altitude and 915m/s surface speed. At this point Rapier jet mode is dying out, so I switched to rocket mode. I try to stay close to the velocity vector (5-15 degree AoA) to reduce airspeed loss due to drag, until main engine cutoff at about 45km. I forgot to take a point at main engine cut off, so that isn\u0027t on the graph below, unfortunately! Ran out of main engine fuel before the end of the circularization burn, but finished it with the OMS engines with about 200m/s deltaV to spare, I\u0027d estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA further note, reentry without airbrake spam is actually pretty straightforward with this thing! I aimed for a 40km periapsis, and came down pitched about 45 degrees. At 40-35km I started S-turning like mad while keeping the nose as high as possible, using the control surfaces and the torque wheel. By 20km airspeed was already down to about 600m/s! Then, simply glided it down, landing it at about 65m/s using wing mounted spoilers to slow me down towards the end, and the drogue chute to slow me down faster while on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2qK57sFl.png\u0022 alt=\u00222qK57sFl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dw9BldRl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dw9BldRl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me at least, 1.0 is much closer to Skylon.

Shed a bit of extra weight, dispose of anything I won\u0027t be needing for the return trip, and I can get my butt the rest of the way to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust needed to remember that, while earlier versions of KSP favored strapping 90-billion air intakes on my wings and making 70km on jets alone, 1.0 is much, much more sensible regarding air-breathing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and I\u0027m loving the fact that I no longer need to worry about having too many control surfaces. Seriously, the infiniglide thing, never realized how much it affected how I build aircraft until now. Now I\u0027m not afraid to add another pair of elevons, or to toss on a set of canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the best way to think of 1.0 is this: Take everything you learned from the past several revisions of KSP, and throw it all away. Start with a clean slate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, this is, I think, the perfect compromise for aerodynamics. It\u0027s not quite as harsh as FAR could be (I know there were a few versions in the past that made me scream and curse in rage), and it\u0027s not as ridiculous as 0.90 and previous, favoring ROFL-Jets and infinigliders and \u0022Intakes... bloody everywhere! Cover every surface in intakes!\u0022 It comes out to be \u0022If you know anything about airplanes, you can make a plane that flies. With a bit of tweaking, you can get that plane into space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for rockets, I\u0027ve already done some stupid things as an excuse to try the new aerodynamics. Haven\u0027t done a single-stage rocket, but the last thing I did was trying to get to orbit using nothing but solid rocket boosters. Nearly managed it. Couldn\u0027t quite tweak the fuel load for the last handful of sepratrons, nor the thrust for some of the old RT-10\u0027s to be quite right. Always ended up either a few hundred delta-V short, or a few hundred delta-V over. Still was a fun experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually have been having more fun in 1.0 Stock than I\u0027ve had in any previous Stock version. Normally after a day or two, I put KSP down until the mods rain in, then I stuff as many as I can into the poor game and make it work. This time, I\u0027ve had fun with the new aero without needing to resort to more parts to satisfy a craving for more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs that an RCSTO?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENah, it was on top of an SRB; I sent it up just to make sure that the minisat would deploy properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight be of use to some people:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeed a low-tech stock-aero basic plane for shuttling tourists around the place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne Startup\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.
