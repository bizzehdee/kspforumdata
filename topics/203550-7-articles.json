Not that we cared too much. All you had to do was get boots on the ground, not establish any sort of long term colony. Today,\u00A0China just wants to go there to compete with US, and that\u0027s it. Russia\u0027s claims about having a Mars program aren\u0027t even credible, and even China\u0027s are in way too early of a stage to call it anything concrete. So really, US wants to go to Mars as some sort of cold war vestige and publicity stunt, and that\u0027s about it. \u0022Every single national program,\u0022 is such a huge overstatement here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd do what with them? Surface structures on Mars aren\u0027t suitable for long term habitation. Between radiation and toxicity and abrasiveness of Martian dust, just waiting out for next departure window on Mars is a huge challenge.\u00A0You have to dig to build anything remotely sustainable for long term habitation. And that\u0027s not something you\u0027re going to be able to do with a few landers. You need to land an entire infrastructure on Mars before you can make it habitable. There are a few projects that suggest turning Martian dust into printable material to construct mounds over landed habitats, but even that\u0027s a huge undertaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContrast this to Venus where a single lander with a balloon and additional inflatable sections can be suitable for long term habitation. Something like Starship would actually work perfectly, as it can survive the re-entry and has enough volume to bring in the inflatables.\u00A0You\u0027ll have to find a way to resupply it, and you\u0027ll have to find a way to dock a return vessel to it, but at least you don\u0027t have the fundamental problem of people not being able to survive there with minimal equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. It\u0027s a problem for humans, though. A big one. And since we\u0027re trying to find a place where people can live long term, picking a place that\u0027s better for equipment is hardly the best criterion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it\u0027s a lot easier to organize a return trip from Mars. So if you want to just visit it for a few months, just to put a check mark that you\u0027ve had boots on the ground, by all means. Go to Mars. I mean, honestly, that\u0027s all these gov\u0027t space programs are trying to do. Get good publicity stunt of having people walk on another planet. But that solves absolutely none of the long term issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity problems can be overcome if you have enough space, and radiation if you have enough shielding. You can\u0027t do either with a few landers. You have to build major infrastructure. And then you\u0027re still living short miserable lives in cramped underground tunnels, because that\u0027s the best you can hope for on Mars. I just don\u0027t even see the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay I remind you that Venus is still not a good option? Most of the reasons why happen to do with the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus, because of it\u0027s enormous levels of greenhouse gasses, is incredibly hot, meaning that anything that lands on the surface of Venus will have to be built to not only be strong against the atmospheric pressure, but\u00A0temperature resistant against a day time that can melt lead. The planet\u0027s day is longer than its year, making it so that such a material would have to sustain a constant stream of heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInflatable habitats would probably not be able to sustain humans; I\u0027m not a scientist, but if you even want a chance of properly inflating a habitat module capable of withstanding 92\u00A0bar without crushing the hapless astronauts involved, you\u0027ll probably want to use a lot of Helium, since it is the second\u00A0least dense gasses in the universe. Hydrogen is a horrible idea because it is reactive to oxygen, but regardless of whether it\u0027s helium or not, you\u0027ll still have to make sure a large chunk of your air is breathable, otherwise the hapless astronauts are either gonna be short of breath, constantly tired and gasping, or very, very dead. But you can\u0027t use an earthlike atmospheric make up for something that\u0027s supposed to be inflated unless it\u0027s at a high pressure that would otherwise crush the astronauts. Like I\u00A0said, I\u0027m not a scientist, so there could be a way for an inflatable habitat to work on Venus, but it really does not seem like there\u0027s a way that\u0027s possible with practical science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t even gotten into the fact that the data we have on Venus suggests that sulfuric acid rain is a common occurrence on the planet. I don\u0027t need to explain why that\u0027s bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut okay, lets just assume that we somehow manage to overcome all of those challenges and land on Venus with the first supplies for a proper base. How do you plan on getting the rocket back? How are you going to make continuous and repeated supply missions to Venus cost effective and sustainable? Any other KSP player whose done an interplanetary mission\u00A0can tell you that atmospheric rocket launches back to Eve orbit are some of the most difficult things anyone can do in the game. Now Venus has a little less than half of Earth\u0027s gravity, but that is not the problem. 92 bar atmospheric pressure would make it that even an F-1 engine strapped to a small fuel tank couldn\u0027t fly there. The only way you could possibly get a craft to rise from Venus\u0027s atmosphere would be using propellers, and that would be impractical, or at the very least difficult to design around with a rocket that needs to enter the atmosphere in the first place. But you also have to put into perspective that we use multi-stage rockets to get to Earth orbit just with our own atmosphere. Fully reusable rockets are an impossibility for a\u00A0\u00A0Venus colonization mission, even if it was possible, and that makes such a venture infinitely more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I can raise the counterpoint that there have been proposals to create floating colonies on Venus that would sustain themselves above the Venetian sulfuric cloud layer. This is actually a somewhat good idea on paper, solving most of the problems caused by the atmosphere, and could possibly be done in practicality, but designing for that type of colony\u00A0would be grueling and resource expensive on a scale humanity might not be ready to handle for it\u0027s first colony beyond the Earth-moon system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your post you question what the point is in colonizing mars when the ground is toxic, the sun blasts ionizing radiation on it, and the gravity will make keeping humans healthy an issue, and then point to a planet with conditions up to 40 times worse than Mars that would make colonization significantly harder, maybe impossible without terraforming or floating platforms, both of which we can\u0027t do to the level needed for a colonization mission with the technology we have now. If we were talking about the moon this would be a completely different situation, as it would be significantly easier to establish a human colony on the moon than on mars, and would be more rewarding from an Earth-centric point of view, despite that\u00A0coming with its own challenges. But that would be just what it would be -\u00A0Earth-centric. Colonizing Mars to many people is not about the practicalities of creating a self-sustaining colony on Mars, it\u0027s about expanding humanities\u0027 horizons beyond the sphere of Earth by creating it, practicalities be damned. It\u0027s about taking the first steps to bringing humanity into a truly extraplanetary future for the first time ever. As mentioned before, to some, it even could relevant to the survival of the human species itself. You talk about the US government wanting to colonize Mars for petty reasons, but the US government largely doesn\u0027t want to go to Mars, at least not until\u00A0the current Artemis program plans are finished. Support for a colony on\u00A0mars in the US is largely coming from the people (and by \u0022the people\u0022 I don\u0027t mean rich billionaires like Elon). People fantasize about it, romanticize it, sometimes to a distracting degree. But they do it because they genuinely see it as the next giant leap for mankind, the natural next answer to the question \u0022where will we go next?\u0022, perilous dangers and life threatening conditions be damned. Not many people outside theoretical scientists and sci-fi artists can say that they feel the same way about Venus. The gas giants are too far, the asteroid belt too low gravity, and Mercury too small and irradiated to be used for much more than distant-future dyson-sphere materials. Really the only two places we can go right now are Mars and the moon. In the role of the dice that caused our solar system to be made this way, our two closest next door homes are a cold, toxic rock that gets bathed in solar\u00A0radiation, and a close, lifeless rock that at one point in it\u0027s orbit gets absolutely blasted by solar radiation for a few days straight. This is the hand we\u0027ve been dealt and a lot of people are willing to role with it if it means that a human can step foot and stay on another world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-13T07:07:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2021 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by NXDIAZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T07:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626147432\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022southernplain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, southernplain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think Venus is a bad option overall, but it is not clear to me that preferring Mars over Venus is \u0022entirely silly\u0022 when every single national space program targets human Mars landings first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus has the problem of the surface being literally hell for human life.\u00A0At least we can be on the ground at Mars and build initial surface structures (which may be able to share design lessons from 2020\u0027s heritage Lunar landing infrastructure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Martian gravity well is quite a bit less of a problem for spaceflight infrastructure than Venus as well (Venusian escape velocity is pretty much Earthlike).

To add more on to what K^2 said, the reason people got interested in going there in the first place originally was because of the \u0022canals\u0022 that were popularized by Percival Lowell in the late 1800s. Then in the early 50s when ICBM development began, space travel became a very serious possibility which numerous entertainment companies took advantage of. Part of the reason Mars is automatically accepted as the next target for space exploration after the Moon is \u0022because Von Braun said so\u0022; Disney\u0027s Tomorrowland episodes on space exploration were instrumental in shaping US public perception of space. Likewise I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the interest in Mars in the USSR/Russia comes from early 20th century works of art (like the movie Aelita), and then considering these same people responsible for propaganda then had to create new works during early Space Race, they\u00A0naturally chose Mars as a dreamy target, as it is what they did before. And it has stuck since then, often quite simply because \u0022they said so\u0022 (they dreamed it first and now I like it too), not because of any logic reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly Venus isn\u0027t considered often\u00A0despite Soviet papers on floating colonies in the early 70s and Geoffrey A. Landis\u0027s work on proposals for balloon based exploration. That\u0027s not to say Mars is at fault, but \u0022just because they said so\u0022 is a poor reason to choose it as a colonization target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the ground is that important. A colony would fly/float, and would likely be so massive it would be hard to tell you were even in the air. To use an Earthly example, despite regularly getting sea-sick on ocean liners or having trouble sleeping on trains, many passengers of German trans-Atlantic rigid airships in the 20s and 30s found no issues travelling and staying multiple nights aboard the airships. And if the gravity is lower anyways, you are likely going to feel uncomfortable to a certain extent. Versus Venus with its Earth like gravity, which coupled with the nature of lighter-than-air-esque flight should not create major comfort issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship would not land on Venus. This is just random thinking based on experience with space history (but not engineering), but it would probably make sense to build a Gateway-like space station in Venus orbit. Starships travel their, unload their cargo and crew, which then board a specialized Venus Descent Vehicle. The VDV then *descends* in a similar manner to the following-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Proposed_NASA_HAVOC_Missions_to_Venus2.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Proposed_NASA_HAVOC_Missions_to_Venus2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airship then docks at the colony. The VDV could carry its own VAV (Venus Ascent Vehicle) for returning to the \u0022Venus Gateway\u0022 or the first settlers could wait until they can construct the \u0022colony structure\u0022 (the balloon) which would perhaps have launch facilities for a reusable Venus \u0022Lander\u0022 (it would only land at the colony of course). Whereas the Venus colonies themselves could be built inside the balloon (nitrogen-oxygen mix for humans is a lifting gas there), the reusable Venus Lander- perhaps which could simply be Starship itself, eliminating the need for airships and a Gateway type space station- will land on an unpressurized structure built above the balloon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you find a Starship landing pad balloon/dirigible/airship to be preposterous, here is a quote from the article linked below-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EVenus settlers would float where Vega 1 and Vega 2 floated, but Landis rejected helium balloons. He noted that, on Venus, a human-breathable nitrogen/oxygen air mix is a lifting gas. A balloon containing a cubic meter of breathable air would be capable of hoisting about half a kilogram, or about half as much weight as a balloon containing a cubic meter of helium. A kilometer-wide spherical\u00A0balloon filled only with breathable air could in the Venusian atmosphere lift 700,000 tons, or roughly the weight of 230 fully-fueled Saturn V rockets.

Safety and perhaps mental anxiety for colonists is a huge improvement, if the Mars city suffers a breach it has the potential to explode, the counteraction of such a problem of which would require building the city in segments that can seal off in an emergency. Versus on Venus where while the air will begin to leak, it will do so slowly, and it poses no threat to the colony itself (the outside toxic atmosphere will not mix with the inside fast, and it will not drop altitude quickly). I would feel much more comfortable in a floating Venus balloon-craft\u00A0than in a lunar or Mars habitat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.

But you also have to put into perspective that we use multi-stage rockets to get to Earth orbit just with our own atmosphere. Fully reusable rockets are an impossibility for a\u00A0\u00A0Venus colonization mission, even if it was possible, and that makes such a venture infinitely more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I can raise the counterpoint that there have been proposals to create floating colonies on Venus that would sustain themselves above the Venetian sulfuric cloud layer. This is actually a somewhat good idea on paper, solving most of the problems caused by the atmosphere, and could possibly be done in practicality, but designing for that type of colony\u00A0would be grueling and resource expensive on a scale humanity might not be ready to handle for it\u0027s first colony beyond the Earth-moon system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your post you question what the point is in colonizing mars when the ground is toxic, the sun blasts ionizing radiation on it, and the gravity will make keeping humans healthy an issue, and then point to a planet with conditions up to 40 times worse than Mars that would make colonization significantly harder, maybe impossible without terraforming or floating platforms, both of which we can\u0027t do to the level needed for a colonization mission with the technology we have now. If we were talking about the moon this would be a completely different situation, as it would be significantly easier to establish a human colony on the moon than on mars, and would be more rewarding from an Earth-centric point of view, despite that\u00A0coming with its own challenges. But that would be just what it would be -\u00A0Earth-centric. Colonizing Mars to many people is not about the practicalities of creating a self-sustaining colony on Mars, it\u0027s about expanding humanities\u0027 horizons beyond the sphere of Earth by creating it, practicalities be damned. It\u0027s about taking the first steps to bringing humanity into a truly extraplanetary future for the first time ever. As mentioned before, to some, it even could relevant to the survival of the human species itself. You talk about the US government wanting to colonize Mars for petty reasons, but the US government largely doesn\u0027t want to go to Mars, at least not until\u00A0the current Artemis program plans are finished. Support for a colony on\u00A0mars in the US is largely coming from the people (and by \u0022the people\u0022 I don\u0027t mean rich billionaires like Elon). People fantasize about it, romanticize it, sometimes to a distracting degree. But they do it because they genuinely see it as the next giant leap for mankind, the natural next answer to the question \u0022where will we go next?\u0022, perilous dangers and life threatening conditions be damned. Not many people outside theoretical scientists and sci-fi artists can say that they feel the same way about Venus. The gas giants are too far, the asteroid belt too low gravity, and Mercury too small and irradiated to be used for much more than distant-future dyson-sphere materials. Really the only two places we can go right now are Mars and the moon. In the role of the dice that caused our solar system to be made this way, our two closest next door homes are a cold, toxic rock that gets bathed in solar\u00A0radiation, and a close, lifeless rock that at one point in it\u0027s orbit gets absolutely blasted by solar radiation for a few days straight. This is the hand we\u0027ve been dealt and a lot of people are willing to role with it if it means that a human can step foot and stay on another world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

To add more on to what K^2 said, the reason people got interested in going there in the first place originally was because of the \u0022canals\u0022 that were popularized by Percival Lowell in the late 1800s. Then in the early 50s when ICBM development began, space travel became a very serious possibility which numerous entertainment companies took advantage of. Part of the reason Mars is automatically accepted as the next target for space exploration after the Moon is \u0022because Von Braun said so\u0022; Disney\u0027s Tomorrowland episodes on space exploration were instrumental in shaping US public perception of space. Likewise I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the interest in Mars in the USSR/Russia comes from early 20th century works of art (like the movie Aelita), and then considering these same people responsible for propaganda then had to create new works during early Space Race, they\u00A0naturally chose Mars as a dreamy target, as it is what they did before. And it has stuck since then, often quite simply because \u0022they said so\u0022 (they dreamed it first and now I like it too), not because of any logic reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly Venus isn\u0027t considered often\u00A0despite Soviet papers on floating colonies in the early 70s and Geoffrey A. Landis\u0027s work on proposals for balloon based exploration. That\u0027s not to say Mars is at fault, but \u0022just because they said so\u0022 is a poor reason to choose it as a colonization target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the ground is that important. A colony would fly/float, and would likely be so massive it would be hard to tell you were even in the air. To use an Earthly example, despite regularly getting sea-sick on ocean liners or having trouble sleeping on trains, many passengers of German trans-Atlantic rigid airships in the 20s and 30s found no issues travelling and staying multiple nights aboard the airships. And if the gravity is lower anyways, you are likely go to feel uncomfortable to a certain extent. Versus Venus with its Earth like gravity, which coupled with the nature of lighter-than-air-esque flight should not create major comfort issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship would not land on Venus. This is just random thinking based on experience with space history (but not engineering), but it would probably make sense to build a Gateway-like space station in Venus orbit. Starships travel their, unload their cargo and crew, which then board a specialized Venus Descent Vehicle. The VDV then *descends* in a similar manner to the following-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Proposed_NASA_HAVOC_Missions_to_Venus2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Proposed_NASA_HAVOC_Missions_to_Venus2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 width=\u0022800\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Proposed_NASA_HAVOC_Missions_to_Venus2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airship then docks at the colony. The VDV could carry its own VAV (Venus Ascent Vehicle) for returning to the \u0022Venus Gateway\u0022 or the first settlers could wait until they can construct the \u0022colony structure\u0022 (the balloon) which would perhaps have launch facilities for a reusable Venus \u0022Lander\u0022 (it would only land at the colony of course). Whereas the Venus colonies themselves could be built inside the balloon (nitrogen-oxygen mix for humans is a lifting gas there), the reusable Venus Lander- perhaps which could simply be Starship itself, eliminating the need for airships and a Gateway type space station- will land on an unpressurized structure built above the balloon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you find a Starship landing pad balloon/dirigible/airship to be preposterous, here is a quote from the article linked below-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this is just a random idea and likely has some flaws and could be rectified, but with an architecture roughly like this, a Venus colony would be very much doable with Starship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other thoughts-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. No need to worry about Marsquakes destroying or damaging the colony\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Colonies can crowd around eachother for support, no need to build them far apart as dictated by Mars surface geography\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Safety and perhaps mental anxiety for colonists is a huge improvement, if the Mars city suffers a breach it has the potential to explode, the counteraction of such a problem of which would require building the city in segments that can seal off in an emergency. Versus on Venus where while the air will begin to leak, it will do so slowly, and it poses no threat to the colony itself (the outside toxic atmosphere will not mix with the inside fast, and it will not drop altitude quickly). I would feel much more comfortable in a floating Venus balloon-craft\u00A0than in a lunar or Mars habitat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. No need to worry about dust storms interrupting supply of energy through a solar farm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent article to read about Venus colonization pros-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflighthistory.blogspot.com/2020/08/venus-is-best-place-in-solar-system-to.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spaceflighthistory.blogspot.com/2020/08/venus-is-best-place-in-solar-system-to.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo go back to the point of the thread- what is SpaceX doing wrong- I think they are investing way to much into a plan with too many unknowns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you said Martian gravity and radiation are some of the biggest problems, and SpaceX has no presented no idea how to solve them- in fact, they haven\u0027t even looked into whether Martian gravity is safe or not. This is beyond irresponsible, and not only threatens human lives- it threatens SpaceX\u0027s goal itself.

It\u0027s just always seemed as something that would be an extreme design challenge like nothing humanity has not seen in it\u0027s entire existence, even compared to a Mars colony. I mainly bring this up because this is one of those situations where it\u0027s a concept that has never been done before. Call me uncreative, but it just seems hard to imagine people living inside\u00A0a Venetian fleet of zeppelins, surviving in the upper atmosphere without much maintenance in a realistic way. Then again, we did say similar things about reusable rockets in the past, and now Falcon 9s are landing so often they might as well be air liners, and two fully reusable rockets are on the way in the US alone, so who really knows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-13T07:32:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2021 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by NXDIAZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slyguy3129","CreatedById":212474,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T07:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003838\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626152520\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208000\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beccab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/12/2021 at 10:02 PM, Beccab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe isn\u0027t\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX is doing exactly zero \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, please get at least a single fact right if you want to call everyone a fanboy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not calling \u0022everyone\u0022 a fanboi, [snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd fine, call me when he puts a man into space with his mess.

Anyway, this is all some pretty interesting information you\u0027ve provided. It\u0027s not as if I haven\u0027t discounted the idea of a floating Venetian colony. It\u0027s just always seemed as something that would be an extreme design challenge like nothing humanity has not seen in it\u0027s entire existence, even compared to a Mars colony. I mainly bring this up because this is one of those situations where it\u0027s a concept that has never been done before. Call me uncreative, but it just seems hard to imagine people living inside\u00A0a Venetian fleet of zeppelins, surviving in the upper atmosphere without much maintenance in a realistic way. Then again, we did say similar things about reusable rockets in the past, and now Falcon 9s are landing so often they might as well be air liners, and two fully reusable rockets are on the way in the US alone, so who really knows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars would be similar however. No outside support, only what is there. The only difference is one is floating and one is on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like the concept of a Mars colony\u00A0has\u00A0not been done either- even the Antarctic stations rely on resupply. Historical colonization is a poor comparison, as the colonists were surrounded by a wealth of resources and did not need to worry about maintaining a breathable atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree we can not know what \u0022will\u0022 happen and I think we have to wait and see instead of declaring ideas \u0022dead\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I look at it is this- if we are going to build an at least semi-self-sustaining colony/base on another planet, it is going to be a huge engineering challenge no matter what- humans still need a set amount of things to survive. The only difference is that one is floating, and in my opinion, it is worth taking up the challenge if it means eliminating the still unknown prospect of human development being impeded by 0.38g. This is all within the context of building a colony \u0022now\u0022 of course, as the topic of the thread stipulates, not spending 20 years with a Mars research station before building a colony to research the effects of Martian gravity on humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-13T08:44:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2021 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SunlitZelkova\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slyguy3129","CreatedById":212474,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T08:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224003893\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626164704\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208000\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beccab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Beccab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, they haven\u0027t .

Breathable air is a lifting gas, so you can have an inflatable greenhouse floating alongside the main habitat. So long as you bring plants that require small amount of soil and can be sustained with drip irrigation, the whole thing can be light enough to require almost no additional support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you\u0027ll have plenty of sunlight and you can run the greenhouse a bit CO2 rich, you can have very fast growth cycles with some plants. Fully sustainable might still be a reach for something that can reasonably be deployed from a single launch, but it can certainly supplement mission supplies allowing for much longer stay before resupply is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder peak CO2 conditions, plants can get to about 5% efficiency of incident solar to carbohydrate energy. Venus gets 2.6kW/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E under direct sunlight. That\u0027s about 400W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of average\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0insolation. A 2,000cal diet averages out to about 100W, so you can in theory sustain a person with just 5m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of plants under ideal conditions, but I don\u0027t think anyone has figured out how to get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethese\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0levels of efficiency from agriculture. It does sound like a possible avenue for exploration, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other limiting factor is water. You have about 0.1g/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of sulfuric acid haze at relevant altitude. I don\u0027t know how much water content is in it, but worst case scenario, if it\u0027s exceptionally dry, you get 18g of water from 98g of pure sulfuric acid. The 2,000cal diet is designed around 2L of water intake. Biosynthesis of 2,000cal of starch will take up another 300g of water.\u00A0So very conservatively, say about 2.5L per person per day. So that comes out to capturing almost 140,000m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of atmosphere for the condensers. That isn\u0027t actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0much, as it\u0027s just 1.6m/s average through a 1m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0aperture, which is a very reasonable flow, but it\u0027s a significant amount of hardware that has to work day and night for the duration of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, all of this can be improved with resupply. We don\u0027t currently have anything like a working plan for a self-sufficient colony on Mars. I mean, there are ideas, but they all involve massive infrastructure - nothing you can bring along on a few Starships. So if we\u0027re doing a resupplied mission either way, Venus is still way easier, as you won\u0027t have to worry about gardening or water capture. And if we want to go towards self-sustaining, there is a clear opportunity to gradually scale up operations on Venus, vs having to build entire infrastructure on Mars before it\u0027s even a consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0Note that for day-night cycle, we really don\u0027t care about planet\u0027s rotation, as it\u0027s super slow.
