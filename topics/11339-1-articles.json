I haven\\\u0027t tried it with the runway yet, as it\\\u0027s rather difficult to line up on vanilla (for me, anyway) but I\\\u0027ve cruised at roughly 10km a few times, and run out of feul. Once the plane starts to glide down, I simply keep the nose up until I hit around 3km altitude, after which point I put a slight upward trim on the pitch, and the plane will land itself. For safety and emergency abort, the plane features an emergency decoupler to jettison the cockpit, which also has 2 parachutes to get the crew to the ground in one piece. After learning the plane and realizing how well it flies, I tried to remove the decoupler and parachutes, which for some reason completely throw off the plan and make it difficult to fly. Only difficulty with this plane is initial takeoff, as it requires the runway, ground, and gets within 100m of the ocean before actually taking off. If you hold S for too long though, it attempts to backflip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Karnac is loosely inspired by the Concorde\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"morninam","CreatedById":14650,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice looking design. i think ill try to build something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
