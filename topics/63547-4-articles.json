I can tell you now a F-15C can do a fair bit better than mach 1.3 with two of those engines. IMy test aircraft is the same weight as the F15C Eagle, and is roughly the same size, yet those two F100s which also power the F15C to mach 2\u002B barely get this aircraft over mach 1.5 at the same altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your intakeair is not enough KSP automatically throttles down engines to compensate that.
