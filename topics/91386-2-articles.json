Strangely enough, lots of particularly silly engine-through-tank clipping seems to be perfectly possible without actually turning part clipping on, while perfectly acceptable connections such as RCS thruster blocks on some tanks and nose cones on the tops of boosters just will not connect without part clipping enabled.

The oxidizer still has mass and is still being fired forcefully out the back of the engine, so you can\u0027t just pretend it\u0027s not there. Personally, I have no problem with pretending that you\u0027ve figured out some cool magic way of compressing the fuel into twice the density half the space, since the mass is still all there anyway, and mass is most of what makes ships challenging. (It\u0027s also a singleplayer game, so it doesn\u0027t matter what I think about your game anyway.) If you really want to be a stickler for accuracy about clipping engines into tanks, you can always just tweak the fuel in the tank down to half full, or just use a smaller tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-30T17:51:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2014 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T18:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when i clip things they explode, depends on the part so all needs testing but i will if i can get away with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i dont go crazy just here and there.
