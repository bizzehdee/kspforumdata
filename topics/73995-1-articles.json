But in this case you don\u0027t, so no worries!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing this, the best place to burn to change your inclination after capture is immediately after your apoapsis falls within the SOI (ie, when you no longer have an escape trajectory). Loop around to your apoapsis and perform a plane change maneuver there. This is efficient because your velocity at an apoapsis that is only just within the SOI will be incredibly low. If we\u0027re going 5ms in one direction, it costs us only a little over 7ms to change that to be 5ms in a perpendicular direction (yay Pythagorus). So when you perform your Eve aerobrake, don\u0027t aerobrake so low that you nearly circularize. Instead aerobrake just enough to leave you with a super high apoapsis. Then perform your plane change. Then aerobrake again on your next loop to bring your apoapsis down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, having said that: If you aerobrake at Eve your periapsis will be just above the atmosphere while your apoapsis will be high up near Gilly.

I\u0027m not sure if anyone has actually done the math, but it might be cheaper not to aerobrake, and instead enter Eve\u0027s SOI and capture on engine power at the altitude of Gilly.
