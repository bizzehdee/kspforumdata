This happens even with a impact less than 6m/s (a couple of chutes). it seems like it is destroyed by the chute being cut and settling into the water. It\u0027s annoying since i\u0027ve taken all care to return the module, only to have it disappear just before the end of the mission. I\u0027ve known about the fuel tanks having this issue for some time, and that\u0027s annoying too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T21:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s why you land on land so you don\u0027t explode but yeah that\u0027s a terrible bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
