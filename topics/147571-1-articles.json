I don\u0027t. I\u0027ve read up on the game (hopefully i didn\u0027t miss anything), and there are some things about it that just confuse me, and i was hoping someone could explain them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not trying to be critical or bitter. I genuinely want to understand and enjoy the game, but there are a few things that i just do not understand about it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-Everyone seems fine with buying virtual ships with real money, sometimes for hundreds of dollars. I get that it supports the developers and is\u00A0a nice bonus for dedicated players, but still, isn\u0027t it technically DLC? What\u0027s more, doesn\u0027t it kind of make the game pay-to-win? After all, i\u0027d suspect that even someone with a fully upgraded aurora couldn\u0027t compete with someone who just bought the $1000 cruiser, or even an origin 300i.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2-Star Citizen seems to highly stress how realistic its space combat is. However, why is it still so prevalent that the game\u0027s space combat is based on air combat? It seems slow, inefficient, and stressful on pilots to turn like an airplane in space, instead of simply turning and burning in the opposite direction like we do in ksp. Also, what\u0027s the point of having forward facing guns on a spacecraft, anyway?

Yeah, that absolutely sounds like pay-to-win to me.\u00A0 However, without actually having seen what sort of advantages those ships have in-game (as opposed to on-paper-stats) it\u0027s hard to really say whether they truly provide a tangible advantage, or whether they just look pretty.\u00A0 Personally, when I was \u0022given\u0022 my copy, I was \u0022given\u0022 a Racing-oriented ship.\u00A0 Personally, the idea of spending 3- or 4-digits in real money on a ship is a little insane... but maybe that\u0027s just me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

This has nothing to do with the game, but with the business model of crowdfunding. The players do not buy these ships - which will be available to all players later for ingame currency earned from missions, trading etc. like any other game - the ships are meant as a bonus for people who wish to support the game even more after the original \u0022kickstarter\u0022 campaign ended.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it is not a DLC, as all ships will be available to everyone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding the \u0022pay to win\u0022 aspect - kinda, but players do not have to compete against each other - as far as I am up to speed - as you can choose how much interaction you want to have in \u0022your game\u0022. A bit like the instanced game play of Elite Dangerous you can choose to encounter players in PvP or almost noone at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The flight model has and does change over the time of the game\u0027s development. They always tried to combine realism with playability.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending on the maneuverability of a ship, it will do exactly that: turn around and burn the other way. To not kill the pilot instantly, you fly a curve and thereby change the flight vector over time. This also makes the ship harder to target, as it will keep moving around instead of slowing down first.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegarding the forward facing gun turrets: Gameplay. Automation kills it. There are weapons (I think) that help the pilot to aim and hit by gimbling a bit, and larger vessels will most likely have auto-targeting turrets, but it is still meant to be a game to be played instead of watched by the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
