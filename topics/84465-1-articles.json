I can import it as a blend file or fbx it doesn\u0027t matter. Unity is \u0022creating\u0022 random materials out of thin air for the objects. All of my objects have the material aura_panel. There are NO other materials in blender at all. Every object is linked to this one single material. When I import into unity it is inventing these random materials I\u0027ve never seen before and applying multiples of them to each object. If I set the object to have only 1 material size in unity it makes part of the mesh invisible, so this isn\u0027t a solution I can use. I am dumbfounded as to why this is happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mYoujdm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mYoujdm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T04:19:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T00:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I right in thinking that the first shader is what you set up and the second shader was generated by Unity? Regardless, have you set your shader(s) to KSP shaders instead of other Unity shaders?
