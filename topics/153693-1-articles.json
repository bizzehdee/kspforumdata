When in KSP update history SQUAD put the IVA looked amazing but that was a lot of time ago and now we are in KSP 1.2 but, for future updates will be amazing to move in the interior of the spaceship. I\u0027ve know that there\u0027s a mod to move in the interior of the SpaceShip but I\u0027ll like to had this on stock game. The things that I\u0027ll like that SQUAD will add is this: 1 Instead of press the EVA button to get out, get out of the seat and do an EVA by opening the door of the command pod. 2 More parts of space stations to move get the Kerbal move there free. This is an idea for you SQUAD. Will be awesome to put this on the game.
