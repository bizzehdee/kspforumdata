I usually go up as fast as I can considering Q, TWR and wobble and then tilt so that I be constantly about 1min before apoapsis. If I am basically horizontal I reduce thrust if necessary to achieve orbit directly at apoapsis. However, I\u0027d be interested in better understanding it. Could you or someone else point to some theory about optimal ascent?

Look at things as more of a goal at the end, rather than a guideline as you ascend. Now obviously, every vehicle and payload will be different. Some payloads may not be able to handle high g.
