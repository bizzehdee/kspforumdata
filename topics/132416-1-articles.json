A lot of science had already been done and was no longer available, making the challenge a little bit harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used Mechjeb for its delta-v display, orbital info, setting up some of the Hohmann transfers (out of laziness), but especially for manually\u00A0editing\u00A0maneuvers to high precision. I love how you can tweak maneuver nodes with 0.01 m/s precision, and sometimes even less than that! I also installed VOID later on during the mission just to see which biomes I was passing over. I didn\u0027t initially because I felt it was cheating, but at some point I really felt \u0022this is ridiculous, incessantly clicking that little button to get the last elusive biome and doing it over and over again, why am I wasting my time with this?\u0022 and got VOID.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission didn\u0027t\u00A0start out as a challenge mission, in fact I just wanted to fulfill a few contracts on a mission to Eve and Gilly: put a satellite into Eve orbit (the whole rocket was the satellite,\u00A0which explains the cupola, hitchhiker\u0027s cabin\u00A0and unused docking port), gather science around Eve, land in four places on Gilly. And while doing all that, I also wanted to get as much\u00A0science as I could to finish the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket in a nutshell: fourteen of the biggest fuel tanks with seven Mammoths underneath, 18 solid fuel boosters, 13 brown tanks with nukes (no oxidizer in those tanks), a few reaction wheels, 12 cheap solar panels, a hitchhiker module, a cupola (because of the Eve satellite contract), a small docking port (also for that contract), some parachutes, a Science Jr., and a service bay containing Goo, atmosphere analysis, gravity monitor, pressure monitor, seismic thingy, and a battery. Oh, and a thermometer of course, and probably some more stuff I forgot to mention here. I made a mistake placing the ladder, so the goo was just a tiny a bit too far away for a scientist to reset. That meant I had to EVA from the ladder to the goo and back every single time. That\u0027s a mistake I won\u0027t make again :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took Bob, Bill and Jeb but I might as well have left Bill home since he didn\u0027t do anything during the entire mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch took a bit of babying because of collisions with the boosters during staging. I had to cut the engine, stage, wait a few seconds for the boosters to clear, then throttle up again. Took a few attempts to get it right. I didn\u0027t bother with asparagus staging (which would not be very realistic anyway, no pump can transfer that amount of fuel that quickly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, so I went to Eve, got into orbit, went through all biomes\u00A0in high space, low space and upper atmosphere (getting lucky on some of the rarer biomes like impact ejecta since I didn\u0027t have VOID yet), then went to Gilly, got science for all biomes high and low, landed in the four required locations for the contract, then landed in the remaining two biomes for some extra science. No need for a landing gear, I could just balance on the middle engine using the reaction wheels and smartASS\u00A0while Bob gathered the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen that was all done, I still had an enormous amount of delta-v left over thanks to the highly efficient nuclear engines, much more than I had initially expected. So I thought I might as well pop over to Jool and play some ping pong there until I ran low on fuel. I remembered getting 6000 science points there during an earlier\u00A0science game without even trying hard, and it sounded like fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get from Gilly to Jool, I left Gilly\u0027s sphere of influence, had MechJeb set up a transfer to Kerbin and tweaked that into a beautiful textbook gravity assist\u00A0(150 degrees or so course reversal), then manually set up another one at\u00A0Duna (after a few years of orbiting Kerbol), which got me to an orbit about the size of Duna\u0027s but intersecting it in two places. I got some more science while passing Duna, but I already had most of it from an earlier mission.\u00A0From there I just made a normal burn for Jool, losing much of what I gained from the gravity assists since I was burning less efficiently from Kerbol orbit, but on the whole I must have saved\u00A0somewhere between 500 and 1000 m/s compared to a straight Hohmann transfer from Eve orbit. And the Jool entry was easier with less speed to bleed off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pingponging around Jool went much better than I expected. Starting from the interplanetary halfway point, I used a total of only 18 m/s to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Get captured by Jool using a gravity assist from Laythe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Get all science from Jool, high, low and upper atmosphere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Get science from all non-polar biomes on the three inner moons, low and high. I didn\u0027t go for the Laythe atmosphere because that would have required entering orbit (passing through the atmosphere on an escape trajectory is considered in space low by the game) and I didn\u0027t feel like spending that much delta-v for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gravity assists during this part were quite a lot of fun, really. I used MechJeb\u0027s maneuver editor (not the planner) to set up the flybys as accurately as possible so the outbound trajectory was always in the orbital plane and I went low enough to get all the science, while keeping the resulting Jool orbit useful for further bouncing around. I let MechJeb execute the first part of most\u00A0maneuvers\u00A0but then did the last m/s or so by hand with just a tiny bit of engine power to kill the engine when the trajectory was exactly where I wanted it. This way, I could really execute them to 0.01 m/s precision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last pass over Tylo is when I installed VOID. Those craters were just taking forever to catch\u00A0and, even though I could do it by repeatedly quickloading and flying the same trajectory over and over again while incessantly clicking the gravity scan button and noting when the biome changed, I figured I had better things to do with my time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the mission I picked up a few extra contracts. Always fun to see a \u0022return science from Tylo\u0022 come up while you\u0027re in the neighbourhood anyway. Ka-ching!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so now all the low hanging fruit around Jool was picked, and I still had lots of delta-v left. So I went for Pol, which is a bit further out than Bop but closer to the orbital plane of the other moons. With the low speed so far away from Jool, I decided to enter a polar orbit to get all biomes high and low. Then I thought, well, with still so much delta-v left and plenty of power from the\u00A0four active nuclear engines, I might as well see if I can land there. It took a couple of attempts but actually wasn\u0027t that hard: as long as I touched down really, really gently and perfectly upright, the reaction wheels were strong enough to balance the rocket on its middle engine on a slope. If I touched down a little too hard or\u00A0got a couple of degrees off vertical, the rocket tipped over and I had to quickload to start over. Funny thing, at one point the rocket started sliding down a hill but somehow the SAS managed to keep it upright, so I could let Bob go down, get science from the surface, and chase the sliding rocket to get back in :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, a new contract just popped up for landing on Pol... Yep, can do, in fact I\u0027m already there!\u00A0:-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, when Pol was done (landed in\u00A0all biomes), I went for Bop. I didn\u0027t land there since it has more gravity and I had now staged the four outer nukes. I did get all the high and low biomes from a polar orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what\u0027s next? Still plenty of delta-v, those nukes are incredible! I could have gone back to Laythe to get its atmosphere, and\u00A0maybe the polar biomes that I skipped on Laythe and Vall, but then I had a look on Alex Moon\u0027s KSP Launch Window Planner website and saw to my surprise that Eelo was just about a thousand m/s away, with a transfer window coming up in a few years! That would be a much better use of my remaining fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I had MechJeb set up a transfer (which didn\u0027t really match the Launch Window Planner but was good enough, and I didn\u0027t feel like trying to find a better solution manually) and then tweaked it to arrive in a polar orbit. Got most of the biomes relatively quickly, then spent ages getting the craters. Just two little craters on the whole planet, seriously?! They\u0027re easy to get from an equatorial orbit but a lot harder\u00A0from a polar one... Fortunately at least they are clearly visible, so I finally managed to pass right over one of them twice, high and low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now what? By now I was frankly getting really bored of all the science hunting. I briefly considered a chain of slingshots all the way down to Moho, it looked like I might have enough delta-v left over if I played it right, but finally I decided I had had enough and just went home. I could always revisit the quicksave file later if I changed my mind.\u00A0Kerbin entry was uneventful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhew... glad to be home again,\u00A0that\u0027s not the\u00A0kind of mission\u00A0I\u0027m likely to ever do again. And I\u0027m not just saying that to keep others from breaking my record ;-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: the mission started during year 4 and ended in year\u00A057. Good thing Kerbals don\u0027t need much food. Real life time 20 days but not playing every day of course. No idea how many hours I spent on this.\u00A0I had about 800,000 funds left when I took off, and more than 5 million when I got back, even after I upgraded a bunch of buildings during the mission.\u00A0If you ever do a long mission like this, make sure to regularly pay a visit to the space center to see if any new contracts popped up that you can fulfill right away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229tVq8mh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9tVq8mh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lQ4bOOA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lQ4bOOA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T08:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by michelcolman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos, added mission time and some info about the extra contracts I picked up during the mission.
