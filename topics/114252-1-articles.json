Now I can not resume a saved game. When I click on it does nothing. I created a new career, went into the game fine. Came out and tried to back in and the same thing happened.

I activated the cheat Ignore Max Temperature to see the effect. As soon as I left the atmosphere the decouplers overheated and spread the heat acoss the whole ship, raising the temperature to the gazillion degrees, no joke. See the thread [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126471-Craft-exploding-(overheat)-1-0-4?p=2044267](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126471-Craft-exploding-%28overheat%29-1-0-4?p=2044267) . I reverted back to 1.03 for I had the game backed up. You only lose any ships created in 1.04. It will say that the career is not compatible, just reload a new 1.04 saved game and the career file will be brought up to date, if this is what you prefer to do. I found the 1.04 unplayable, for I also have tons of mods installed.\n\n[![To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg](http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u603/Bonemachine1/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg)](http://s1324.photobucket.com/user/Bonemachine1/media/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T15:38:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrasHReBooT**\n  \nTypo error"},{"CreatedByName":"msstdenis","CreatedById":147025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T12:27:19Z","Content":"I found the problem.
