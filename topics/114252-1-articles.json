I activated the cheat Ignore Max Temperature to see the effect. As soon as I left the atmosphere the decouplers overheated and spread the heat acoss the whole ship, raising the temperature to the gazillion degrees, no joke. See the thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126471-Craft-exploding-(overheat)-1-0-4?p=2044267\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126471-Craft-exploding-(overheat)-1-0-4?p=2044267\u003C/a\u003E . I reverted back to 1.03 for I had the game backed up. You only lose any ships created in 1.04. It will say that the career is not compatible, just reload a new 1.04 saved game and the career file will be brought up to date, if this is what you prefer to do. I found the 1.04 unplayable, for I also have tons of mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1324.photobucket.com/user/Bonemachine1/media/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1324.photobucket.com/albums/u603/Bonemachine1/To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022To%20hot_zpsmmk6zyjg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T15:38:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrasHReBooT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo error\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"msstdenis","CreatedById":147025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T12:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found the problem.
