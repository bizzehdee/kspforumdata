Whatever got derp-clicked seems to have committed dup/triplicate entries in these, and only these, nodes. Further tiers are unmolested.\n\nThis is persistent through a restart of the game which tells me I did something to the .persistant or the tree config with this.\n\nPerhaps I should have kept my fingers out, but you start somewhere, no?\n\nLooking through the rest of the functions leads me to think this can be used to add/remove items from nodes and add/remove nodes, but I would be stumbling in the dark trying to suss out what is/does what.\n\nJust having info on how to \u0027set\u0027 an editor as the .cfg editor to satisfy the \u0027No .cfg editor set\u0027 would be a start."},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:02:18Z","Content":"\u003E Just having info on how to \u0027set\u0027 an editor as the .cfg editor to satisfy the \u0027No .cfg editor set\u0027 would be a start.\n\nYou can set an editor by going to the settings tab in the RnD toolbar and put the complete path to your text editor in the first blank and hit save.
