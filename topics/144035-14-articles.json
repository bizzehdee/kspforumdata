This is a newspaper announcement in German, i read a publication is in preparation by the university of Zurich. Irreversibility is due to glacier dynamics, once the insulating reflecting snow cover is gone and replaced by darker dust and soot and\u00A0 surrounding areas are exposed and free of snow and ice, taking up heat of the sun instead of reflecting, then the melting accelerates in a positive feedback. It is thought that 90% of the Swizz glacier\u0027s ice mass - compared to the maximum in the early 19th century - will be gone until 2100; more than 50% is already lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember paraglading over the Aletsch and Oberaar in the early late 90s/2000s when one could see the change from year to year.

First you had the third exceptionally active July in the East Pacific in a row (five named storms and one depression), then the \u00A0Fujiwhara effect between Noru and Kulap, then FOUR tropical cyclones lasting over a week in the EPac, then Noru eating Kulap, then Noru\u0027s out-of-the-blue explosive intensification into a SUPER TYPHOON, and now the threat of Noru upon Japan has been joined by the high potential of two new tropical cyclones in the Atlantic.

Uh oh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin the meantime, Typhoon Noru appears to be preparing for a burst of intensification.
