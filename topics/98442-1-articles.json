I like the building rockets part but parts of this game are getting a bit time consuming for me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this doesn\u0027t sound like the OP is sick of spending time in the VAB, it sounds like he\u0027s spending too much time sending up redundant launches and waiting for rendezvous etc. Some of this will be solved by the warp-to feature, but the biggest thing, and I\u0027ve experienced this too early on, is sending up launch after launch trying to get that tight sense of efficiency and failing to reach orbit, wasting too much fuel, hitting hidden diminishing returns etc. For newbies the am-I-missing-something thing will help, but a huge help I think would be really simple, clear information on a rocket\u0027s TWR, Delta-V, drag, etc per stage so you could see what\u0027s going to work and not work in the VAB without sitting through a 10 minute launch that\u0027s doomed to failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
