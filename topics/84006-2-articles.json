The Tau version, while not a perpetual drive like the GN Drive, uses electricity to generate GN particles. So you could adapt that to larger ships or stations that have solar power or reactors. These could be larger drives since based on the lore, only 5 GN drives were originally made with another three being made after Celestial Being rediscovered how to make them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think, Capacitor should have some \u0022engine\u0022 ability or just a butteries will be fine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Railgunner2160","CreatedById":67181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T23:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo just got your rather AWESOME mod, and managed to build a NFT nuclear powered GN Tau asteroid explorer.

Since Taudrive only hold 50000 unit GN particle, it is only enough for 100t vessel cancel gravity (equals to 10m/s^2 acceleration)for 50s. So, if your vessel is very heavy, yes, it could happen.
