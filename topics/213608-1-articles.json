Putting the framework in to have at least 2-3 lets Devs or modders add more later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an outift gets features its bulk goes up. The amount of bulk affecting the Kerbal\u0027s ability movement rate and how stable they are. Perhaps coded as a weight mass separate from their own mass. Some of this might be done by letting them carry different jetpacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe minimum 3 would be\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClothes (casual looking, can choose one of several appearnces)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight suit (suitable for safer planets like Kerbin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace suit (with the jetpack etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe steps in clothing being:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cloth (meant for civilian, no air, no jet pack, can be a few styles like hawaiin to jogging to business to Trek-like)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Air flight suit (meant for air crew, no air supply, minor heat protection, has a parachute)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Crew suit (meant for people inside space stations or during launch, short air supply, minor jetpack fuel, has a parachute maybe)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Space Duty Suit (the normal space suit, heavy, has normal long air, normal jetpack etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Ground duty suit (regular protection but no jetpack thus lighter and easier to walk on planets with)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Racing Suit (a space suit variant with less other things to have more jet pack fuel)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Heavy duty suit (adds bulk for better resistance to hazards like heat)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
