Basically, with the new 1.0.3 fixes, is it possible to build an SSTLaythe Spaceplane that does what it needs to do without any staging or refueling? I\u0027ve gotten one Spaceplane up with what is probably more than 2 km/s Delta-v, but it won\u0027t be enough to do anything other than skim through the Jool System I suspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge accepted? Keep spaceplanes and similar creations specific to the task of reaching Laythe, since I dont want this to be a copy of the post your SSTOs here thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
