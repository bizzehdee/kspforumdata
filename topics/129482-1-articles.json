However, as a \u0022fuel\u0022 (energy provider) it can certainly exist. So I assume what you mean to ask is: how do MJ/KER account for the amount of electricity available to provide for propulsion? So if you only propellant for 5 minutes of burn time, but only electric charge for 2 minutes, the amount of DV available would be, say, 200 m/s and not 500 m/s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t write mods but I suspect inspecting the available charge in the batteries will go a long way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T14:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, MJ assumes\u00A0a infinite amounts and I am quite sure KER does the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
