It flies wonderfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the brakes and the 2 Elerons on my main wing will move to they\u0027re max deflection to create drag and slow the plane down. Perfect!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after I fly my plane on 2 or 3 missions, I will launch my plane \u0022lets say\u0022 for the 4th time / mission, and when I hit my brakes to slow the plane down on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elanding ((( Only 1 of my Elerons will deflect, causing the plane to make a turn )))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is 1 \u0022The left\u0022 Eleron not working as a spoiler anymore? It literally just stops working as a brake. It still works to turn the plane while flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it stops working as a brake... ?????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I go into the Plane editor and delete the Elerons and re-create them, it starts working again for 2-3 flights. Then stops again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Yes the Elerons are in the action group assigned to \u0022Brake\u0022 nothing changes there. But in flight the left one just does not work after a few flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHELP!!!!
