I\u0027m not really sure how I could send everything. Unlike Mun/Minmus trips, interplanetary voyages can only occur once in a period, and I\u0027d like to send everything up in one go instead of spending years sending one thing at a time.\n\nHowever, not only I\u0027m awful at rendezvousing(only recently I\u0027ve been getting better), but I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d haul the ending result. Especially since I\u0027m even worse at sending rovers. I\u0027d need a good manual of how such a vessel could look like - It includes just a base that can support 6-8 Kerbals and two rovers that can handle their own in Duna, so it probably wouldn\u0027t be too complicated.\n\nAnd then there is the landing site. As my rover exploration around the Mun has shown, rovers take far too long to get anywhere important. And I have ADHD, so I won\u0027t survive long trips to see worthwhile things. And then there is the risk of rovers breaking down on the way(which can be rendered moot with a good rover), which means the roving crew will be royally screwed. Due to this, I\u0027d like a landing site that is around 1.5km away from the polar ice caps, but isn\u0027t overly flat *and* that is possible to see Duna\u0027s sky with ease. But I might be asking for too much here, so the third requirement can be discarded.\n\nI hope I\u0027m not asking for too much. Despite being here since late 2013, I still don\u0027t have a solid grasp on things(I rarely send Kerbals outside the Kerbin system), especially involving orbital assembly. I\u0027ve heard a lot about this tactic, but never got to do it before, so I\u0027d like to try it out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T14:35:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T04:08:43Z","Content":"The Martian was such a great book! I too was inspired by that and began my Duna mission. (link in sig) What I am doing is getting all my modules in orbit with thier transfer stages attached, then transferring them all 1 day apart. this way I can aerobrake one after another, but not too close that I run the risk of things getting deleted and not too far that I miss transfer windows or something. My mission isn\u0027t so much a base as it is a landing and return, but it still applies here because there will be several ships moving together out of the kerbin system.

I dropped four or five in various craters and plains areas. Zooming out and panning around a probe can give you a reasonable idea of what the landscape is like around it.

If you havent seen it then [this](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) is the tool you need to plot these sub-optimal intercepts. Its also available ingame via a lightweight mod.

Using these tools you should realise you also become much more free in journey time as well as departure date.

You can aerobrake to scrub off the extra intercept dV created by a high-speed transfer and send ships there in very short order without overpaying to slow on arrival.\n\nYou can also as mentioned create congalines. Start ejecting ships a day before the \u0027optimal window as given by KAC or whatever\u0027 and keep going up to a day after. You can get a full flotilla even with some stuff making multiple periapsis burns due to low TWR. I often do this when working with RemoteTech so that only 1 craft needs a big dish to reach Kerbin, the flotilla then short-range to each other since they are all on the same trajectory and transfer as a pack.\n\nAs for Orbital Assembly, theres a thread right above/below this one about that very subject, some good hints in there.

Yes rovers suck, its sad, realistic and true. Unless you have months to make the drive like NASA its pretty much unviable since you cant usually reliably physics warp a moving rover. The only way to make this worth taking is to put down on the intersection of biomes, preferably 3 or more. You can either wiki the moons/planets and eyeball the biome maps against the game, or use something that pulls the biome data out for you while still in orbit. KER in surface mode, scansat...whatever. If you really dont want a mod i\u0027ve used grav scanners as bootleg biome detectors since the experiment considers biome relevant all the way to high space.
