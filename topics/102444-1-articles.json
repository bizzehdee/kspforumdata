I\u0027m not really sure how I could send everything. Unlike Mun/Minmus trips, interplanetary voyages can only occur once in a period, and I\u0027d like to send everything up in one go instead of spending years sending one thing at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, not only I\u0027m awful at rendezvousing(only recently I\u0027ve been getting better), but I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d haul the ending result. Especially since I\u0027m even worse at sending rovers. I\u0027d need a good manual of how such a vessel could look like - It includes just a base that can support 6-8 Kerbals and two rovers that can handle their own in Duna, so it probably wouldn\u0027t be too complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there is the landing site. As my rover exploration around the Mun has shown, rovers take far too long to get anywhere important. And I have ADHD, so I won\u0027t survive long trips to see worthwhile things. And then there is the risk of rovers breaking down on the way(which can be rendered moot with a good rover), which means the roving crew will be royally screwed. Due to this, I\u0027d like a landing site that is around 1.5km away from the polar ice caps, but isn\u0027t overly flat \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E that is possible to see Duna\u0027s sky with ease. But I might be asking for too much here, so the third requirement can be discarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I\u0027m not asking for too much. Despite being here since late 2013, I still don\u0027t have a solid grasp on things(I rarely send Kerbals outside the Kerbin system), especially involving orbital assembly. I\u0027ve heard a lot about this tactic, but never got to do it before, so I\u0027d like to try it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T14:35:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T04:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Martian was such a great book!
