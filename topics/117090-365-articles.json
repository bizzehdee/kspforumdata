(1.4, 1.5, 1.6)\n\nFurther back than that... I cannot say for certain, but it is likely that it will ***not*** work due to changes in the KSP code that SSTUs custom DLLs are compiled against (method signature changes at least; some changes to resource handling).\n\nFor example, the Stock-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E meter.  Required changes to the SSTU code to play nicely with it, as there were new resource-lists that needed to be manipulated when changing resources.  That stock code (the resource lists) *does not exist* in earlier KSP versions; so I guess the furthest back the current releases will be compatible with would be the first stock release that had the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E meter.\n\n^^^ So there is your answer.  No.  Current releases of the mod will only work on current versions of KSP.  Stock has changed their code, SSTU had to change to still be compatible, and those two changes entirely break any potential for backwards compatibility.\n\nTLDR:  If you want KSP 1.3, you need to use the mods intended for that version.

I don\u0027t think any of it has ever been shown before, and certainly nothing was ever published as far as usable parts go.

The mechanics of KSP mean that you either have parts that can move and possibly adjust height (and independently on each side to level), or you need something like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to have your astronauts assemble them. That, or you have something where they get constructed in-situ (you design them, then get to place them on the surface where you have a cargo pod that contains them, then you pop them down complete). Sorta like EPL.\n\nI tend to like the idea of structures buried in regolith from a realism standpoint (even if just roleplaying), but the nice thing about the models you show above is that a buried option seems totally possible as a right-click option (greenhouses need the sun, after all).\n\nThe usual KSP mechanic in other mods is wheels added. If you are not wanting to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, perhaps the parts could have a very limited self-locomotion, even without wheels? This would be an abstraction of them being constructed. Maybe it could require certain other parts (including kerbals) to be within some range. Imagine the base of one of those parts with a sort of pneumatic bellows that auto-levels the part (maxed out at some number of cm max extension). Would it also be possible to treat them like wheels, with some super slow max speed? Land dome pod. Deploy to dome, then it moves painfully slowly to contact with other parts nearby, and docks?\n\nAt higher tech node, I also like the idea of 3D printed habs (like the MASHA concept, among others). The nice thing here, is that you can have the parts be the printer (with different radii), and the printer can then build a hab wherever you place it. If they are small enough, level is not a huge problem (they could print as self-leveled), and connecting 2 spaces might be a flexible tube, so no concerns about perfect alignment. The printer can use \u0022rocket parts,\u0022 or it could use some other resource that makes use of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E (or ideally requires some of each).\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_KxqCL5L5Q?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceX","CreatedById":141070,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-16T20:46:24Z","Content":"I just wanted to take a moment to say THANK YOU for everything you do.
