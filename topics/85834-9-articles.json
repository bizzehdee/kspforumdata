With CBK I am able to increase the number of contacts able to be accepted even by the lvl 1 building. I have increased it to 6. When I use the shortcuts to accept or decline a contract the number displayed at the top of the list for max contract switches from 6 to stock 2. If I then exit and reenter MC the number is fixed and I can accept contracts again. I don\u0027t have this issue if I do not use the shortcut to accept or decline. I will say the mod by Dmagic Capcom that gives a \u0022MC\u0022 outside the space center doesn\u0027t have this issue resting max accepted contract so check that if needed. Hope that helps!
