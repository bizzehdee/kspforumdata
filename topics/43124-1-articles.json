Making multiple solar systems, an economy and an AI (for both neutral and enemies), and making the whole thing playable seems like quite a big task, and you might need a really powerful computer to run such thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut doesn\u0027t that sound like something that could be done after years of mods combined together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those that don\u0027t know X, it\u0027s a space game where you control a ship and explore the universe, with trading, fighting, setting stations or making fleets as part of the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry, doesn\u0027t have anything to do with adult rating)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrisM","CreatedById":78957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T17:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean \u00224X\u0022 game: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate? or if it\u0027s a single game, \u0022X\u0022 sounds like one of those games anyway. I think the biggest problem is the \u0022hard scifi\u0022 nature of KSP. Every 4X space game I\u0027ve played takes a space opera approach (doesn\u0027t mean one doesn\u0027t exist that is more in line with our current space tech and focuses primarily on the space aspect), with vast swaths of technology across the tech trees. KSP is just now talking about a tech tree coming, so I don\u0027t know how much work any mods could do to make it into such a game, if it\u0027s even possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**edit** hooray I can post w/ out mod approval on my 4th post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonie2k","CreatedById":75558,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T17:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think he means the X series of games (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X:_Beyond_the_Frontier\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EX: Beyond the Frontier\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X2:_The_Threat\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EX2: The Threat\u003C/a\u003E, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be pretty awesome although I expect you\u0027d need a small server room to run it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit: 4th post for me too!

That type of game flourishes on the fact that planets and stations are all completely immobile and the only things moving about the universe are the player and AI controlled ships...and they all move freely.

As many KSP mod users have noticed, realistic space combat is actually pretty dull.

Definitely futuretech ships, so orbital mechanics become kinda irrelevant since you have effectively infinite delta v. I *think* it\u0027s still going to be based on Newtonian mechanics though, so flight should be a wee bit more realistic than the X games.
