In fact they thought it was so good for them that they agreed to let us use the old Kerbin Airfield and repair it for free as long as we opened a museum about the Kerbal Aviation Klub and Enthusiasts (K.A.K.E). After a month of various repairs and fixes and hiring board members, they finally declared the Kerbal Aviation and Space Agency (KASA) officially open! Me, my old friend Bob and his twin sister Val, and my other friends Gene and Bill, all piled into a bus (Yes they even created a bus stop for us!) and drove down to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The KC had picked an interesting cast of characters,\u00A0 from Mortimer Kerman, world famous stock broker and accountant, to Walt Kerman, also world famous but for wearing a hazmat suit nonstop and leading the Society of Believers in Robot Spiders on Duna, to Wernher Von Kerman, world famous rocket scientist and the inventor of the Snack, to finally Gus Kerman, leader of operations at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the only non famous Kerbal in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher was stuck in the UKR\u0027s capital for now but sent his intern Linus Kerman to represent him. Once we had all gotten acquainted, the four department heads laid out some strategies they had come up with. The four of us (Me, Bob, Val, and Bill) decided to turn administrative duties over to Gene and let him pick. He looked them over and realized we couldn\u0027t fund any of the strategies right now and decided to wait a bit before picking one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ikpqtQN.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002254.64\u0022 height=\u0022655\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ikpqtQN.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe brainstormed what the immediate goals for KASA were and wrote them down on the whiteboard. After that was settled we moved on to filling the remaining roles at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I was picked to be head of the kerbonauts, meaning I could pick who to hire, and Val was put in charge of training. Bill took over the engineering department and Bob became head of the astronaut science team (Linus and Wernher ran the science department for KASA). Then Bob nominated Gene to be the director of KASA but Walt stopped us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid we already have a director\u0022, he said. I looked over at Gene, who was looking pretty disappointed, and asked Walt if it was robot spiders from Duna. Gene laughed\u00A0but Walt\u0027s eye started twitching and he looked like he might attack me. Mort hurriedly answered that the director was a kerbal who went by the name Kerminator1000. He was supposedly a very secretive Kerb who never showed his face and only communicated using memos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe all sat in silence for a bit until Val suggested that Gene become the mission controller, responsible for taking contracts and leading the missions.

On the way there we spotted a few solid rocket boosters lying on the side of the road and strapped them to the hood, despite Val complaining about them scratching the paint. When we got there we unloaded the five boosters and showed them to Wernher, who had finally showed up. He said that they looked amazing and that he was going to have to copy the design for future missions. He then said that they would be great for today because he had gotten a shipment of MK1 Command Pods from Kerlington and that now we would be able to actually launch a rocket today, rather than just train in the command pods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene, a big believer in safety, looked appalled at that suggestion, but me and Val managed to convince him otherwise. While Gus and his crew installed the command pods on the boosters, I asked Gene if I could have the first mission. Gene agreed and I ran off to go tell Val (who was so sure that she would be first, she had printed business cards). Soon after, as Gus was moving the rockets to the launchpad, Gene ran up to us. He said that several companies had sent us\u00A0contracts and were very interested in the future of the space program!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wRyx2gi.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.96\u0022 height=\u0022452\u0022 width=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wRyx2gi.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith lots of cash on the line I sprinted to the capsule and strapped myself in.

It was going to be 11\u00A0days of testing and building before I could make history!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EDay 15\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter 11 days of training, building, and static fires we finally finished the O1 - Orbital Rocket! Werher was also developing a two seater capsule, which Bob dubbed the Pea. As I climbed into the rocket, the launch clamps groaned ominously. Mostly because this rocket was the largest rocket we had ever launched, and also because our launch clamps sucked (we are expecting a new shipment in a few weeks).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Z6lvv6J.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Z6lvv6J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI strapped myself in and flicked on all the screens.

The few times we tested it the fins had failed and the rocket engine (a Reliant Rocket Motor) was to unresponsive so we switched to a Swivel Class instead. We had done some static tests and a test of a new command pod that could hold two kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter launching, the rocket tipped over in a new maneuver called a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 that our physicists had discovered.

I wasn\u0027t sure but it cleared up after a bit. The rocket suddenly jerked forward as the second stage kicked in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uDLRCWv.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.49\u0022 height=\u0022268\u0022 width=\u0022483\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uDLRCWv.png?1\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter losing the first stage, I decoupled the abort tower.

I looked around at Kerbin and the Mun, floating in the huge arm of the Green\u00A0Galaxy\u00A0and and wanted to go explore it all. I also was surprised by mysterious music that started playing through the speakers. The comms switched over to the Harvester Massif antenna and in the brief silence I heard something. It sounded ancient and angry. My best guess was that it was one of the\u00A0Krakens that Bill was always talking about but I couldn\u0027t tell.

I decided to help out with the building and got to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EDay 17\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bus met me early that morning to take me to Kerbal Academy. I felt like a Kerbette going to school again. I got off the bus at the Academy. It was huge! A large sign arced over the door and a Kerb was at the door waiting for me. She took me down to the simulator room where several people were waiting for me.

A few professors taught me about the theory of inclination changes and how to do them. The simulator felt very real and was the best part of the day. Lunch was also amazing. It was way better than the crap they serve at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I had a 3 hour and 30 minute capsule test. Despite the fact that it was a nonstop simulator in a cramped capsule, it was actually fun. I had learned a lot about how to do maneuvers and inclination burns and was now an experienced pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022meUEeBz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/meUEeBz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I was in the capsule Val launched with Tito Kerman, the millionaire inventor of KerbNet, who was paying for a trip into space.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rScBBEU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rScBBEU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can tell from the picture, Val hated Tito. She complained about him messing with the buttons and had to smack him away from her snacks drawer. She did manage to make the most accurate landing of the entire space program. About 7km away from the launchpad! Tito claimed he had a great time, but the nervous looks that he gave Val gave away what really happened. But Val refused to explain what really happened and me, Bill, and Bob think we will never know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223WqtadC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3WqtadC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTito\u0027s trip seems to have sparked a space fanaticism.
