But rather than just a boring, blank letter, I was thinking it\u0027d be cool if there was some sort of KSP - themed image or card template I could use to help make him more excited about the game. I was imagining, some letter-sized printable graphic or collage with rockets, explosions \u0026amp; the like with some room for text (download link / instructions would be a plus).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything similar around like that already?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drewscriver\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
