I defiantly found these craft to be EXTREMELY entertaining to fly around Duna (It really takes awhile to get used to landing) and I think that they might make a very interesting replacement for science gathering rovers when Duna finally gets multiple Biomes. So what do you think of this? Are you super excited to try to make a vertical takeoff Duna Ion SSTO? Do you think that the fact that this is possible is a testament to the overpowered nature of ion engines in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want something to play around with here is the latest version of one of the craft I have made, I have yet to fly it on Duna but it should still work (its only slightly different from one of my most successful versions).
