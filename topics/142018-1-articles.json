I last played it on version 1.0.5. I am wanting to update to the most recent version, whats the best way for me to do this, I have quite a few mods installed. Would it be as simple as running the patcher then copying and pasting the new version of the mods into the game data folder?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI ran the patcher and started KSP just fine without updating any of the mods, I didn\u0027t get any of the pop up messages telling the mods are out of date which I thought was strange. When I then updated the mods\u00A0by just copying and pasting the most recent versions it then asked me to update KSP to the most recent version on the pop up messages when the game starts. Any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-18T14:23:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2016 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mait3rz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
