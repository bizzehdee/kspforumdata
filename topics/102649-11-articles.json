The belt doesn\u0027t touch the plane and therefore can\u0027t exert any force on it.\n\nThe only thing the belt is touching is the plane\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Ewheels\u003C/u\u003E*.  And it can\u0027t actually exert a forward-or-backward force on the wheels, to any significant degree, because they *\u003Cu\u003Eroll\u003C/u\u003E*.\n\nWhat the belt *\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E* do is make the wheels *\u003Cu\u003Espin\u003C/u\u003E*.  But that has nothing at all to do with the motion of the plane.\n\nHere\u0027s how the physics work, here:\n\n- The conveyor belt can accelerate backward as hard as it likes, limited only by the power of its motor.  This does not affect the motion of the plane.\n- The airplane can accelerate forward as hard as it likes, limited only by the power of its engines.  This does not affect the motion of the conveyor belt.\n- Sandwiched in between these two things are the plane\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Ewheels\u003C/u\u003E*.  They move with the plane (since they\u0027re rigidly attached to it).  But they\u0027re free to spin.  The spin speed of the wheels is determined by the sum of, 1. how fast the conveyor belt is moving backwards, and 2. how fast the plane is moving forwards.\n\nThe spin speed of the wheels is the *\u003Cu\u003Eresult\u003C/u\u003E* of the plane\u0027s motion (and the conveyor belt\u0027s), not the *\u003Cu\u003Edeterminant\u003C/u\u003E* of it.

It depends on the relative motion of the plane and the belt. If the belt matches the speed of the plane, the plane can take off without the wheels spinning at all and the brakes fully applied.\n\nIf the belt is stationary, the wheels are turned by friction with the belt as the plane accelerates by the force of the engines.\n\nIf the belt goes backwards the wheels turn but the plane doesn\u0027t move. The wheel hubs are effectively frictionless and can\u0027t exert any force on the plane to accelerate it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-15T19:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2018 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic**"},{"CreatedByName":"VaPaL","CreatedById":150974,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-15T19:39:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 minutes ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But, the plane\u0027s wheels need to spin in order for the plane to move forward.\n\u003E \n\nIf you have no friction with the surface, the wheels wont spin, but the plane would still take off.\n\nEDIT: So if you have a treadmill without friction, it will be tha same as a ground without friction.
