And now that I think of this, I remember once having suggested an idea where once you have an at least two-star kerbal, you can spend time and money to have them instruct lower-level kerbals of the same class at the Astronaut Complex, leveling them up to a maximum of one level below the instructor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-19T20:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat idea!
