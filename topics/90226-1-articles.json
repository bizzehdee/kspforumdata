In testing for the \u0022mission-of-a-lifetime\u0022 , I launched a ship which was meant to hit Ap way out of the atmosphere. This would allow me to blow the little lander cans off of the depleted drive section individually (or all 3 at once which was my plan) and then individually establish a non-decaying orbit with each one using either \u0022]\u0022 if it was close enough or map view if not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to lose the ability to flip back to the two uncontrolled ships as soon as I blow them off. I know the atmosphere rule... but I\u0027m in space!!! (Left the KER stats in there to avoid that question.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets worse - I can control the ship that I wind up focused on, but all of the menu options stop working so I can\u0027t revert, can\u0027t exit to the Space Center, etc - but I can still fly the ship in the focus. Can\u0027t even click on the thing that shows me fuel, electricity, etc. Staging totally disappears, but the throttle controls still work and I can manually deploy the chute. I can go to map view and watch as the other two cans slowly plummet to Kerbin, but can\u0027t switch to them. (Not a huge sample size here, I\u0027ve tried it 3 times with wildly different Ap\u0027s... but every time same behaviour, every time happening WAY out of the atmosphere.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using .25 x64, with only the very latest KER installed. All I am hoping somebody can tell me, is - do I put this down as another glitch either caused by x64 or mods (in this case ONE mod, and a very widely used one at that), or is there something fundamental about controlling multiple manned crafts (OUT of the atmosphere!!) which I have never managed to see on the forums???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rvERzH0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rvERzH0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T00:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by James_Eh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T01:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose lander cans are \u0022crewed\u0022 vehicles so you will need to place a crew member in each one prior to launch in order to control it.

You\u0027ve touched on the heart of my question though, which is why I took great pains to mention that I was out of the atmosphere. Is it sub-orbital that causes things to evaporate outside of 2.5 km?

I sometimes get the odd bug here and there and find that this method fixes a few. Also, you should only loose the craft when they are out of physics range (2.2km from the craft you\u0027re controlling) AND, on kerbin, below 20k asl. so you should be okay even if they drift too far from you whether in or out of atmosphere.
