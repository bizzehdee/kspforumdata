I\u0027ll be roleplaying and building the Confederation of planets, complete with vying factions and mounting environmental pressures back on Kerbin. I\u0027m currently setting the stage for the beginnings of the, I guess after action report is the best word for it. Launching a global satellite network and building an ISS counterpart. I also need to set up the Kerbinbound buildings and set\u0027s for roleplay related stuff. I\u0027m basing the Confederation of combinations of my two favourite Peter F Hamilton sci-fi series\u0027, Nights Dawn and Greg Mandel, with the former being the main influence of the larger Confederation and the latter being the influence of the roleplaying related things on the smaller scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have any suggestions or tips for me while I\u0027m in the early stages? This is the first time I\u0027ve made and After Action Report for a game before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be keeping the roleplaying to a minimum, because for a reason which I cannot fathom it isn\u0027t allowed on the KSP forums. I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s referring to forum roleplays but I\u0027ll play it safe, for the record, if any mods are reading this, I\u0027m referring to in game roleplaying. I\u0027ll take this down till I have some actual gameplay to talk about if it\u0027s requested, if not, feel free to post suggestions in the comments, also, if you have a craft, base or other item that you think would fit with the Confederation, drop me a link and I\u0027ll try and include it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Error","CreatedById":58941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T12:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK you can post up \u0022roleplaying\u0022 here, as in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022\\\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Did the engineers install that untested afterburner?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022I\u0027m not answering that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022You just did.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut roleplays with other people are no-no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, tip: either have your \u0022battles\u0022 (or whatever) pre-scripted or determined entirely by the Random Number God, adds a hint of uncertainty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Space Ostrich","CreatedById":108829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T13:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh cool, that\u0027s fine then.
