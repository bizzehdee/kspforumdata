Since this contract, some new points have appeared on my orbital map view (M key).\n\nBut since, my vessel, its orbit/trajectory have disappeared from my orbital map view. Without my orbit and trajectory, it is almost impossible to play and pilot my vessel.\n\nI have restarted the game, and the situation is the same.\n\nI have tried to change the focus, reset the view. No effect.\n\nI have tried to cancel my contract. The ticks for temperature measurement are gone, but I still cannot see my orbit or trajectory.\n\nI have reinstalled the game. Situation is the same.\n\nHere is a screen capture : [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437975119](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437975119)\n\nAny advice or solution?\n\nSorry for my english.

This save is not usable anymore due to the evolution of the carreer system, but when I go the orbital map view, I see my orbit/trajectory again.\n\nThe problem seems to come from the save.\n\nIs my save broken?
