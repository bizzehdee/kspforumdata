I have an M700 Survey Scanner in a polar orbit. I activated it and it gave me a coloured rendering of the surface of the object it is orbiting, but I can only see that colouring when in map mode of that specific vessel. I then put a M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner into a polar orbit and activated it. I expected that it would steadily refine the accuracy of the initial scan, but all it seems to do is to tell me what is exactly underneath it at that instant, this information does not appear to be saved anywhere. Surely with the technology the Kerbals have a bit of RAM to save this information is not too much to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would expect anything discovered by the M700 to be visible in the map display of any vessel and I would expect that display to be refined by an orbiting M4435. Or am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the % resource on the GUI of the M4435 does not appear to be particularly useful. As far as I can see the % shown on the left click menu of the unit is more useful as it changes depending on what is below it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent hours on 0.9 with kethane so that might explain my thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T16:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THobson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat refines is the surface scanner, not the narrow band.
