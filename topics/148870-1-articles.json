Hypothetically, if you can deploy them but maintain or regain controlled flight afterwards, that\u0027s OK, so in-flight chutes that you cut away before landing, or early-deployed landing braking type chutes are OK, provided you work within the basic concept that we are dealing with flying things not falling things. \u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is not a requirement. \u00A0I have no problem with drop tanks, one-way probes, disposable stages etc. I also want to allow the idea of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane that gets a refuel in orbit to allow it to fly on to somewhere interesting. \u00A0The X15 space plane was dropped from a B52. \u00A0I\u0027m playing stock, so if I do something like that, the B52 analogue will be lost. \u00A0That\u0027s totally OK by my rules. \u00A0Equally, you may want a Mun lander or interplanetary ship that has no chance of coming home. \u00A0These are all entirely fine by me. \u00A0What I specifically want to exclude is cheating with a heat-sheild-and-parachute lander where the crew is rescued by a Kerbin atmospheric plane. \u00A0Also, the simple solution of one-way mission is not really in keeping with the idea, so the last rule:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) No Kerbal left behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made a start, under 1.2 pre-release, and I\u0027m having a blast. \u00A0I want the career play through to be fun, so I\u0027ve allowed myself two starter-flights\u00A0of Mk1 pod, Mk16 parachute and Flea booster to unlock enough science to get to the \u0022Aviation\u0022 tier that unlocks the basic \u0022toothpick\u0022 undercarriage and Juno engine. \u00A0I could have build some sort of rolling capsule based science-from-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E type craft to get there, but that\u0027s too much of a grind for me. \u00A0So far, I\u0027ve got some nice planes that can do low altitude observation missions, and built a \u0022SSTsubO\u0022 that gets me into space to achieve the \u0022leave the atmosphere\u0022 contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve hit a bit of a barrier, though. \u00A0I\u0027ve unlocked the Weasley engines and built an orbit capable craft. \u00A0It comprises 3x FL-T 200 fuel tanks, a LV-T45 Swivel first stage engine, a pair of Mk1 liquid fuel tanks radially each with a Weasley and basic circular intake, basic swept wing and a tail on the back, resting on toothpick tricycle undercarriage. \u00A0On the front is a TR-18A stack decoupler, LV-909 Terrier, FL-T200 fuel tank, 1.25 m storage bay with science and a Mk1 cockpit. \u00A0This will take off on the jets (needs extremely careful handling on the runway as the undercarriage is right at the limit), climb to about 8000 m under jets, light the rocket, the jets flame out at whatever altitude they get to, when the rocket burns out the capsule and terrier can get to orbit at 85 km with plenty of fuel to spare. \u00A0I\u0027m totally convinced this can form the basis of more substantial missions.\u00A0\u00A0The problem I\u0027m now having is how to get back within the rules. \u00A0I want my rules to allow for the game to still be fun to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tested this ship by adding\u00A0a pair of AV-T1 winglets as wings (placement vital to allow stable but controllable gliding) and a simple fin tail and\u00A0a couple of batteries in the service bay. \u00A0This allows the pod to re-enter from orbit, establish controlled gliding flight (using reaction wheels for control) and approach an arbitrary point on the surface nearby at a speed and descent rate that corresponds to a safe wheeled landing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway. \u00A0I see a couple of decisions I need to take now. \u00A0Is it feasible to bring a craft down from orbit with the basic toothpick undercarriage, or will the blow up all the time? \u00A0If they aren\u0027t viable, I\u0027ll work on the assumption that a safe ocean landing (i.e. one that doesn\u0027t involve destruction) in the water next to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is as good as a landing on the runway, on the basis that they have a seaplane dock? I\u0027m entirely convinced I could manage a safe splashdown on this craft. \u00A0Would it make the challenge better if I required returning craft to not just manage a controlled glide approach but also a powered flight approach? \u00A0I\u0027m pretty sure I have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E on this craft to do it, the question is will that requirement make for a better game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T20:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222778464\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148870\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475095103\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129752\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rcp27\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, rcp27 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve decided to have a go at a non-vertical-launch space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pity the fool \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T22:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like this is going to end up being a mission report, and so the thread has been moved to Mission Reports.

With just the Wheasly and 1.25 m parts, putting something together that can get to orbit at all has proven pretty tricky. \u00A0The only way to get a useful payload to orbit means using things like jet engines on decouplers as boosters to fly off the runway. \u00A0With a capsule at the top that has to be capable of stable controlled flight after re-entry, getting a launcher that can fly straight both with and without jet engine boosters is a real challenge. \u00A0I knew I needed to get a good chunk of science quickly, though. \u00A0A bit of farming of biomes gave me the first bit step forward: the clampotron Jr. \u00A0With this bad boy I can move on to building a craft capable of making \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and refuelling it with robot tankers. \u00A0A nice little craft with a Mk1 cockpit, a 2 man crew compartment (so that I can bring a scientist along to refresh the experiments), a Science Jr and a little cargo bay with batteries, thermometer, barometer and some goo is just the ticket. \u00A0Made \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with fumes in the tank, but help was at hand. \u00A0Only problem is, although I have the docking port, I have not yet unlocked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0With a bit of care I managed to mate the tanker, fill the tanks and had enough left in the refuelled to clear up the space junk by sending it to a fiery grave. \u00A0With the ship tanked up, and Jeb, Bill and Bob all on board, we made a nice transfer burn to Mun, with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E down around 35 km, and established a stable (but pretty highly elliptical) orbit. \u00A0That got me the orbit Mun achievement as well as plenty of science both high and low. \u00A0One of the problems with the 2-man crew pod, though, is it has no external door. \u00A0Every time Bob had to go reset the experiments, I had to get Jeb out, transfer Bob to the cockpit, get him out to do the science work, and them get them all back on board without Jeb drifting away too far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was where I met one the big challenges with this set of rules. \u00A0No heat shield means carefully nursing the ship through multiple aerobraking passes and hoping to goodness the ship holds together. \u00A0That Science Jr certainly has pretty poor thermal performance, and as we came down with flames everywhere and just about every component on the ship with angry red heat bars, I really didn\u0027t think I\u0027d make it. \u00A0Make it\u00A0I did, though, and all that science gave the most valuable reward: Supersonic Flight. \u00A0Now I have both the Panther engine and the first set of Mk2 components. \u00A0A bit of flight testing and I put together a basic but practical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that can get two crew up to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and land back on the runway all in one piece. \u00A0All those stranded Kerbals waiting for rescue can breath easy, help is now on the way!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve been surprised at how much easier it is than I thought to progress in career with these rules. \u00A0In the past I always regarded space planes as something you might consider later in the game, once you had at least the Whiplash engine unlocked. \u00A0I always avoided unlocking the aircraft related nodes in the tech tree in favour of getting things like 2.5 m rocket parts. While I have had to leave some nodes to be unlocked later than I would normally like, it\u0027s not been too much of a challenge so far, and the solutions to the challenge of getting places under these constraints has resulted in some very \u0022Kerbal\u0022 solutions. \u00A0The next milestone will be actually landing on Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T19:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo pics? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T21:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I was a bit busy not crashing.
