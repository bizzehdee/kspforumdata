We all know about Jebediah Kerman, his love of explosions, his always-happy attitude, but I have something I want to know, where is Jebediah Kerman in your savefile? Is he floating around in interplanetary space? is he crash-landed on Laythe? I want to know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Jebediah Kerman is currently floating around the Mun in an eccentric inclined orbit, yet to be rescued.
