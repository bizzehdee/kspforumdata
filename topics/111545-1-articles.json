Good job with this art, keep it coming.\n\n(Also, I noticed you changed your title from \u0022The Stupid one\u0022 to \u0022The Irish one\u0022. I\u0027m not trying to sound rude, but could you please change it back? I liked it the way it was before, and your location already says you are in (and presumably live in too) Ireland. Again, I\u0027m not trying to sound rude; I\u0027m just saying this as a suggestion. You are still awesome, as well as your vids!)"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T10:20:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Exactly what I was thinking.

I think if I change my location to something else, like \u0022Where do you think?\u0022 Considering it says \u0022The Irish One\u0022, that will make a bit more sense.
