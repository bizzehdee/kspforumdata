Well according to mechjeb the manuver needed more than 12k dV so i found the solution of using gravity assist from planets. It\u0027s complicated tho and changes from situation to situation so i would recommend checking out a guide if it seems hard to you.

This wasn\u0027t actually explicitly stated in the thread. If what you want is just, for example, to \u0022lower a periapsis so it\u0027s close to the sun, but high apoapsis is OK\u0022, the strategy would be different.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything that involves getting into a low orbit around the Sun is going to be just \u003Cem\u003Ebrutal\u003C/em\u003E in terms of dV. The lion\u0027s share of the work is going to be lowering your apoapsis once you\u0027re down close to the sun, and other than using a planetary gravity assist, there\u0027s not a lot that can help you with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you can at least try to minimize the amount of dV you use on your initial burn that drops your periapsis down to the sun (while apoapsis is still up around Kerbin): you want to make maximum use of the Oberth effect, which means you want to be in as low an orbit as possible around Kerbin, and then accelerate like blue blazes to do a single high-impulse burn at low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned that you\u0027re using nuke engines, which means you can\u0027t just go \u003Cem\u003EWHAM\u003C/em\u003E and do it in one go, but you can at least help yourself out by making a few passes. That is, start out in low circular Kerbin orbit. Figure out where you\u0027re going to make your eventual Kerbin-escape burn. Make a burn at that spot, without enough to actually escape-- all you\u0027ll do is burn for a minute or so right at that location, which will raise your apoapsis and put you in elliptical orbit around Kerbin with your periapsis still really low. Coast around your orbit, until you come to periapsis again, do another burn. Continue this as many times as necessary to get it so that you\u0027re in a highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin with apoapsis really high and periapsis really low. This will have you doing in the neighborhood of 3000 m/s at periapsis. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E when you do your big burn to escape Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for lowering your apoapsis when you\u0027re around the Sun: wait until you\u0027re at periapsis and do all your burn then, again to maximize Oberth effect. You do not want to do a bunch of little burns. Wait until you\u0027re lowest and fastest, and then one big huge brutal burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be possible to shave some dV with bielliptic transfers, as folks have suggested, but would need to know the exact orbital parameters to work out the numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
