The challenger had a TON of rudder authority. Not only does it have a large rudder, but it was a bit unstable on the yaw access. You could literally steer the aircraft by sticking your hands out the doors. The rudder authority on this aircraft made its crosswind handling capabilities amazing if you knew how to control it. My personal best is a 25 MPH crosswind.... not bad when you consider the touch down speed is only 45 mph. This thing slipped like mad! In a hard slip you had to look out the side window to fly. It made getting into tight fields a peace of cake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft also has removable doors (GREAT feature!). You took the doors off for summer flying and put them on for winter. The problem with this is the doors make the aircraft fly differently. Adding the doors made the already rudder sensitive plane even more sensitive. It also sort of added a dead-zone to the rudder. It made the airplane feel very slippery. Basically, what the vortex generators did was remove the dead-zone to the rudder. They were simply cut out of thin aluminum sheet metal, bent into shape by hand and applied to the plexiglass with double sided tape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really miss flying this plane. Buzzing wheat fields with the doors off and \u0027slipping it in\u0027 was sooo much fun. The airfield I flew out of was 6 miles south of a large Airforce Tanker base. I regularly flew above the altitude the KC-135s flew. It\\\u0027s quite surreal to stick your head out the window and watch that much metal zooming along below you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice video (not mine):\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyMSBnFWCGA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\\\u0027t get into all the RC and rocketry things I\\\u0027ve done, but I\\\u0027ve made some very odd things fly.
