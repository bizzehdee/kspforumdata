If someone warps ahead, they split off into their own subspace. You can choose to shift your time line forwards to sync with people who are further ahead in universe time than you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it\u0027s very difficult to have any multiplayer game without some kind of server, even if the server is built into the game rather than being a separate executable. One machine needs to either handle the calculations, or in DMP\u0027s case, act as a message relay and universe database. Except perhaps for some very simple or particular games, pretty much every multiplayer game runs on a server/client architecture of some sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for whether Squad will provide paid servers, I don\u0027t know.

The issue comes with separation. Developing multiplayer can be like a separate game, or you can make it so single player is multiplayer with no internet connection. Originally Minecraft was the former, two separate games, one for Multiplayer and one for Single Player. Later, after the great refactoring, single player games are just multiplayer games run on a local server without an outside connection, so the code is unified making it a lot easier. I fear Squad hasn\u0027t come to that point of realization yet like Mojang did.\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, games companies should be developing with multiplayer in mind from the start. Then they don\u0027t have to do this refactoring business which is long and complex.
