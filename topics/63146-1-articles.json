However, I have some ideas that I would like to propose to the developers to see if they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll consider them for the final game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve noticed in campaign mode is that it still feels a bit sandboxy. Even though there is science, the game feels a bit open (which is great for sandbox mode but not for campaign). Furthermore, once you obtain enough science the game is basically over in campaign mode, and you are essentially in sandbox mode once again. In update 0.22, people such as Scott Manly could unlock the tech tree in a few missions; even though in 0.23, this issue was mostly fixed (it takes longer to unlock everything), the fact remains that once you complete the tech tree, the game is essentially in sandbox mode again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to propose is adopting (either in addition to or in place of) an achievement-based system, which can be linked to certain part unlocks. The main advantage of this system is that it gives linearity to the gameplay and direction to new players by forcing them to perform certain maneuvers/missions in order (some players might dislike this, since KSP has kinda always been very open; however, my argument is that the sandbox mode should be completely open and campaign mode should feel more like a campaign and be somewhat linear). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, with the research and tech-based unlocking model, players can finish the game without ever having to perform some of the maneuvers that make the game fun, like orbital docking, aerobreaking into orbit, or creating a Mun or planet base. These items could all be achievements of their own and would unlock certain addition parts which would form players to learn and perform these actions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me now give a brief narrative of how said game would begin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, rather than starting the game with manned capsules and having to unlock satellites, wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t it make more sense if it were the other way around (like what happened in the real world)? I.e. you start only with satellites, and once you get into space, you unlock decouplers. Once you get into a stable orbit, you unlock manned capsules. There could be other achievements like obtaining a circular orbit (to a certain tolerance of course), getting into a polar orbit, landing etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which would all unlock parts or give you money to spend in career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere obviously could be loads more achievements which would unlock further parts or give you money to spend in career mode. This achievement based unlocking model I think would give the game a bit more direction, and help new players generate ideas for missions, since they want to unlock a certain part and have to earn it by performing a certain mission. For instance, the radial mounted parachutes could only be unlocked upon performing an aero breaking into orbit maneuver (the other parachutes, would obviously, need to be unlocked with new parts, since returning to Kerbin would not be possible without them; the radial mounted ones are more of a frill that should be earned). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis model would also harmonize the debate regarding whether or not mods performing similar functions to the popular mod \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMechJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 should be included in the final game. In my opinion, once you learn how to land, after some practice it becomes less fun and more tedious. Thus, once you demonstrate that you CAN land on an atmosphere-less planet or moon on your own, you get the achievement for landing and unlock the landing function of MechJeb, which can auto land for you (to further this idea, maybe you wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even start with landing struts, but instead, would have to land on the rocket nozzle itself. Once you do that successfully, you unlock landing struts). Performing a suicide burn landing by yourself would be a separate achievement that would unlock this function in MechJeb. Similarly, performing a targeted landing manually would unlock this function of MechJeb etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 There are obviously numerous other ideas for achievements that I can leave up to the developers to decide and surprise me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince achievements would be used for unlocking parts, the scientific parts (like temperature sensor, barometer etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6) could be used to actually collect real data rather than abstract \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscience\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 points which can be spent. Currently, players can look up information about the planets and moons in the mission control window in the game. However, I think it would be better if players had to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cdiscover\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 it themselves i.e. crash a satellite with a barometer into a planet to determine how the atmosphere varies with altitude and orbit a planet with a gravity meter to determine the acceleration of gravity on the surface. I know that if this information isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t displayed in the game, then players could just look it up online, which would defeat the purpose of players having to perform these actions themselves. My response to this is that players can always \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccheat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in this way. Alternatively, every time a campaign is started, the planets would all be randomized in terms of location, density, appearance etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 such that players could not cheat since their solar system is unique and different from the solar systems of others online. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are all the ideas I have for now\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion? Comments? Ideas for improvements?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T06:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if the mass majority will side with your suggestion. I\u0027m not sure if I even do lol. But I do agree the Career mode should be somewhat more targeted and linear. Even if it keeps the task of what and when and how you do it fairly open, there should be a further clear set of goals beyond \u0022research all the tech.\u0022 I like the idea of achievements in the sense that you should be rewarded for doing feats. When I recently discovered how to dock I felt like I was on cloud nine for 2 days. But did the game care? Nope. In fact, half the reason I have mission ribbons in my signature is just to show off what I\u0027ve done. But- that\u0027s not this forums point. That\u0027s the point of the game and I feel that\u0027s something that should be expressed in a further update. Even if it was as simple as mission badges or minor tech upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for science research I agree 100%. Doing experiments should unlock real information. You shouldn\u0027t be able to see all the information about planets from the get-go. I hope, and I\u0027d assume, that this will eventually come into effect around the time telescopes come into effect. Seems to me somewhere in the DevNotes I remember someone saying you\u0027d have to search the skies for new planets. Applying the same idea of research = knowledge to doing experiments just seems like a no brainer. Though to get slightly off topic and add my own 2 cents... please, please, make planet mapping a thing. Because currently having to land at new spots on the Mun looking for new biomes is kind of like spinning and globe and stopping it with your finger. It\u0027s all really hunches unless I cheat and look online for a map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess in conclusion, what KSP lacks is \u0022In-Game Rewards\u0022 imo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And yes, I realize there\u0027s a mod for planet mapping. But that isn\u0027t my point, the vanilla version of the game should support it. Mods aren\u0027t always the answer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T18:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Espinomonkey: so if you agree that career mode should be more targeted and linear and science should unlock information rather than just science \u0022currency\u0022 with which to purchase unlocks, then what better way to achieve both of these than by switching to the achievements model for unlocks? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose if it was just achievement based, once you\u0027ve learned to perform all the maneuvers etc... the game might get boring i.e. it would lose its replay value (however, this would also be the case if the point of the game was to unlock techs). I suppose there could be difficulty settings (that you would select upon starting a new campaign) which would add in more difficult mods or effects, such as more realistic aerodynamics and/or deadly re-entry etc or constrain your budget even more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of biomes, i think it would great to force players to get a telescope into a polar orbit of a planet in order to obtain the planet biomes (it would give purpose and direction toward the game). To further this idea, there could be randomly-placed artifacts or discoverer-ables that you need to first locate with telescopes (the game would find them, not you manually looking through telescopes for hours), then land near to recover in an EVA (giving a reason for players to learn how to perform a targeted landing). Once you discover, recover, and bring these artifacts back to Kerbin, you win. Perhaps some artifacts require a base to process before they can be recovered (giving reason to have bases on other planets/moons). (In harder difficulties, some artifacts might be placed on Eve, forcing players to make a spaceship that can get there, land, and return!). Randomly placing artifacts around the solar system removes the need to randomly generate solar systems for each new campaign since although players could find the information for the location, period, gravity etc.. of other planets online, the locations for the artifacts which they need to find to win are always random (Except maybe on the easiest difficulty setting) so that they cannot cheat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs usual, thoughts? Constructive comments?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, i think there should be a display/indicator in the corner of the screen that tells you which biome you are in currently, so you know when to do new science (assuming the science model continues to be the dominant unlocking mechanism).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T02:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you\u0027re model wouldn\u0027t work, I\u0027m just think the devs are past the point of changing the current model in any dramatic way. Ultimately, we\u0027re still only on the verge of .24 and the game has numerous and more dramatic updates to make. But somehow I don\u0027t see them rebuilding a core element like research all over again. Which from a coding perspective you kind of would have too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of achievements, I just think that should be added because it makes too much sense and I assume eventually it will. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for biomes, the devs have stated they aren\u0027t big into random events as it takes away from the ability to share the same experience with other players. Though on the topic of telescopes, I\u0027d hope they\u0027d make the land based telescopes weaker then the space ones. But that really just gets into the whole argument that there needs to be a better use for unmanned craft, which currently there\u0027s not much of, that includes rovers too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I agree 100% about a display indicator about Which biome you\u0027re in. Once you do research it tells you in the pop up science menu which biome you\u0027re doing research in, but it sure would be nice to just be able to glance and know after you\u0027ve done you\u0027re first research in a said location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
