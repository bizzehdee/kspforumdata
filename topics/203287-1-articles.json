Basically what happens is whenever I place a crew module down, it only turns into one seat and that seat is occupied by Jeb (usually). Whenever I try to remove him, he duplicates, the duplicate going into my \u0022Available Crew\u0022 tab and the original one staying in the seat. I know this is a ModuleManager problem.

You may want to uninstall Module Manager and try to duplicate the problem. If it happens, then you may need to remove all patches and add them back in one at a time to see which one is causing the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
