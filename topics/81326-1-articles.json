If you\u0027re looking for a non-mod solution...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I use biome maps (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuch as this\u003C/a\u003E) to see where I want to aim to do my science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Then I will look at Kerbin in \u0022focus\u0022 in the map and find that location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Orient the camera so that the orbit line is in the foreground and you\u0027re looking straight down onto the target biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Place a maneuver node on the orbit line directly above the biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I will also orient my spacecraft so that it points down toward the planet as I\u0027m passing overhead. Then you can use it to sort of \u0022aim\u0022 at the target biome to help fine tune it even more during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives you a count down and some sort of idea when you\u0027ll be right over the top of it, so you can start clicking for science.
