You present them with two options: MechJeb with full functionality of all modules or Mechjeb with limited modules at first, with new modules delivered as you progress through the Tech tree. Should be simple enough to word so that almost everyone who is at least aware that career mode has a tech tree can understand it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is different from other mods in that there are no parts to unlock. I like what you did to incorporate it into the tech tree though. That said, many people might prefer to just take Mechjeb as a full plugin at the start of career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider... when someone unlocks a new module from the Tech tree, they aren\u0027t given any information to indicate that. For someone who has never used Mechjeb before, they actually might be confused. They either won\u0027t know where the new \u0027stuff\u0027 came from, or they won\u0027t notice it at all. It might be nice if you could make it so that when a new module is unlocked (by researching an appropriate node in the tree), a popup comes up celebrating the new modules you just unlocked (I really don\u0027t know if this is possible to code a plugin to do). That would be a big help to players who have never used Mechjeb before and aren\u0027t familiar with all its features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T06:42:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by simmy2109\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tour1988","CreatedById":97542,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T06:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tour1988\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tour1988\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can\u0027t get the \u0022new\u0022 MechJeb to work.. i deinstalled the complete game then redownloaded it.

Autopilot enabled MJ lined up the axis fine but then sat there saying it was approaching at 0.0mps. At one point it said it was backing away at 0.0mps. It had not move as far as I could tell. I took manuall control and moved to within 10m and aligned properly. MJ docked fine at that point. I then undocked and put the ship into various locations to test the docking ap.

It would also dock without aligning first and would dock coming in at an angle. It\u0027s hard to describe. The axis were aligned so it was more sliding sideways into the dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope some of that helps.
