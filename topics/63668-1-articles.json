In fact its the only game i play nowadays. i dunno, but watching my rocket fly is kinda relaxing to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i 1st got this game which dont have career mode, it kinda disorient me with all the available parts and i lack the imagination for sandbox games due to lack of knowledge in the space program. I play sandbox just for trying the tutorial i see on youtube and etc. Apart from that i dont really do much because seeing all those parts kinda overwhelmed me i guess. Maybe i\u0027m just not a sandbox guy because i have no idea what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen career mode came out, this really made a big difference. I have an objective to unlock the tree and start getting to know the lower level tier 1 by one. I start to spend my time almost daily with this game because the parts are introduced bit by bit by unlocking the tree. Then i realized the potential this game actually have and comparing how much i paid and the time i spent on this game. I felt that i should buy 2 more copies just to support the dev for making a game this fun with so much to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my rambling, below is just a few ideas that would be useful in the future career mode. Might not apply to everyone but i wouldn\u0027t know unless i post it i guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECareer Mode\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIncome\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Monthly budget funding with missions to accomplish and rewarded with bigger funding \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For example at starters, achieve certain height for bigger monthly budget allocation. Next maybe achieved stable orbit and etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For those that failed and depleted their fund can just time warp to next month so it wont depress new players since the only penalty is time. (Kinda like simcity but with rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Side mission or quest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pop up appears in VAB for a special request from certain client or VIP and etc from time to time. Deliver a rover to the CEO house or a small fuel tank. Anything suited for an imaginary planet with green men. This will let players explore the planets because now you get rewarded for doing so while doing missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Satellites\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend getting money for putting the satellite into orbit only, then the controls are handover to the client. Once in a while there will be a request to refuel it or maintaining it which is accomplished by docking with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Emergency crisis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA competitor rocket losing orbital velocity and request you to help it or change a falling debris trajectory and etc. Do it the movie Armageddon style, i dont care as long you get the rush of doing something at a limited time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERewarded with science points/money or special rare parts that cant be researched normally \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGame Difficulty\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Harder difficulty gets less money and no revert \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E or a limited time frame to accomplish mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour kerbal will die and you get a small structure (i cant remember the word for it, sorry) near the building for your fallen brave astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven possible for game ending scenario. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Planning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible or not but it would be good if we can do our planning on something like the space center before launch. Adding the maneuver point there and just follow it one by one at the real launch. It\u0027s not the planner fault if the pilot/rocket fail to follow it. It\u0027s good for newbies to plan on the ground instead of doing it while flying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanning maneuver 1 by one in a sequence and then following it at launch. Adjustment can be done as we do it now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add more later when i can think of some more\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T18:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMissions and the economy are planned for career mode.
