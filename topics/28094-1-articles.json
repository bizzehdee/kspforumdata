I\u0027m a Turkish spacefan who has just joined the forum-I guess I\u0027m the first Turkish kerman here?-. I\u0027ve been making flights for two weeks on KSP and I fell in love with it! I\u0027m glad I am going to experience the whole development of this excellent simulator (I just can\u0027t say game, games are not as complicated and high quality as KSP) and I want to thank all of the SQUAD members for creating this awesome universe.
