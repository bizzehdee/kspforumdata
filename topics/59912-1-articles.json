It\u0027s a reboot of a series of games from 1994, the original being called \u003Cem\u003EX-COM: UFO Defense\u003C/em\u003E (\u003Cem\u003EUFO: Enemy Unknown\u003C/em\u003E in the UK). The original is widely regarded as the greatest strategy game of all time. Even without having played the original, I can tell that the this game lives up to that legacy. I think even Danny made a video for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who haven\u0027t played, it works like this: Aliens have invaded the planet Earth (maybe those Kerbals got a little militant), and your job is to command the XCOM Project, the first and last line of defense against the aliens. The game is split into two modes: the strategic base management mode, where you build your base, manage funds and research, buy weaponry for your troops, etc., and the tactical mode, where you command a 4-6 man squad in turn-based combat against the aliens. It is much, much harder than most games you\u0027re probably used to even on the easiest difficulty, but that\u0027s part of the charm (much like KSP, really).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, has anyone else played this game, and has anyone got any good stories of battle with the extraterrestrial threat? I got a few tales of my own, which I\u0027ll post tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Manifest","CreatedById":53633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T06:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEhhh, I bought it when it came out, I loved and still love the concept, I even bought the expansion even though I was disappointed by how it turned out on initial launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I loath how the AI is handled, and how increasing difficulty is administered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, in combat, there are scripts that are implemented if you do too good, for example if you\u0027ve just hit your last three shots, all of a sudden their chances of hitting will be doubled many times over, and yours decreased many times, until you\u0027ve taken fire in some form of damage, be that a cross map shot from a plasma pistol, or a hit when in full cover 15 tiles away from the enemy hitting you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA case in point is an old story where I was engaging one last alien, having just killed three to four of it\u0027s friends and taken no damage the script kicked in, I knew this and had prepared my assault soldier to run up into it\u0027s face and in that way override the script with a 100% chance to hit, so I ordered him up on his sides, one tile away from him, and to my horror I see the script is still active, by decreasing my chance from 100% to 99% chance to hit, so now I see an opportunity to experiment, so I save the game(*), and sure enough, with 99% chance to hit, he misses his shot, so now I load the save to see if it truly is the game engine or a script, and freaking a\u0027, as soon as it was loaded I had a 100% chance to hit because the script wasn\u0027t reactivated in the loading process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is way I have problems with the game, I freaking love the concept, the air battles being a little thin on content, but overall being awesome, if it wasn\u0027t for the damned scripts that replace AI with game altering features, i would love the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have also been some major reports of the AI clipping through walls when you can\u0027t see them, getting up on roofs and through walls, that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t hate the game, I love it, but it gets destroyed for me by the lazy ai design hidden behind scripts, and clipping bugs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*)This may be referred to as \u0022save-whoring\u0022, but when the game has scripts like that to increase the difficulty trough laziness, instead of actually increasing the difficulty, by giving the AI new paths and new processes to run before choosing an action; then I don\u0027t give a damn, it is a sign of lazy AI programming to me and I\u0027ll be damned before I let it stand and just \u0022deal with it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T06:28:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Manifest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshington","CreatedById":73509,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T07:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love it to death, but my first play through was probably the worst thing I\u0027ve ever done.
