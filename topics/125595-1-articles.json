I\u0026#39;m trying to add custom sound to an engine. I got the \u0022engage\u0022 \u0022disengage\u0022 and \u0022flameout\u0022 sounds working just fine, but the \u0022running\u0022 is giving me trouble. Basically, the sound wont stop playing. As soon as I go into the flight scene with that engine loaded, the sound plays. I haven\u0026#39;t even started the engine! The engine is completely off, and the \u0022running\u0022 sound is playing! Any help at all would be appreciated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T02:26:17Z","Content":"\nwhat your cfg look like ?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT- And have you seen this plugin DynamicSFX Dynamic Sound Effects [url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138647-DynamicSFX-Dynamic-Sound-Effects-PartModules-%28Development%29[/url]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T02:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T02:34:37Z","Content":"\nI actually found the problem.
