I do not experience anything like that at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 1.0.5, I was watching a video today on YouTube and noticed the KF app-launcher icon is duplicating itself a ton again.

Why must Squad screw everything up again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisabling DustFX for the \u0022folder\u0022 isn\u0027t something you do here. In KSP, there are no \u0022folders\u0022 since everything is loaded into memory under a database of some sort. Now, if you mean to disable it for the parts, yes... you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E remove the module from the parts. However, the code is set up to re-add that module if it doesn\u0027t already exist. When I get around to updating this mod properly, that will change to a certain degree. Right now, the in-game toggle only toggles the spawning of the individual effects for the dust. I\u0027m working on a way to disable the module completely on all parts in the game when that toggle is in the off position so it stops even checking for the \u0022enabled\u0022 variable. It\u0027s all a work in progress though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid it\u0027s going to take a bit more time before I can get an updated github repository up and release an update.

Thus... lack of activity does not mean lack of attention. It simply means I\u0026#39;m super busy learning how to make delegates and derivative classes and interfaces (not to be confused with user interfaces, which would be easy in comparison) and developing API and/or console-level pseudo physics engines for simple arcade game interaction without helper assemblies to invent the wheel for me, metaphorically speaking that is. It\u0026#39;s brain-twisting and not very conductive to that sense of \u0022I wanna go home and mod KSP now!\u0022 So, I\u0026#39;m afraid all I can do is come in here and provide a status update from time to time. I will gladly look into anything constructive that is provided here, however. No promises that it will pan out, or end in a new release of any sort, but it\u0026#39;s a step in the right direction. Ultimately, I\u0026#39;ll have something updated before the new year (and I don\u0026#39;t mean 5 minutes before... more like weeks.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo... hang in there, and pray (if you do that) that 1.1 doesn\u0026#39;t screw it all up.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T23:17:43Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Gaalidas\u0027]Alright guys, I\u0026#39;ll continue to poke around with this.

compensate for the slowed movement of such craft by adjusting the angle of thrust when movement was detected along the relative-horizontal axis.\u00A0 There is some KF code already owing its existence to that mod, and I\u0027ve been experimenting with the sticky-feet feature to make something I\u0027ve talked about on and off in the old thread a lot: Anti-repulsion.\u00A0 Designed to work in conjunction with repulsors, this would allow the craft to regain a percentage of the lost friction with the ground due to being repulsed from the surface.\u00A0 When used with wheels, this would allow the craft to be \u0022glued\u0022 to the surface in varying degrees to allow for better performance in low gravity environments, and allow for steeper climbing on normal and/or high gravity worlds.\u00A0 I developed it with the plan of allowing it to be an extended feature for the standard repulsor parts, as well as a separate part with only this feature for use on craft with no other repulsion technology present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to conclude this wall of text here and end with this: Work continues, slowly.\u00A0 For those of you who have contributed

break it apart and make if more of a framework for other mods to hook into so that new content could be developed, and new features could be coded without having to modify the base mod\u0027s code, so that it could continue to live on past my interest in the game itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now I need to go.\u00A0 Still have finals to prepare for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote

compensate for the slowed movement of such craft by adjusting the angle of thrust when movement was detected along the relative-horizontal axis.\u00A0 There is some KF code already owing its existence to that mod, and I\u0027ve been experimenting with the sticky-feet feature to make something I\u0027ve talked about on and off in the old thread a lot: Anti-repulsion.\u00A0 Designed to work in conjunction with repulsors, this would allow the craft to regain a percentage of the lost friction with the ground due to being repulsed from the surface.\u00A0 When used with wheels, this would allow the craft to be \u0022glued\u0022 to the surface in varying degrees to allow for better performance in low gravity environments, and allow for steeper climbing on normal and/or high gravity worlds.\u00A0 I developed it with the plan of allowing it to be an extended feature for the standard repulsor parts, as well as a separate part with only this feature for use on craft with no other repulsion technology present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to conclude this wall of text here and end with this: Work continues, slowly.\u00A0 For those of you who have contributed in the past and feel you have something worth sharing, feel free to do so.\u00A0 I don\u0027t want this mod to simply be another solo-administrated mod in the future.\u00A0 I\u0027d like it if I could break it apart and make if more of a framework for other mods to hook into so that new content could be developed, and new features could be coded without having to modify the base mod\u0027s code, so that it could continue to live on past my interest in the game itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now I need to go.\u00A0 Still have finals to prepare for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is correct.\u00A0 I\u0027m slightly autistic, so school was a real pain in the nethers for me in the past.\u00A0 In my late 20s/early 30s I\u0027ve finally gone back to college to try and get an education.\u00A0 I\u0027m well on my way to doing so, but my older age is making it a bit of a slow process.\u00A0 I rarely give up completely on anything, however, so KF ain\u0027t going to die any time soon.\u00A0 It\u0027s just in a state of... suspension.\u00A0 Alive, but not really living.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncan one just completely delete the collisonfx plugin, if there is one, or just disable collision FX in the menu as a
