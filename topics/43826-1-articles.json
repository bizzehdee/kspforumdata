This is a game I loved for ages but never finished. I dont know why it was so good but I have never played a game as good as this since. And the strange thing is I prefer simulations more, after TLoM all my other favourite games are sims and stragey games - this is the only adventure game I have ever really liked. Weird!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway check it out if you remember it. And if you dont remember it and have a phone or tablet (or PC/Mac) check this out definitely because its made for portable devices (although its still great on a large screen):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thelordsofmidnight.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.thelordsofmidnight.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T00:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember that game, was up there with Elite in terms of cramming a huge map into a tiny amount of memory.
