I seem to never get very far when I start career modes, almost never getting past missions to the Mun and Minmus. Hell, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve landed on anything outside the Kerbin system in any career mode game and I\u0027ve been playing for 2\u002B years. Oh well. At least the latest version seems stable so I won\u0027t have to upgrade quite immediately and hit \u0027reset\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was using the new Real Fuels alongside 64k to see how it was. They added engine ignitions to Real Fuels, though, so this makes an extra challenge. This \u002B Remote Tech are ruining so many missions for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m right at a danger point. I took the RT mission to set up 4 comm-sats and the Munar flyby mission. However, I lost 2 satellites in the process which tosses about 50k funds. The first was lost to leaving it in the wrong orientation and it lost power. This is the one that I failed to program orientation changes to stabilize the fuel (aero\u002Bnto) and the engine failed to ignite. It\u0027s slowly decaying in orbit as the periapsis is less than 91km up. It\u0027s been up there about 30days and still hasn\u0027t lucked into a better orientation to recover power. The second I lost to a burn calculation error. I was trying to circularize for the RT mission (e\u0026lt;0.004) and mis-calculated my burn and wound up raising my ap WAY over my burn location. All the fuel was gone then, so it\u0027s a dud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have insufficient money to build the last two comm-sats. The next thing in my build queue is the second commsat (if it succeeds). I modified the satellite for the Munar flyby, though which has a decent payout and all you have to do is get in the SOI. I did a simulated mission to check my calculations and I think I\u0027ve got it set now, but if I miss I think my career game will be over (or I\u0027ll have to cheat my funds back in). Did I mention that without the full tracking station, I have to calculate my burns by hand? Yeah... career in RT\u002B64k\u002BRealFuels is hard. At least it\u0027s got me playing again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T15:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice report.

If you\u0027ve gotten far enough, Kerballed craft can be a real life-saver before your RT network is fleshed out. Your stuck satellite is still salvageable, the orbit won\u0027t actually decay if you\u0027re focused elsewhere. You could try rendezvousing with it with your munar probe before TMI and giving it a little bump to get power back, but yes that is risky. Adding more ground stations to the RT CFG is fairly easy too, one is hard early on and a bit unrealistic IMHO. If you want a less \u0022cheaty\u0022 way of generating emergency funds, there are mods out there that let you trade funds for science/rep, or even give you an outright loan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back to the learning curve \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I wish you luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
