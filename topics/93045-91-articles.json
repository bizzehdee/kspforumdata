based on the small separation motor but with 1/10th the thrust and fuel.\u00A0 I usually mount at least two at a 45 degree angle, then cut the thrust and fuel down further.\u00A0 Gives a modest spin,

bit expensive (1800) but I added a recovery shoot to the first stage which effectively cuts the cost in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trouble I\u0027m facing now is that all I\u0027m doing is Medium and High sounding rocket contracts.\u00A0 I\u0027ve done at least 15 so far and estimate I\u0027ll be doing at least another 5 if I don\u0027t want to just skip time.\u00A0 There just aren\u0027t any other doable contracts at this early stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did manage to completely the \u0022atmospheric analysis\u0022 contract but I think it\u0027s requirements are set just slightly too high for Vanguard/Juno era rockets.\u00A0 Trying to get 560km\u00A0x 3200km when you only have about 10km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E available is really not viable.\u00A0 It\u0027s the 560km periapsis that\u0027s a bit much.\u00A0 I could reach that altitude, but rarely had enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left to complete orbit let alone push apoapsis to 3200km.\u00A0 The difficulty is you pretty much have to do everything with a single burn and have limited control by the time you get to you last stage.\u00A0 I only managed to do it by taking my Vanguard rocket and attaching eight Aerobee 170 SRBs to it, then firing those in succession.\u00A0 It was completely unstable and took me several tries to complete.\u00A0 Any mistake during the flight would either cause the rocket to go out of control or miss it\u0027s target.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure there are any number of rockets I could put together using Vanguard/Juno era equipment that could do the contract, but if you\u0027re trying to go with more or less historic rockets, this contract is extremely hard to complete.\u00A0 Maybe reduce the periapsis to 350km.\u00A0 A 350km x 3200km orbit is hard but at least doable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut once you complete the \u0022atmospheric analysis\u0022 contract, the next type of satellite contract you get have requirements that are impossible (or at least beyond extremely difficult) to accomplish with Vanguard/Juno era parts (let alone with actual Vanguard or Juno rockets).\u00A0 I have two satellite contracts available: \u0022Meteorogical Satellite\u0022 and \u0022Micrometeorite Measurements\u0022.\u00A0 Both of them have periapsis and apoapsis requirements that are too strict for Vanguard/Juno era equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know all three of these types of contracts are completely doable once you have Thor/Atlas/Titan era equipment.\u00A0 It\u0027s just getting to that point that I\u0027m finding very repetitive.\u00A0 I just think we need a few satellite contracts that can be completed with Vanguard/Juno era rockets (i.e. single restart and limited upper stage

that meant having to rely on sounding rocket contracts to make the funds needed for new parts and site upgrades (I\u0027m still working on the funds to improve my launch pad).\u00A0 Just seems to me we need some repeatable early era satellite contracts (i.e. contracts with only minimum periapsis and apoapsis requirements).\u00A0 Maybe with a new Milestone contract that has you put a satellite
