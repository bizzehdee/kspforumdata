I understand that KSP requires that each ship component be 1 \u0027object\u0027 but that does not, necessarily, mean that that one object cant be composed of multiple meshes.\n\nFor example, I\\\u0027m modeling a fuel tank and would like to add some detail features. In particular I am aiming to model a small hose that runs down the side of the tank. Can they be individual meshes or must they all meet at common verts at some point?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T22:51:30Z","Content":"You definitely can have several separate meshes, it\\\u0027s exactly what I did with the Propane tanks I made for Tosh\\\u0027s tiny rover *and I intersect meshes with no problems*, you can only ever have one node\\_collider per complete part though and that collider cannot have concave surfaces.\n\nEdit:\n\n0.15 allows multiple colliders? that\\\u0027s cool but I bet you have to use the .mu files and Unity3D to make that work, same with the normal maps, bump mapping and all the other fancy new stuff, no chance of any of that for me, I can\\\u0027t run Unity3D on Linux ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T10:53:05Z","Content":"Just think of C7\\\u0027s landing gear: it\\\u0027s one part, but it is composed of several meshes (you can watch his tutorial on Unity).\n\nWith 0.15, you can even have multiple mesh colliders for only one part, which means REAL cargo bays with working doors are now doable (in a single part)."}]}
