It entered service during the later years of the war, and was recognizable by the low-frequency humming produced by its twin engines. This replica takes some liberties with the craft, but hopefully it\u0027s still recognizable. Because of a combination of technical unfeasibility\u00A0and a fair amount of laziness, the top turret and the tiered cockpits are missing.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal deal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022Northrop P-61 green airborne.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Northrop_P-61_green_airborne.jpg/1280px-Northrop_P-61_green_airborne.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy knockoff version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xQAc6iS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xQAc6iS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, it has virtually no similarities other than the twin boom design and the propellers, which are completely stock by the way. It\u0027s capable of flying at 234 kph for infinitely long, and it has a set of flaps which prove beneficial very occasionally. It seats one, as opposed to the three it\u0027s supposed to seat, because you don\u0027t need a gunner in KSP (usually). Get your knockoff today!
