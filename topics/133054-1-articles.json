CO2 particularly likes very cold precipitation, the fog that forms over the arctic ocean and then falls has been really good at pulling CO2 from the air, the oceans then picked this up and transported it down into the deep ocean, but now its started to come back to the surface. But its not dry ice by any means, its just CO2 rich regular ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T17:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there was more of it in the atmosphere, it would deposit itself, but there is not. For something\u00A0to precipitate, its partial pressure in the fluid needs to be equal to the vapor pressure of the precipitate. At that point, the precipitate and the vapor are in dynamic equilibrium - rate of particle liberation is equal to the rate of particle deposition/condensation. Any change of temperature or pressure in favor of the precipitate will cause it to, well, precipitate completely (faster if the conditions are further away from the point of equilibrium).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPartial pressure of carbon(IV) oxide in air is 0.04 * 101325 Pa = 4.052 Pa.
