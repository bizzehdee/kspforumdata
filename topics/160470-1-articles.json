I had always heard it might make a comeback with more recent developments. but it seems to not have happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne argument went into wire length and various arguments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brought me back to an idea I had along time ago. Geometric mobos made up of lego like blocks and geometrically designed for shorter wires. This, instead of flat 2d boards, could shorten the space of many system parts to increase at the least the core system. How pheasible would it be to have instead of a normal mobo(or on top of a normal mobo) a cube,pyramid, or spherical shape with core components either with the entire system or core components like ram bridges and cpu and other connectors reducing down wire length to speed up a system and get better features. If you also can make the entire system including gpu into segments instead of a whole card the engine system could be put in and customize by spacing in the shape instead of a long 2d space. I would think the main issue would become heating potentially. But design and possibly shrinkage could make interesting mini system or much more complex parts to fit on 2d or other boards. I\u0027ve been playing too much STO, but what about a dyson sphere computer with these shapes inside of it or a borg ship shaped computer! 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a lego like computer where you stick on cpu and other possibley different system parts could be interesting. if it\u0027s no bigger than a baseball or golfball or smaller how much could be changed about modern computer design. A whole computer the size of a baseball on a baseball stand providing power on a shelf would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about cylanders like the one ship in that one star trek movie.

the problem with sram is that its very big, 6 transistors per cell as opposed to a transistor and a cap. not only does this make sram very expensive but also very big. how deep your ram is also adds to memory latency because that whole speed of light thing. sram is good stuff though, very low idle power, very fast and quite easy to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\none thing you see in the embedded world is chip on chip packages, raspberry pi uses one. you can get a cpu that has pads on both sides, the top pads are so that a memory chip can be installed on top of the cpu, and a trip through the reflow oven bonds it all together. you cant really do the same thing with a high performance cpu like an i7, because you need a block of metal in contact with the die to act as a heat transfer medium into the heat sink, with a thermal interface paste of sorts in between. i often wonder why we have our ram way out in the boonies rather than right next to the cpu die. like ring the chip socket with sodimm slots to minimize signal paths to the chip. i dont think the case modders would like that very much, you cant stick a heafty cooling block on your cpu if you have ram in the way, even though the closer ram would probibly be worth more performance wise than a few hundred mhz of overclock. unfortunately thats the group you have to market your boards to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen i build a computer less is usually more, all your performance comes from your cpu, ram, and ssds (and your gpu). you dont need a mobo that you could use for a coffee table, or a case the size of the apollo guidence computer to get good performance. smaller is always going to be better. thats why im fond of the mini-itx form factor. you can cram a lot of performance into a little tiny computer. they seldom take more than one video card and seldom more than 2 sticks of ram, maybe a minipcix or an m.2 slot. power supplies and video cards are really behind the times with reguards to miniaturization. again high end system builders demanding massive video cards with two pounds of heat sink, which they will remove and replace with a liquid cooling block that they dont need. at least their are half length cards that have pretty good performance, but id rather have a half height card to get my case size down. power supplies are finally coming down, i saw a 500w modular sfx power supply, so at least the psu people are getting with it. id like to get my system down to about half a cubic foot next time (realistically im probibly reusing my elite 110).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-11T21:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCooling is the primary spacerelated problem in

(AKA color spectrum detection as hardware storage and massive bitlengths for data representations etc to increase information processing.) the question was how much could you incrase processing by using LCD or similar tech and light spectrums as a way of sending data in mass form. Each light spectrum being a massive bitlength and subtle changes in light being changes in data. Say an entire length of lcd made a single massive line of data(the line is not straight) but it is read on a continuous basis, possibly not all at once but fairly fast. Although I would assume constant read states would be possible.) if each node was a color and the color was displayed and read properly and each node being a massive bit length and/or the entire line of LCD\u0027s being a bigger bit length made of the smaller bits could you process massive information on a visual/nonsivusual color spectrum in a line or whatnot. Then instead of processing data the normal way you simply keep track of changes on a massive color display that is storable without power(assuming) and ram/HDD and possibly CPU/GPU in one. I wondered if error checking and actual processing could be done via visual scan and electronic bit at once separately and used for checking and processing of info simultaneously for quicker use on a whole or in case situations. Particularly if the node held it\u0027s own data on it\u0027s state. I wondered if it could get longer lifespans than normal methods also. I think it came down to wether the nanometer size of the chip outdid the color spectrum depth of bits in the LCD and it\u0027s size or something. Would something like that be cooler and usable as either lines(normal fiber optics or my idea) or as a processing unit of some kind? Not sure whether LCD\u0027s produce more heat output than a cpu does in equivalent mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the origin of the convo was going past binary computing. I think my reasoning was the potential ability to change the lights spectrum and hold it with minimal change or ware on parts and massive depth of bit information to make up for size or other issues. And wether it had any other advantage/disadvantages. And if it can act as enough parts of a current computer(RAM/HDD/CPU/GPU/other) take over as a single multi use component given a correct configuration or design. If all else works I\u0027m assuming the difficulty is repair/replacement and associated issues. though you would have to probably look at recycling and reuse to see if it can be made to override those issues. Along with ease or cheapness of manufacturing. Especially if you can get enough computing from a small enough area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://news.mit.edu/2013/computing-with-light-0704\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://news.mit.edu/2013/computing-with-light-0704\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s this. But I was thinking color spectrum detection because you could have 2^2,000,000 bit length at minimum plus possible non visual color spectrums. Although multiple measurements simultaneously was something I wondered about. If you can make it do two or more(possibley many more) thing at onces. Or\u00A0 in between readable functions of one type or another...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could make raid interesting.

Like that ELCD(or was it OLED) stuff that was supposed to come out with massive color bit spectrums of display from japan.

If the case itself were all OLED\u0027s and the side facing you is the screen while the rest of it is used for the computer it might work out nice. Especially if those oled\u0027s are or could be made less power hungry. If it could hold it state data physically without power it could go into low power mode and only use one read state to run most things and a small minimal chunk of oled\u0027s for computing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_light-emitting_transistor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_light-emitting_transistor\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_field-effect_transistor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_field-effect_transistor\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdl\u003E\u003Cdt\u003E\nLower cost in the future\n\u003C/dt\u003E\n\u003Cdd\u003E\nOLEDs can be printed onto any suitable \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_%28printing%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Substrate (printing)\u0022\u003Esubstrate\u003C/a\u003E by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing,\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED#cite_note-65\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[65]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_display\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Plasma display\u0022\u003Eplasma displays\u003C/a\u003E.
