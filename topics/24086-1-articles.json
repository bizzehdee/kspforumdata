You\u0027ll know you\u0027re there when your Surface Speed is 0m/s.

Though you really could do it with any design as long as you can maintain a \u0026gt;1 TWR the whole time so that the burns take place before it loses contact or moves out of position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c376/sbssean1987/screenshot70_zps9b7a19cb.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStep 1\u003C/a\u003E 80km initial apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c376/sbssean1987/screenshot71_zps094bcb3d.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStep 2\u003C/a\u003E Raise apoapsis to 2868km after reaching 80km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c376/sbssean1987/screenshot72_zps1a18526c.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStep 3\u003C/a\u003E On the second pass, KSC is below the satellite.
