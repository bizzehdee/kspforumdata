But the game challenged me to do so much more. To create a reliable satellite network (RemoteTech 2), build aerodynamically sound and aesthetically pleasing rockets, etc. Now, while I await the 1.0 update, I have not really felt like playing the game (which always happens when a new update is imminent). However, after seeing mission patches from NASA, ESA, and jpvalery (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.behance.net/gallery/13065333/Kerbal-Mission-Patches\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.behance.net/gallery/13065333/Kerbal-Mission-Patches\u003C/a\u003E), I decided to attempt to create my own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aSlmh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
