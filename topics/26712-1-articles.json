Not only does it provide a autopilot, but it also gives you great information about your orbit or when to start your interplanetary travel. Also mechjeb does a superb job alnding your craft in non air enviroments, and if you specify your orbit yourself mechjeb weill even eb able to land with a 100m margin of error next to your specified target (without specifing your orbit yourself mechjeb will most likely miss the target aroun 30 km) I also use Hydrotech for docking my larger crafts wit mutiple dockingports. If you need to have a specific orientation this will help you. Just be prepared to wait around 10-30 min until hydrojeb has docked, it likes to take its time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T12:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mechjeb\u0022 isn\u0027t cheating in any way, and you will learn just as well with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without autopilot, all the information like the \u0022Delta Velocity\u0022 per stages is a prerequisite to become good at the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurist be damned, Computer are the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the autopilot, you\u0027ll have the time to watch how it does it, what went wrong, what could make it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last version of Mechjeb offer so much setting that you\u0027ll learn to understand concept like \u0022Homann Transfer\u0022 and \u0022Terminal Velocity\u0022, or why doing an interplanetary plane-change mid-course is cheaper than doing it during the original burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll even go as far as saying that Mechjeb will be obligatory late-career mode, because not everybody have fun launching 800 tons tankers and 12 geostationary satellite repetitively, but everybody have fun building them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T14:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets lock this before it becomes another Mechjeb vs no Mechjeb thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
