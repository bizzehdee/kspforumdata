It is likely bound for a 0 meter parking orbit but I would like to figure the issue out so the next station in orbit doesnt do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a search on this and one suggestion is that trim is out, so I have madly been pressing Alt-X to reset trim but this seems to have no effect. The yaw and pitch indicators do look like they may be ever so slightly off center, but this may just be a GUI issue, either way Alt-X does not do anything to fix it. I see no entries for trim in the settings config so I cant even tell if the keys have been remapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station is stock except for the Aviation Lights Mod; I have most of my craft lit up with these. This is the only one with the unwanted spin issue (that I have noticed).
