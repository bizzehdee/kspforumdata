It seems that even the slightest breeze will cause the thing to fall to pieces, and it can\u0027t seem to maneuver at all in the atmosphere. I can probably get the thing to orbit pretty easily using my heavy lifter, but if I can\u0027t land the damn thing, what\u0027s the point? I\u0027m at a loss as to how others have managed to produce a working shuttle using these parts. I\u0027ve attached my latest conceptual design in hopes that somebody can help me understand where I\u0027m going so wrong.\n\n[Space Shuttle Concept](https://www./?blziq7ah249svi4)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T03:14:52Z","Content":"Ooo...

The main booster is meant to be recovered, which I was able to do without issue. The problem again is landing the shuttle itself. It has difficulty landing on the *runway* it seems, and any maneuvers in the atmosphere causes it to decide that it doesn\u0027t like being in one piece any longer. I haven\u0027t messed around with any screenshots yet, but it\u0027s pretty standard stuff, which makes its refusal to work all the more perplexing."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T04:41:41Z","Content":"mknote,\n\n I just checked out the shuttle itself. I disabled the inboard elevons, the rudder, and the engine gimbaling. It flies much nicer that way.\n\n Try that and see how it goes.\n\n\\*edit\\* It\u0027s too nose- heavy also. The thrust of the engines help raise the nose, but it drops as soon as the power\u0027s off. Wings need to come forward a bit.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T04:56:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"mknote","CreatedById":20101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T18:41:25Z","Content":"Well, I added some wing strakes and it flies more stably now. Disabling the control surfaces is not advisable though. I\u0027ve also removed the RAPIERS to better simulate the actual space shuttle. Dunno if it lands from space well yet, but I got it to land at a reasonable speed and it\u0027s a lot more controllable, so I think I\u0027m good. Thanks for the help!"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T10:38:06Z","Content":"I\u0027m also flying a shuttle called Endurance now, it\u0027s an in-between of a Space Shuttle and a Buran. Launching it is like flying a cow-it wants to always turn itself in some odd direction, probably because of the huge tail fin. But descending it is like a dream. The center of lift and center of mass are pretty far apart, the thing is pretty stable because of that.But Big-S control surfaces, a powerful reaction wheel and RCS thrusters are enough to compensate for that. Due to its stability I can do a real shuttle style descent where I keep myself long in the upper atmosphere and decelerate from 2100m/s to 500m/s. After that I glide the Endurance down to KSC with a max speed of about 200m/s, but a drag chute is enough to slow it down to a save landing. I don\u0027t understand why your shuttle \u0022breaks up\u0022. Is it because of heat or are you playing with FAR? Or does a spontaneous unplanned lithobrake happen? Really, drag/drogue chutes are your friends.\n\nSadly I only have a phoenix shot of my shuttle.\n\n![7ThJdU5.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/7ThJdU5.png?1)"}]}
