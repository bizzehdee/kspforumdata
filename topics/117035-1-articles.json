It seems that even the slightest breeze will cause the thing to fall to pieces, and it can\u0027t seem to maneuver at all in the atmosphere. I can probably get the thing to orbit pretty easily using my heavy lifter, but if I can\u0027t land the damn thing, what\u0027s the point? I\u0027m at a loss as to how others have managed to produce a working shuttle using these parts.

Launching it is like flying a cow-it wants to always turn itself in some odd direction, probably because of the huge tail fin. But descending it is like a dream. The center of lift and center of mass are pretty far apart, the thing is pretty stable because of that.But Big-S control surfaces, a powerful reaction wheel and RCS thrusters are enough to compensate for that. Due to its stability I can do a real shuttle style descent where I keep myself long in the upper atmosphere and decelerate from 2100m/s to 500m/s. After that I glide the Endurance down to KSC with a max speed of about 200m/s, but a drag chute is enough to slow it down to a save landing. I don\u0027t understand why your shuttle \u0022breaks up\u0022. Is it because of heat or are you playing with FAR? Or does a spontaneous unplanned lithobrake happen?
