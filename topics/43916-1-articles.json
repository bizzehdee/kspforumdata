People therefor have got the idea that the same happens when you throw it out in space. But I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that any liquid\u0027s evaporation point lowers with the surrounding pressure. But in order for a liquid to vaporize it needs energy from somewhere. When there\u0027s no air the water can\u0027t get any energy from the surroundings (We say that there\u0027s no radiation directed at it). But it has to vaporize and the only source of energy it has is it self. Therefor it pulls energy from itself which will cause it to freeze, while it vaporize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have a situation where the water will vaporize and freeze at the same time. But I can\u0027t figure out what the water would look like afterwards. My current theory is that it would be something like snow but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T08:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei believe you are correct.

In direct sunlight there\u0027s plenty of incident energy to vaporise it, at least in earth orbit. In shade Kahlzun is right, there would be a burst of vapour as the water loses most of the energy it had when it was released into vacuum and then it would freeze. This is why there is ice in the permanently shaded parts of craters on the moon, but on the exposed surface it can only exist beneath the surface layer or else the sun would vaporise it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T09:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kahlzun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kahlzun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question i\u0027d like to see answered is \u0022would thermite, or similar metal/oxide fires burn in vacuum\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why not, at least those that don\u0027t require an external source of oxydiser outside what\u0027s provided for by the reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s after all the way rocket engines work, and we know those work rather well in a vacuum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the thermite reaction fits the bill: Fe2O3 \u002B 2 Al \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00E2\u20AC\u2122 2 Fe \u002B Al2O3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemains the problem of keeping the materials in contact so the reaction can take place, but that\u0027s an engineering problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T11:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn vacuum, there\u0027s nothing to keep the faster particles in water to jump out and deplete the amount of energy in it.

The \u003Cem\u003Eboiling point\u003C/em\u003E lowers. Boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is greater than ambient. Vaporization happens at \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E temperature. Water at room temperature evaporates. It just does so more slowly. And as it evaporates, it cools down. Unless humidity in the room is 100%, water left on its own will be at lower temperature than the air in the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct in predicting that water will cool to the freezing point. But it will not stop evaporating then, either. It will continue to evaporate even when frozen. So the correct sequence of events for a blob of water that got accidentally released into the vacuum of space is that it will first begin to violently boil, breaking down into many tiny droplets. These droplets will cool to freezing point and freeze. The result will not be quite like snow, because freezing will be very fast. It will be more of a frozen mist. That frozen mist will then, over time, evaporate completely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
