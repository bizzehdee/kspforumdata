With that said, Kerbal Konstructs does work with this, but it will use whatever launch site you last selected in the VAB/SPH, so it just requires some extra scene changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I think of it, I could probably eliminate a scene change by letting you launch from the editor if the ship is already on the pad and ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: To avoid double posting, I\u0027ll just edit this. I added the launch button to the editor, but didn\u0027t test it. I did however FINALLY get building upgrades to have a time requirement and it appears to be working properly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E So that\u0027s in the dev build now. Only thing left to do is a bug fix or two, add the building upgrades to the settings and build list (and restrict them to career mode), probably add some more options for KAC alarms, and get launching craft that are recovered to the inventory working properly. I might get some time tomorrow to work on this, so \u003Cstrong\u003Ehopefully\u003C/strong\u003E I can have a suitable prerelease within the next week that isn\u0027t just a bunch of random things thrown together. I\u0027m pretty sure the current dev version is functional and mostly bug free, but not quite suitable for normal play just yet. Once I get it stable enough, I\u0027ll let JeffreyCor break it as much as possible (and anyone else who wants to test), then release it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, it\u0027s not super packed with features; it\u0027s mostly bug fixes. As many of you know, I\u0027m in my first year of graduate school, so free time is not something I have a lot of, and when I do get it I\u0027d rather relax instead of spending more time debugging code (my research involves molecular dynamics simulations that I\u0027ve written myself, so I often have to hunt down bugs in it)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T04:47:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghostshark27","CreatedById":78982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T21:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to do a non-KK and a KK based version of KCT? So those that need it can launch from other places, and those that like using stock facilities can use KCT without KK dependancy? Just throwing out an idea, don\u0027t know if that would break anything between versions, my knowledge on mod making is pretty limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the case, I\u0027m loving this mod, and can\u0027t wait to see what else you put in it.
