Wing drag increased in 1.0.1, but wing lift increased *more* so the l/d is now preferable to before. The more wing you have, the nearer to horizontal you can be while still remaining level, so the more thrust you can get out of your jets, so the sooner you go to space ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ve experimented with tiny wings in 1.0.2 and they simply don\u0027t work. The way that jet thrust is so tied to your angle above the horizon will cripple planes with smaller wings.\n\nIf I had any advice, it would be to choose what this bird is *for*. You list a cargo capacity, but it has a crew cabin. If it\u0027s a crew transporter, does it need 3T in the bay as well? If it\u0027s a lifter, you can add 2.5T capacity by dumping the crew tank. A 5.5T lifter is pretty good going under current stock, so I\u0027d be inclined to remodel and specialise one way or the other.

As long as you can break Mach 1 at 10kms, you are fine, and each RAPIER you take out is a couple tons extra payload. I\u0027m thinking maybe three could be enough for that weight class (my White Dart 1.0 is probably overpowered too by at least 25%).\n\u003E \n\u003E Other than that, the control surfaces on the wings look to be really close to the CoM. Use them only for roll control, since they won\u0027t add much pitch torque and they will steal lift and increase drag when they try to pitch you up. Or just make the wing bigger and take them out, to get enough roll authority you can usually make do with the pod\u0027s reaction wheels. If you are lacking pitch authority (doubtful, the new aero system lets you get away with very little), canards should work wonders in a tail-heavy design like that one, and you can sink them into the cockpit for a flush look, that still works like before (occlusion is only done for stuff inside cargo bays and/or connected by nodes).\n\u003E \n\u003E Rune.

Right now I am trying to figure out if a more gentle ascent where I am already going Mach 1 as I hit 12k is best or if a steep climb to 14k-15k at subsonic speeds and then diving to break the sound barrier is better.
