A modern longbow is more like 50-60lbf at 28\u0022 as we are weak and sissymen who don\u0027t train from an early age hundreds or thousands of hours per year). The best longbowmen could fire an arrow four hundred yards! Sources vary on typical range of a longbowman company in battle, but estimates are from around 270-350 yds. By comparison a modern longbow with a 60lbf 28\u0022 draw can send an arrow about 200yds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at those long ranges a bodkin or broad arrow is generally effective at penetrating 3 or so inches through a jack coat (leather and padded coat typical of infantry without great means). A bodkin arrow would penetrate more than 2\u0022 through maile armor and would even be effective against poorly maintained steel plate or wrought iron armor. They\u0027d also be capable of penetrating joints or eye holes of even the best steel plate armor...and keep in mind, thousands of arrows are being rained down on an army from (likely) several companies of longbowmen. So even the best armored, which would be VERY few, of an opposing army would stand a modest chance of taking an arrow in a joint, eyehole or other weakness in their armor. Let alone the vast majority of an army who would not be wearing the best armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at Againcourt where the charge on the English army (composed mostly of longbowmen) was composed almost exclusively of plate and mail armored French knights, most of the knights were dismounted by arrow fire and many were injured or killed by arrow fire (or the dismounting) and then slaughtered while mired in mud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other modern tests show that the heaviest bows with the heaviest arrows and bodkin points ARE capable of penetrating even some of the better steel breast plates of the late medieval and early reniansance period at point blank range (average bows likely would only penetrate a very small amount, well less than an inch, meaning you MIGHT get hurt, but probably not at all as the point wouldn\u0027t penetrate far enough to punch through the padding you were wearing under the armor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you factor in that the average longbowman was provided between 50-60 arrows during a battle; then that the sustained rate of fire (factoring fatigue and a long battle) was 6 arrows per minute and you have an awesome, awesome spectecal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe average longbowman was expected to be able to hit a lone man some of the time at 200yds and an army all of the time. Lets not consider their accuracy at, say, 50yds (which was probably greater than a 95% chance of striking a man let alone a horse). Even figuring a typical sustained rate of fire a charging army on foot would take about 2 minutes to cross 300yds at a speed of around 8 feet per second (roughly 5mph. Probably about as fast as a full army could run in armor with weapons over open ground for nearly a quarter mile and have even a modecrum of cohesion). That means an army on foot would have to suffer at least 12 arrows per archer. If the force has a company of archers of only 100 men in it, that is 1,200 arrows. Figure an army of 3,000 might have 400 archers, which would be nearly 5,000 arrows. Then you also factor in that the archers will probably fire faster at first, especially seeing a charging army coming at them, they could probably fire off 20 arrows in those 2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven charging knights on horse back could be riddled. Figure knights on Destriers and full armor on level, unbroken ground might be able to charge at 25mph (which is probably on the high end) over 300yds. That still takes them close to 30 seconds to cover that ground, or at least 3 arrows per archer and since they\u0027d probably be firing as fast as they possibly can, maybe 6-8 arrows per archer. I am a weak and sissyman (actually I am not), but using my 60lb oak longbow trying to fire as fast as I can in to a straw target at 40yds with my arrows point down in the dirt in front of me like an English longbowman would do during battle and firing accurately enough to put every arrow in to the target (not necessarily a bullseye, but accurate enough to hit a man sized target basically at 40yds) I can fire roughly 14-15 arrows in one minute, though admitedly my rate of fire does start dropping off from my arms getting tired after that. Even with heavier bows, I\u0027d assume these guys with their life on the line and a decade or decades of training and stronger, even if using heavier bows could at least be able to manage a similar rate of fire in a short burst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeowch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuns only won out for two reasons. One, they did penetrate better than arrows and as heavier armor became cheaper, they had an advantage as things like steel cuirasses started to become wide spread in mercenary armies during the reniassance. Next was training. A couple of hours could train a musketeer (not the book/movie kind. I mean the kind that used a musket) sufficient to load, fire and care for their weapon and a couple of weeks could make then rather proficient. It took years and years to train a good longbowman. Longbows continued to have a significantly better rate of fire, more accurate and longer ranged until the advent of rifling and continued to have the advantage rate of fire until the advent of breechlock rifles and repeaters in the mid 1800\u0027s (though longbows went out as a weapon of war in the early 1600s basically).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T13:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside with bows was having to fire them up into the air to get distance. If you have ever seen a master bowman aim, raise and pull all in one you just know how much skill it takes (none of this pulling, holding then aiming lark lol).

The fins in back are for steering. That particular rocket system has to make incredibly (relative to velocity) tight turns. In my experiments with fins in KSP, putting them at the top works pretty much in the same way it does for the missile - spin control.

The French knights effectively got funneled down toward the narrower front of the British army and the muddy ground both slowed horses and men once they were dismounted.

A heck of a lot were captured. The Ransom a knight of even modest means could bring for a commoner longbowman was SUBSTANTIAL.
