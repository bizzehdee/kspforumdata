Just a few moments ago I was out exploring the solar system and I encounter what appeared to be a distant star twinkling in the distance (mind you I was flying one of those USS Enterprise ships and traveling at extreme velocity) well I aligned the bow of my ship toward and hit the throttle. I could see the object/star/UFO/thing moving (relatively) up away from my bow and it actually was outrunning me. Im traveling at 454248 m/s and this thing is moving at about 3 times that speed away from me! Mind you I got within 50,000 km of this thing before it punched it up to warp 9 and I am using no mods except KAS, Mechjeb and Hyperedit I have three other Star Trek ships; USS Voyager, USS Stargazer. and The Phoenix. None of which contains additional coding that I am aware of. BTW I encountered this 46,000,000 m away from Minimus and 70,000,000 m from Kerbin I have no idea how to give better info than that but I can tell you that Minimus is to my right as well as Duna in the distance off to the right if that helps any of you astronomers out that pinpoint my location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can shed some light on what this thing was or if anyone has also seen strange things floating in space - Not debris, before anyone says it - I would love to hear stories of UFOs or other strange phenomenon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T17:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm...
