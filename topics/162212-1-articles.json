I\u0027ve got about a dozen mods, have identified several that are causing problems.\u00A0I seem to have 4 parts that are not loaded into the game. These are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) utilityCabin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) adapter-375-25\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) KAXelectricprop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) mk3-9pod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe list above is exactly what shows up under the Vessel Loading Error box once the Space Center is loaded. I\u0027m already pretty certain\u00A0that the \u0027utilityCabin\u0027 and the \u0027mk3-9pod\u0027 are the PPD-24 Itinerant Service Container and the Mk3-9 Orbital Command Pod respectively. These are both from the NearFutureSpacecraft mod, which I do have the latest version of. So this eludes me as to why they aren\u0027t loading.\u00A0I have not been able to identify the adapter-375-25 part yet, however I do not believe that it is a large adapter, because one of the vessels containing it is of a smaller scale. (So I don\u0027t think it is\u00A0an adapter from 3.75m to 2.5m, but again, not 100% sure). Lastly, the KAXelectricprop is obviously the electric prop from the mod KAX. This mod has been a problem for me, as I have identified it as the cause of the game crashing upon load-up. The mod is not currently updated, however I find it hard that because it is not updated, it makes the entire game crash. So maybe it\u0027s something else, I don\u0027t know. Is there a way to manually copy a part (like the electric prop) and place it in another mod so that the part loads? Any help would be much appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
