Personally, I prefer the orbit being drawn through objects. It gives you a sense of how much speed you will have and how much you may need to change your orbit to avoid an impact. The periapsis marker already disappears when there will be an impact, anyway, that\u0027s what I look for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
