I seem to recall reading a while back that what happens is that the 1st part to hit the air heats the air, so anything radially attached further back on the ship gets normal reentry heat plus this preheated air. This yields the silly result that the radial parts away from where the actual heat is being generated and in the boundary layer that isn\u0027t moving as fast anyway, burn up before identical parts on the leading end of the ship that are facing the full brunt of the entry.\n\nYou can demonstrate this for yourself fairly easily. Make a tanker out of an orange tank with a Sr. docking port on the end that will hit the air first. Attach more Sr. docking ports radially to the orange tank near the middle or other end. The port on the end will survive a pass that burns off the radial ports."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:44:35Z","Content":"The problem is scale. \n\n3000m/s? LOL. I tested kerbin up to about 12 km/s with a 20 km periapsis. Even at that velocity reentry is not troublesome. This is a situation that shows where realism is a better benchmark. Have a tiny system, with exaggerated gravity, and pulled from thin air atmospheric settings, and trying to balance things becomes impossible if a goal is for kerbin reentry to be even a little dangerous.\n\ni will test using RSS tonight and see if at real scale reentry has some dangers.

But those who have tried these things are already screaming with things as they are. Send a small probe and no real problem, provided you\u0027ve got it in a fairing. But send a big ship and things get quite tricky. If you come in low enough (and \u0022low\u0022 at Jool is in the vicinity of 190km, just 10km inside the atmosphere) to capture into the most elliptical orbit possible, you\u0027ll probably burn something up. So you pretty much have to plan on burning about 600-1000m/s for such ships to capture at Jool intact after just barely aerobraking at like 198km, depending on your arrival speed. I believe this is all because of fundamental flaws in both the heat system and the new aero system.\n\nThe new aero system, which I think was designed especially for Kerbin without much consideration of its effects elsewhere, is really weird in that atmospheric density is much greater, ridiculously so, at higher altitudes than it was pre-1.x. This is why all aerobraking altitudes are considerably higher than before for the same planets. I suspect this was done to remove the incentive for airhogging with SSTOs, along with jet thrust curves that make thrust suddenly die at about 25km even though there\u0027s still plenty of air. And also to reduce the amount of wing area required, so that drag would be low enough to get supersonic. But this has all sorts of strange effects on other planets. It essentially makes any substantial atmosphere nearly a brick wall at interplanetary speeds. In addition, it has made Duna\u0027s atmosphere totally friendly in all respect. Used to be, Duna\u0027s atmosphere was like Mars\u0027, aptly described as \u0022too thin to be any use but too thick to ignore\u0022. Now it\u0027s the opposite. Thin enough to ignore if you so choose, but thick enough to be extremely helpful if you want it to be. Parachute landings are now totally easy on Duna, even at high ground elevations, with much less chute area than before. And you can fly airplanes there no problem at all, nearly as well as on Kerbin, when before this was extremely difficult. But at the same time, there\u0027s no heat to reentries at all, not even coming from Kerbin, and taking off requires less dV than before, just like on Kerbin.\n\nThen there\u0027s the wrongness of the whole heat system. First and foremost is the fact that it has more massive objects heating up faster than lighter objects, which is back-asswards to reality. Second is the way the rear parts of the ship experience more heat than the front parts, which is also at odds with reality, so the longer the ship, the hotter it gets. And the bigger the ship, the faster it heats up. Thus, the odds are stacked against anything much bigger than a small probe.\n\nAll in all, the full silliness of the 1.0.2 system cannot be judged simply by how pods reenter from LKO. You have to see it all across the solar system to fully \u0022appreciate\u0022 it.\n\nThe bottom line, however, is that nobody\u0027s happy. Some say it\u0027s too easy at Kerbin, other say it\u0027s too hard elsewhere, and a few say it makes Duna the easiest place ever. Making things harder at Kerbin will necessarily make things impossible elsewhere (or when returning to Kerbin). Making things easier at other planets (or returning to Kerbin) will make things at Kerbin super-easy. I think that\u0027s a pretty good indication that both the heat and aero systems need to be rebuilt from the ground up because arguably it\u0027s currently broken everywhere in the solar system. Individual users can\u0027t alter settings to make 1 place more to their liking without making everything else worse. I hope that some of the working being done for 1.0.3 is aimed at this."},{"CreatedByName":"SignalCorps","CreatedById":134795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T06:29:07Z","Content":"\u003E That picture you have of that horrendous rock with wings and a crazy-ass kerbal on top...please tell me you made that, and it actually is flyable."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T08:23:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The new aero system, which I think was designed especially for Kerbin without much consideration of its effects elsewhere, is really weird in that atmospheric density is much greater, ridiculously so, at higher altitudes than it was pre-1.x.

First and foremost is the fact that it has more massive objects heating up faster than lighter objects\n\nIIRC there was a thread around showing that atmospheric density with 1.0 was actually lower in the upper atmosphere than it was prior. Atmospheric **drag** being different shouldn\u0027t surprise anyone given the entirely new system that doesn\u0027t just assume a coefficient of 0.2 for everything.\n\nThe decreasing thrust at altitude is to my knowledge approximating atleast two things. The decreasing mass flow rate and the change in compressor efficiency. Combustion engines can\u0027t run on the extremely thin air in the upper atmosphere so it needs to be run through a compression stage first to bring it into operational densities. That compressor is going to have a limit past which it can\u0027t do it\u0027s job effectively enough to feed the engine even if the total flow would be high enough.\n\nLarger objects heating up faster is actually somewhat to be expected. Larger objects generally experience a lesser drag force per unit mass (mass is ~cubic with size while frontal area is ~size squared) leading to them decelerating slower and carrying greater speed into the denser parts of the atmosphere. Heating rate is most likely proportional to atleast speed^2^ if not a higher power, so even a slight increase in speed would have a dramatic impact on the generation of thermal energy. Focus that into only a couple of parts that receive the brunt of the airflow and you get more explosions with the heavier vessel"}]}
