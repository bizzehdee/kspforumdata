Fell out of the sky like a stone. Maybe I\u0027ll have to cheat to create more wing area. Too bad FAR is so picky about the cargo bay that testing gets difficult.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I tried taking off with an empty KSO (infinite fuel) from the runway with your FAR config and it just doesn\u0027t seem to generate enough lift to keep itself airborne. The FAR config will undoubtedly require cheating to manufacture a wing area that generates suitable lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qnistNAMEERF","CreatedById":80995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T19:47:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SMILIE\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SMILIE\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat would be nice is, if you can make a download for the three phases separately and without all the other requirements.
