It\u0027s been six decades since the apocalyptic Atomic Conflict. Kerbal society has mostly recovered, although it remains fractured, as always, into distinct groups of varying scales. The largest of these, the Great Powers, control vast swathes of Kerbin\u0027s landmass, and with it millions of individuals. Each represents its people and its outlook for the future. Their development steadily walks along, as it always has; in fact, we begin this story in a period of extreme economic growth. The future holds boundless promise for those who dare to dream. Technological advance steadily rolls back the cruelties of illness, slavery, and malcontentment. Travel, fickle as it is, has also been mastered by Kerbalkind, thanks to the combustion engine. With it, and the pneumatic wheel, traverse across land is no longer exhausting and timeconsuming. With it and the propeller, sea travel is cheap, commonplace, and vital to the global marketplace; even the skies have been conquered. But there yet remains one final frontier. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESpace. That perfectly black void beyond the atmosphere. It has been the home of dreamers since time immemorial; but an area that is inaccessible, and some say impossible, for Kerbals to reach. But with great expectations, the Grand Equatorial Union, a band of states loosely tied around the planet\u0027s midsection, has been convinced it\u0027s possible for a Kerb to go there. Even live there. With the aid of a new technology: the rocket. And even then; the G.E.U\u0027s people aren\u0027t the only ones looking up.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(This is going to be an AAR, in the style of Cydonian Monk\u0027s much-beloved NULL CYCLES/AD LUNAM.
