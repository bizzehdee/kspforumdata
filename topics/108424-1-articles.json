I just threw on some OX-STATs and a couple of lights, and it appears that once the EC hits zero, you can\u0027t do any commands. Enable *or* disable. And so the lights and Science Lab stay on, sucking all EC, and preventing me from shutting them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis continues even if I EVA my scientists - the lab continues to try processing data, and my EC level does not increase. I have an OKTO installed. If I edit my quicksave to throw some extra EC into my batteries, I can control the vessel normally. When the lights and Lab are both off, I am very power positive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought in previous versions if you were power starved, consumers were disabled until you were power positive again.

If you burn too much and run out of power then it keeps trying to fire as energy comes in but there\u0027s not enough to maintain thrust- so you lack the ability to shut it off and you can\u0027t time warp it off since it\u0027s still accelerating.
