I just threw on some OX-STATs and a couple of lights, and it appears that once the EC hits zero, you can\u0027t do any commands. Enable \\*or\\* disable. And so the lights and Science Lab stay on, sucking all EC, and preventing me from shutting them off.\n\nThis continues even if I EVA my scientists - the lab continues to try processing data, and my EC level does not increase. I have an OKTO installed. If I edit my quicksave to throw some extra EC into my batteries, I can control the vessel normally. When the lights and Lab are both off, I am very power positive.\n\nI thought in previous versions if you were power starved, consumers were disabled until you were power positive again. Is this new behavior?\n\nI am currently not running any mods such as Remote Tech that might cause similar behavior:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\u003Eckan list\n\nKSP found at C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program\n\nKSP Version: 1.0.2\n\nInstalled Modules:\n\n- ContractConfigurator 1.0.4\n\n- ContractConfigurator-AnomalySurveyor 1.1.2\n\n- ContractsWindowPlus 5.1\n\n- CrewManifest 0.6.0\n\n- DockingPortAlignmentIndicator 6.2\n\n- KerbalAlarmClock v3.3.1.1\n\n- KerbalConstructionTime 1.1.6\n\n- KerbalEngineerRedux 1.0.16.6\n\n- LandingHeight 1.4\n\n- LightsOut 0.1.3\n\n- ModuleManager 2.6.3\n\n- PreciseNode 1.1.3\n\n- RCSLandAid 2.4\n\n- StockBugFixModules v1.0.2b\n\n- Toolbar 1.7.9\n\n- TransferWindowPlanner v1.3.0.1\n\n- WaypointManager 2.3.2\n\nLegend: -: Up to date.

A manned pod without power could still start/stop things, but a probe core requires power to work.\n\nAs has been said, kerbals on EVA should be able to shut down consumers. They could also push your lab so you get more sun on the panels.\n\nHowever, that lab needs 5 power/second. From it\u0027s looks, I guess that your Lab will barely have enough power under ideal conditions, and as soon as conditions are no longer ideal, you\u0027re out of luck."},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:51:15Z","Content":"Yeah xenon probes have the same problem- you throttle up and they burn up EC. If you burn too much and run out of power then it keeps trying to fire as energy comes in but there\u0027s not enough to maintain thrust- so you lack the ability to shut it off and you can\u0027t time warp it off since it\u0027s still accelerating. That has been a major problem for probes for ages. As a minor error in your xenon burn and ruin and entire mission which could\u0027ve taken hours to prepare... Quicksaving is always key here...\n\nHence why I always have hyperedit installed. It allows you to edit your fuel levels without having to open the persistance file. It prevents mission enders like yours or on long term burns by xenon."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:51:18Z","Content":"No docking port either.

Lock and unlock resource flow. So you can lock a full battery. And if you run out of power, you unlock it. This turns it into backup power, which you use to turn off the power drain. Than recharge all batterys, relock the backup battery, and continue as normal"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:57:55Z","Content":"Turning the lights off while on EVA is what I tried to do at first, but I was unable to - I thought that was possible with .90, but maybe I am mis-remembering. I did try in a sandbox - engineers aren\u0027t able to turn lights on or off externally either, and scientists and engineers can both open solar panels externally.\n\nI knew the mobile lab didn\u0027t count as a pod, hence the OKTO on it, but I was surprised that I wasn\u0027t able to turn off the lab itself when low on power. Even when I EVA\u0027d my two scientists, the lab would not shut down - that\u0027s probably a bug. I tested some things in a sandbox:\n\n\\* Without scientists you can activate research, and even though you are not researching, you are still losing the 5 EC/s. Seems like a bug to me.\n\n\\* While on Kerbin\u0027s surface at night @ zero EC, I could not activate/deactivate anything. I could enable/disable EC flow from batteries at least.\n\n\\* While on Kerbin\u0027s surface in the day time @ zero EC I could activate/deactivate items with 3 OX-STATs, but only if I started with some EC - after a long night @ zero EC I could not activate/deactivate items. Probably a weird rounding error?\n\n\\* When I varied up and down high timewarps, the EC on-board would vary up and down, up to \u002B40, while it should be all negative.\n\nI\u0027m playing with KCT on Career normal, so redesigning it with deployable panels (or docking ports) wasn\u0027t available at the time this was complete and ready for launch. It has parachutes all around so I will cheat a little power, enough to deorbit, and relaunch with a new design.\n\nDefinitely something that could be added to the Engineer\u0027s Report: \u0022Producers minus consumers of power is negative, add MOAR POWER!\u0022 or somesuch, along with listing the power requirements for the Mobile Lab in the VAB card.\n\n@ZooNamedGames - Thanks for the offer, but since this is at Kerbin and I have plenty of ./, I\u0027ll deorbit and relaunch with a v2.\n\n@Sirrobert - A good tip, and one that I\u0027d gotten out of the habit of due to my 0.90 game with Remote Tech. I\u0027ll keep an eye out to disable probe\u0027s on-board battery moving forwards.\n\nMmmmmkay, here\u0027s a weird exploit one can do:\n\nDisable one battery, select that battery plus a couple that are not disabled (these will show a few hundreths of an EC), and transfer EC to the disabled battery.
