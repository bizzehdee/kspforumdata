This has inspired me to try some things I\u0027ve never really done before. At the same time, I\u0027ve been wanting to do a real mission report for a long time now. I think I\u0027ll start by making a survey plane since aircraft are my weak spot. Expect some pics within the next few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
