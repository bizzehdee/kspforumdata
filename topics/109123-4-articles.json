I might have backhanded SYSTEMS into a monitor when he tried to cheer me up after the boilerplate bit it. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  Yeah, I forgot to place antennas on all parts that were supposed to operate while detached. \\*\\*facepalm\\*\\* While I was kind of worried going full RemoteTech for accomplishing this program, toadicus\u0027 AntennaRange provides a similar experience with a couple of options turned on, minus the need for command caching on the flight computer and time delay. A harsh lesson for future unmanned SunShooter launches: make sure there are antennas on board. I wonder if the failed recovery will affect my score. Greg?\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, some tentative score calculations, though can someone check my math as well, to be sure I\u0027m scoring this right?\n\u003E \n\u003E Points racked so far with an Apollo 4 mission launch:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Saturn V uses 5 \u002B 5 \u002B 1 = 20 (SIC uses a SpaceY cluster, SII uses 4\u002B1 separate engines)\n\u003E - Launch Escape System = 5 (MRS Boost Protective Cover \u002B LES)\n\u003E - Use fuel cells only = debatable. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) CSM had the fuel cells, but the MEM had solar panels. Then again, this was an LKO test flight, so maybe the MEM doesn\u0027t really count? 10 points if GO, 0 if NO GO.\n\u003E - Life Support Mod = wait. This was an unkerballed flight. I guess having Snacks! onboard won\u0027t count this time. Also, now that I think about it, will Snacks! be acceptable to score Life Support? The 50 kerbal-day supply on the command pods are still pretty generous by life support standards; even real-world!Orion does only about 21 days max, if I read Wiki right \u0022with up to 21 days active crew time plus 6 months quiescent\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Total score to date: 25 max, 15 min, depending on how the jury rules on the solar panels in the MEM. Maybe less, if GregroxMun docks points for fouled recovery. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nNext on SunShooter: a tour of the hardware (maybe?), and sending willing victims volunteers those engineers better get things right on everything this time\n\nPS: loch.ness, yes, I am having way too much fun.

(These missions also test the USI Life Support mod before sending crew interplanetary.) Starting with a creative solution to a failed solar panel deployment by the crew in the first ever in-space repair, three crews flew to Skylab establishing new records for space endurance and used the built in science sensors and Apollo Telescope Mount to learn more about Earth and the cosmos than could ever be done from the surface.\n\n\u0022Hey there\u0027s another planet out there!\u0022 Apollo XIX, initially intended for a munar landing, flew out to this little green rock (should be called Mintmus) using an unmodified CSM/LM package. Launching the mission was the first Saturn V ELV (Saturn V with four integrated solid boosters). Instead of a rover the crew brought along an RCS powered \u0027hopper\u0027.\n\nAnother ELV next launched the MOLAB which set down near the Twin Craters. With only a crew of two, Apollo XX landed adjacent to the MOLAB while the uncrewed CM remained in hibernation mode in munar orbit. The modified LM now carries nuclear power generation and sufficient life support for an extended stay up to 45 days, while the MOLAB on its own can support up to four kerbals for a total of 45 days (or two for 90 days).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.
