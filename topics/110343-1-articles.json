This one is, by far, my most practical iteration of the concept... which actually isn\u0027t saying much. The plus side is that it\u0027s only around $35k, which makes it relatively cheap to operate for an SSTO/spaceplane, and it is surprisingly satisfying to land.\n\n![kadmW6w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kadmW6w.jpg)\n\n[Download the KDX Lawn Dart](http://kerbalx.com/MaxSimm/KDX-Lawn-Dart.craft)\n\nTo get to orbit, simply accelerate past 200m/s and rotate until you\u0027re about 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. Go up until 10km altitude, then reduce pitch to 15-20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Don\u0027t touch anything - just let it accelerate. Don\u0027t worry about the heat, it can take it. Once velocity starts to decrease (you should be getting between 1250m/s and 1350m/s), hit ABORT to toggle the RAPIER mode to closed cycle and go to space.\n\nReentry is easy and can be done one of two ways: maintain 30-35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch until velocity has become manageable; or don\u0027t worry about it and just use the airbrake. \n\nThis sucker is tricky to land, so I added a pair of carefully balanced chutes for those who prefer to hedge their bets. Just deploy, disable SAS, and the craft will gently land with no problems. Unless you\u0027re over mountains. Then you\u0027ll have problems.\n\nTo land on the runway, hit ABORT to toggle the RAPIER mode to air breathing cycle and toggle BRAKES so the airbrake is on all the time. The landing speed is pretty high so all you really have to worry about is your descent rate, which you want to keep under 10m/s - the craft is almost pitch neutral wheels down, so just let it do its thing. Kill the engines once TD occurs because this baby is super slick and it has the annoying habit of shooting off the end of the runway because it is going too fast.\n\nOr so I heard."}]}
