I recently discovered the advanced tweakables option. It seemed really useful at first, but then i discovered that it messes with some modded parts. For example MechJeb doesn\u0027t work anymore. It just doesn\u0027t SHOW the GUI. Also, some of the parts from the station parts expansion have different modes, similar to different colors of fuel tanks. With\u00A0advanced tweakables on, it causes them to all merge together into one. Turning them off and restarting them fixes it, but i can\u0027t use the mods at the same time as advanced tweakables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help, LusBax.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-22T10:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to take this over here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/70-technical-support-pc-modded-installs/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/70-technical-support-pc-modded-installs/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince a lot of people use Advanced Tweakables and I\u0027ve never come across a single person experiencing your issue. it must be on your end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
