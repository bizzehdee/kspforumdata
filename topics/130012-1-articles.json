Anyway, it stands:\u00A0 you don\u0027t need that much mass.\u00A0 A lightweight radial separator, with a strut or two to stop bending, will be far more serviceable, at least for the ship designs I\u0027m used to seeing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s entirely possible that you\u0027re right and that radial attachment simply makes no sense for your ship, but I\u0027m suffering a crisis of imagination here because I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever launched anything that big.\u00A0 Even a full Jool mission for hitting every moon, back in the old days before ISRU, my launchpad weight was nowhere near 2500 tons.\u00A0 I\u0027m really having trouble picturing your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I\u0027m not criticizing your design choices, just trying to wrap my head around the scale here.\u00A0 Especially with a thread topic like \u0022rocket design rules of thumb\u0022-- because normally one of my rules of thumb is \u0022don\u0027t launch things that are 2500 tons\u0022.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enecessarily\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it could be that you have a particular mission profile that really requires it.\u00A0 But it may be worth a review of the overall design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if you\u0027re looking for design advice, then a screenshot (along with desired mission parameters) would really help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright. \u00A0I have some time. \u00A0(no work, no snow) I spent this afternoon working on documenting my mission (im learning how to use vegas video again), give me a couple of hours and I\u0027ll show an iteration of my rocket. \u00A0Right now, I can, launch, get to Jool, visit three moons and come home. \u00A0With objectives like... \u00A0get on the leaderboard and make a video with whisky tango foxtrot qualities. (ahh the life of \u00A0construction worker in deep winter with no snow)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
