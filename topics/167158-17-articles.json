comes to casino games.\u00A0 A casino will not put a game onto it\u0027s floor that will not show a profit per the Law of Large numbers.\u00A0 These games are not \u0027rigged\u0027, a legal casino is required by law to have the payout stats available upon request (at least by the governing body for that casino) for any mechanical game on the floor, and table games odds are well published on their own already.\u00A0 A game is only rigged when the actual odds are intentionally different than the published odds, either by alteration of the mechanism of a machine or through mechanics on a table game to affect the outcome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple methods usable by the player to obtain a legal edge over a casino.\u00A0\u00A0 The most obvious is card counting in blackjack, it can turn a very slight house edge (usually less than 1%) into a significant edge for the player.\u00A0 And it\u0027s not illegal, it\u0027s just that casinos don\u0027t like it (obviously), and if they figure out you\u0027re doing it, they can ask you to not come back into their establishment.\u00A0\u00A0 Of course, if you are using a mechanical device to count cards, that is illegal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother edge players can get is in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09601\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eroulette\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 With long, tedious, and very careful study of the history of a particular wheel, you can discern if it has any biases.\u00A0 If you find a wheel that has a bias, then you can alter your bets to reflect that bias, and potentionally gain an advantage.\u00A0 It is not a practical solution, as it requires tens of thousands of spins to generate a decent history, enough to show a discernible bias (think detecting the Higgs), and again, you\u0027ll have to record the data by hand, and a casino will probably kick you out for sitting there for a months or years writing down the results in a notebook, and then change the wheel out, ruining all your work.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 It is also possible to calculate the probable outcome of a spin, if you know the starting conditions of the wheel (see the previously linked reference).\u00A0 But again, it\u0027s not very practical without mechanical/electronic tools to crunch the numbers fast enough to alter your bet. \u00A0\u00A0 Of course, having the wheel on a said river boat or cruise boat, the random action of the water would probably have enough effect to completely negate any advantage you could obtain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are only a few casino \u0027games\u0027 where you can legitimately regularly have an edge.\u00A0 These would be Sports Betting, Horse Betting (other forms of track betting too) and \u0027zero sum\u0027 games against fellow players. \u00A0 In both the Sports book and Horse racing, the odds are set by humans, and those humans (with or without the help of computers) have to study the various teams/entrants, and compute all the data to present odds to offer to the player.\u00A0\u00A0 A player has to do the same research, and come up with their own conclusions.\u00A0 If the player thinks an odds line is far enough away from where it should be, they can make a bet to maximize their return.\u00A0 That\u0027s one of the reasons why you will see an odds line change after a sports book has starting taking bets, if they are made aware that they might be wrong, they can change the odds they are offering to reflect this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other scenario is zero sum games, like poker, as they are played against fellow players, and not the house.\u00A0 While the house will take a % of each hand usually (or hourly, or whatever), a skilled player can earn enough off the other players to earn back the house rake they have paid out, and have a decent return on their time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EHopefully this post hasn\u0027t violated any forum rules, as I am

Under parimutuel betting (common at horse and dog tracks), the listed odds are not fixed. What is fixed is the percentage of the total take that will go to each winning bet (win/place/show/exacta/trifecta, etc.). As more money gets bet on favorites, the payout gets smaller so that the total amount that will get paid out remains at the correct fixed percentage of the total take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith bookmaking, the bookies try to do approximately the same thing by setting odds that they think will end up with one side of the betting covering the other side, leaving them with their rake-off. But unlike a horse track, if they guess wrong about where bettors want to put their money then the bookies can end up holding one side of the bet themselves. So typically as money builds up on one side of the book, the bookies change the odds to encourage it getting balanced out. However, each bettor gets the odds that were in place when the bet was made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat many people overlook when they talk about the betting line is that the bookies are not really setting a line for how they think the odds in the sports event are split. They are really setting a line for they they think the money that will be bet on the sports event is split. If everyone was rational and had access to the same information, then in theory this distinction would be irrelevant. But in practice, the bookies have to understand which teams are (possibly irrationally) favored or disliked by the betting public and adjust their odds according to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnnyc","CreatedById":177387,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-05T18:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should read what if? by Randall Munroe It\u0027s full of absurd questions and scientific answers.

ceramic tile\u00A0array for superior armor protection. Think of composite armor on a tank, but on a smaller scale. Three layers of tesselated hexagonal tiles, staggered in a triangular pattern, with each layer separated/bound/encased by a kevlar-impregnated rubber, backed by a kevlar spall layer. I\u0027m not sure how much more effective it\u0027d be than existing AR-500 steel plates backed by kevlar, or if it\u0027d be lighter, but it\u0027d possibly be more flexible than the steel plate setup. Not sure if it\u0027d be worth the tradeoff of possibly reduced protection. And the major downside of the ceramic tile concept compared to the steel plate system would be a noticeable reduction in protection if hit on the same tile as a previous shot, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
