I\u0027ve also tweaked the configs slightly to get a performance level similar to what it was in 0.90, which is probably still overpowered. The only issue I\u0027m having with the updated Ariane 5 is the emissives. When I use the MBM textures in my 0.90 install the emissives work as expected, but the behavior isn\u0027t quite what I was expecting. In 1.0.2 the SRB nozzles will begin to glow near the end of their burn where they would begin to glow much earlier in the burn in 0.90, while the Vulcain and Upper Stage engines do not glow at all. All the emissive textures are where they should be and oriented correctly, the emissive animation module is defined correctly in the configs. Since the SRB nozzle does glow eventually I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a texture issue, but an animation, or temperature issue. I\u0027m thinking that I need to re-do the animation curve, but I\u0027m not sure."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:36:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Didn\u0027t even know that, it\u0027s not the actual description ingame.\n\u003E Also, I figured that would make sense.
