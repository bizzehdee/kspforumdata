I have one ship orbiting Kerbin. It has returned from a long journey and I want to land it, but I forgot to put enough parachutes. So I made another ship with a lot of parachutes and a claw, lunch it to orbit and made randezvous. But when I get closer to make docking I realized that the first ship is rotating when I rotate the ship I am currently controlling. It\u0027s like I am controlling both ships simultaneously.\n\nDid anyone faced with the same problem and maybe has workaround for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T11:58:40Z","Content":"I got the same problem once. I personally think it\u0027s a bug because when I redid the rendevouz operation, it didn\u0027t happen again."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T12:46:59Z","Content":"It is a known but rare bug.\n\nYou could ask in the support forum about it - I\u0027ve personally never seen it happen."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:14:23Z","Content":"Yes, it\u0027s happened to me in a similar situation in v90; a lander undocked from its Minmus orbiter, landed and returned, then both ships repsonded to control inputs. \n\nMy workaround was to get one ship oriented for docking, then disable its reaction wheels and turn off SAS. Then control the second ship and dock to the first."}]}
