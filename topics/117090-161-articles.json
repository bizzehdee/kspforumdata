In fact I would put support beams on all of them. If I can suggest, It would be nice to have exagonal beams around tunnels. Or even better,  just flat vertical beam, but more of them. Like one on each side of tunnel and few more of them depending of the size of the torus. It kinda make sense from a structural standpoint would be much more compact when folded. Technically cable would do sice the pressure inside the torrus would be enough to maintain most of the structural integrity. But that would not be nice or believable. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T17:55:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T19:01:22Z","Content":"![yW3nFdB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yW3nFdB.jpg)\n\nUsing [@cxg2827](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57380-cxg2827/)\u0027s excellent parts as an IVA analog again (I should have rotated them slightly so the floors were level)... The small torus has a fair bit of room. They would actually fit entirely inside the torus, they are stuck on the skin, so the torus looking smaller is perspective only.\n\nThe KHM-3-1 holds 2 crew, so there are 16 slots there. Each kerbal could get one as a room, and there is still room for a lab and a common area for meals. For reference, the stock MPL part is about 1.5X the length of those pods. So there is room for a lab, plus 6.5 of these habs. So your crew rating of 5 is very generous to them, they each get a room of their own, plus 1.5 of those as a common area, plus a lab.\n\nYou could have a crew of 6, and have 5 of these hab volumes available for common space, equipment/supplies, and a lab.

The stock mouse-driven system sucks, so I would not be using that system, and I have no clue how I\u0027d make a GUI that would be useful for procedural fairings.  The closest I may come to this would be some pre-built resizable fairing models; so like 3 different lengths with the width set through sliders/standard GUI controls.

Custom fairing panels not needed\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![88257.jpg](http://lowres-picturecabinet.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/43/main/9/88257.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nPossible, sure; see the MUS tanks... they have fairings at both ends.  Something I want to take the time to implement?  Not really; I cannot think of any good uses for it, nor is there any good method to determine when the fairing should be enabled/not enabled, nor any way to tell how tall the fairing should be.  Lower fairings are easy; they just snap to the bottom node of the part below;  that doesn\u0027t seem to be a good way to do it for the top fairings.  (MUS tanks use a special top-cap which tells me how tall the fairing needs to be, which is why they can be used there without these problems)\n\nWhat is the intended use-case for these?  I really can\u0027t think of any time you would want upper fairings unless you are trying to use them as some sort of procedural adapter?\n\nIn regards to your earlier request for more SC-A textures;  you can use the GIMP - .dds plugin to open them up; however they are spec-masked and there is no easy way to remove the spec mask/alpha channel that I\u0027ve found.  However, if you are truly interested, let me know and I can send you the original GIMP project files (4 in total, one for each part).\n\nI have nothing against more textures for it.... I\u0027m just not making textures at the moment / for the foreeseable future.  Thankfully it sounds like the wheel replacement system may finally be going somewhere/making progress... so I may be able to return to concentrating on SSTU before too much longer.\n\nIn other news I spent quite a bit of time yesterday working through how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS functions with all of its new... functions.  After a bit of reading it seems... casual enough... Its a fairly simple system even with the additions of hab-time.\n\nPut together some preliminary numbers for hab time, supplies qty, and recyclers setups for the DOS and COS modules.  Going to require quite a bit of patching to get the LS stuff in-place, as every single part is going to need its mass and containers adjusted in order to accommodate the mass and volume of the supplies (which do seem ridiculous; 16kg/day, for a kerbal? I may go through 2-3kg/day including water.... 16 seems... way too much).\n\nOn that note -- how many crew should a basic DOS station support?  It would be 6 modules with total crew capacity of 18 (3 seats per module), but I feel like the life-support should be geared for much lower optimal capacity (3-6 crew, 12 at the very high end)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-09T15:09:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think in part the issue is that it took a lot of time (probably 20 or 30 seconds for the parts that welded correctly) to \u0022meld together.\u0022   Since I was using MechJeb\u0027s docking assistant that may have had a part to play in the issue.

Design for effect, the actual utility is more important here.  \n\nThe real problem I\u0027ve had in designing plausible vehicles is the problem with hab multipliers, which make little sense to me. The idea is that working space (e.g., labs) give you some available space, hab modules give more more room to move (bonus kerbalmonths) and multipliers are supposed to be parts which give benefits throughout the whole ship. To give a far-future (slightly silly) example, a cinema or pub would give you a bonus throughout, not just for that module.\n\nFor a less far-future example, I think the toruses are more than reasonable to use as hab modifiers. Crews can rotate through the ship, so having work time spent in-gravity during transit is of great overall benefit to the crew. What values are given here are something quite different though.  \n\nThinking in terms of actual game effect, I don\u0027t think you should \\*need\\* artificial gravity for a Duna mission. It would be nice, and might be a really good idea, but I think you should be able to get by without. This is also a good reason to have torus parts above hab parts on the CTT, so you can slum it in a low tech manner.  \n\nDuna transit is less than 300 days, so that\u0027s a reasonable figure to aim at for a Deep Space Habitat-like vehicle (i.e., ISS Lab module, ISS docking nod, ISS hab/MPLM module \u002B propulsion bus, Orion and MMSEV). Architecture of this manner could keep a transit vehicle in-orbit and land the crew to an unmanned and previously deployed surface hab.  \n\nAnything beyond Duna should probably require artificial gravity. Checking out the Outer Planets mod, the extremes of the solar system (Neidon and Plock) are something like 23 and 35\u002B years to transit for a minimum energy transfer one way. Clearly then, a long term space habitat needs to end up with hab time approaching 50-100 years. That might be with a minimum crew (probably 4 or 6, since 2x Scientists, 1x Pilot, 1x Engineer seems sensible as crew minimum in most cases in KSP, but there are arguments for more especially with mission involving ISRU or other base parts. If I recall correctly, UKS does model \u0022unhappiness\u0022 in the form of inefficiency for fewer than five kerbals at a Kolony, which may or may not be a consideration).  \n\nSo, just throwing some arbitrary numbers out for the extreme end of things:  \n\n30 man torus for a 6 crew long (really long) duration mission would have:  \n\n(30 \u002B Bonus Kerbal months) \\* Multiplier / Crew  \n\nWithout bonuses, hab time is 150 days per crew member.  \n\nAssuming a bonus of 200 kerbal months (one KM per seat means this is \u002B170) and a crew of six, that\u0027s:  \n\n30 \u002B 170 \\* Multiplier / 6  \n\nUsing a **Multiplier of 30 and bonus of 200 Kerbalmonths** here would allow for the largest torus to support hab time for six crew for about 70 years. That seems reasonable to me as a top-end \u0022permanent\u0022 habitat, and is within reason for an interstellar flight (therefore a decent practical endgame limit for KSP). Certainly fine for pootling around the solar system."},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T01:04:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In regards to your earlier request for more SC-A textures;  you can use the GIMP - .dds plugin to open them up; however they are spec-masked and there is no easy way to remove the spec mask/alpha channel that I\u0027ve found.

I took this up in the USILS thread when it first came up, largely because the suggested hab multiplier is the *mass* for a part like the cupola. You could make a part with a single window (thick, leaded glass) and the entire thing is made out of lead, and that sucker multiplies habitation by its mass. Crew of 30, and 1 really overbuilt window can do what you like... how about a 10-ton porthole! 10X hab multiplier! Or, you know, spam cupolas.\n\nIf the large torus used its mass as a hab multiplier, lol.
