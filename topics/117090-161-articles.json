Design for effect,\u00A0the actual utility\u00A0is more important here.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe real problem I\u0027ve had in designing plausible vehicles is the problem with hab multipliers, which make little sense to me. The idea is that working space (e.g., labs) give you some available space, hab modules give more more room to move (bonus kerbalmonths) and multipliers are supposed to be parts which give benefits throughout the whole ship. To give a far-future (slightly\u00A0silly) example, a cinema or pub would give you a bonus throughout, not just for that module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a less far-future example, I think the toruses are more than reasonable to use as hab modifiers. Crews can rotate through the ship, so having work time\u00A0spent in-gravity during transit is of great overall benefit to the crew. What values are given here are something quite different though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThinking in terms of actual game effect, I don\u0027t think you should *need* artificial gravity for a Duna mission. It would be nice, and might be a really good idea, but I think you should be able to get by\u00A0without. This is also a good reason to have torus parts above hab parts on the CTT, so you can slum it in a low tech manner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuna transit is less than\u00A0300 days, so that\u0027s a reasonable figure to aim at for a Deep Space Habitat-like vehicle (i.e., ISS Lab module, ISS docking nod, ISS hab/MPLM module \u002B propulsion bus, Orion and MMSEV). Architecture of this manner could keep a transit vehicle in-orbit and land the crew to an unmanned and previously deployed surface hab.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnything beyond Duna should probably require artificial gravity. Checking out the Outer Planets mod, the extremes of the solar system (Neidon and Plock) are something like 23 and 35\u002B years to transit for a minimum energy transfer one way. Clearly then, a long term space habitat needs to end up with hab time approaching 50-100 years. That might be with a minimum crew (probably 4 or 6, since 2x Scientists, 1x Pilot, 1x Engineer seems sensible as crew minimum in most cases in KSP, but there are arguments for more\u00A0especially with mission involving ISRU or other base parts. If I recall correctly,\u00A0UKS does model \u0022unhappiness\u0022 in the form of inefficiency\u00A0for fewer than five kerbals at a Kolony, which may or may not be a consideration).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, just throwing some arbitrary\u00A0numbers out for the extreme end of things:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30 man torus for a 6 crew long (really long) duration mission would have:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(30 \u002B Bonus Kerbal months) * Multiplier / Crew\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout bonuses, hab time is 150 days per crew member.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssuming a bonus of 200 kerbal months (one KM per seat means this is \u002B170) and a crew of six, that\u0027s:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30 \u002B 170 * Multiplier / 6\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing a \u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplier of 30 and bonus of\u00A0200 Kerbalmonths\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0here would allow for the largest torus to support hab time for six crew for about\u00A070 years. That seems reasonable to me as a top-end \u0022permanent\u0022\u00A0habitat, and is within reason for an\u00A0interstellar flight (therefore a decent\u00A0practical endgame\u00A0limit for KSP).
