Basically, the claim was that, despite the fact that energy densities are small and velocities are non-relativistic, the Newtonian approximation was invalid because the total mass/angular momentum of the galaxy was not small and the non-linearities in the Einstein field equations add up to a total result that differs significantly from the Newtonian one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe talk involved using a specific form of the metric to recompute mass distributions based on measured rotation curves for spiral galaxies, and found no need for a Dark Matter halo to explain the rotation curves. If this result holds up, it\u0027s rather a big deal, since rotation curves are one of the main reasons we came up with Dark Matter in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, rotation curves are independent of lensing results such as the bullet cluster; however, it\u0027s interesting to note that we \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E use a Newtonian approximation to compute mass estimates from lensing results, so non-linear effects might be just as important here as they are in rotation curves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, since that conference, I\u0027ve taken a deeper look at the papers upon which the talk was based, and have identified at least one potentially fatal flaw - the density profile chosen for the model has a gradient discontinuity across the z=0 plane which results in the model failing to satisfy the Einstein equations on that plane (the model assumes a dust distribution for matter, but on the z=0 plane there is a delta-function term which appears in at least one of the pressure components of the stress tensor). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis flaw means that without further support for the model (such as a numerical relativity computation) I no longer trust the derived density profiles; however, the existence of this flaw doesn\u0027t change the main point of the paper, which is that neglecting the non-linearities of the Einstein equations by using a Newtonian gravity approximation for galaxies is probably a bad idea. As a result, the support for the existence of Dark Matter may be a lot less strong than we think it is. (There is still a third pillar of support for Dark Matter coming from CMB anisotropy measurements, and that support is presumably independent of the issues raised here, but when you kick two legs out from under a tripod it\u0027s understandable if the tripod begins to wobble a little.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The original paper upon which the talk was based may be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507619\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E; see also more recent work by the same authors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T07:43:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 07:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T07:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say \u0022Newtonian,\u0022 do you mean pure Newtonian, or something along the lines of linearized gravity?

To quote from his 2007 paper: \u0022It has been known since the time of Eddington that the gravitationally bound problem in general relativity is an intrinsically nonlinear problem even when the conditions are such that the field is weak and the motions are non-relativistic, at least in the time-dependent case. Most significantly, we have found that under these conditions, the general relativistic analysis of the problem is also nonlinear for the stationary (non-time-dependent) case at hand.
