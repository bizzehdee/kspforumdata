While unfocused the flight crossed an SOI boundary thus completing a\u00A0objective. Good deal 1.1 fixed that bug from 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here\u0027s the bug. That flight is now splashed down on Kerbin. If I recover the\u00A0flight the game doesn\u0027t crash or freeze, but does go unresponsive. I can click on buttons all I want, but nothing happens. Even the esc menu is unresponsive. I have to alt-tab out of the game and close the app manually at this point. The only thing that flight did different from the others is crossing that SOI boundary, and completing objectives, while unfocused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
