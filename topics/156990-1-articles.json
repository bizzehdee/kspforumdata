The communotron 16 series (both types) have 500,000 antenna power; the HG-5 series has 5,000,000 antenna power. Unfortunately the combinability exponent for them isn\u0027t documented anywhere I know of (because that would be too useful, apparently), so I\u0027m just gonna guess 0.75, because that\u0027s the number quoted for the 88-88. That would put a craft with three HG-5\u0027s at just under 11,400,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSQRT(500,000 * 11,400,000) = just under 2,400,000 meters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the combinability exponent was 1.00:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSQRT(500,000 * 15,000,000) = just under 2,750,000 meters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe distance between Kerbin and the Mun is 12,000,000 meters. In other words: you don\u0027t have enough range. Not nearly enough. If the vessel in orbit of the Mun had three HG-5\u0027s as well, then it would be enough - barely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom looking at your screenshot, you were working with the assumption of 500,000,000 range for a single HG-5, and 158,000,000 for a single communotron-16. However, those numbers are only for direct communication with the tracking station. They are precalculated numbers for your convenience, using the antenna power of the tracking station and the antenna power of the antenna in question in the above-mentioned square root formula, so you don\u0027t have to calculate it yourself everytime you build a vessel. But for going from one vessel to another, you must use the antenna powers of those vessels. The tracking station is not involved at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpgrading your tracking station does not magically make your onboard antennas better! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E It only lets the tracking station itself reach them at longer distances, not other vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-26T10:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2017 10:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biggen","CreatedById":173719,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T12:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149099-commnet-signal-strength-calculator-antenna-selector/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will tell you what range you can expect to get out of every antenna in the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
