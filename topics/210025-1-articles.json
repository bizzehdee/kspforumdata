No power = no control, make sure you have batteries and some form of power generation (solar panels, fuel cells or RTGs) to keep them charged up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGot command? If you have CommNet switched on, you\u0027ll need a signal back to a ground station on Kerbin to have full control. A few different settings can affect this- enabling extra ground stations makes it much easier to have a signal, while enabling \u0022require signal for control\u0022 means you need a signal or nothing will work at all. Make sure you have an antenna powerful enough to reach back to Kerbin and a line of sight to one of the ground stations, which may require a relay satellite of some sort to cover the blind spots in low Kerbin orbit or when other bodies are between your vessel and Kerbin. You can turn CommNet off and ignore this problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs the probe core on hibernate mode? This disables control to save power, make sure it\u0027s not hibernating when you want to use it; it\u0027s a good idea to enable \u0022hibernate in warp\u0022 mode on every probe core you use as hibernation saves a lot of power.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magicpinch","CreatedById":223268,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-13T02:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see a lot of useful information.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
