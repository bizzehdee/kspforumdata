It just says \u0027save incompatible\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only solution I found after searching the forums is opening the save folder, renaming my latest manual save to \u0027persistent.sfs\u0027 and it suddenly sees no problems at all and loads fine.... until I save again, leave the game and try reloading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile this is a temporary sollution I would like to fix this.
