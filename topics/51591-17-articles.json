In the AntennaRange folder, create a new file in your favourite text editor (Notepad or something) and call it NAU_for_AntennaRange.cfg. Technically you can name it anything you like, but this should ensure that you remember exactly what it is. Then grab a copy of the file here, and then paste it into your new .cfg file (make sure the extension stays .cfg and : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/dbHHjxXQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/dbHHjxXQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave your file, and then everything should be working perfectly!
