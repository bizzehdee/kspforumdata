Right now, a plane ticket for me, based on the projected 650E/kg is 34450$, because I weigh about 117 pounds, or 53 kilos (and converting euros to dollars). And that is just a Skylon space ticket. Based on chair standards, an optimal person\u0027s sitting position is 4.4 feet tall and 3.08 feet wide from the facial view, and about 1.3 feet from the side view. Using these values we can infer that one person takes up about 17.6 feet cubed of space (check the maths please, I haven\u0027t taken geometry yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) Obviously this is just a calculation, that if we were going to put a person in the cockpit, that is the maximum amount of space we would need. Moving on, if we were to squeeze as many people from left to right inside the cargo bay of the Skylon, we could fit about 3 people from left to right using optimal spacing, though it might be a small squeeze. Now, since the average person weighs roughly 83(ish) kilos, it would be 251 kilos with all three, average weight people. The water the people to need for 3 weeks is as follows: 2.2L per person per day X 3 people X 7 days a week X 3 weeks = 138.6 liters =138.6 kilograms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo up to this point we have found out that one person with plenty of space around them takes up a volume of about 17.6 ft cubed, and you can most likely fit 3 people from left to right inside the cargo bay. These 3 people would weigh approximately 251 kilograms, along with 138.6 kilograms for water needed for the people to drink (excluding food.) So, for just the people it would weigh about 389.6 kilos or 0.3 metric tonnes. We are looking good so far yes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a few more calculations. Let\u0027s say we have about 12 tons of vehicle, just putting it out there, for everything, life support, engines, food, water, and other electronic and measurement utilities needed for space travel. 12.3 tons for 3 people in one very light spacecraft. So using your estimates, we will say that there is a VASIMR engine powering our amazing future spacecraft. The weight of the spacecraft is 12.3 tons fuelled and 12 tons empty and the Specific Impulse of a VASIMR is let\u0027s say 8,000 at medium operating thrust. So, let\u0027s use the Delta-V equation to find out the Delta V of our spaceship, using 300 kg of fuel. So, after some calculator tinkering our good value is, well a whopping 197.5 m/s of delta V. Let\u0027s trade the tonnage for fuel, let\u0027s say that the starting weight is 12.3 and the empty weight is 10.4. Much better, about 1342.34 m/s of Delta-V. Thats with about 15% of the mass of the spacecraft being fuel. Perhaps the argon is in it\u0027s liquid state to conserve volume, or it is highly compressed to say that we are safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sadly, we don\u0027t really have an average percentage which tells us the average % of fuel mass out of the whole rocket, but this is a sophomore trying to do math soo, yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculations end up to be 12.3 ton vehicle, with optimum space for seating, compressed life support systems (to track with time), weight of water, fuel, etc. with 1.3 km/s of delta-v if my calculations are correct. I am stepping out on a limb here, maybe I forgot a value here and there but yes you have a wide, fuel efficient vehicle to get around in space in, and also a pretty hefty launch price of 8,585,400$ to launch your spacecraft, even with Skylon\u0027s boasted 868$/kg price tag. That\u0027s not including the cost of the spacecraft, which involves development and other factors that WE WILL NOT EVEN GUESS AT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it probably won\u0027t be you or I that comes even close to buying a spacecar, or spacecraft, in this case, but it will definitely be a helluvalot cheaper than it is today, which hopefully comes with the development of Skylon. If you would like to check my calculations or see what I missed, then please do, Im not very good at the maths XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T21:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, i like to think about it this way: in 20 or 30 years, we will have road cars capable of traveling as fast as a modern F1 car (assuming steady rate of tech advancement).
