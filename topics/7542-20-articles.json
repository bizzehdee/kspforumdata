KSPAction is just an attribute. KSP looks them up at runtime and uses them to create the Events (right click ui) / Actions (=\u0026gt; action groups) properties for your part module. You might be able to simply disable them, eg. on Awake of your module... and re-disable them every time ModuleScienceExperiment might activate them, again.
