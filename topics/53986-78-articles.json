The scale is 1:1. Just like the planets and orbits themselves. That is exactly what I\u0027m saying, that is what has been done with part packs all along. Now obviously stock KSP, KW, NP, AIES, and RLA which while may be loosely based upon something real, they are what we\u0027ll call the \u0027generic packs\u0027. Except for engines (which are sized and spec\u0027d as IRL), other parts are a generic lego-building block pieces to build rockets, which v6.0 and TweakScale make them even more so, w/o increasing part count. Have you not tried FASA, OLD, Lovad Saturn\u0027s...obviously not...full 1:1 scale. Now the top of the rockets exceed the VAB model, RSS tweaks the allowable space for parts so that it scrolls above the roof. Nope, no scaling, it\u0027s all 1:1, or as best as we can match because sometimes models in part packs are built with the 1.25, 2.5, 3.75 progression in mind, so that to mate one piece with another a different size it can get tricky or not real at all, but I\u0027m doing my best to ensure it is...The FASA Saturn V is likely within a few millimeters to centimeters of the real thing, both height and diameter of all parts. The OLDD Saturn V is a couple meters off due to some scaling issues with the model that DennyTX has offered to fix, just haven\u0027t gotten together yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T17:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to voice support for Agathorn\u0027s playstyle; I (currently) much prefer to find interesting solutions on my own, and play around with possibilities, rather than play RO/RSS as a history simulator, or restrict myself to RPL.

In my past experience with RO, \u0022done\u0022 really just meant things like pods, engines, batteries, solar panels. Things like Fuel Tanks were pretty much always skipped because it was assumed you were using Procedural Tanks. But bear in mind that my experience with RSS/RO is from its very earliest days, and before you came on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I should say is I like playing with realistic parts, not \u0022historic recreations\u0022 if that makes any sense. I don\u0027t need, nor necessarily want, an exact replica of the Saturn 5, or the J-2 engine, or what not. What I want is engines and parts that can be combined to build realistic looking and behaving rockets of my own design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really didn\u0027t know things were supposed to be exactly 1:1 scale. Did RSS/RO start out with a scale and then change to 1:1? I could have sworn it wasn\u0027t 1:1 before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day my eventual end game goal with KSP is to be able to build and play with rockets, satellites, space stations, rovers, etc that aren\u0027t necessarily reproductions of real ones, but ones that look like they could be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, knowing that things are supposed to be 1:1 scale lets me tweak things on my own so that\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW KSPI may be \u0022future tech\u0022 but its all based on real world science, or near future science on the books.

I am tempted to do another clean install and see if that fixes it, but not looking forward to it. Not exactly the easiest thing now that I have RO in a seperate install on my computer so Steam doesn\u0027t auto update it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T22:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beno\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AEt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beno\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AEt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreetings!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ELittle bug report\u003C/span\u003E: The Remote Tech 2 GigaDish2 called in R.O.
