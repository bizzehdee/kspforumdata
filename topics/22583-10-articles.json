With airbrakes on the back upper surface of the wing at a 30 or 45 degree angle, you\u0027d expect them to act as elevators, pitching up. Instead, they pitch the plane down (with FAR at least). I think this has to do with the fact the plugin works by altering the drag of the part, rather than taking into account the angle of deflection, like a control surface. The modeling could be more accurate if implemented as a control surface that toggles by action group instead of the usual attitude inputs. The verisimilitude could alternatively be improved by trickery with the model\u0027s scene coordinates so that it considers the part\u0027s forward direction to be perpendicular to the plate of the airbrake in the deployed position. However, I\u0027m not sure this method would account for Newton\u0027s 3rd law on the deflected air as the control surface method would.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
