Some parts do need stronger joints, but on average it\u0027s the opposite). Even with FAR I\u0027ve only had large rockets break in half from turning too hard and flipping as a result. However, the joints are too flexible. This allows them to bend, causing loss of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been said before in this thread, but since it\u0027s a third opinion, not agreeing with either side, no one even noticed it. Both sides are blaming each other for making invalid arguments while neither side actually seems to give the other opinion or the arguments supporting them much thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who support current joints basically say either that \u0022its teh kerbal way moar struts moar boosters\u0022 or that wobbly makes you try to make your design more efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Kerbal Way\u0022 argument is BS. Kerbals are excellent engineers, even though they like explosions a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more efficient design is a valid argument, however it is very restricting without procedural parts and also bigger parts. This does make 30 tons payload a fairly big one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who support stronger joints basically say that wobbly is unrealistic and more an annoyance than a challenge and ruins aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022More an annoyance than challenge\u0022 and the aesthetics part is something I have to, at least partially, disagree with. It is annoying, but it\u0027s a part of the challenge. You can make aesthetic rockets while being efficient. You can\u0027t expect to make replicas, however, unless we go procedural. As for realism, this is a completely valid point, but the fix for it is in the first paragraph. It\u0027s not the joint strenght that is bad, it\u0027s that it flexes instead of snapping. If that is fixed, it\u0027s actually more realistic to use many small tanks rather than one big one because then the rocket can snap in the middle of a tank, instead of at where a joint would realistically be, which is, well, realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, notice how I wrote all this without bringing up any new points. Every single thing I wrote has been written before in this thread (except for that snapping in the middle of a tank thing - that was in another flame war thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a total of 175 posts summed up in this post.

it wouldnt matter how strong that one dollop of weld is, it\u0027d still be unstable in that the parts would be liable to pivot around that point. even though the parts arent supposed to rotate from that point, they still do a little bit, but a little bit on several parts is enough to generate oscillation. the wobbliness has less to do with joint strength than it does with joint area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimagine 2 orange tanks snapped together. all the weight of the upper tank is resting on a single point, the snap point. but in real life, all that weight would either rest on the lower tank in a disk, a washer, or a hoop. all of these spread out the weight better and provide support on the outer edges of the parts that keep them from rotating about the center. instead, they have to rotate about the edge to rotate at all, which is harder to do than at the single point, because all around the joint it is solid. the parts push together on the side bending in, and pull apart on the side bending out, so you get this sort of double feedback lever that makes things harder to bend in the first place. this is much less wobbly than a joint of equal strength at a single point. i think the game mechanic finds it difficult to keep parts from bending at the single point joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso instead of using these point snaps, why not use disks or washers or hoops instead for snapping parts together? they are more realistic, and provide a larger surface area to spread weights over. parts snapped together would act more realistically, not wobbling about single points, but only about the edges of parts snapped together, like a real rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoing this might be difficult since it might make parts incompatible. so to ensure parts are compatible in the game at all times, i think only the option of disk or point joints be used. you could switch between the two for different purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese would make joints more stable perpendicular to the rockets acceleration, but not make them stronger parallel to it (so engineering skill is still needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat i\u0027d like to see to make joints STRONGER is some sort of girder/interstage/payload mount BUILDER (specifically for parts like adaptors, girders, etc, mostly i have the octagonal girder in mind, but of varying shapes, sizes, and strengths), so you could replace very unrealistic struts with you\u0027re own custom parts. this builder would calculate the strength of the part based on how you\u0027ve designed them (so you need engineering skill). this is where struts would come in. you use something like struts to make the girders, or use solid for interstages/adapters (but driving up the strength also drives up the weight). once the part was made, you could save it in-game as a single piece part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy not even go a step further? i saw one post mention that it\u0027s unrealistic to slap tanks of standard size together. this is true, and it drives up part count as well. so why not take a program along the lines of PartGen3.1 and make it part of in-game vanilla KSP? on top of the standard parts, you could design your own in game specified to your exact needs, but at the same time, calculates realistic weights and fuel amounts for your rocket (so you dont go all cheaty with it). it\u0027s already an application, why not incorporate it like sub assemblies was (which is bugged, btw, but whatevs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.neamerjell.com/projects/ksp/disablescaling1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022disablescaling1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall these solutions combined would both make KSP engineering more straight forward AND realistic. it would even increase creativity, if partgen were made part of vanilla ksp, people could make not just ships, but basic PARTS, and custom textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor people who bicker a lot over a small aspect of the game, all you guys are really saying is \u0022fix it or leave it\u0022. it does need to be fixed, but i dont think \u0022make the joints stronger\u0022 is in any way HOW it needs to be fixed, nor is it the only alternative to wobbly rockets. i think after 19 pages, there should have been more creative solutions than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justmeman117","CreatedById":84618,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T10:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*i forgot to mention the kerbal engineer mod, which also really outa be incorporated into vanilla ksp as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T10:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixes to the joint system were introduced in Unity and implemented in the game in 0.23.5, so I think this thread isn\u0027t all that relevant anymore \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T11:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJoint connections are much better in 0.23.5 even with the 3.75 and 5 meter Nova Punch mods.
