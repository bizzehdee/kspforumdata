Basicly i am trying to search for a formula with wich i can calculate the diffrence in separation distance between 2 objects every orbit cycle. This will be usefull for me when making synch communication\u00A0satellite orbits using the least amout of time and fuel. My guess this formula will include Ap-Pe of both objects and time\u00A0for one orbit. Maybe someone already has such\u00A0formula?\u00A0As for now i will continue searching...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T19:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVisual RemoteTech Planner\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T10:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you need an actual formula to calculate that on paper?
