I could set it to -69,105 in DRE code and the stock code would allow it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChutes vs Stock chute tolerances are exactly the same. By the time DRE is finished with them, they have a final maxTemp of 1150. The parachute temperature multiplier is currently 0.25 by default giving canopies a virtual maxTemp of 287.5. I\u0027m probably going to bump the multiplier up a bit to give canopies a virtual maxTemp corresponding to Nylon 6-6 which is a more heat resistant fabric and is often used in NASA\u0027s chutes. (Curiosity chutes were made of this; the lines were made of something stronger, I forget what). (it would be nice to grab the Real Chute material field and treat different canopies according to their material properties, but it\u0027s a tricky thing to deal with. Kevlar has a higher \u0027melting\u0027 point but is substantially weaker at high temperatures. All we really deal with right now is failure due to high temperatures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, yeah the *10 multiplier does make them more prone to destruction, but without the multiplier they become essentially invulnerable.
