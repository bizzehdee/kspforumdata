Could there be any problems if this mod was installed over low rez EVE or would it just correct itself manually? I also noticed that the orbital paths of the moons surrounding Jool show through the planet but I couldn\u0027t decide whether that was a sign that something was going wrong somewhere or a design choice since the planet has no solid surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of that the only thing I messed with was removing the Kerbals EVA suits etc, since I\u0027m using Greenskulls.

I can always try a re-install tomorrow anyway and trim the fat from some of the other mods somewhere if needs be too. I can see myself dropping a few of the regularly used mods to squeeze this in.
