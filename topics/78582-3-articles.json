Seeing how others use the Supernova gives me good feedback on what needs to be improved. Like for instance the FusionPellets resource to represent the fusion fuel used by the engine. It makes sense to have, but how do you actually make the stuff? Well, the Fuel Refinery in Multipurpose Colony Modules lets you make them, but that requires MKS/OKS as well as Multipurpose Colony Modules. But with a karbonite variant going into stock, it makes sense to include something in the mod, so time permitting, next update will have a processing unit for making fusion pellets from ore, minerals, and water, It will make glykerol (used by the liquid droplet radiator) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually do have plans to model the heat radiators from the Discovery II spacecraft. They will be the baseline radiators and for game play reasons won\u0027t require any glykerol coolant. But you\u0027ll need a dozen of them to cool the engine. Contrast that with the liquid droplet radiator, which slowly consumes glykerol, but you\u0027ll only need four of those to cool the Supernova.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who don\u0027t want the complexity of heat management, I\u0027ll have a debug menu to turn that game mechanic off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u0027m working on a Near Future Construction-compatible octo-truss that holds fusion pellets and glykerol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-13T14:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T15:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a look at what\u0027s coming up next (minus the heat animation and octo-truss tank with fusion pellets):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7MIaqIw.png\u0022 alt=\u00227MIaqIw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T07:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Angel-125/DSEV/releases/tag/v0.3.6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet the latest release here\u003C/a\u003E.

What you can do in IR is attach a washer to the cupola, attach a hitchhicker to serve as a hub, attach a rotatron to the bottom of the hitchicker, and continue to build out the spacecraft. The problem is that the cupola will spin freely and will end up rotated differently from the rest of the body. You\u0027d think that you could just rotate the cupola joint to match that of the main body, but it\u0027s not that simple.
