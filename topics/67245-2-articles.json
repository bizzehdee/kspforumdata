Both are on the to-do list, so we can be sure to get it... But it would be nicer not to go for more at the moment, better to complete features and details of the existing planets first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently Jool is the most interesting system in the game, so another gas giant would be really great...

Each of the current planets and moons have something unique about them that make them challenging with a couple of exceptions. I don\u0027t want a planet or planet \u002B moons that don\u0027t force me to change my design. For example, Pol and Bop are just a repeat of Minmus. Dres is no harder than Ike to reach and land. That makes them a tad less interesting to explore.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EExcept Pol and Bop don\u0027t have the easy-to-land-on flats of Minmus. And Dres may not be \u0022harder\u0022 than Ike to reach, but it\u0027s different with its inclined and somewhat eccentric orbit.
