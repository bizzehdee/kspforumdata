With some of my favorite mods installed (RealChutes, ProceduralFairings, KER, FAR \u0026 DRE), I was expecting some trouble but not total destruction due to my ignorance of re-entry methods.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTKHqfloB7Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nCurrently I am using the controls to hold the vehicle in a positive lift. The vehicle\u0027s COM should be offset from centre and provide some lift without the use of controls. Rolling is used for changing lift. And a little skip upward as the vehicle enters the heavy atmosphere to provide relief for the heatshield.\n\n[Plenty of my vehicles have had undesired stable trim attitudes resulting in non-recoverable situations](https://youtu.be/MTKHqfloB7Q?t=16m22s). Now I always seperate my command module.\n\nWill the kerbals now have less to worry about? As designs for Lunar fly-by and Lunar landing are initiated.\n\n The mod [Procedural Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676) looks like a good choice instead of using the stock engines and tanks that were used for my first low earth orbit in hard career mode.\n\nP.S. not sure if the Earth was a dark red place back in 1968"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T20:58:00Z","Content":"As far as I know most pods in RSS/RO ( your are playing with RO as well, yes? ) have an option for descent mode that moves the CoM. The FASA Apollo capsule flies like a dream. \n\nBallistic reentry 9 times out of 10 will kill your crew. However a skip isn\u0027t necessary coming from LEO, but you still want some lift to keep the pod in the upper atmosphere as long as possible so when you hit the thicker air your moving slower. \n\nKnowing this... I still had trouble last night getting the right reentry angle of 6.5 degrees. I dont know how to do this. All i know is trial and error with my periapsis until its where it needs to be to provide one skip when coming back from the moon. So... Is there anything I can do to get a reentry angle value? That\u0027d be great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T21:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"roosterr","CreatedById":61317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T07:30:20Z","Content":"Excellent point and experiment. Most folks dont realize that the Apollo command module did just as you describe. Its descent path had to be altered like a roller coaster as it reentered earths atmosphere, so it would have enough space to slow down to a reasonable speed without too many G\u0027s on the astronauts. So they did \u0022steer\u0022 the capsule with subtle rolls allowing the off-center COM to angle the heat shield in such a way to create lift, so it could rise and descend like a zig zag maneuver to bleed off speed. \n\nThey will likely do the same with the Orion capsule I imagine."}]}
