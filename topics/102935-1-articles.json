The vehicle\u0027s COM should be offset from centre and provide some lift without the use of controls. Rolling is used for changing lift.

However a skip isn\u0027t necessary coming from LEO, but you still want some lift to keep the pod in the upper atmosphere as long as possible so when you hit the thicker air your moving slower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing this... I still had trouble last night getting the right reentry angle of 6.5 degrees. I dont know how to do this. All i know is trial and error with my periapsis until its where it needs to be to provide one skip when coming back from the moon. So... Is there anything I can do to get a reentry angle value?

Most folks dont realize that the Apollo command module did just as you describe. Its descent path had to be altered like a roller coaster as it reentered earths atmosphere, so it would have enough space to slow down to a reasonable speed without too many G\u0027s on the astronauts. So they did \u0022steer\u0022 the capsule with subtle rolls allowing the off-center COM to angle the heat shield in such a way to create lift, so it could rise and descend like a zig zag maneuver to bleed off speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will likely do the same with the Orion capsule I imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
