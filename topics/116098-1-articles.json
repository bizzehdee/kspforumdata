If the satellite does not know it\u0027s own orientation in space relative to the Sun, Earth and other bodies, and comes upon a planet that might have an inclined orbit around the Sun, how does one figure out what is North and what is South?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe top and bottom of a body, well at least I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENorth and south can easily be defined by the axis of rotation.

I suppose, a planet with zero rotation can exist, but the odds are overwhelmingly against it.
