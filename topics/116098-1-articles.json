I guess Pluto probably has a magnetic core so they could have used a sensor for that to measure it, but what about planets that don\u0027t?

Sell left-handed screws for left-handed people.\n\nBut yeah. The only sensible definition for a planet is rotation based. I suppose, a planet with zero rotation can exist, but the odds are overwhelmingly against it. On the other hand, not all planets have magnetic poles, and some objects (planets among them?) can have large number of magnetic poles. Which makes any compass-based definition useless.\n\nOn that note, I wonder how feasible a Foucault compass would be. Naturally, it wouldn\u0027t be mechanical, but with optical gyros, you should be able to detect rotation precisely enough to tell which way the rotational north pole is."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T23:53:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [Quoth wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt)\n\u003E \u0022Note that there are two standard methods of specifying [axial] tilt.
