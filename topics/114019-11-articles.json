Gently (use caps lock and tap w repeatedly for gentler input) nose up to 35-45 degrees so that you keep accelerating. Then start nosing down gently around 8000 to try to get down to around 10-15 degrees by 12000. Then only climb as heating requires. Getting past 1000m/s between 12 and 13 km is aggressive but safe. If your altitude is less than 10 times your speed, you should be ok. Once up to 15000-16000 let it keep rising about 50-100 vertcal m/s until you\u0027re up to around 21000. Mach 2-3 below 2000 really chews through fuel but Mach 4\u002B above 22000 barely sips it. 0.1 per second per rapier at 1700\u002Bm/s over 20000m altitude is what the 40 minute planes have been doing. For as much wing area as you have, mid 1600\u0027s should be attainable. Above 24000-ish you\u0027re going to lose a lot of speed and below 20000, you\u0027ll lose a little and suffer excessive compression heating.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T21:49:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**"},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:28:30Z","Content":"yay!\n\n39:17 with 1 engine, and no quickloads except for when my computer crashed!\n\nalso, 50 units left... who thinks i can make it on 1 precooler and FL-t400? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Seeing those large square wing surfaces and yout 17-teens top speed made me think a significant improvement could be found through less overall lift (since, in a sense, lift and drag are closely related). I\u0027m not flying it right because the best I\u0027ve gotten has been about a 39:27 but I see my top speed is just a percent or so higher than yours. (this is in level flight. When set to prograde/full throttle from 21600, it\u0027ll get to around 1735 befor ethe atmosphere below 20000 starts slowing it down.) ![D3mjjgE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D3mjjgE.jpg)\n\nIf you want to play around with it, here\u0027s the craft file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/51x21s973odivnw/Retribution%20MkII.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/51x21s973odivnw/Retribution%20MkII.craft?dl=0) The way I like to do it is ignite at full throttle, let the engines spool up to 80\u002B kN, release the docking clamp, get off the runway at 150-ish, start climbing at 250-ish. I think my biggest time loss is that I\u0027d go really steep climb (65-70 degrees) to allow full throttle all the way up. This lets me start nosing down at 8000m and use the wing\u0027s G forces to stay below mach 3 until I level off around 14-15 km. And the 39:27 I hit with it was a night time landing with too early a descent. I\u0027ve set it up with drogue chutes. They\u0027re good up to about 550 m/s but I\u0027d recommend not popping them until the runway is less than 10-15m below. [edit to add: I also recommend setting the forward \u0022canard\u0022 elevons to pitch only, the rearmost elevons to roll only, and the elevon \u0022wings\u0022 to no control reaction. In pilot assistant, it also helps if the vertical speed scalar is bumped up a little (1.3-ish). I was seeing some slight oscillations at 4x accel otherwise.]\n\nThe difference in top speed might buy you another 3-4 seconds, all other things being equal. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMy personal best is in a 3 engined craft cruising at 1727. I set it down safely in 39:17 but by that point, the 39 barrier had been broken. And because it\u0027s really unstable (too much pitch authority) I haven\u0027t been inspired to try it too much more. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T05:00:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 05:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**"},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T10:09:46Z","Content":"interesting!\n\ni\u0027l have to check this out! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T10:23:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yay!\n\u003E 39:17 with 1 engine, and no quickloads except for when my computer crashed!\n\u003E \n\u003E also, 50 units left... who thinks i can make it on 1 precooler and FL-t400? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/B6Bh9](http://imgur.com/a/B6Bh9)\n\u003E \n\u003E i\u0027ll be back ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nWHOA LOOK AT THE ORANGE!\n\nCertainly an interesting idea you\u0027ve got here!
