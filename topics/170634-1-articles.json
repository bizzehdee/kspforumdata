I built many rockets in the last few months\u00A0with no issues but something happened yesterday night that left me puzzled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a tiny plane with two small rocket engine that has 3600 delta-v and a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of around 0.7. The plane slowly climb up to around 60 000 meters, reaching\u00A0a speed of 900 m/s\u00A0 ...then\u00A0run out of fuel. Before someone ask, the Delta V calculation for the plane is provided by Engineering Redux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is ... what is the difference in the Delta-V budget between a standard rocket and a plane (using rocket engines)?\u00A0How come a plane cannot do it even though it has more delta v than necessary? It\u0027s probably something related to air friction on the wings or something but cannot put my finger on it.I am missing something but I am pretty sure that someone here can explain that to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys, this forum is awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T20:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Frag2000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-08T21:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch profile, the path your craft takes to space, matters a lot. If you could fly your plane up to 7000 m and then expend all of that 3600 m/s at once, you\u0027d suddenly have a plane going ~3600\u00A0m/s---\u003Cem\u003Ein the atmosphere\u003C/em\u003E. Drag would hit it like a brick wall, and it would rapidly slow down to just a few hundred m/s, if it didn\u0027t burn up first. All that delta v would be lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you climb slowly, then the same thing happens in slow motion. You\u0027re expending fuel just to stay at or near terminal velocity over a longer period than is necessary for an equivalent gravity-turn launch. This is why a successful spaceplane design generally uses jet engines to get out of the lower atmosphere; they\u0027re a lot more efficient than rockets when there\u0027s air in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-08T21:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223289744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170634\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518122240\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022173192\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frag2000\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Frag2000 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is ... what is the difference in the Delta-V budget between a standard rocket and a plane (using rocket engines)?\u00A0How come a plane cannot do it even though it has more delta v than necessary?

If you\u0027re really good you can get to orbit with a good deal less than that (3100 is doable), if you\u0027re not so good or your craft are not so optimal for whatever reason, you can easily burn 4000 without doing anything\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing with getting into Kerbin orbit, is you have to beat two forces: gravity and drag. If you have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1 and are going straight up, you\u0027ll never get to orbit: all the fuel you burn will be lost to gravity. Similarly, if your drag is exactly equal to your thrust, you\u0027ll spend all your fuel fighting it without ever going any faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to answer your question, your problem is the low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and shallow climb: you\u0027re burning most of your fuel pushing against air rather than accelerating your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, the a well-made rocket-powered spaceplane can get to orbit with about the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E as a well-made rocket. You lose some more to air resistance because you\u0027re spending a bit more time in the lower atmosphere, but you lose a little less to gravity because your wings are producing lift and you\u0027re accelerating the craft, and you win back a bit more by getting away with a lower starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E -- 1.0 isn\u0027t enough for a rocket, but it is enough for a rocket-powered plane. You probably shouldn\u0027t go much below that though -- I have flown some that start out as low as 0.85 but that\u0027s really pushing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fly a rocket plane to orbit, take off, point it up at 45 degrees, and when you hit 10 km and 500 m/s, follow prograde: from there on out you\u0027ll be on the same vector as a rocket on a gravity turn. If your rocket plane doesn\u0027t have enough power to fly up at 45 degrees immediately after take-off (it\u0027s okay if it doesn\u0027t accelerate in the beginning, it will a bit later), add more engines or remove some mass or improve its aerodynamic efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T21:55:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frag2000","CreatedById":173192,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-09T04:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery strong answers guys, it really\u00A0helped a lot!
