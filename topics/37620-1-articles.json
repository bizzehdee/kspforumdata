Once you finished equipping the outside you switched to the \u0027inside\u0027 and started programming with a variety of wires and analog and logical switches to give it a basic intelligence. Once you released your rover in the arena all you could do was wait and see if your rover was capable of surviving or winning. I lost countless hours of sleep either building and programming or tossing and turning in bed trying to figure out a better strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003EEdit: Forgot to mention it also had, just like KSP, great mods and community.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, Mindrover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember it well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, it is no more.
