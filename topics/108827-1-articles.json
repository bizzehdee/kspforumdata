Now whenever I log in, I just get a kind of map view of deep space, no planets, sun, or anything it seems. This is *such* a bummer, I was just starting to get interplanetary contracts. Unfortunately I never backed up the save file, which I usually do at least once a week or so, but never done it in 1.0, and now I\u0027m really regretting it. \n\nI hope there\u0027s a way to fix this, and I really appreciate anyone who\u0027ll take a few minutes to reply, thanks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve fixed it, thanks for all of the replies though. I really appreciate it. One of two things ended up fixing it, I went through my career save (called Eeloo Or Bust) and simply removed all NaNs (not a number) and replaced with reasonable velocities/ coordinates. It also could have just been closing KSP and opening again, I done both at the same time so don\u0027t really know which fixed it, it was most likely removing NaNs but I can\u0027t say for sure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T15:01:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ActuallyImad**\n  \nFixed"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:52:53Z","Content":"if you were playing Stock without mods, you might want to contribute your case to the Support-Team.\n\nI never had that happen to myself, sorry ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:53:13Z","Content":"I had a similar problem.
