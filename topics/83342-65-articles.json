I am planning on changing how orbital simulations work to a method where you never spend \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E time on the launchpad, so changing the delay option doesn\u0027t make sense when it\u0027s about to be removed. I\u0027d also like a fix for antennas breaking, but that\u0027s more of a RemoteTech issue with them not checking if the vessel is packed when it\u0027s moved to orbit. When I implement the new simulation method then that should be fixed since there won\u0027t be a move at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T16:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know what you mean by \u0022Reset to Space Center function\u0022. The only way to disable the chance that a part won\u0027t be added to the inventory if it recovers at a speed percent less than 100% is to alter the StageRecovery settings to remove the \u0022soft\u0022 region between the low and high cutoff velocities (or just switch to the flat rate model, which is the same thing). It\u0027s only a random chance between the low cutoff and the high cutoff velocities, so as long as you make sure the stage will land at a velocity lower than the low cut off (which you can check in the editor with StageRecovery) then you\u0027re guaranteed that the part will still be added to the inventory. That\u0027s a function of planning rather than random number, the random number just acts to fill the void left by the fact that the part inventory is quantized and you can\u0027t add half a part and you can\u0027t track damage on a part.\u003Cp\u003EDisabling the time requirements for tech is very easy.
