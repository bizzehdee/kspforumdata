We\u0027ll assume for the sake of convenience that the origin and destination orbits are circular, or close enough to circular for required adjustments to be negligible.

Once you\u0027ve done that, take half of that orbit\u0027s period, since that will be the amount of time it will take for your craft to travel from one apsis to the other. With that, you\u0027ll want to figure out the length of the arc the target craft travels in its orbit in the same amount of time. You can do this by dividing the half-period of the transfer orbit by the period of the destination orbit; the ratio between the two will be the fraction of the orbit\u0027s radius that the target craft travels in that time. Convert that ratio to degrees, and you\u0027ll have the phase angle you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One of my peers has also let me know that he\u0027s posted \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66508-The-KSP-equation?p=916182\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post916182\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis handy equation\u003C/a\u003E that boils all of what I\u0027ve said down into a single formula.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-07T03:07:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2014 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T03:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sodra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sodra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know I could do it with maneuver nodes, but doing it by hand it more fun to me.\u003Cp\u003EPlus I can do a more accurate rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t notice much if any accuracy improvement. First off, there\u0027s nothing at all in the stock game that measures the angle between planets so if all you know is the phase angle, you\u0027ll just have to eyeball it in the map view, which isn\u0027t conducive to accuracy. To make the phase angle useful, you have to know what day the planets will line up, so you can warp time forward however many months until that day arrives. OK, that\u0027s as good as you can get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then there\u0027s also the question of ejection angle, meaning where on your starting orbit you need to place the maneuver node. While you can calculate this angle as well, there is still absolutely nothing in the stock game that measures this angle, so you just have to eyeball it, which again destroys accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to avoid the inaccuracies of eyeballing angles is to use mods. Protractor measures angles so you can use it for both phase and ejection angles. Kerbal Alarm Clock knows what days the phases angles for various transfers come up and will stop the clock at them but it\u0027s only good for the phase angle. MechJeb will plunk down a maneuver node for you at the correct ejection angle on the proper day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T04:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really need to get to putting together my big video series on Orbital Mechanics - this similar question has come up a lot lately...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, some call it \u0022Phase Angle\u0022 and such, but what you are simply looking for is the portion of the Target\u0027s Orbit that will be completed when you are on you Hohmann Transfer Orbit.
