I\u0027ve been considering hacking some parts like that together using parts from other mods. As I have no idea how to create new models or parts from scratch, I was just gonna add modules to other parts to make them fulfill that functionality. But If you were to do it, It\u0027d be so much better. Another component to the same idea that would make it more realistic would be making the engines dependent on a external reactor part. I wouldn\u0027t expect you to make those new parts, so maybe there could be optional 3rd party support for like Near Future Electrical, and the aero nuclear engines would have to be dependent on heat from the reactor if that extra was enabled. The same could be done for standard non atmospheric nuclear engines. This would essentially turn what are now nuclear engines into just nozzles, with the the reactor actually doing the work.
