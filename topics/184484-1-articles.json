One of my favorite spacecrafts is Sputnik - 1, but I can\u0027t, first of all, the antennas are too short and the wrong color, also, the the unmanned command pod that is supposed to represent Sputnik has that thing at the bottom of it where you attach it, I want to be able to decouple it like you can with the Russian capsules. Plus I want parts that can recreate the N1, it\u0027s a cool rocket and I want to be able to make it easier. I really want them to fix this in Breaking grounds or future updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-14T12:13:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2019 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by VictoryNeverFail\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMisspelled\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-14T12:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlenty of mods add real life rockets and to be frank, we have enough redundant parts as is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine any historical part that got left out moat likely has a suitable stand in already in KSP like the antennas you mention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we really need a silver version just so we can do a faithful Sputnik?
