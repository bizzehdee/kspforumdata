I don\u0027t know precisely what are the maximum speeds for each parts, but for example radial intake has quite big strenght (i think it was 80?) and can jump around at quite higher speeds than normal parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe structural pylon part has strength of 999 and I\u0027ve had it survive crashes at 200m/s\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one interesting thing about \u0022splashdowns\u0022 is that they occur only when the part enters the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf for example we got a part half or fully submerged at low speed, we can then accelerate to whatever speed we can and not encounter splashdowns at all. Although if the part in question would jump out of the water just for a second it would splashdown when returning to it.

The trick is to pick the right parts at the ship\u0027s water line so the whole part stays partially submerged, and be sure that the whole ship is stable enough so it doesn\u0027t make that part\u0027s fully surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T05:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadial intakes I believe have a large impact tolerance too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T05:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep yourself around 5 m/s to make sure that the craft will splash down in one piece, no matter how big it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
