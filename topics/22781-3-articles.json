One thing that KerbCam does when changing the camera to be relative-to an object is reparent the flight camera to that object.

I\u0027m beginning to wonder if a rewrite is in order, but I\u0027m not sure if I have the time or inclination to undertake that effort. My previous efforts at fixing/feature-adding to KerbCam have often taken many times longer than I anticipated, owing to a combination of factors, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Meddling with KSP\u0027s internals in ways that they are not suited to be meddled with (i.e messing with the cameras) often leads to subtle and hard to reproduce bugs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Lack of documentation on KSP\u0027s APIs is a pain, but understandable. Failing that I could use an up-to-date version of the public/protected class metadata for searching across.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Debugging the mod is difficult, in that stack traces don\u0027t contain line numbers, and I have been unable to attach a debugger to the KSP process at anything other than a assembly-language level (i.e not a Mono/.NET level). (I can imagine that even if this were possible, the KSP developers wouldn\u0027t be too happy about the internals being reverse-engineered to that degree - which would be fair)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Due to a lack of debugger, the only other alternative is to introduce logging statements to attempt to discover more about a problem, which means recompiling the mod. To introduce a newly compiled version of the mod means a complete KSP restart, which takes upwards of a minute or two to get back to a testable position. This gets frustrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I suck at coding in C# (this is the only codebase that I work on that is in C# or .NET).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I also suck at making GUIs.
