It\u0027s much easier this way. The missions are way more profitable now and getting science points/ unlocking nodes\u00A0 isn\u0027t an issue any more. I think putting the science slider on 10% and the reward slider on 20% would be a perfect way of stretching the career experience. This way, I\u0027m are \u0022forced\u0022 to do science on other bodies other than the Mun, Miinmus and Ike/Gilly, which, on hard mode, contain more than enough science points to unlock the complete tech tree, even without the use of the science lab. Also, playing with a tight budget forces me to rethink my designs, which is always a nice puzzle. I know this grindy kind of gameplay isn\u0027t exactly mainstream, but I love it hehe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T16:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30/30 is rather easy. \u00A0I suspect 10% science 30% funds is a little more grindy and the jump from high orbit to Mun flyby can be pretty tricky with any science gear. \u00A0By the time you get to 10% science 10% funds my best missions barely pay back 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some tips you may not have thought of\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0Everything must be 100% reusable. \u00A0First stage lifter should be a LFO reliant with parachutes and 1800-2000 dv. \u00A0This allows a nice high AP so you can get the next stage safe and recover the first stage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
