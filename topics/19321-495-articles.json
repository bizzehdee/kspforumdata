I did read the wiki but didn\u0027t notice anything about having to press Calculate Stability Derivatives in order to display the information, when I do that the graphs populate correctly. Which is actually a bit depressing as I was really hoping that the problems I\u0027m having with this plane were at least in part due to a dodgy FAR installation and it seems like that might not be the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m left still not understanding what\u0027s going on with this plane. It\u0027s a very conventional light jet design but the behaviour is just bizarre. In straight and level flight rolling left or right causes to nose to raise by as much as you banked. Adding 20 degress of flap causes it to point 90 degrees straight up in the air. Dropping the undercarriage results in no reduction of velocity. It cruises at about 250kts with about 15% throttle and glides at about 150kts with gear down and full flaps with even the slightest amount of nose down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe characteristics on final approach are not ideal. With flaps and gear out coming in at about 100kts with 5 degrees pitch up I would expect the throttle to control the rate of descent, and the pitch to control the speed. But it doesn\u0027t seem to be working quite right, the speed is still largely governed by the throttle and it seems as if the only way to get the thing to descend is to point the nose at the ground.

After installation of FAR loading a plane in the SPH and opening the FAR gui all the graphs are blank, all readouts are zero. This is the case with stock planes, the planes that come with FAR, and planes I built myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight a plane I\u0027m testing that flies beautifully in stock is practically uncontrollable with FAR installed, (although this is my first time using FAR so I\u0027m not sure what to expect). The plane behaves as if there is almost no drag, it cruises at 200kt with 10% throttle, accelerates towards the ground with no throttle at all with even the tiniest amount of nose down even if the undercarriage is down, and bounces wildly off the runway on even a gentle touchdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn level flight lowering the undercarriage has no noticeable effect (I would expect some increased drag), and rolling left or right appears to pitch the nose up too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s quite likely my plane is crap and badly designed, but the fact that the FAR gui is all blank is causing me to think that something else is wrong too. Since no one else seems to be having this issue I suspect I\u0027ve probably done something incorrectly, but the installation instructions seem fairly idiot proof so I can\u0027t work out what I\u0027ve done wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is on a clean KSP, the only other mod installed is ShowFPS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.1.2 x64\u003Cbr\u003E\nWin7 x64\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ah4umej3ishjy55/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ah4umej3ishjy55/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/73cvt6d05h9he4o/MK1%20Small%20Jet.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/73cvt6d05h9he4o/MK1 Small Jet.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried your model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou should increase ctrl deflect of winglets at 18-20 and roll at 15\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfat 455 spoiler at 19, rear gears brake 25\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmove front gear from cockpit to mk1 crew cabin and then move with slider toward cockpit. increase spring and dumper of all gear to 1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso center of mass is better if it\u0027s near rear gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactivate break when u want to reduce speed\u00A0 or land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-18T10:21:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2016 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Acvila\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lasergladiatrix","CreatedById":165595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T10:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222635827\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002219321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466230336\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258513\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gryphon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Gryphon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any of the FAR flight assists active (even in a vacuum)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I did have those enabled.
