It\u0027s 4.5 times that of a LV-N! That is a big deal, especially when it has a TWR of 9.84. For comparison: the LV-N has 2.72, the Poodle has 8.97, the LV-909 has 10.19, and the PB-ION thruster has... wait for it... a whole 0.2. In other words: the DS01 has nearly ten times the Isp of other engines with comparable TWR. That is really, really, really good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may however be getting deceivingly low dV ratings from it anyway. The reason for that is that it runs on hydrogen, which has an abysmal density. Even the biggest tank you can mount has hardly any significant mass in it. And because the rocket equation looks at mass, and not at the number of arbitrary units of fuel that the fuel tank uses to count its contents, that means you don\u0027t get much dV from just one tank. If you want to go places with hydrogen, you need to build big. Really big. Bundle up those 2.5 meter tanks. The fun fact is that this won\u0027t actually make your vessel \u003Cem\u003Eheavier\u003C/em\u003E than if you used a single small liquid fuel tank. It will just be much larger. In fact, because the Isp is so much higher than that of a LV-N, and the thruster itself is so much lighter too, the ship will weigh a whole lot less despite being much larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then, yeah, the power generation. The plasma thrusters buy their impressive TWR by paying in electric charge. Let\u0027s calculate an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMounting three DS01 MPDTs and one MX-1 reactor weighs 6.87 tons, plus weight for the radiators, which I don\u0027t know off the top of my head. Let\u0027s guess blindly and say 7.5 tons for the whole assembly. That gives you 84 kN of thrust, for a \u0022propulsion section only\u0022 TWR of 1.14. Compare that to the LV-N: 2.72 for the propulsion section (in this case only itself). For the weight of the plasma thruster/reactor assembly, you could mount three and have a little weight left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, now comes the Isp difference. You say your LV-N fueled craft weighs 21 tons wet and 6 tons dry, and is meant to carry 10 tons of payload. Let\u0027s quickly check the rocket equation: 800 * 9.82 * ln(31/16) = ~ 5196. That doesn\u0027t really match up, to get 4500 dV you\u0027d need about 17.5t dry mass \u002B payload, not 16. Or the wet mass is lower, but that\u0027s ultimately arbitrary, so let\u0027s just go with this. Assuming one LV-N in those 7.5t dry mass gives a total vessel TWR of 0.197; if it\u0027s two LV-Ns, then that\u0027s 0.394.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplacing the LV-N\u0027s with the MPDT/reactor assembly, assuming one LV-N we remove 2.25t and add 7.5t. Together with the 10t payload that makes 22.75t dry mass. How much fuel mass does this need to get 4500 dV? 4500 = 3600 * 9.82 * ln ((22.75\u002Bx)/22.75), solve for x. The result is roughly about 3.1t, for a wet mass of 15.85t, or 25.85t with payload. Note how this is less than the 31 that the nuclear rocket tug features. In fact, since the MPDT assembly gives 84 kN thrust instead of the 60 of one LV-N, the total vessel TWR with payload is now 0.331 - which is \u003Cem\u003Ealmost 70% higher\u003C/em\u003E than the LV-N! The reason the MPDT craft weighs less despite the huge reactor is all down to the fact that the Isp is so high that it requires barely any fuel mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the original tug had two LV-N\u0027s? Then the new dry mass is 10.5t plus payload, and total vessel mass with payload and enough fuel for 4500 dV would be 23.3t, which gives a total vessel TWR of 0.367. This is slightly less than the twin LV-N config, showing that higher-thrust, lower Isp engines still have a good reason to be used in certain cases. But the MPDTs are certainly competitive still, and if there was a higher dV requirement (such as longer distance or higher payload) they would once again come out on top. You could double the dV of this ship and the vessel TWR with 10t would still be over 0.3 - not something you can easily match with LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you paid attention, you\u0027ll have noticed that the MX-1 reactor is actually slightly short of being able to supply three DS01 MPDTs. They would drink 2250 Ec/s, and the reactor outputs 2000 Ec/s. The remaining 250 could be supplemented by a MX-4 reactor, or solar power and/or by utilizing buffer storage. Near Future actually adds parts predestined for this, namely the capacitors. They store 8 times as much Ec per weight as normal batteries do, but cannot be drained directly; they must dump their contents into regular batteries for it to be used. So what you do is have enough regular battery space to receive one capacitor worth of power, and then just stack a large number of capacitors and dump them one by one when necessary during burns. Then afterwards the capacitors can be recharged. This will of course add weight, but that should be under 2 tons so the craft will still easily remain over 0.3 TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, this shows that electric propulsion using the DS01 MPDT can be competitive to LV-Ns even in a medium dV light cargo tug application, but technically plays its real strength only when more dV (or bigger payloads) are required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T17:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00228749236\u0022 data-cite=\u00228749236\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used that design before, having a 100 ton payload rated space tug that can bring me to anywhere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut refueling is a pain-in-the-****..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo everytime I crash it into kerbin or something instead of refueling it..\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDock it to a station or something, or fly disposable tankers up to it to restock it with fuel.
