A lot of beginners handicap themselves by trying to get a telescope that can also do photography, and spend way too much on an unwieldy, large mount, and then never get into imaging in the first place, and then wish they had just gotten a visual-only telescope. Good mounts are expensive, and $600 USD isn\u0027t going to get you very far. For that much, you should be able to get something that should allow you to take images of planets, but negatively subtract hugely from the quality of telescope that you get. You can probably forget about deep space object imaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, these days sometimes you don\u0027t even need a mount, you can put a digital camera on the ground and take a bunch of like 15 second exposures (short enough to avoid star trails) and then stack a whole bunch of them to make some nice Milky Way vistas... but you won\u0027t be doing that in the UK outside of Scotland, probably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, yea, for that price he should just go for some good optics on a stable mount that is easy to use. Dobsonians are the best value for the money, but their relative value goes down somewhat if you live in a place that is too heavily light polluted to see the stars very well (the UK is one of the worst places in the world to do astronomy, sorry to say).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027d recommend either a 150- 250 mm Dobsonian (if your brother wants to look at some of the tens of thousands of deep sky objects like galaxies, star clusters and nebulae that can be seen with such a telescope) or good quality refractor on a solid alt-az mount (or maybe whatever the equivalent is of a CG-5 these days). The refractor is a rather small telescope, but in the hands of a beginner, it is still a magical instrument. The Dobsonian will absolutely blow it away on deep sky objects, and if the mirror\u0027s figure is halfway decent, it will also beat the refractor on planetary views, but again, if the light pollution is bad enough, there will be very little in the way of deep sky objects to look at.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T20:48:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been looking for a telescope in a similar price range for the past 3 months.

I have been able to see Jupiter and a 2-3 of its moons, though not in any detail, just as points of light. I also got a night sky map app (sky guide) that has been great for finding objects to see with my binos.

Many newbies think it is magnification sometimes called power. This is false. The issue is that things are FAINT and hard to see not SMALL and hard to see. A 150 power magnification is way more than enough to see anything you want to see with a telescope in light polluted areas. Even if you do decide to go for magnification, aperture is still the most important feature as a larger aperture allows a larger useful magnification. Many cheap telescopes have a small 60 mm aperture and 500 magnification. That means they have the optics that mathematically works out to 500\u002B power so they are allowed to claim it, but they don\u0027t have the aperture to support it and you will not be able to really see anything at that power. In addition they use a cheap Barlow to boost the power. A Barlow is an adapter that increases the power by a factor of 2 or 3. So a 3x Barlow turns a 150 power telescope into a 450. The problem with that is a cheap one will also boost the flaws in the mirrors or eyepieces and ruin your picture. The takeaway from all this: Ignore magnification/power, go for aperture. #1 most important stat. By far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Aperture is king. Yes this is a repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)The kinds of telescopes available to you vary. The two big ones are reflectors and refractors. Reflectors give the most aperture for you money but also more maintenance. I still recommend reflectors though, Dkmdlb above recommended a reflector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I paid $550 Canadian Dollars for my reflector, it was a 5 1/4 inch (135 mm) reflector, it has a computerized mount that after a simple lineup procedure, will point to things like Mars, Andromeda, Orion Nebula. Just to give you an idea of what you can get for your budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Consider getting a cheaper one like what Dkmdlb suggested and then also getting an eyepiece set. A set of eyepieces from the same manufacturer can often be changed without wrecking your focus. Also keep a lookout for eyepiece filters, they often come in eyepiece sets and often include a light pollution filter. A light pollution filter is not magic, but it helps a great deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Telescope cameras are readily available that fit into standard telescope eyepices slots without adapters. The only concern I have with that is, looking at dkmdlb\u0027s recommended scope, I see it is a kind of reflector called a light bridge, are those rods durable enough to hold a camera in the eyepiece? Probably they are, but this is just a heads up on the sort of things to be considered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Check your local area for a astronomy club. They can give you specific advice for your local area as well as give you an opportunity to try out different telescope styles before you buy one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T21:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe nice thing about a very portable scope for urban areas is that you can always go out of town, and actually take it with you without much trouble.

The reflector typically has two mirrors. One at the bottom and one tilted 45 degrees to aim for the eyepiece. These mirrors have to aligned. Most scopes do this with the help of screws. My telescope (and most similar sized reflectors) has 6 screws for the main mirror, 3 to lock it in place and 3 to adjust its angle. The 45 degree mirror had a simpler arrangement but I can\u0027t remember without looking. The basic procedure is to look through the empty eyepiece socket and adjust the main mirror until everything is centered. The 45 degree mirror then gets adjusted forwards and back to make sure it is in the center. The angle itself isn\u0027t adjustable, we just move the mirror so that it is in the center. Transport of the telescope out to a field to look around may jostle the mirror. Smaller scopes like the sort you are looking at would typically need to have this done once or twice a season, larger scopes might need to do this every time they setup. The scope normally comes with instructions on how to do this, but if not the internet has many tutorials on the subject. Some scopes come with a collimation eyepiece, which basically is just a smaller hole to look through to make things easier. I use a laser collimator for my scope, it fits in the eyepiece and when the laser comes right back straight you are setup.

Light pollution filters work by filtering out the light at around the colour of incandescent streetlights. Nowadays many cities are going to fluorescent or LED streetlights and those are a different colour. A local club would know how well they work in your area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy own suggestion is to get a scope that have f/D of around 6 to 10. Below that are fast scopes, which are great to see deep sky objects/DSOs (nebulas, galaxies, clusters), while higher than that are good for planets and solar system bodies. Low f/D is also good for scanning (say, find a comet or such). Mind that for galaxies and nebulas not the magnitude that makes you able/not able to see it, it\u0027s the surface brightness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your brother wants to make the scope points for him, get a computerized mounting. The scope could be anything. My own suggestion is to actually encourage him to learn manual pointing and focusing - while could be a bit hard, he\u0027ll enjoy what he see more than if the mount points it out for him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
