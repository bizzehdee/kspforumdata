That window you modified is a \u0022science report and checklist window\u0022 Those buttons need to go in a **different** window which is planned for V5.\n\u003E \n\nShould be a pretty simple matter of moving the GUI elements to another window (unless you are planning on doing a real Unity 5 UI and dumping IMGUI). I wrapped all my calls to the DMagic code with reflection, and most of the actual experiment execution code happens in its own class, so it should be a pretty simple matter to move them to another window. I didn\u0027t see any code for this other window on github, I\u0027m assuming you have it locally?\n\nOne of the challenges with orbital science experiments is that currently there is no way to precalculate the results of some of them - the Recon experiments don\u0027t define the biomes they support anywhere except when you run them. This is a limitation of the DMagic code, and while one could duplicate the logic inside the DMagic classes, I\u0027d much prefer a way to simply call the experiment module and ask for all the situations that it handles.\n\nIf possible could there be an option/setting to keep one window? My screen is cluttered enough as it is with all the mods, and being able to filter the experiments to the ones I want to run with the filter checkbox is one of the reasons I wanted to add this logic to the mod. Note that these buttons only appear if you have selected the Current Situation (since that\u0027s the only case when it makes sense to have execution buttons that filter). I get that you don\u0027t want to step on another mod\u0027s toes, but to be honest the less mods I need to have installed for similar functionality, the better. Plus some of the automated science gathering mods have non-permissive licenses and mods tend to die quickly around this forum...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-06T12:21:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2016 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by westamastaflash**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bob Jub","CreatedById":12104,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T14:22:06Z","Content":"Would it be possible at all to have this mod automatically open the science experiments when it detects science to be gained?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarxis","CreatedById":130923,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T20:47:45Z","Content":"The one thing I\u0027ve always wished for [x]Science was that the font and default window was bigger."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceBadger007","CreatedById":150547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T04:05:46Z","Content":"I am a little confused on how to install this mod, there\u0027s 2 x science folders so which one should I download?"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T19:56:25Z","Content":"Is there any way to avoid the KSC baby biomes in science.cfg?

What I have done is completely gut the current science window.  All the logic is held on other classes.\n\nWhat I didn\u0027t want to do was have two window, each doing much the same thing, eating up CPU.  Now all the CPU intensive stuff will only be done once.\n\nIt was a fairly mammoth task but is now completed.  I\u0027m hoping to get a new version out soon but between school holidays and a massive website we are building at the moment I don\u0027t have much time for KSP modding.  Actually, I\u0027d have more time if I didn\u0027t keep playing FTL - and by the way that game doesn\u0027t event teach you rocket science.\n\nAny how I notice that the next KSP version has gone into test.

I do remember that the KSP Devs were banging on about Linq and foreach.  The reason being (I assume, feel free to correct me) that they cause tonnes of garbage collection which can really slow things down.  I\u0027d really like to rip all that stuff out but [x] Science! was built from the ground up on Linq and it\u0027s not going away just yet, there is just so much of it to remove.  Despite the all the Linq in there, I think [x] Science! is a pretty fast and low-impact Add-On so don\u0027t worry.  All the same, it does make lots-and-lots of small memory allocations and it filters them with Linq - that isn\u0027t going to change any time soon.
