Right now I have to refuel my EveLander, attach a nuke booster or two send a refueling and support armada with it and give it a try. Then while that is on the way I will launch a version without the aerodynamic nose cones and parachutes and some of the 48-7S engines, assemble a much more extensive armada in orbit, including one or two of my rapier wingless airbreathing SSTO\u0027s (for Laythe), and send of a Joolian expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rough test of my EveLander was to launch the 2nd/3rd stage combination and get my Mk1 lander can in to munar orbit, then take the full vehicle, launch it to 1500 meters land it on chutes with just a little engine work back as KSC then relaunch with the remaining fuel to 10,000 meters altitude at 50 m/s near the ground to 150m/s at 10,000 meters on the first stage only, the objective with reducing the thrust to simulate was to simulate having to boost for a prolonged time through the thick of Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T17:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just over-fuel when I travel to Jool, then use Skippers (or Vesta\u0027s on KW when modded) to boost me out.

Tylo was truly the biggest hurdle of the bunch though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMy Tylo landing was planned with a 5000 m/s delta-v budget (using the numbers from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NKZhU57.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis map\u003C/a\u003E).

The mothership handled most of the de-orbit burn, putting periapsis at about 6km, releasing the lander, and then boosting prograde to re-circularize. My first landing used way too much fuel; the three outer tanks were about half empty and I grossly underestimated how long they\u0027d last on ascent, leading to losing TWR too soon. Even moving fuel from the center out didn\u0027t help. I originally thought staging those outer tanks as an \u0022abort plan\u0022 for Tylo launch would be sufficient (scrubbing my Laythe visit), but the loss of thrust made that problematic, and would\u0027ve required also scrubbing the Vall visit. I knew my problems were piloting, so I kept at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next attempts were with a \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39812-Landing-and-Takeoff-Delta-V-vs-TWR-and-specific-impulse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econstant altitude\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 descent profile; keeping my retrograde marker on the horizon line by thrusting slightly up to increase time spent killing horizontal velocity. However, a couple of hills on the descent path kept popping up leading to unexpected lithobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I got a successful landing. There were a couple close calls with hills, I think I skimmed one at about 300m above terrain while still going ~1500 m/s. And it was a hard landing, all six landing gear broke but the engines survived and the gear was repairable. A flag was planted, EVA report and surface sample obtained. I moved fuel from the center tanks into the outer ones (to keep all four engines fueled), and orbit was achieved. Rendezvous was handled with the last fumes from the tanks and RCS. I then refueled the lander, scrubbed the science parts, and took the remaining stages to Laythe, then Vall, then Bop, then Pol. I currently have over 100 science reports in the mothership\u0027s command module (with \u0022landed on Pol\u0022 yet to do), no idea how many science points will be rewarded on return to Kerbin. It\u0027s a moot point, since I\u0027ve already finished off the tech tree. But this has been my most ambitious mission in KSP to date and it feels damn good to be close to finishing it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, if anyone has tips on Tylo missions, please post them!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t look like an inexperienced player to me.
