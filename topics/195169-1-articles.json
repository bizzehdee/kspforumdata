It seems like the problem has something to do with the export and also my part seems to be missing something. I imported a stock engine with the .mu plugin and exported it again from within Blender, this did give me the missing particles but the nozzle was rotated by 90 degrees. This is the reason I use the Unity exporter because Blender always destroys my geometrie. Then I tried to export my custom model from within Blender this gave me an invisible mesh ( only nodes visible ) and the particles still didn\u0027t show up. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-30T17:17:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2020 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaguy007\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
