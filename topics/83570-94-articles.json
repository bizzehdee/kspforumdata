Before I knew bac9 was MIA I was hoping for procedural parts doing that you could cut the RAM requirements by 3/5th at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you wouldn\u0027t have to have models for each of the different sized cargo bays, wings, fuselages etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDw I don\u0027t expect a maintenance port of B9 to overhaul B9 Aerospace to that degree but it would have been nice, but B9 doesn\u0027t really fit the cartoonish athletic of KSP so it will never happen anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maars\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maars\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m into it, have done the config spamming for bottom nodes to -1.0 for all parts, am now playing around with aero and once I bumble through that it\u0027s going to be the engines.
