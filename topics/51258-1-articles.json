This way you can put rear landing gear farther back and still pitch up on the runway, giving you a reduced chance of tail strike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your center of lift behind the center of mass. On larger craft, get the lift vector to point through the very rear portion of the center of mass ball indicator. Lighter craft should have centers of lift farther behind than this. This way as your fuel burns your craft will stay fairly well balanced. Corollary to this: part of your lift balancing plan should include some lift near the very front of the craft (but don\u0027t overdo it by shaping on too many control surfaces!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA winglet tail fin is a good idea. Stick it right on your plane\u0027s butt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor small craft, put one jet engine in line with the fuselage so burnouts don\u0027t affect your yaw. For smallish craft, use a bi-coupler or a tri-, to keep your engines as close as possible to the long axis of your craft. This helps control the problems associated with flameouts, if they happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlap some RCS thrusters on. A couple fore and aft, and a pair at the tips of your wings. Save your monopropellant by keeping RCS off until some arbitrarily high altitude where your plane stops feeling like a plane and starts feeling like a Subaru drifting through the snow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a similar note, control surfaces are important. Too many and you can\u0027t control your craft. Too few and same problem. Put some on your wings, behind your centers of lift and mass. If your craft pitches too quickly, remove a set of control surfaces. If your craft always tries to pitch up or down, it is imbalanced. Fix the design, or alternatively, angle your control surfaces down or up by 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, respectively. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more wings than you think you need. Two symmetric sets of delta wings with control surfaces is about right for a cockpit, one mk2 fuselage segment, two mk2 adapters (which contain fuel), couple small bipropellant tanks and four engines. If your prograde vector is at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to the horizon when your heading is at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, add more wings. There is a spot at mid-altitude, maybe 15-20 km, where you haven\u0027t accelerated enough but havereached thinner atmosphere, and your heading and prograde directions will drift apart from each other. You can be at a 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch and your prograde vector is 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, so you are predominantly accelerating horizontally. That is ok, and once you get to high (\u0026gt; 1 km/s) velocity your vector and heading will align better. In fact, I have had flyavle but less than stellar designs that reach a ceiling around 17 km, but with a little rocket boost can keep going on just jets until 25 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, you also need enough air to get the velocity you need with jets. Otherwise your SSTO is not doing its job. You need tons of intakes, at least 5 per jet engine. At extreme altitude, intakes = thrust. Want to get up over 2 km/s on jets? Try \u0026gt;10 intakes per engine. After 15 km, keep your vertical speed around 20 m/s and crank it horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe perfect mix is tricky to find. I know this is more than what you asked about, but I hope these tips give you some inspiration. Nothing more rewarding than hooting orbital velocity at 35 km and drifting up peacefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELlama\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Octagon","CreatedById":68317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T15:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Scott Manley has some tips: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUxzC4EngIsMrPmbm6Nxvb-A\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an older version: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEm5nyZU3a-O2ak6mBYXWPAL\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T16:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is a great start for any aircraft in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54903-KSP-Quick-Guides-Everything-from-airplanes-to-interplanetary-SSTO-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54903-KSP-Quick-Guides-Everything-from-airplanes-to-interplanetary-SSTO-s\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this just further reinforces it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only suggestion is get the FAR mod, it will help with aircraft design and control, they will behave like planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T16:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general aircraft terms, its usual to have the CoL behind the CoM, but not greatly so.
