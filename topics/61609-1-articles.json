This is how I build my side-mounted space shuttles. After building it in the SPH, I detach everything from the cockpit, delete it, then add a girder, which is then automatically selected as the root part. Then I just attach the fuselage to it, replace the cockpit, grab it at the fuselage, and save the sub. It\u0027s really easy, it only needs some logical thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T21:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUse the SelectRoot mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconded.
