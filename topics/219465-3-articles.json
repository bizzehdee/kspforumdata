Especially when a rival mobile monetization company offered to pay Unity $17 billion if the called off the IronSource deal and merge with them instead. Unless that $1b was for the sake of C-suite bonuses, in which case all of this makes perfect sense.

He also was the one who helped Elon with his fake \u0022 Taking Tesla private\u0022 scam.
