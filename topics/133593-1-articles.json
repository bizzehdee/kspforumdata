Its an SSTA that gets to Kerbin orbit with 3200ms of dV, its on KerbalX, called the KSS Voyager its also VTOL\u00A0capable on moons and rough terrain off Kerbin. Plus it can refuel itself. Only carries itself and 4 Kerbals though. i only just figured out how efficient the ramp is drag and weight wise, this won\u0027t work to anywhere near the efficiency without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T18:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, I generally don\u0027t like to build \u0022SSTA\u0022 craft as they are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Inefficient\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* exceedingly unrealistic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I generally stage everything as much as I can while still making it reusable/recoverable. That craft meant to take all those rovers for instance... its a SSTO, in the picture I posted, you see it just after staging of the booster section, which is fully recoverable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet to orbit: stage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet to kerbin escape velocity: stage (and recover/reuse the \u0022ejector\u0022 stage after a retroburn and aeorbraking to a lower orbit for refueling or return to kerbin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet to target SOI: Capture into highly eliptical orbit, and stage (rendevous with this later, as its used on the return)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet to low circular orbit around target: stage\u00A0 a dedicated landing craft(rendevous with the part of the craft in low orbit, generally I leave the lander there so future missions just carry refills for the lander)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get the idea... except now I\u0027m trying to use modular things that I can put in the cargobay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet to low laythe orbit: detach Rapier module, attach the next stage (a LV-N module).
