I\u0027ve forgot most of the inner workings of it. I\u0027m curious how people have managed a sort of helicopter-esque design. Not using propeller or helicopter blade type mods of course... More of impromptu helicopters. Recently I tried sticking a makeshift helicopter blade out of wings attached to a free-spinning infernal robotics docking ring, and while I can get the thing spinning fast as heck with sepratrons it seems to impart no lift on the vehicle. I\u0027m going to try a more quadracopter approach tonight but in the mean time I\u0027m hoping people can share their experiences or point me at some good reference material.
