Add to that the fact that the part connections are over-engineered because they have to be set to control deflections rather than the ultimate forces themselves and I can see that level of over-engineering happening. I think most modern fighters can come close to those g-forces but are limited because the pilots can\u0027t maintain proper situational awareness and control if the plane is executing a 9g\u002B maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for trying to detect if there\u0027s a surface that the shock can attach to... It\u0027s difficult to find the absolute front-most point of a vehicle (it\u0027s close to the origin of the front-most part, but a little further due to the model); then I\u0027d have to attempt raycasting the cone created by that point to find any places where the shock would impact the vehicle (this would be very expensive computationally, btw). Then I\u0027d have to try and determine whether a part being impacted by the ray meant that it wasn\u0027t riding a shock (e.g. a vertical stabilizer that reaches outside the Mach cone, but doesn\u0027t ride the shock) or if a part that wasn\u0027t impacted meant that is wasn\u0027t riding a shock (e.g. a vertical stabilizer that remains completely inside the cone, but doesn\u0027t ride the shock). Attempting to use the normal vector of the impact point only does so much good and doesn\u0027t tell me anything about the vehicle geometry in between the ray origin and the impact point, so even using that to help differentiate is difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is less about the physics themselves and more about trying to detect the actual aerodynamic configuration of the vehicle. The current part-by-part solution doesn\u0027t need me to figure out the configuration of the whole vehicle; I only need to worry about the properties of one wing part, or one nosecone, or one fuel tank when I\u0027m attempting to code the aerodynamics. Yes, it makes the assumption that the flowfield is linear (i.e. that I can combine the individual effects of each part and the linear combination will be accurate), which is very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E wrong, but it is the simplest and most robust solution to the problem of indeterminate vehicle geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d honestly \u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E to do a more advanced aerodynamic simulation that handled the aircraft as a whole rather than part-by-part like I\u0027m doing now.

The second problem is trying to implement the simulation in an efficient and robust manner, by which I mean it doesn\u0027t lag your computer to hell and it doesn\u0027t vomit when you try to fly an Abrams tank because it doesn\u0027t know what to make of that.

In an earlier post, discussing unrelated cargo bays, it was explained that this could result from cargo bays starting in an open state, however, even configuring the B9 cargo bays to start in a closed state (it allows setting the start state from the action menu) doesn\u0027t fix the problem, it just causes it to manifest later during the flight.
