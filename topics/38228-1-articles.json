For example, this program already does a good job of calculating the total dV needed for everything including the Munar orbit-insertion burn (and possibly landing), but escaping the SOI of the Mun is much easier than (almost) escaping the SOI of Kerbin. Additionally, if the the Munar escape burn occurs at a time when Kerbin rises over the Mun\u0027s horizon, the resulting trajectory will escape the Mun counter to its rotation around Kerbin, meaning that the periapsis of the orbit around Kerbin (after leaving the Mun\u0027s SOI) will already nearly intersect Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, which is another VERY significant savings of dV needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, there\u0027s no \u0022easy shortcut\u0022 to figuring out dV for return trips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T19:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that the return journey is the same as the outbound journey if you don\u0027t use the atmosphere to brake.
