I have a station where I docked a kw 3.75 port to a stock 2.5 one. When I switched away and back, the kw 3.75 port is still docked to the 2.5m port, but is now much smaller. It\u0027s about 2.75m across or something. It\u0027s still docked to the port, but on the other end, where it was attached to the station\u0027s structure, there is now a gap between the docking port and the rest of the station. It seems to behave as if it\u0027s still the appropriate size despite a gap big enough to float a kerbal through. The other 3.75 port on the station remains unaffected. I searched back a few pages in the thread and saw at least one other person with a similar problem, but no response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to kw, I\u0027m running KAS, Interstellar, kethane, remotetech2, and the docking indicator mod by navyfish.
