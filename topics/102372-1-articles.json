There are contracts for:\n\n- Taking tourists all around the Kerbin system.\n- Taking tourists to your existing stations and bases.\n- Building space tourism attractions.\n- Taking tourists to your newly built attractions.\n\nUnlike the stock tourism contracts, all tourists for a given contract want to go to the same place. You\u0027ll also start receiving tourist contracts for 20-50 Kerbals to visit your attractions at a time.\n\nThere are 10 randomly regenerating tourism contracts and 4 one-time contracts that progress your space tourism program. Will you be able to build the space casino and start printing funds?\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/a/UWcIS\u0022 style=\u0022height:559px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Download**\n\n***\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E***: In [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154922-ckan-the-comprehensive-kerbal-archive-network-v1251-broglio/), Select and download the mod \u0022Contract Pack: Tourism\u0022\n\n***GitHub***: For the direct download option, please ensure you have all the dependencies before raising a support request:\n\n1.

If you build the space casino you\u0027ll get contracts to take 20-30 Kerbals up for about 4-6 million funds a pop. By that time it should be fairly late game, and the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is taking 100 part test contracts to get your funds up.

I was very hopeful when you mentioned Claw\u0027s hotfix, but his solution is the same as mine - put the Kerbals into the \u0022Unowned\u0022 state, so they don\u0027t show in the astronaut complex (but still exist in the save file). I can\u0027t stop it from happening as there\u0027s too many ways it can happen. One of the main places I see it is getting the \u0022first splashdown\u0022 (maybe every landing before it was on land). Or vice-versa (first landing). Same thing with giving a warning - it\u0027s way too easy to accidentally mess it up - then the player ends up with a corrupted save.\n\nI\u0027m not *too* concerned about the save bloat unless someone can point me to a specific problem it causes. From a file size perspective the extra Kerbals don\u0027t add a lot - let\u0027s say 100 bytes. 1000 Kerbals would be a ***ton*** of contracts, and that\u0027s still only 100KB (not negligible, but not huge either). My bigger area of concern is that they get stored in a list. Scanning a list of 1000 is quite fast, but I\u0027ve seen too many places where KSP likes to do checks on every clock tick. Scanning a list of 1000 items 60 times per second still isn\u0027t terrible... but starts to get more worrisome.\n\nAnyway, the main reason that I\u0027m not putting a fix in is that it would be a fairly painful fix for me (the cure is worse than the disease, for me at least), and I fully expect that this will not be an issue in 1.0 any more. Now if 1.0 rolls around and we *still* have this problem... then maybe I\u0027ll need to revisit this position and do the hard workaround for Squad\u0027s bugs that I really don\u0027t want to do."},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:58:52Z","Content":"Why reusing them isn\u0027t a solution?

Main reason I didn\u0027t want to reuse was so that the player didn\u0027t keep seeing the same names over and over again. How about this, I\u0027ll implement it so that if the list of unowned (or tourists if I make the change below) hits say... 250, I\u0027ll start reusing. That way there\u0027s a wide enough pool of names that a typical player won\u0027t notice the reuse, and the save-bloat is kept to a minimum.

It may be what Squad ends up using for 1.0 instead of a trait - so might be worthwhile changing it now if that\u0027s the case.

If the contract comes up and you then do something that causes the game to get saved and reloaded (like changing scenes), it doesn\u0027t save the location information properly. This only affects when the contract is offered. If you can accept it right away (ie. cancel it in mission control and keep cancelling other stuff until it comes up), it should work.
