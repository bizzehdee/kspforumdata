I wasn\u0027t aware of a loss_rate argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I could leave it alone for now, since it inadvertently simulates mass loss, and besides - unlike H2 or O2, it doesn\u0027t just undergo a reversible thermal fluid/gas state change, it actually chemically reacts away. It\u0027s already got comparative advantages with hydrazine: less efficient, but with more thrust. Peroxide is supposed to be able to decay at any temperature (obviously, heat accelerates the process; actually, I\u0027m wondering now if one could make the value a formula - e.g. loss_rate = temperature * x). It\u0027s thermodynamically unstable. It can also be catalyzed into decaying. Plus, what\u0027s interesting is that it decays into water and oxygen (2H\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003EO\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; O\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E \u002B 2H\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003EO), which means that a tank filled with peroxide can be turned into a tank partially filled with drinkable water and a pocket of oxygen. That has some interesting implications for manned spaceflight: you could have a fuel tank which is mostly used for a, let\u0027s say, transplanetary injection burn, and then you catalyze the remnant of the fuel; afterwards, the crew could open up a hatch and enter the tank, \u0022wet workshop\u0022 style.
