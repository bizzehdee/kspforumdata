When you go into higher timewarps, KSP can\u0027t understand large temperature gradients very well and starts doing stupid things. Radiators will pull more heat than exists, parts will spontaneously heat up to millions of degrees, heat will conduct in unpredictable ways, etc.\n\nAs long as the core heat system is working fine (which is mostly stable at high timewarps) everything should be ok with the reactor.
