They used to slowly decrease over time which is bad, and the weirdness made docking very difficult as well. It\u0027s only a toggle because the problem was so weird, they weren\u0027t sure if the fix would end up worse than the original issue. It\u0027s not, and you should leave that on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second is so that you don\u0027t go from 0g to a full 1g in a single frame when you load a ship. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just for the launch pad or counts ships landed on other planets. In the past, that sort of thing could destroy a ship. It\u0027s a toggle because in rare cases, easing in gravity can be worse for a ship than snapping it on. I\u0027ve never encountered one of these cases so can\u0027t give any details, but I\u0027ve heard others say it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
