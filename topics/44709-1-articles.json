However, the lads on the Kerinternet are impatient, and want their Eeloo pictures ASAP. Your task is to send a probe to Eeloo as quick as possible. Said probe must: Have a power source, so it doesn\u0027t die (or become unable to torque) Have \u0022communication abilities\u0022 (just glue an antenna onto it) Have a camera (just glue some lights to it) Not impact Eeloo Now, all that is needed is a picture of the craft on the launch pad, and at the periapsis at Eeloo (showing the MET, so no F2). Crafts will be judged on: MET at periapsis (Days Hours Minutes) ... And that\u0027s it. Velocity at periapsis should be high, but isn\u0027t judged for (one could take 600 days getting to Eeloo and then burn like hell).

Did this rather quick without anything too fancy, with more time spent on a craft to up the delta-v you can shave off more time. Btw SunJumper, you should probably add a rule about infinite fuel / debug menu being forbidden.
