An integrity check is just for the core developer made data. Any mods will be glossed over, and modded data files are likely to be overlooked, as well. The integrity check is more for looking for missing and/or corrupted unreadable files. From the days of PC gaming yore, it has always been recommended to do a clean re-install when you have modded files included. Clean meaning you do a Steam uninstall, and then you delete the remaining files manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, mods are not supported by the developers, and you install them and make your own at your own risk.
