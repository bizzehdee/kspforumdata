We need to protect ourselves from this deadly adversary, and in doing so, we request that our best scientists (I think) to build a Missile that can reach the Krussian Space Center (KSC 2) in under 15 minutes, and also working on our missile defense system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do try and make the prices for the missiles to be lower than 100,000.

I have built and successfully tested an SRB-boosted GGM/IRBM with designated targeting lock (via MechJeb and preplaced target marker), it\u0027s accurate to 20m and that\u0027s after falling over the horizon (I use RemoteTech which requires line of sight and range-capable comms back to KSC for all unmanned probes except those equipped with the 3m probe core). Maximum payload has been a tank of antimatter which pretty much vapourises everything in physics range on detonation. ABM warhead is more often than not a shroud of radial decouplers for some Kessler spam in the incoming\u0027s path. For near-infinite range, I could swap out the SRB for a stock jet and some Firespitter intakes...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
