Even with 3 small and 1 med heat shield, the best thing i could do was use Kerbin as a gravity assist to lower my solar orbit as much as I could, and I had to launch a rescue mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided the best way to remedy this was to make the lander module (which must fit inside the MK 100 cargo-bay, I\u0027ve allowed myself clipping privileges) capable of re-fueling after landing, and then making multiple surface to low Eloo orbit trips to gradual fill up the mothership completely, which will have no issues getting me back. This was my first attempt to use resource mining/conversion on planet surfaces:\u00A0I needed to use the small drill and small ISRU to make the lander compact enough to fit my requirements, and placed one of each on the craft; 1 radial ore tank, 1 small isru, 1 drill. I placed 2 small radiators on the lander to cover heat, and I had 1 radioisotope generator (i failed to remember that energy generation was paramount in refining craft).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind I did do my hw and make sure my landing zone had more 2.5% ore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I got to Eloo the second time (this was yesterday, and this mission is in 1.1.2 where the previous was in 1.0.5) I as you can imagine vastly underestimated the requirements for \u0022pratical\u0022 mining; it took 15\u002B days to fill my radial ore tank, and refining it all took less then 7 seconds, and gained me about 8 units of fuel and oxy each. In 20 min of doing this nonstop, i had only gained 100 units of fuel out of the 1000\u002B I needed to re fill it; AND i was banking on doing the trip multiple times to refill the orbiting tug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn relation to my\u00A0Eloo endevers, my questions are:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nhow many jr. drill o matics and cooling\u00A0should I add?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat energy system should I use? Obviously not radioisotope, but is fuel cell an option?\u00A0How many Gigantor solar panels should I use if I go that route?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaybe something I\u0027m not taking into consideration?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0Much thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteveD80","CreatedById":160995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T06:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest replacing your mobile miner with a base. But in answer to your questions I will say that my mining operation on Minmus used full size drills and needed more than one gigantor per drill. I was able to run the drills over night using fuel cell, but I never tried running the converter off them I also found that each drill required a large radiator; I\u0027d guess that the juniors will run off a medium.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your miner us manned make sure it has an engineer, the higher the level the better.

It holds 2/3 the fuel capacity\u00A0of a jumbo fuel tank, and uses 4 1x6 solar panels, 2 Fuel Cell arrays, 4 jr. drills, an a jr. ISRU. the zone I land in is slightly above the min amount needed for the Jr. Drill to work. The efficiency is terrible; it takes 1yr 50 days to refill the fuel tanks, but it does work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions on how to make it more efficient? I think Ill replace the solar panels with the larger ones to take more load off the fuel cells, but I can only do it to a certain degree on Eloo since its so far away, especially during the apoapsis of its orbit. I think Ill also add 4 more drills maybe? but then that would take more power from the fuel cells, would it provide less benefit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160995-steved80/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022160995\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160995-steved80/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SteveD80\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0when your using the mini drill an engineer will help with efficiency, but they wont help efficiency with the mini ISRU, just in case you didnt know\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T07:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a Exploration Space station able to refuel quite efficiently on nearly all bodies.
