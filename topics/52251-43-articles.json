However it does take some careful piloting on landing for that. I risked it because I\u0027ve done a LOT of landing at weird angles and attitudes during my time on KSP, even if it wasn\u0027t on Tylo itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBare minimum seems around 2200 dV down, and something similar coming back up, though as those charts linked on the first page suggest, it depends on TWR local to that body and ISP. Still, a good minimum to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of just a minimal probe body, one chair, a ladder, a solar panel or three, and the rest fuel and engines (maybe some landing gear would help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) but eventually decided to go for the whole \u0027Tylo SSTO\u0027 thing. I probably could do better still than I did. My first efforts I tried it with Poodle engines and got a smaller craft, but the best TWR I could get was 1.25 on landing and couldn\u0027t get the dV good enough overall with that set up. Hence I switched to Skippers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlay around with different engines, even ones you wouldn\u0027t think would work better.
