I wanted it to fulfill my contracts where I have to fly at over 19,000 meters and take crew reports.\n\nSo I removed the Wheesley engine from my favorite plane and slapped the Whiplash on. I was amazed at how quickly it climbed and the speed! I am used to operating at full throttle, but max power with the Whiplash is just insane. I hit well over 1,000 m/s and my plane turned into a giant red fireball. I thought it was going to explode.\n\nAnyway, it made me real uncomfortable. Instead of a nice, leisurely flight, I was nervous and on edge. So, I completed two objectives on a contract and high-tailed it home. I just barely made it back after sucking down almost 600 fuel. This thing is not as economical as the Wheesley.\n\nAfter that, I decided to go to the north pole ice cap and do experiments. I chose the Wheesley plane for this because I felt more in control with it vs. the Whiplash.\n\nI guess I just need more experience with the Whiplash to figure out the best cruising altitudes and speeds. Or maybe I should shut the graphics off so I can see the plane instead of flaming metal. Is it possible to go over mach 1 without turning the fuselage to magma?"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:03:51Z","Content":"I say GIMME FUEL GIMME FIRE GIMME THAT WHICH I DESIRE!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Farmer","CreatedById":71519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:07:19Z","Content":"Mach 1 = 340m/s so you are about at Mach 3.\n\nAt sea level your ship will disintegrate from heat somewhere between 1,075 and 1,250m/s depending on how you built it.\n\nAbove 20k you can get 1,300m/s\u002B if you fly right but your engines also begin to die due to lack of oxygen.\n\nBest of luck."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:17:55Z","Content":"You should be able to supercruise at about 750 m/s at 15-17 km basically indefinitely. Drag is crazy in the transonic region from 300-550 m/s, but settles back down after that. You want to avoid that region as much as you can to save fuel. I find it cool that this cruising speed tends to be around mach 2.2, as that similar to real life supercruise."},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T06:26:29Z","Content":"Keep that plane handy. Building planes is so frustrating that i sometimes go back to my own simple TJ racer just to vent some anger. It\u0027s nice to have a plane that goes!\n\nAnyway, you have two problems with a high altitude, high speed plane. The lag in throttle response of the engine, and the few parts the plane is made of. More complex planes have more parts and therefore more or better heatsinks. If you make a high altitude screamer dedicated to science try using an extra fuel tank or two, just to absorb/radiate heat.\n\nThis craft is entirely limited by heat. By that i mean i will be forced to land to cool off long before i\u0027m out of fuel. It\u0027s an old build and i\u0027m sure improvements could be made. I made it to deal with the Kerbin athmospheric contracts. There\u0027s also a smaller one that can make larger suborbital hops but is less usefull at altitude.\n\n[![6ZEfpQ2m.png](http://i.imgur.com/6ZEfpQ2m.png)](http://i.imgur.com/6ZEfpQ2.png)\n\nThe throttle response is just something you have to get used to. Once the turbojets go nuts at supersonic speeds, it takes them a few seconds to stop providing thrust and then the plane still has to suffer drag for a few more seconds before it slows down enough or you pull up. Airbrakes are also usefull, but there is a nice cruising altitude and speed you have to experiment a bit to find. I\u0027f i\u0027m honest though, i\u0027m far to impatient for that. I\u0027d rather go suborbital even if it means taking on heat on the way up and down. Or not bother with athmospheric contracts anymore... :\\\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T06:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T07:11:46Z","Content":"Just remember when you encounter one in the wild, back away slowly and don\u0027t show that fear.

It mounts two Whiplash engines with a shockcone intake and precooler on each nacelle. Works pretty well for long-range flights.\n\nIf you\u0027re afraid of the runaway freight train effect at lower altitudes, once you\u0027re past the transonic speed range and into the ramjet effect of the J-X4 Whiplash, you can bring down the thrust limiter on the engine(s) so you can still use your throttle without worrying too much about overspeed. I have a twin-Whiplash engine fighter that I keep both engines at 70% thrust limiter, and a single engine fighter I keep at 80%...they won\u0027t break through the transonic barrier at low altitude without bumping up the thrust limiters, but at medium and high altitude, it keeps the engines governed better.\n\nIt just comes down to testing limiter settings at the altitudes you want to operate at and find what configuration works for you...just think of it as prototype flight testing ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T18:58:43Z","Content":"Speed and fuel economy are helped by throttle control. Few jets (even space planes) fly well with a binary throttle.\n\nJet ISP is dependent on her thrust in game. The less drag, the less thrust needed to counter said drag, and the less fuel needed. This is why you want to avoid cruising at trans-sonic speeds and fly high for distance.\n\nAt 1 km/s level flight at 20 km you should have no heat issues. Sensitive parts may display heat gauges, but they should not climb above 60%. Going faster than that on Whiplash engines in level flight is very hard (as they quickly lose thrust at faster speeds)"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:12:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Speed and fuel economy are helped by throttle control.
