I wanted it to fulfill my contracts where I have to fly at over 19,000 meters and take crew reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I removed the Wheesley engine from my favorite plane and slapped the Whiplash on. I was amazed at how quickly it climbed and the speed! I am used to operating at full throttle, but max power with the Whiplash is just insane. I hit well over 1,000 m/s and my plane turned into a giant red fireball. I thought it was going to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it made me real uncomfortable. Instead of a nice, leisurely flight, I was nervous and on edge. So, I completed two objectives on a contract and high-tailed it home. I just barely made it back after sucking down almost 600 fuel. This thing is not as economical as the Wheesley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I decided to go to the north pole ice cap and do experiments. I chose the Wheesley plane for this because I felt more in control with it vs. the Whiplash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I just need more experience with the Whiplash to figure out the best cruising altitudes and speeds. Or maybe I should shut the graphics off so I can see the plane instead of flaming metal.

It\u0027s nice to have a plane that goes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you have two problems with a high altitude, high speed plane. The lag in throttle response of the engine, and the few parts the plane is made of. More complex planes have more parts and therefore more or better heatsinks. If you make a high altitude screamer dedicated to science try using an extra fuel tank or two, just to absorb/radiate heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is entirely limited by heat. By that i mean i will be forced to land to cool off long before i\u0027m out of fuel. It\u0027s an old build and i\u0027m sure improvements could be made. I made it to deal with the Kerbin athmospheric contracts. There\u0027s also a smaller one that can make larger suborbital hops but is less usefull at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ZEfpQ2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ZEfpQ2m.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ZEfpQ2m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe throttle response is just something you have to get used to. Once the turbojets go nuts at supersonic speeds, it takes them a few seconds to stop providing thrust and then the plane still has to suffer drag for a few more seconds before it slows down enough or you pull up. Airbrakes are also usefull, but there is a nice cruising altitude and speed you have to experiment a bit to find. I\u0027f i\u0027m honest though, i\u0027m far to impatient for that.
