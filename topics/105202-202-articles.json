Note that Habitation is not the same thing as Supplies but both are constraints for how long your crew stays functional, along with a third constraint, EC.\n\nThe LS Status window is telling you that with crew up to 2 (out of a possible 4), there is a 25% reduction in their supplies requirement.  Look above the text you snipped for the Supplies column at the top of the window.  If you\u0027ve not added any supplies to the setup you mentioned, you have none and won\u0027t see any benefit to the Salamander\u0027s recycler function.  Once you add supplies, note that the Supplies column changes but not Habitation does not.\n\nAdditional Kerbals beyond 2 will not get the 25% reduction. I\u0027ve seen a formula somewhere.  Have you checked the MKS-LS Wiki?  Although parts of it might be out-of-date, I don\u0027t believe the Supplies calculation is.\n\nRunning out of supplies means starvation and running out of Hab time results in homesickness.  Depending on the LS options you set this could mean nothing, refusal to work, to death."},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Coyote","CreatedById":37107,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-19T02:52:15Z","Content":"Is it me or has anyone else had this problem with the 1.1.0.0 update?\n\nI\u0027ve installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS correctly and I noticed in my list that there are only three parts .. all of them the green houses.
