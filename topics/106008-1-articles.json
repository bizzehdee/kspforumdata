NONE. You do however have a right to give constructive, logical, calm, and THOUGHT OUT feedback to the team based on your \u0022feelings\u0022 and \u0022Personal Experience\u0022 with the update. If you say \u0022aero model is broken!\u0022 and you\u0027re not an actual aerospace engineer? You have no clue what you\u0027re talking about. Period. Instead, you should say that it \u0022feels\u0022 broken to \u0022you\u0022 and stop making all these over arching statements lumping people in with you as though everyone MUST agree with your assessment. Spaceplanes feel broken? Maybe that\u0027s because you were used to an aero system that..well...was crap and you can\u0027t \u0022cheaty plane\u0022 your way to orbit without some thought anymore. Heating feels broken? Turn on the thermal overlay and thermal data in action menus and study the data like the rest of us so that you can give honest and thought out feedback to the devs...such as..\n\n\u0022Cub Octag struts seem to be acting as heat insulators and while they seem not to increase the overall thermal mass of the part they are attached to, they seem to assist that part with absorbing and radiating heat\u0022 Maybe this was intended, maybe it wasn\u0027t. But it\u0027s feedback that doesn\u0027t have a single bit of \u0022I am engineer, I know more than squad, squad sucks!\u0022 in it. Oh and if you provide some screenshots? Well boy howdy...now you\u0027re talking their language. So hows about we all calm down, and give them actual empirical data they can use to fix things that are ACTUALLY broken, instead of spending time telling them what we THINK is broken yeah?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:38:42Z","Content":"Agreed...seems so simple, yet also appears to be illogical to many, many people.\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"harbingerdawn","CreatedById":16550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:40:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you say \u0022aero model is broken!\u0022 and you\u0027re not an actual aerospace engineer?

I don\u0027t think not being one of those roles should invalidate feedback entirely, given that makes up the extreme majority of players. It\u0027s of course equally unhealthy to take suggestions from the masses at 1:1 face value but there\u0027s a balance to be found.\n\nCertainly more people need to learn how to be constructive though, and conversely, many need to acknowledge that complaining/criticising does not mean that you \u0022hate the game\u0022 (even when done in a polite way). I think on the whole (there are always exceptions) everyone just wants the game to be all it can be - engineers, developers, or otherwise.\n\nAs an aside, some things that are \u0022wrong\u0022 are hard to quantify with data.

If a single small parachute is enough to decelerate my 10 ton craft at 35g from 2000m/s to 200m/s, with nothing bad happening, i **know** something\u0027s broken. \n\nOr, nice example which i can actually prove (by uploading the craft if needed), i\u0027m trying a new SSTO design, which admittedly failed just 20 minutes ago - it stalled, so far so good. It fell towards the ground at roughly 40m/s. All the way from 40km to the ground. The craft at that point had to weigh roughly 40 tons (half fuel, 80odd tons to start with).

All the feedback I\u0027ve seen is purely from a gameplay perspective, one of a gamer, of course not by an actual engineer or what have you. Granted, we\u0027ve likely seen different feedback, but I\u0027m going off of what I\u0027ve seen. And what I\u0027ve seen is people talking and discussion amongst themselves what has changed in 1.0, and there has been a fantastic response from users about how to work around these problems. This feedback process, the one you\u0027re attempting to defend SQUAD for, is all a part of the learning process of Kerbal Space Program. I\u0027ve already learned tons from threads here, and I hope I can continue to do so. It doesn\u0027t matter if someone\u0027s a game developer, an engineer, or just some average joe with a computer. Every bit of feedback is useful information, slamming on the part of SQUAD or not.\n\nI happen to adore the game, and play it every single day. I know that it may seem as if people are just complaining, but in my opinion, and this is something I feel strongly about, they\u0027re simply trying to learn. Unless they actually make good on their threats to stop playing (which, by the way, I haven\u0027t seen any such threats) due to the problems, then it is wonderful to assume that responses from fellow players and forumgoers have helped them how to understand the problem, fix it, and move on.\n\nIt\u0027s just a learning wall people are smacking into, that\u0027s all."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:49:43Z","Content":"While I agree with the general sentiment of the OP, I think that making a blanket statement of if you aren\u0027t *X*, then your opinion doesn\u0027t matter is wrong.
