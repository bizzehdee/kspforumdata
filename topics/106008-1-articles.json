This feedback process, the one you\u0027re attempting to defend SQUAD for, is all a part of the learning process of Kerbal Space Program. I\u0027ve already learned tons from threads here, and I hope I can continue to do so. It doesn\u0027t matter if someone\u0027s a game developer, an engineer, or just some average joe with a computer.
