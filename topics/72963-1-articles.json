It is counterintuitive, rarely the desired behavior, and the source of much head scratching when diagnosing fuel feed problems. I believe the crossfeed is a holdover from before we had fuel lines, I think it\u0027s time to do away with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T12:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever knew they were crossfed, but I have to see it makes sense that they shouldn\u0027t be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T14:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree wholeheartedly with this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T15:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait what?

There needs to be a non-tank part attached to the decoupler in the radial stack for the crossfeed to work.

This is a big part of why the crossfeed of radial decouplers is bad, usually we attach tanks with them and no crossfeed occurs, so we assume the decouplers don\u0027t crossfeed. Then, when a situation arises in which it can, we\u0027re confused by it because we\u0027ve assumed they don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Like in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76661-Asparagus-staging-with-drop-tanks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, where a player has fuel tanks mounted to the top of SRBs that are attached with radial decouplers, the problem stumps veteran players (myself included).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-21T15:29:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2014 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T17:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEdit: Like in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76661-Asparagus-staging-with-drop-tanks\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, where a player has fuel tanks mounted to the top of SRBs that are attached with radial decouplers, the problem stumps veteran players (myself included).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhhh right, didn\u0027t see that link on ma phone at first, that\u0027s awesome!
