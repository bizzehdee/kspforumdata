We at Argus develop and provide automated crafts and vehicles for use on terrestrial bodies as well as in space. Founded in 2015, the Foundry is a fully automated factory that uses a unique production and design algorithm that designs, develops, and creates crafts for a variety of uses without the need for Kerbal engineers or workers. This approach is also utilized in our Drone craft design, with no need for crew or life support in our vehicles and ships, our Drones are able to do what a manned crafts cannot. If any Drones are lost in the line of duty, no Kerbals are lost in the process. We at Argus work for Kerban, so that Kerbals may live. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.I.
