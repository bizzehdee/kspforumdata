I\u0027m amazed, awed, and astounded by the vast bulk of the vast bulk of the stuff in it. Yay Squad! But this item is still a bad idea. There\u0027s no gameplay point in it at all. Assume there\u0027s no overheating at all; the result is that the player gets to fly his rocket without worrying about it. OK, so add overheating, which requires the player add some other part(s) to counter it. But he will, and the result will be the player gets to fly his rocket without worrying about overheating at all. Only now the rocket has a few more parts and weighs a bit more. So why even bother? It\u0027s just a trap for the unwary, which is not good game design. A better solution would be to just make the engine weigh a bit more to account for the radiators. You\u0027d get the same result--a heavier rocket being flown without concern about overheating--but it would have fewer parts (a good thing) and wouldn\u0027t be a trap (also a good thing).\n\nAlso, introducing overheating to numerous rather significant parts without providing a radiator is a critical oversight.

If Squad wants to get real with heat, that\u0027s the place to start, not with overheating operating parts.\n\nI think Squad wanted to find a way to nerf the nuclear engines, since the chemical rockets got their isp reduced. So by overheating, it means they can\u0027t be used at 100%, which means they have a disadvantage against chemical rockets.\nBut it still sounds like a poor choice.\n\nAlso, on the matter of radiators, what kind of parts are you guys thinking? I think Interstellar using heatsink type of parts. But while I guess they are effective, wouldn\u0027t a circulating fluid work better in space?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why would I aerocapture a nuclear tug without proper heat-shielding? It has more than enough fuel to do the job I want it to without risking an atmosphere.\n\nTo save on fuel of course. But it\u0027s an honest question. So far, most of my transfer stages had radially mounted nuclear engines and, should I use a 3.5m tank, there isn\u0027t a heat shield large enough to cover them, so I\u0027m thinking in either using tweakscale on the heatshield (once it\u0027s updated) or, even funnier, push them inside or outside with infernal robotics.\nBut I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I have to.
