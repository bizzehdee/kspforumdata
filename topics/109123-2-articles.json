The EMH is about 10 meters past that. The lights are on, looks like they\u0027re welcoming us home.\n\n**One Week Earlier:**\n\nWith a thundering roar, the unmanned Sarnus V rocket pushed itself through the clouds, the fairing shroud concealing the cargo within. Since Ascension 11 had first landed on the Mun, there had been six more missions to the Munar surface. All but Ascension 13 went smoothly, and due to the ingenuity of the crew and Mission Control, even that crippled mission returned the kerbanauts home unharmed. With the Sarnus V having more than proved itself as a reliable workhorse, it was decided to revisit some of the initial plans for the ascension mission.\n\nInitially, it was assumed that each Mun mission would take two Sarnus V rockets to complete, with the first sending a MOLAB (Mobile Laboratory) pressurized rover along with other hardware for an extended Munar stay. The second launch would bring the crew in the MEM, where they would perform a precision landing next to the MOLAB. Unlike the Ascension 11-17 missions, where the kerbanauts only stayed on the surface for a few days at the most, these missions would have explored the surface for weeks, or even months. With the tiny battery-powered Munar Rover, Kerbals could only explore about 3 square kilometers around the MEM; with the MOLAB that would be increased to almost 1300 square kilometers.\n\n**Ascension 18** **(featuring Extended Stay, Mun Base, MOLAB)**\n\n![yvIH0mFl.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/yvIH0mFl.png?1)\n\n**Phase A:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/vI9mb)\n\nAscension 18 would consist of three total launches, or phases. Phase A consisted of a Sarnus V launch lifting the MOLAB and EMH (Extended Munar Habitat) all the way to Low Munar Orbit, where they separately descended to the surface under their own power. The MOLAB was powered by RTGs for reliability and contains a complete mobile geological lab for inspecting samples. The EMH is a two-story \u0022Mun house\u0022, solar powered and capable of sustaining Kerbals for extended periods. With all systems operating nominally at the newly established East Crater Outpost, the go-ahead was given for the next launch, which would bring the crew to the surface.\n\n**Phase B:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/DpjD8)\n\nAscension 18 would break dozens of records with its extended Munar stay and improved research capabilities; but it would also bring the first female Kerbal to space. Valentina Kerman, a rival of Jebediah and experienced Air Force test pilot, was finally selected for an Ascension mission (KSP officials assured us it had nothing to do with a rumored KCLU lawsuit). Lancas Kerman would accompany her on Phase B, the month-long surface exploration, and Phildred Kerman would return the first CSM to Kerbin (nobody wants to stay in Munar orbit for a month in what\u0027s essentially a compact car).\n\nPhase B was essentially a normal Ascension mission profile, but with a precision landing bringing the MEM within a few meters of the East Crater Outpost. Once the crew was safely on the ground, thanks to Valentina\u0027s hours of practice is the simulators back home, Phildred performed the TKI burn and arrived home several hours later. Meanwhile, on the surface, Val and Lancas performed detailed checks of the MOLAB and moved into the EMH, which would be their home over the next month.\n\nOver the course of Phase B, several extended rover trips were performed, some lasting several days. The crew visited craters up to 20 kilometers away from the Outpost, and Lancas, an experienced geologist, gathered a trove of information that will help Kerbal scientists discover the history of the Mun\u0027s formation.\n\n**Phase C:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/J3vfN)\n\nAs Val and Lancas wrapped up their surface stay, a final Sarnus V was launched, this one with no MEM and only Bill Kerman at the helm of the CSM. After the TMI burn and Munar orbit insertion, the crew on the ground gathered their supplies and powered down the MOLAB and EMH, which would remain for use by future scientific expeditions. Entering the MEM, the Ascent Stage blasted the two Kerbals into Munar orbit, where they were picked up by Bill. One last TKI burn sent the CSM cruising back to Kerbin, where they splashed down under parachutes and awaited pickup by the Kerbal Navy. Val and Lancas had lived on the Mun for over a month. Where others had only visited the Mun\u0027s surface, they had vacationed there. But the boys back at Mission Control already have their sights on greater, more distant goals - Duna and Eve.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nI was a little confused about the wording of the Apollo Applications Program section of the OP. It says that you *have* to do one AAP mission, and then it says to add 20 points for each *additional* mission. So it seems to me that reading it literally, if you do one mission, you get 0 points, and if you do two missions, you get 20 points. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s how GregroxMun intends for it to work. Either way, I completed the parameters for the Munar Base and the MOLAB projects in this mission report, and I\u0027ll let him score it as he sees fit.\n\nPrevious \u0026 Future Ascension Program Reports: [Normal Apollo Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121201-The-Apollo-Applications-Program-1-0-Edition?p=1943306\u0026viewfull=1#post1943306) - [Eve Flyby](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121201-The-Apollo-Applications-Program-1-0-Edition?p=1949916\u0026viewfull=1#post1949916) - [Duna Flyby \u0026 Landing](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121201-The-Apollo-Applications-Program-1-0-Edition?p=1955180\u0026viewfull=1#post1955180)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T20:46:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jonboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:49:03Z","Content":"A continuation of my Apollo Program. \n\nBefore crew can launch on the Saturn V, a demonstration must be made that the LES works effectively. \n\n**LES DEMONSTRATION**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027d say that\u0027s a good 20 points, with a base and a MOLAB, and any extra points based on goals that there may be that have not already been taken by the previous Apollo missions.\n\nBut, like, WOW! That was an amazing mission report! That was awesome. I hope you plan on doing more challenges in the future, these are great reports.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A continuation of my Apollo Program. \n\u003E Before crew can launch on the Saturn V, a demonstration must be made that the LES works effectively. \n\u003E \n\u003E **LES DEMONSTRATION**\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/me3XV](http://imgur.com/a/me3XV)\n\u003E \n\u003E OUTCOME: Success!

Additionally, an important date was looming: a transfer window that would allow a spacecraft to swing by Eve, using a gravity assist to return back to Kerbin using minimal fuel. There would be neither the time or the funds to accomplish this mission using elaborate new hardware. Instead, the mission would be accomplished using the reliable Sarnus V booster and the battle-tested Command and Service Module. However, the CSM used in the Ascension missions up to this point could not support life for more than a week or two. Wernher von Kerman and his team of engineers focused all of their resources on creating a cheap and effective plan for Kerbals to visit another planet for the first time.\n\n![3zKicrml.png](http://i.imgur.com/3zKicrml.png)\n\n**The Plan**\n\n![rOlcDRUl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rOlcDRUl.jpg)\n\n(For more info on this particular AAP Venus flyby plan, check out [this blog post](http://amyshirateitel.com/2011/12/03/nasas-manned-mission-to-venus/).)\n\nThe current capabilities of the Sarnus V rocket allowed only the CSM, a small payload under the intermediate fairing, and the partially spent third stage of the booster to be carried into orbit. Assembly of a multi-part spacecraft in LKO would require additional Sarnus V launches and development of that craft, causing development and mission costs to skyrocket. Instead, the boys at KSC developed an ingenious (some would say crazy) plan to utilize the third stage of the rocket as a habitat for the long flight to and from Eve.\n\nThe concept (known as a \u0022wet workshop\u0022) had originally been studied when the Ascension mission profiles were first developed years ago, as a way to cheaply create a scientific space station in LKO. The third stage would be modified so that after launch, any remaining fuel could be vented into the vacuum of space. Next, a breathable atmosphere would be pumped in, and kerbanauts would outfit the roomy inside of the booster with cloth walls, using prebuilt attachment points to secure bulkier equipment and \u0022lots of velcro\u0022 for the rest.\n\nFor the mission to Eve, the MEM will be replaced with an Environmental Support Module, containing all of the life support for the mission as well as the furnishings for the wet workshop. After launch, the standard transposition and docking would allow the CSM, ESM, and wet workshop to be joined into a roomy interplanetary spacecraft, all with one Sarnus V launch.\n\n**The Mission**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/oTWsq)\n\nA crew of three kerbanauts was selected for the Eve mission, with two veteran astronauts and one planetary scientist. Milus Kerman was the pilot and mission commander for Ascension 8, the first manned flyby of the Mun, and would reprise these roles for Ascension E-1. Patdock Kerman was the engineer on Ascension 7, which was the first manned flight of the Command and Service Module. Franree Kerman has never flown in space, but is an experienced planetary scientist who jumped at the chance to be the first to observe the purple planet up close.\n\nThe crew was launched with the CSM and ESM on a single Sarnus V, six days before the launch window. Once in LKO, the transposition and docking of the CSM to the ESM was performed, and the Kerbals began checking the ESM for damage ... and snacks. Extensive checks of all systems were performed multiple times; if something went wrong on a mission to the Mun, the astronauts could normally return within ours. If a problem happened on the way to Eve, they would not be able to make it back for months.\n\nWith all systems go and the launch window imminent, the Ascension E-1 spacecraft was oriented for the burn that would eject them from Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The burn fully depleted the third stage booster, changing the ship\u0027s velocity by 1,454 m/s. Mission control estimated that any further burns to correct the ship\u0027s course (which would be performed using the service engine on the CSM) would take less that 400 m/s delta V. Compared to a more blunt approach, which involves burning for Eve, inserting into Eve\u0027s orbit, waiting for a transfer window, and burning back to Kerbin, the advantages of a timed flyby are obvious. A traditional Eve orbit mission would take approximately 4,500 m/s of delta V, as opposed to the chosen timed flyby, which takes a mere 1,850 m/s of delta V.\n\nMilus: Ascension to KSC, how do you read?\n\nKSC: You\u0027re coming in loud and clear, Ascension.\n\nMilus: 6 hours have elapsed since we vented the third stage tanks and repressurized with the breathable atmosphere. Permission to enter the third stage habitat?\n\nKSC: Permission granted.\n\nFranree: Phew! It smells like rocket fuel in here.\n\nPatdock: Don\u0027t worry, Franree, you\u0027ll get used to it ... sometime in the next six months hopefully. Here, help me velcro my sound system to the wall.\n\nThe Kerbals set in for the long haul: 60 days until their encounter with Eve. In the mean time, they stayed busy, mainly by perfoming experiments studying interplanetary space, though they also played a lot of Risk. As they finally entered Eve\u0027s SOI, KSC relayed experiments to them at a blistering pace. They would only have a few hours to study the surface of Eve up close, and the planetary scientists back home wanted them to make the most of it. As they approached their closest distance to the planet at a velocity of over 4,000 m/s, Franree described the surface to the millions watching on TV back home.\n\nFranree: It\u0027s unlike anything I\u0027ve ever seen. A purple planet. Amazing.\n\nPatdock: Look at the craters on the surface. They\u0027re very large. Some of the seas seem to be formed from craters as well.\n\nFranree: Yes. Note the absence of small craters, though, the kind you would see on the Mun.\n\nMilus: How do you account for that?\n\nFranree: Well, most of these large impacts are probably left over from the initial formation of the planet, when bombardments like that were more common. At that time, Eve probably had no atmosphere to help protect from impacts. Now, with the thick atmosphere, most small metoers burn up before they can cause craters.\n\nKSC: Let\u0027s get back to the experiments, shall we, Ascension? Only 1,329 left to go.\n\nAs Eve receded into the distance, the Kerbals were partly relieved that their workload was lessened, but also saddened that their time at Eve was so short. The rest of the mission was uneventful, aside from a short burn halfway between Eve and Kerbin that placed them on a perfect trajectory to reenter their home world\u0027s atmosphere. Finally, the blue globe appeared as a distant light in the window. With only hours to reentry, the wet workshop and EMS were discarded, and the crew prepared for the reentry checklist. Finally, the service module was ditched, and the beefed up ablative shields on the Command Module began to glow white-hot as the pod slammed into the atmosphere at over 4,000 m/s. The Kerbals safely descended under parachutes after over 120 days in space, the next step in the Kerbal exploration of space complete.\n\nWhile the first interplanetary flight proved the reliability of the CSM over long flights and the viability of the wet workshop concept, the boys at KSC realized that a short fly-by could only provide so much data about a planet, especially about its surface. For the next mission they wanted something more substantial, and they had Duna in their sights. It will be a challenge, but hopefully the successful Eve mission will cause even more funding and support to pour into the Ascension Applications Program.\n\n**Scoring**\n\nWith the completion of the Eve flyby project parameters, this adds 20 points to my Apollo Applications Program score.
