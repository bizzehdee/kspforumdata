I\u0027ve been moving a bit NSWE and taking EVA reports but nothing seems to activate the contract. Am I doing something wrong? When I click on the marker on the map I get an option to \u0022Start Navigation\u0022 but it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything!

Although, it can be hard to see the marker if it is over the horizon line of your navball. It helps to have the control point of your rover facing forward, not upwards - otherwise the horizon line is barely visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA message will pop up on your screen when you get within 500 meters of the site marker. You can do your report anywhere within that 500 meter area. Assuming this is an EVA report then your site should be on the surface, but some contract sites are above the surface and you\u0027d need to fly through the area around the marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a mod that will show you the markers in the world as you\u0027re driving, then consider getting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94432-18x-waypoint-manager-v281-2019-10-22/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EWaypoint Manager\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-04T18:11:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2020 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flexico","CreatedById":168681,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-04T18:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAha, there it is!
