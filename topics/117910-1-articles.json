With a 4 MW solar array (~50 tons), and 50 tons of xenon propellant, you could lift 400 tons of payload to EML1 (on paper). That\u0027s \u0026lt;$2 billion of launch vehicles, for the entire mass of the ISS. (The ion engines would probably cost more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor bringing in mass from a low-C3 NEO, you could get LEO \u003Cem\u003Emultipliers\u003C/em\u003E as high as 100:1. I.e. one Falcon Heavy launch (50 tons) gets 40 tons of SEP propulsion to a NEO, which then pushes 4,000 tons of NEO mass by 300 m/s, into EML1. For bulk shielding, that\u0027s insanely cheap! 4,000 tons of iron-nickel, for example, would surround a 10-meter TransHab with \u0026gt;1 meter thickness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just silly back-of-the-envelope stuff, but it\u0027s provocative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T23:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
