And unlike Mars or Moon, countless minor planets are small enough to tug onto more favourable, easy-to-reach orbits - easing the delta vee load on interplanetary infrastructure. This smallness also makes them easy to launch from and land on, both delta vee- and TWR-wise.\n\nAFAIK, while minor planets in the inner Solar System are drier than the driest slab of concrete baking in the Gobi desert, you can still find volatiles on them (in the form of hydrated clays and such).

This also allows low-thrust (SEP) cargo shipments from LEO)\n- Reasonably fast evacuation to earth possible (~1-3 days)\n- Very cheap to near-earth heliocentric, to bring in NEO asteroid material (minimum of just 140 m/s to C3=0!)\n- Very cheap to SEL2, to bring in space telescopes for upgrades\n- Very cheap to low lunar orbit, and the lunar surface\n- Reasonably cheap to bring in satellites from GEO (probably low-thrust / SEP)\n- Cheap to high-C3 interplanetary (descent to low earth altitude \u002B Oberth burn)\n- Generally strikes good delta-v balance between a lot of places\n\nCompared against similar locations,\n\n- Solar Lagrange points need more delta-v from earth\n- Near-earth asteroids need more delta-v, and have very long transit times\n- Lunar orbit needs more delta-v, and has high station-keeping costs\n- Various tradeoffs between EML1/EML2 (unstable) and EML4/EML5 (stable halo orbits)\n- LEO is cheaper from earth, but very expensive from heliocentric. If you want to use lots of asteroid material (water ice, shielding mass), you want to assemble things in a high orbit like EML or SEL\n- GEO is more expensive from both earth and heliocentric (VERY suboptimal)\n- Lunar surface is in a deep gravity well, has day/night cycle, and is covered in dust\n\n(Of course, this isn\u0027t an [original idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L5_Society) at all!)\n\n[![616px-Stanford_torus_under_construction.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Stanford_torus_under_construction.jpg/616px-Stanford_torus_under_construction.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus)\n\nedit:\n\nShould emphasize how surprisingly cheap EML could be.\n\nThe low-thrust delta-v for LEO -\u003E EML1 is 7 km/s. With a solar-electric tug, you could probably get 1.2 : 1 mass ratios or better (e.g. for a 1-year spiral, at 8,000s Isp and with [200 W/kg](http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/st8/tech_papers/2005%20IEEE%20Aerospace%20Conference%20_Big%20Sky_%20Paper-%20NGU%20ST8.pdf) solar panels). \n\nI.e., take 10 Falcon Heavy launches to LEO (500 tons). With a 4 MW solar array (~50 tons), and 50 tons of xenon propellant, you could lift 400 tons of payload to EML1 (on paper). That\u0027s \u003C$2 billion of launch vehicles, for the entire mass of the ISS. (The ion engines would probably cost more).\n\nFor bringing in mass from a low-C3 NEO, you could get LEO *multipliers* as high as 100:1. I.e. one Falcon Heavy launch (50 tons) gets 40 tons of SEP propulsion to a NEO, which then pushes 4,000 tons of NEO mass by 300 m/s, into EML1. For bulk shielding, that\u0027s insanely cheap! 4,000 tons of iron-nickel, for example, would surround a 10-meter TransHab with \u003E1 meter thickness.\n\nThis is just silly back-of-the-envelope stuff, but it\u0027s provocative.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T23:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"}]}
