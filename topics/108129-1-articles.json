As for what I was doing, I simply selected the station from map view. I think what may have happened is that I had the four parts packed closely together on the station. When I used the new models, which are much larger, probably had multiple nasty collisions. By reverting to original models, the collisions went away. \n\nGame is heavily modded. I had no problems until using latest vision of parts. Reverting to old parts fixed the problem.

Did you try the new parts with a new save and a new vessel ?\n\nAlso KSP (1.02) does NOT suport 64 bit on Windows, that means it can only use 3,X Gigabiyte of RAM.
