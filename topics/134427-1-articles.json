If you could just have that fuel back! This challenge does require a mod and a heavily used save file, if you use the fuel connectors from KAS then you can transfer any remaining fuel from the remaining debris, my challenge is for you to bring all the fuel home to kerbin, then recover the debris by way of pushing it out of orbit. Do a job for your community in space clean up your mess!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T10:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing something a little like this now in the Bill and Jeb adventure challenge, basically exploring by pirating existing infrastructure. \u00A0You might consider sharing a save game (just put a persistant.sfs file on Dropbox) so everyone can start in the same page. I actually had to create a game by playing through a quick career on Easy, as my play style is to not leave debris. Kinda necessary until 1.1 as my KSP computer is an actual potato.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T17:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChallenge also accepted...\u00A0after some explosions...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I don\u0027t even know what I have in orbit.
