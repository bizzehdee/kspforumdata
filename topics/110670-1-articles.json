I however have several questions to ask.\n\n![J267kWJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J267kWJ.jpg)\n\nFirstly, you\u0027ll notice the station is divided in half by a big decoupler. I had originally intended to jettison the orange fuel tank so it looks nice, but now I\u0027m thinking maybe keep it for refuelling capability. So my question #1 is does the ability exist to decouple it, move it around, attach a docking port to it, and re-attach it nicely to my station? Can you do all that in EVA, even if you have KIS and KAS and all that good stuff? Or should I just launch a new, dedicated tank for that purpose?\n\nMy second question is, are Kerbals in EVA able to attach medium sized docking ports to vessels? If so, which tool do you accomplish this with? I tried in sandbox and they all just fell off. \n\nMy third question is about the modules on either side of the solar panels. You see the squares with \u002702\u0027 and \u002703\u0027 painted next to them? You see the circular ports? Those are MKS modules; I was wondering if that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s where you attach docking ports? (Stock docking not MKS docking)\n\nMy fourth question is the same as above, except I was wondering, can somebody do the arrangement like this? D \u003C-\u003E D -\u003E SF -\u003E S\n\nwhere D = Docking port, SF = Structural fuselage and S = station? I\u0027m asking if you can have a docking port attached to a structural fuselage attached to a station, so it sticks out nicely for easier docking?\n\nFinally, there exists the \u0027MKS Flexitube\u0027. Will connecting two stations like I have in the picture with a flexitube keep them from floating away from eachother? If not, how do you keep two stations from drifting away? Are only docking ports acceptable?\n\nThank you so much for any help you are able to provide."},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T19:08:47Z","Content":"since you have KIS, you should be able to move stuff around. remember to equip the black tool (forgot the name, is like the wrench but... yeah you know), then, while moving the object, press X to use the [***attach***](https://www.google.com.br/search?es_sm=93\u0026q=how\u002Bto\u002Battach\u0026spell=1\u0026sa=X\u0026ei=RyFiVZPtDsOXgwTJpIHoCQ\u0026ved=0CBoQBSgA) mode. be careful cause you cant move properly while grabing something. position yourself first, then do your things\n\nyou should be able to put normal dock or junior docks to those circular ports in your modules."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T19:10:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E since you have KIS, you should be able to move stuff around. remember to equip the black tool (forgot the name, is like the wrench but... yeah you know), then, while moving the object, press X to use the [***attach***](https://www.google.com.br/search?es_sm=93\u0026q=how\u002Bto\u002Battach\u0026spell=1\u0026sa=X\u0026ei=RyFiVZPtDsOXgwTJpIHoCQ\u0026ved=0CBoQBSgA) mode. be careful cause you cant move properly while grabing something. position yourself first, then do your things\n\u003E you should be able to put normal dock or junior docks to those circular ports in your modules.\n\nOkay, I will launch the next segment then with some docking ports in the storage.
