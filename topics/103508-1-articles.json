Your goal is to go to space and beyond, with each poster adding to the current technology to go to space better than the previous poster.\n\nHow \u0022better\u0022 is up to you.\n\nRules\n\n1. Only one upgrade in technology per post.\n\n2. Your upgrade can either be an add-on to current technology, or replacement of old technology. You can replace a whole bunch at once with one sufficiently advanced technology.\n\n3. Follow all rules of reality and physics.\n\n4. Only current and near future technology, no sci-fi.\n\n5. You have to explain why your addition makes things \u0022better\u0022. It doesn\u0027t have to be entirely logical - you are kerbals.\n\n6. Your destination is space and beyond.\n\n7. Have fun. A lot of it.\n\nFor example:\n\nPoster 1: I throw a rock to space.\n\nPoster 2: I use a slingshot to shoot the rock to space. A sling shot can shoot further than a hand can throw.\n\nPoster 3: I attach wings to the rock and shoot it to space with the sling shot. Wings will help the rock fly better.\n\nPoster 4: I attach wings to a potato and shoot it with a slingshot to space. A potato is lighter than a rock, so it will fly higher.\n\nPoster wacko: I bake the winged potato and shoot it with a sling shot to space. A baked potato is more delicious.\n\nLet\u0027s start!\n\nI throw a paper plane to space."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T12:07:33Z","Content":"I attach more wings to the paper airplane.
