Your goal is to go to space and beyond, with each poster adding to the current technology to go to space better than the previous poster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow \u0022better\u0022 is up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Only one upgrade in technology per post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your upgrade can either be an add-on to current technology, or replacement of old technology. You can replace a whole bunch at once with one sufficiently advanced technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Follow all rules of reality and physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Only current and near future technology, no sci-fi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You have to explain why your addition makes things \u0022better\u0022. It doesn\u0027t have to be entirely logical - you are kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Your destination is space and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Have fun. A lot of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoster 1: I throw a rock to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoster 2: I use a slingshot to shoot the rock to space. A sling shot can shoot further than a hand can throw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoster 3: I attach wings to the rock and shoot it to space with the sling shot. Wings will help the rock fly better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoster 4: I attach wings to a potato and shoot it with a slingshot to space. A potato is lighter than a rock, so it will fly higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoster wacko: I bake the winged potato and shoot it with a sling shot to space.
