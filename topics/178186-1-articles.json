They have \u0022dents\u0022 in them that are 45 degrees forward and behind vertical. It\u0027s being looked into by the devs, but there are no promises as to when it may be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will have to apply some force to get the rover to come back down to resting flat on the wheels. One additional problem with that is the command keys, and whether you have any reaction wheels on your rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have no reaction wheels, then simply pushing W should accelerate your rover, and that may be enough to reorient your rover. Or maybe hitting S to accelerate backwards, and then suddenly braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0have a reaction wheel, and you leave the controls set to the default -- then pushing W causes your rover to accelerate forward and also causes it to pitch down ... which is not what you want, because it tends to keep things they way they are. It may also be why your rover ended up sitting the way it is now. The easiest way to fix that is to go into the settings and pick some other key for \u0022forward\u0022 and \u0022back\u0022, for your rover.

It tends to happen on low-G worlds -- but it\u0027s not a problem with minmus specifically. There is a cheat you can use on kerbin called \u0022hack gravity\u0022 to lower kerbin\u0027s gravity to match minmus. Actually it lowers gravity in the whole universe, so if you want to use it for testing landers, it\u0027s best to test in a separate sandbox game, so nothing important gets messed up. But yeah, try hacking gravity on kerbin, and then tweaking the \u0022spring\u0022 and \u0022damper\u0022 values on your landing gear. You can often fix/minimize that kind of silly jumping problem by doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
