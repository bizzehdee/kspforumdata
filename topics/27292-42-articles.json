In the meantime, I went on EVA, and ended up bouncing off my ship, sending it (and myself) spinning out of control. Because I\u0027m a bad EVA pilot, I ended up over a kilometer away, and under 50% fuel before I managed to regain proper control and return to the ship.

Turns out the LEM design had way more LOX capacity than it needed for a simple down and up, and it was just a lander can, an X200-8, 4 large lander legs, an LV-909 plus the docking hardware to begin with (i.e. really light), so it was crazy easy to steer on the lander can\u0027s gyros alone. Was able to rendezvous with Elny in the CSM; just parked the LEM five meters away and jetpacked over. Didn\u0027t even have to use any of the CSM\u0027s delta-V for the rendezvous. Rest of the mission was routine. No soil samples retrieved, of course, but at least the crew got back safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad to plant a flag before I left Mun, of course.
