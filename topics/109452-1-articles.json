The charts in this thread will no longer be updated.\n\n==============================================\n\nFor a couple weeks now I\u0027ve been preparing a bunch of engine charts in the spirit of tavert\u0027s excellent [engine efficiency charts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR) using the new engine specs of 1.0. Here I present my results so far.\n\nThese charts are meant to answer this general question: *if I have a* ***payload*** *of certain mass that I need to take somewhere requiring a certain* ***\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv****, what is the engine that will give the* ***lightest possible ship****, and what is the* ***minimum mass*** *of that ship?*\n\nFor those who understand what these are and just want to cut to the chase, I\u0027ll start with the charts themselves, and leave the details below for interested readers.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Update 25/may**: I\u0027m working on an **interactive web app** to produce these charts on demand. It\u0027s still a work in progress, but you can see the state of the beta version here: [**http://meithan.x10.mx/KSP/engines/**](http://meithan.x10.mx/KSP/engines/).\n\n-----------------\n\n**1. Mass-optimal engine charts (vacuum)**\n\nThey show the optimal engine given a paylod mass and desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for several minimum (Kerbin-relative) TWR values. They are calculated for vacuum operations (see 1a below for atmospheric charts) and do not include SRBs and airbreathing engines. White areas indicate regions where no solution exists. The jaggedness is due to changes in the number of engines.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/N1xNb)\n\nHow to read these charts: Pick the chart with your desired minimum TWR, locate the total mass of your payload on the left axis (the scaling is logarithmic, so the dotted horizontal lines indicate multiples of the shown payload masses) and the desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv on the bottom axis. The color of the intersection point indicates which engine type is optimal.\n\nExample: suppose I want to take a manned lander weighing 20 tonnes (including its fuel for landing and takeoff) to Duna and back, which can be done with 3000 m/s. If we want a TWR of at least 0.5, looking at the [chart for min TWR=0.5](http://imgur.com/a/N1xNb#5), we see that the best engine is the LV-N.\n\n*Update 16/may*: the payload range now goes up to 1000 t.\n\n*Update 16/may*: I\u0027ve added some extra charts that include the PB-ION at the [end of the album](http://imgur.com/a/N1xNb#21).\n\n-----------------\n\n**1a. Mass-optimal engine charts for atmospheric operations**\n\nThese are calculated for the Isp and thrust values at 1 atm of pressure. They are intended as a guide for launch vehicle first stage engine selection.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Lvwa0)\n\n*Update 16/may*: added these charts upon request.\n\n-----------------\n\n**2. Total ship mass charts**\n\nThese complementary charts, each one computed for a (payload mass, minimum TWR) pair, show the total mass (payload \u002B propellant \u002B tanks \u002B engines) of the ship as a function of desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for all engines. The discontinuous jumps occur when the number of engines changes to accomodate the TWR restriction.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Find the desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv on the bottom axis, and read the corresponding total ship mass on the vertical axis for any engine. The lowest curve is that of the optimal engine.\n\nExample: revisiting the previous example (20 t payload and minimum TWR of 0.5), by looking at the [corresponding chart](http://imgur.com/a/Lodus#44) we confirm that for 3000 m/s the optimal engine is the LV-N, and we see that the total ship mass would be about 55 tonnes. By counting the number of jumps we see that the ship would need 3 LV-N\u0027s (so it achieves a TWR of 0.5). We also notice that the next runner-ups are the LV-909, the Poodle and the Aerospike, but they yield ships almost 15 tonnes heavier.\n\n*Update 16/may*: added charts for 200, 500 and 1000 t payloads\n\n-----------------\n\n**3. Maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv curves** (single chart)\n\nThis additional plot shows the absolute maximum theoretical \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv possible for each engine type as a function of minimum TWR. In practice, once your desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv starts getting close to this, the total ship mass will grow exponentially and quickly become impractical.\n\n[![uYmKuh9l.png](http://i.imgur.com/uYmKuh9l.png)](http://i.imgur.com/uYmKuh9.png)\n\nHow to read this chart: find your minimum acceptable TWR on the bottom axis. For each engine the value of the curve will tell how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv can be obtained, in the absolute limit, from that engine.\n\nExample: If you need 5000 m/s and a minimum TWR of 1.0, engines like the LV-N, LV-1/LV1-R, RAPIER, Mk-55 and 24-77 are no-go. The KR-2L, Poodle and KS-25x4 are probably the best choices.\n\nNote that the engine with the highest maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for a given TWR is *not necessarily the best*, as that will depend on how close the actual desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is to the engine\u0027s limit. Refer to the first two series of charts to find this out.\n\n*Added 16/may*: the following is an alternate version of this plot showing the full LV-N curve, as well as two curves for the PB-ION (not included in the general analysis). The curve labelled ION\u002BSPs is the PB-ION with its mass increased by 100 kg, which is about the weight of the solar panels needed to fully satisfy the electricity demand at Kerbin distance. Note that Xenon tanks have wet-to-dry mass ratios of about 2.3 (so \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 about 1.3).\n\n[![OXHJ2tnm.png](http://i.imgur.com/OXHJ2tnm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/OXHJ2tn.png)\n\n============================================\n\n**Assumptions and additional details**\n\n- **Single-stage ship**. As we all know, dropping mass allows reaching higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv values, but I\u0027m keeping it simple here. Above ~5000 m/s, it\u0027s probably better to use multiple stages.\n- **\u0022Payload\u0022** is defined as everything that is *not* the propellant, tanks or engines used to push the actual payload around. This means \u0022payload\u0022 includes stuff like structural elements required to mate the actual payload to the tanks/engines.\n- **Propellant quantity is treated as a continuous value**, so tanks are considered infinitely divisible. While this is not entirely realistic, one could approximate this in practice by using a large numbers of small tanks. In this respect tavert\u0027s analysis is still superior.\n- **Solutions consider a restriction on the minimum acceleration** (or, equivalently, Kerbin-relative TWR) of the final ship. This is done so they remain remain relatively practical (sure, a single LV-N will push 1000 tonnes to huge \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0027s, but it\u0027ll take *forever*).\n- **Assumes the full-to-dry mass ratio of the tanks is 9** (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=8) in general, except where noted. All \u0022rocket\u0022 LFO tanks have this ratio in 1.0.2, while the \u0022spaceplane\u0022 LFO tanks (i.e. Mk2-Mk3 tanks) have slightly worse ratios, very close to 8 (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=7). Note that my parameter \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 (alpha) is equivalent to the conventional full-to-dry mass ratio *minus one*.\n- **The change to liquid fuel only for LV-N is accounted for**, and I\u0027ve used a tank full-to-dry mass ratio of 8 (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=7), which matches closely the ratios of the Mk2 and Mk3 liquid fuel-only fuselages.\n- **The O-10 monopropellant engine is also included**, even though it doesn\u0027t excel anywhere. The full-to-dry mass ratio of the RCS tanks vary, but I\u0027ve set it to 7 (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1=6) which is close to the average value for the larger tanks.\n- **For the RAPIER, closed-cycle mode is assumed**, i.e. \u0022rocket mode\u0022 using liquid fuel and oxidizer.\n- **Engine specs for 1.0.2** are used throughout, extracted from the corresponding .cfg files.\n- **The number of engines is limited to 50** in the mass-optimal engine charts, but there\u0027s no limit in the total mass charts. This is to try to stay within the bounds of reason. I can recompute charts for a different limit under request.\n- **Some engines are left out of the analysis**: the LV-1R (no point including it since the LV-1 is always superior), the LFB KR-1x2 liquid fuel booster (would require a different computation), and, notably, the PB-ION ion engine (with 1/r^2 solar power scaling and fuel cells, this engine deserves its own separate analysis). Also, for now, all airbreathing engines and SRBs.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Formulas used in the calculations**\n\nFor a given desired \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv and payload mass (m\\_payload), the optimal (i.e. minimum) total mass of the ship for a given engine is:\n\n![vxRIrJm.png](http://i.imgur.com/vxRIrJm.png)\n\nwhere m\\_engine is the mass of the individual engine, I\\_sp its specific impulse, g0 standard gravity (assumed to be 9.82 m/s^2 in these charts; but see note below), and the number of engines, n\\_engines, is given by\n\n![GDEVWVN.png](http://i.imgur.com/GDEVWVN.png)\n\nwhere TWR\\_min \u003E 0 is the minimum required Kerbin-relative thrust-to-weight ratio of the ship, TWR\\_engine that of the engine itself, and ![807e2debc359ab4b141d93f1b47e6742.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/0/7/807e2debc359ab4b141d93f1b47e6742.png) is the *ceiling function*, which indicates that the result should be rounded *up* to the next integer. If no TWR restriction is imposed, n\\_engines is simply 1.\n\nIn these two formulas, the parameter alpha (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1) is defined as the *propellant-to-dry* mass ratio of the tanks (as opposed to the *full-to-dry* mass ratio, which is more common):\n\n![9sTrH8C.png](http://i.imgur.com/9sTrH8C.png)\n\nFinally, the maximum theoretical \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of a given engine depends on \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 and the minimum TWR as:\n\n![PVEL6Mg.png](http://i.imgur.com/PVEL6Mg.png)\n\nNote that this relation implies that the TWR of the ship is limited to be smaller than the TWR of the engine themselves, and the maximum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv possible approaches zero as the TWR of the ship approaches that of the engines.\n\n-----------------\n\nWhew! That\u0027s it for now. Hope these charts are useful and I welcome any error reports and suggestions on how to improve them.\n\nA special thanks goes to **Slashy** for cross-checking some of my figures, which helped me find a couple of typos in the engine specs.\n\nThese charts are calculated using Python and plotted with the matplotlib library.\n\n-----------------\n\n*Note 16/may*: **g0 correction**. After posting these charts, Slashy [pointed out](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121565-Optimal-engine-charts-for-1-0-2?p=1944931\u0026viewfull=1#post1944931) that the game seems to be using a value for g0 much closer to the standard value of 9.80665 m/s^2, as opposed to the reported 9.82 used pre 1.0. The impact of this on the charts [is very small](http://i.imgur.com/KMMAnYc.gif), so I\u0027ve left the charts computed with the old 9.82 m/s^2 value. I\u0027ll be using the standard value of g0 from now on.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T00:03:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:28:46Z","Content":"\u0022You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Meithan again.\u0022\n\n These charts are going to be indispensable for the community.\n\nI nominate this thread for a sticky.\n\n One possible (unconfirmed) error: I\u0027ve gotten word that the Isp conversion factor may have been fixed in KSP 1.0 and is no longer 9.82 like it was when this script was originally made.

And up to ~0.6 TWR it finds its place at the low mass / high \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv region (remember I\u0027m limiting the calculation to 50 engines, which is why it doesn\u0027t appear at higher masses for TWR \u003E 0).
