I know broken wheels are like the plague, so I brought along 3 engineers, two of which have a level high enough to repair them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr so I thought. Because when I looked up Nedi\u0027s skills in the astronaut complex, repairing wheels is one of them. But here I am orbiting Vall after like 50 gravity assists, and I can\u0027t repair the damn wheel on the miner (which somehow got broken mid-flight) because, after all, \u0022Crew member has insufficient Engineer skill level. Level 3 is required.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s up with this? Is it supposed to be level 2 or 3? I really don\u0027t feel like waiting another three years to send a better engineer to fix a wheel. Is there anyway to \u0022fudge\u0022 the wheel into being fixed? I don\u0027t think I\u0027d consider this cheating. In fact, I\u0027m the one that feels cheated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t usually play career, BUT, you could try to edit your save file.
