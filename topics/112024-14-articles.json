So half way to the Moon is half way to the Mun. Sometimes this results in parts that are heavier than you would expect.\n\nIn the case of dock ports, in KSP, the rigidity of a docked connection is affected by the relative masses of the dock port parts and the overall spacecraft(s). To allow Orion and other systems to have a rigid docked connection, those ports are typically 5t. Low mass versions of the CBM and IDA ports are also included for situations when structural docking is not necessary.\n\n**Orion Payload Expansion Cartridge**\n\n(continued)\n\nIts essentially a double service module fairing sized for the MPLM habitat.\n\n![cLDpnd.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img913/3365/cLDpnd.jpg)\n\n![acDL4B.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img538/5744/acDL4B.jpg)\n\n![tcQJwW.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img538/2318/tcQJwW.jpg)\n\n![YXwA9H.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img633/278/YXwA9H.jpg)\n\n![bCzVjG.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img901/176/bCzVjG.jpg)\n\n![5ymgTR.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/9179/5ymgTR.jpg)\n\n![fESVXK.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/6023/fESVXK.jpg)\n\n![cVxo0x.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img661/5459/cVxo0x.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T00:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"}]}
