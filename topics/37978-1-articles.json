But your actual stages and their order are all messed up. What i imagine, is that you were decoupling everything below the nuclear engine before the main central stack was finished burning. So you had this huge rocket pushing you from behind, but since you decoupled it, you had no control over it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this setup. Everything is exactly the same, i just fixed your staging problems. You should hit the spacebar when the first 2 booster stacks burn out, then hit it again when the second 2 booster stacks burn out. That will leave you with the main central stack still burning and under control.
