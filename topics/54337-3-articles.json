I\u0027m playing career mode and I\u0027m working on building a solid space station for refueling. Today, I decided to bring down my old space station because I have some new parts and better experience building. It only has two parts. the central hub with a manned piloting module and the habitation module that I had docked with it using a computer piloting module. I decided to do the re-entry burn together and separate upon entering atmosphere so I only have to do it once. I only need to get the single pilot down safely after all. The drone doesn\u0027t even have reentry safety chutes built in. It was intended to crash down. It all seems to be going according to plan up to this point. Upon entering atmosphere, I detach the two parts and lose control of the piloting module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had left my kerbal in the housing section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPanicking, I immediately determine I\u0027m going to have to do an EVA and safely guide him over. Not a problem. I can do that. At 65k I go to initiate an EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels are blocking the hatch. I hadn\u0027t bothered to retract them. Again, why bother? They are just going to crash anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sit and wait as these things slooooooowwwwly retract. By the time I\u0027m able to open the hatch I\u0027ve dropped below 60k. The piloting module is only about 10m away though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let go of the ship, drift a lot faster than I expected, bounce off the safety of the piloting module and start gyrating away. I can\u0027t get the spinning to stop. I can\u0027t even get the EVA suit controls out. The still-thin atmosphere helped me a bit here by slowing down the spinning enough for me to get control though. I have drifted 60-70 meters away from the ship I need to reach though and I\u0027m still falling through the atmosphere. I think I\u0027m at about 50k at this point. I\u0027m more distracted and panicked at this point so I wasn\u0027t checking as closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI slowly direct my way over to the shuttle. The hatch is on the other side of course. As I go up to come around the other side I see the other module is getting closer again. It is only about 7 meters away. Apparently, the weight and aerodynamics were causing it slow (it was ahead) a little faster than my other one. It is slowly moving to block my entry hatch. I propel myself down. Guide my Kerbal in towards the hatch, grab on, and enter at slightly over 40k. I\u0027m cruising at over 2300m/s relative to the surface. I reorient my ship, burn retrograde to slow myself, and get away from the other module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there I land safely.
