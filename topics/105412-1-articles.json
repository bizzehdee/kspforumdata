I pull to 45% and shallow out ever so slightly around the 15k mark. The Turbo Jets fart-out around 20k and they turn off. I switch modes around 24k meters and power to 70k apoapsis.

Sometimes things go well and the ship keeps its parts, sometimes not. The best solutions I\u0027ve found is either skimming the upper atmosphere around the 50k mark for as long as possible to decelerate, or going with a very aggressive de-orbit burn and dropping steeply through the atmosphere. Anything in between is a part-eater. I\u0027m convinced some of the aero parts are too weak.
