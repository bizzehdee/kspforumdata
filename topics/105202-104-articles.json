Jool was to have a dangerous radiation belt that would have encompassed Laythe. EVA or venturing into the belt in any manned craft without heavy shielding would spell death in a few minutes and the sun would have a near impenetrable field around it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also if I remember right, there was supposed to be basic solar weather and safe magnetospheres around certain planets. Kerbin would have had one that would have given full protection around Kerbin and the Mun. Moho would have had a very minor one (analog to Mercury\u0027s weak magnetosphere) that would only offer trace protection. No idea on the solar weather mechanics though. I guess there would be some sort of background radiation in relation to how close you were to the sun.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As for shielding, a nice end-tech module would be an artificial magnetosphere coming in a 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 size for ships and bases. It would give full protecting but require a lot of electricity to run and only protect what is inside the bubble, in a way similar to the bubble protection field the Alcubierre Drive add-on uses.\n\u003E \n\nPretty close, tho I am not aware of the original Squad design\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, goldenpsp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How is it an exploit?\n\u003E \n\nYou can starve your crew for 14 days, hop out, slap a life support canister on your ship and take a snack, drop it back in KIS storage, rinse and repeat.\n\nIt\u0027s a huge pain, but still technically an exploit."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T19:07:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a huge pain, but still technically an exploit.\n\u003E \n\nYou are still constrained by your KIS storage.
