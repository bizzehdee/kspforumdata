What is the formula for that anyway? I guess I\u0027ll have to go do some research. Did you have more than two reaction wheels in the lower stages?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T04:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a bit of a bug in between two versions, right now i\u0027ve only seen it in the VAB not sure if any ships in space were affected but here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESA4-LFT (the long 1.25m tank) on top of a Wildcat V, the thrusters have all shifted about a meter into the tank since the previous version.
