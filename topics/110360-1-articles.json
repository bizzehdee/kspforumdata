I\u0027ve launched both 3-stage and 4-stage asparagus in 1.0.2 and never had an issue. The only time I have issues with asparagus is when I get careless or distracted and do something stupid with the fuel lines (e.g. forget to put one in, or put in one too many), but in that case it\u0027s pretty obvious pretty quickly that something is amiss \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E, doesn\u0027t sound like your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious, just as an experiment, suppose you let one of those out-of-sync stages burn about halfway through (not all the way to flameout), kill throttle, and then examine the tank contents to compare the relative amounts-- will they be the same, or out of sync?
