I\u0027ve got a rather standard asparagus staged lifter, and the first two (out of three) stages run out of fuel just a bit out of sync, so that my rocket rotates maybe 20 degrees in the second between when one engine quits and when its partner does. I have to bring it back to prograde before I can detach the empty stage. \n\nAnybody else seeing this in 1.0.2?\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T15:31:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Perry Apsis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:21:29Z","Content":"That\u0027s odd, haven\u0027t seen it myself. I\u0027ve launched both 3-stage and 4-stage asparagus in 1.0.2 and never had an issue. The only time I have issues with asparagus is when I get careless or distracted and do something stupid with the fuel lines (e.g. forget to put one in, or put in one too many), but in that case it\u0027s pretty obvious pretty quickly that something is amiss ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif), doesn\u0027t sound like your problem.\n\nI\u0027m curious, just as an experiment, suppose you let one of those out-of-sync stages burn about halfway through (not all the way to flameout), kill throttle, and then examine the tank contents to compare the relative amounts-- will they be the same, or out of sync? (in other words, is this a fuel-tank problem or an engine problem?)"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:26:32Z","Content":"I had some weirdness, in a simple 4x symmetry fuel feed into a central tank and engine. The outer engine/tanks drained un-evenly; One of the outer four was full and not draining, but its engine was firing normally. I did a manual fuel transfer between two tanks to level that out. But of course the drain rate problem continued, and engines quit at slightly different times, causing minor problems ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI could tell something was not quite right, when I decoupled the finally empty outer engine/tanks: one of the engines of those four, drifted away from its tank like the node attachment was made of chewing gum.

Going to the VAB and stripping off the fuel lines, and then putting new ones on should fix it, even if you put the new ones right where the original ones were. What\u0027s important is to replace them, to reset things. It worked for me, anyway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T01:22:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:29:53Z","Content":"You all got it wrong! Hah!\n\nThe problem, as it turns out, was between the earphones. I had drained out some fuel to increase my TWR, and I hadn\u0027t done it quite evenly. Then I forgot I had done it. While I\u0027m somewhat proud of having stumped the panel, I must give at least some credit to the fact that I have the attention span of a squirrel.\n\nThank you all for your excellent suggestions."}]}
