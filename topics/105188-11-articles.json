I\u0027m not liking the fairings at all. Trying to make an interstage is a PITA, and there is no simple way I can see from fiddling around to make clamshells vs potato chips. If it requires a wiki page, it\u0027s a bad UI. Capsules in DRE/FAR worked as expected, a capsule reenters properly blunt-side down with SAS off. This requires constant control input in 1.0.\n\nThe SAS cannot deal with the atmosphere, if you set it, it gets very confused in the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:00:40Z","Content":"Dear SQUAD,\n\nIf you scroll down to the bottom of the KSP website, there\u0027s a picture of a rather nasty-looking (sorry) rocket made in some older version of the game; it even has the red launch tower behind it.
