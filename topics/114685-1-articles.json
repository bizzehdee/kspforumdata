It was this, rather than \u0022torque\u0022, which tended to make the WW2 single-engined fighters pull to one side during takeoff. Anyway, a clockwise prop would have an effect which a jet engine doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhotos of the real thing also show more streamlining of the crew pod. Maybe a Tail Connector rather than a reversed Nose Cone? There is a slight weight saving, but it would look a bit long. I\u0027m trying to stay Stock, but a Glass Nose nosecone would be a nice add-on part, whether for German WW2 aircraft or a B29/B36/B50.

You can easily replace oxidiser with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be surprised if KSP couldn\u0027t cope with asymmetry: that\u0027s a feature of the Space Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thingymajigy","CreatedById":136332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I half-crashed my ssto and it still flew rather fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9AiqpH3.png\u0022 alt=\u00229AiqpH3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
