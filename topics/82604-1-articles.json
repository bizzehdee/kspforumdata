When I put sepratrons on an S1 SRB attached by hydraulic manifold to an orange tank, the sepratrons fly off unexplainedly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional information: When I separate the SRBs shortly after launch (running or not), they separate just fine, and the Sepratrons don\u0027t fly off. However, when they\u0027re almost out or completely out of fuel, the Sepratrons fly off. Pre-firing them prior to decoupling doesn\u0027t help, since as soon as the hydraulic manifold decouples, the Sepratrons decouple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem DOES NOT occur if you use TT-38Ks or TT-70s, so I believe I\u0027ve narrowed this down to an issue with the hydraulic manifold part itself.

IOW, Sepratrons on the loose is a symptom, not the cause, of the underlying problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Kasuha says, in 0.24.2 there seems to be a decided lack of separation force in all decouplers but especially with the radial ones. What seems to be happening the radial decoupler\u0027s force is absorbed in breaking the struts necessary to keep the booster from wobbling. So then the booster is just sitting there in its original position except not attached to the rocket, so from here on, air and gravity will dictate where it goes. And with NEAR, the top of the booster will tip into the core every single time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means you absolutely have to have Septratrons now (you could often do without before). And you have to do them differently than before, too. Nowadays, you have to put a pair of Sepratrons perfectly horizontally at the very top end of the booster to keep its top end from swinging into the core. If the boosters are mounted so their nozzles are at or below the core nozzle, this is usually all you need. The boosters will fall behind and slowly rotate away, and by the time their nozzles swing into where the core used to be, the core will have moved ahead. However, if the boosters are higher than the core nozzle, or for whatever reason aren\u0027t mounted vertically, then you need another pair of Sepratrions on the bottom end, too. This will move the booster out straight sideways without it pivoting at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T23:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs Kasuha says, in 0.24.2 there seems to be a decided lack of separation force in all decouplers but especially with the radial ones.

In 0.24.2 there was a code change to fix one of the stack decouplers. Something in the way the rocket\u0027s velocity is applied to the decouplers was done incorrectly. Basically the decoupler isn\u0027t receiving enough velocity when initially separating, even though the rest of the separated part seems to be fine. So while stack decouplers aren\u0027t affected to badly, the radial decouplers are more obviously broken. The end result is that a decoupled part appears as if it experiences a sudden \u0022drag\u0022 on only the decoupler, causing radially decoupled parts to tip inward upon separation. If NEAR or FAR is installed, this initial tip inward then leads to aerodynamic forces shoving the separated parts back into the core. (This can still happen in stock, but it isn\u0027t quite as bad.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
