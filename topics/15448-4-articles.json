At that point more thrust produces little speed increase because of atmospheric drag and is otherwise wasted. Rocket engines don\u0027t save fuel with lower throttle, once they are traveling faster than the exhaust speed of the engine they are at maximum efficiency and throttle amount has no affect on efficiency. The only thing that increases efficiency would be a higher Isp. \u003Cp\u003EEr, what? What do you mean by power? Once you reach orbit, you\u0027re uh, in orbit. There is no aligning left to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t sound right at all. Rocketry and orbits are all about the speed you need to travel to fall correctly around the orbital body, this is why it\u0027s all about delta-v delta-v delta-v. If the orbit height you want to have takes a delta-v of 4500m/s to obtain, and I give you a rocket with an engine with a certain Isp and fuel quantity that gets you 4200m/s of delta-v, you can throttle however you want, you are not getting into orbit. It just doesn\u0027t work that way. You can\u0027t increase delta-v by lowering your throttle, if you are, what you are seeing is the fuel bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBack on topic\u003C/strong\u003E , I love MechJeb. I love all the information it provides, it\u0027s just a plethora of wonderous streaming data that I can use in so many ways! I tend to use it a lot on new craft so I can monitor everything, but then I usually get rid of it once I have flown a craft repeatedly. Probably for me the best thing about it is instantly seeing my apoapsis and periapsis without having to check the map. That\u0027s what I use the most often. I rarely use the automated features except for simple testing purposes, because it can repeat almost the same maneuvers exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022while more thrust, fuel, etc. will be needed to transfer a larger communication satellite from low Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit, the delta-v required is the same. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esee while delta-v is the same, there is obviously lee weigh in the amount of thrust and fuel required. which means you can most certainly save on fuel by throttling, especially when you weigh less than initial takeoff and other things like drag of the atmosphere reduces the higher you go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v is the speed you need to obtain to do things like gain orbit, it is not dependent on the ships mass or fuel mass nor amount used...how efficiently you gain that speed means you can vary the amount of fuel used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can\u0027t call it a fuel bug when it\u0027s about throttling efficiency. I think you\u0027re on a completely different page here. I\u0027m talking about the entire lift off from on the ground to orbit altitude, to going into orbit. you can save fuel by throttling during ascent. the delta-v may be the same for a maneuver, but the amount of fuel and throttle required can vary based on time and distance, with quite a bit in savings being possible. in essence, going 2000m/s by the time you reach your target means more fuel used than going 1000m/s instead. we can afford to lose forward momentum for a lower throttle netting us fuel savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-18T22:08:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2012 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T22:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekerb, the point others are making is twofold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) There IS a fuel bug in the current version. Aparently the thrust produced scales linearly with throttle, while the fuel used scales quadratically.
