Annoyed that mapping blade deploy angle to throttle can result in less thrust with more throttle? Wish you could just use the throttle to control the force of your propeller without finicking around?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell now you can! This mod will handle all of the details while you just fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to use:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd blades to any rotor. Make sure that they are aligned in the disc plane in their undeployed state and that increasing the deployment angle makes them take a bigger \u0027bite\u0027 of the air.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet them deployed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the rotor hub, select which mode you want:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThrust: Keeps the blade at its maximum thrust angle. Throttle the motor\u0027s RPM or torque to control your thrust.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThrottle: Makes the blade produce thrust proportional to the throttle setting. Set your motor to the desired RPM and a torque setting that will enable that. This is the default and probably easiest to fly with.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEfficiency: Keeps the blade at its most efficient (Thrust/Torque) angle. Throttle the motor\u0027s torque to control your thrust. This mode is likely the least useful unless you\u0027re trying to build a maximum range craft and even then...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFor you extra \u0027Kerbal\u0027 types, the math is there to try to optimize weird, non-radial or conic propellers but I don\u0027t guarantee it will be able to optimize anything. The steps above are well tested but I can\u0027t predict everything you\u0027ll try. If something doesn\u0027t work, please let me know and send me the craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a caveat on my promises of optimization: this optimizes the thrust of the propeller blade, not thrust-drag of the propeller blade. At high forward speeds, it might be a few fractions of a degree away from absolute perfection. I\u0027m working on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReverse thrust is also roughly implemented, but isn\u0027t perfect yet. I\u0027m still actively developing this but it\u0027s good enough to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownloads:\u003Cbr\u003E\nGitHub: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/DBooots/Pitch-Perfect/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/DBooots/Pitch-Perfect/releases\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceDock: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/2616/Pitch%20Perfect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/mod/2616/Pitch Perfect\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLicense: MIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDependency: Breaking Ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-09T20:17:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2021 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Booots\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mor128","CreatedById":64046,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T20:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds very useful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T21:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell right away I see with one of my\u00A0record attempt planes (EM-64s motors and loads of R-12 blades) the controller pushes the blade angle way too far. \u00A0I always found peak speed with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/fourfa/Speed-Demon-3-364ms-stock-props\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis craft\u003C/a\u003E at 62 degrees, but only after a long slow ramp up to that speed with a lot of time spent in the high 50s. \u00A0In Thrust mode, the controller jumped right to 66 almost right off the ground. \u00A0Then after a few maneuvers it seemed to get stuck at 53 degrees and never went above it again. \u00A0Reverting to runway, twice in a row it tried to launch with negative pitch (and tipped over and exploded). \u00A0Then back to the initial behavior. \u00A0I could not get it to repeat the speed record in that screenshot\u00A0until disabling and manually using the settings illustrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepeated with my Mk3 heavy speed plane - similar, blades go to a too-high setting too quickly (15\u00B0 too high)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry using physical time warp - typically I see the blades stretch out from the hub and start doing a bizarre dance, speed drops drastically, craft loses control. \u00A0Cancel physwarp and control is slowly regained - but the controller has become confused and seems to get stuck in a slower/lower pitch valley. \u00A0Not sure this is in scope through? \u00A0(BTW if you enable \u0022rigid attach\u0022 on blades and hub attachments it seems to be able to tolerate 2x physwarp, but not higher - and this seems to come with a speed penalty)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuto-feather on throttle cut is nice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStall recovery, and dynamically tracking during maneuvering is very nice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, maybe the reversing on launch has to do with brake being set on launch? \u00A0Is there a default braking routine bound to brake key?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the best way to help debug with details?

Are the blades \u0027regular\u0027 (do they emanate from the rotation axis and form a disc with zero deploy angle being flat in the disc)? The \u0027stuck\u0027 behaviour you describe could be what it does if it can\u0027t solve an equation - it will just leave the prop at the angle it was. It could also be that it\u0027s decided that that angle is optimal for high speed, which may not be the case for very high speeds since it doesn\u0027t account for blade drag in its decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I seem to have auto-mapped reverse thrust to brakes in the released version.

This mod was more of a tech demonstration/proof-of-concept. I haven\u0027t had time for modding in the last year\u002B (moving internationally and then learning to be a real-life test pilot) so I wasn\u0027t able to develop it any further. I had also started moving away from modding for KSP 1 thinking that KSP 2 was coming soon, but I may need to reassess that idea. If all the rumours turn out to be true, I\u0027ll be back to modding for KSP 1 again once my course finishes and I\u0027ll try to pick this up again. In the meantime, anyone is free to try to improve the functionality of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
