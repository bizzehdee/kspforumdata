However, using wings may offer an advantage.\u00A0Based on the lengths of the burns for the return portion of the boosters flight on the Orbcomm-2 mission,\u00A0I estimate the amount of propellant that must be reserved for the booster RTLS as ca. 46 metric tons (mT). This results in a large performance hit of a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/10/musk-plans-reusability-falcon-9-rocket/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E30% loss of payload according to Musk.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0However, estimates of wing weight are about 10% of the landed weight, which probably could be reduced to 5% with carbon composites. So for a F9 booster with an estimated dry mass of 20 mT to 25\u00A0mT, you would only need an additional 2 to 2.5 mT, and likely half that with composites. This would results in large reduction of the payload loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0But the question is could we use wings to allow a RTLS when the booster flies at hypersonic speeds, say, at ca.

That is much lighter, than an equivalent sized aircraft, like the Airbus A321, which weighs empty\u00A0~47 tons (including 2x2200 = 4.4 tons of engines)\u00A0for pretty much the same dimensions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a 100% difference, not 10%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mass of the engines is similar for both the\u00A0airliner and the\u00A0rocket, so the\u00A0difference in weight is mainly due to the stuff that makes the A321 fly like an aircraft (wings, structure, hydraulics, flight controls, landing gear, power, etc...)\u00A0and the stuff that makes it comfortable for people (pressurization, windows, seats, galleys, toilets, etc...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding wings, structure, APUs, hydraulics, and everything required to turn a booster into an aircraft (even without the people carrier equipment)\u00A0will make the total mass\u00A0much closer to the mass of an aircraft than to a rocket. Maybe not 100%, but certainly not 10%.\u00A010% mass penalty is what it takes to simply add landing legs and grid fins to the F9.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t necessarily need a heavy TPS, but the\u00A0X-15 flew to Mach 6.7\u00A0and needed a special ablative\u00A0coating.

Wings are one thing, but you need control surfaces and landing gear, which need hydraulics, some way to maintain pressure in those hydraulics (an APU or a propulsion unit). At Mach 7, you\u0027re also going to need some sort of TPS, so your wings can\u0027t be made solely of composites.
