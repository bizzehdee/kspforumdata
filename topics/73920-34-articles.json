As per my post above. As it is, I had to remove the engine failure module (left coolant failure alone) because my probes could never fire their engines after the long drift. I tried tweaking the MTBFs but then it made my lifting engines too reliable. Being able to flag parts or expand to user inputed part classifications would be sweet. Would cut down on mod integration and allow us to set our own numbers. A simpler approach could perhaps be a tweakable that allows each module to have a low, medium, and high reliability module (so a low engine, medium engine, high engine). With all defaulted to medium. This way the players could set them based on how they want the modules to work. Not sure exactly but that would likely cut down on processing instead of having a custom module tied to each and every relevant part type (and keep our save files from getting bloated). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course one could simply set everything to the highest, but what\u0027s the fun in that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T00:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Paul Kingtiger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Paul Kingtiger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Coffeeman, \u003Cp\u003ESo the idea is to have a tweakable slider in the VAB/SPH for parts, which allow you to lower or raise the MTBF for the part, with a appropriate adjustment of the port cost.

It would also be nice if I could get an engineer\u0027s report on what items are in need of inspection due to a probable imminent failure. This could be graphic, IVA, textual, or a computer voice telling me that it just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit and that it\u0027s going to go 100 percent failure within 72 hours.
