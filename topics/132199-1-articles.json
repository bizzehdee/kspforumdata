Water ice bodies in outer solar system may be too soft (at least those with significant gravity). Temperatures need less insulation and warming. Atmosphere gives little protection against radiation and micrometeorites and there are not highly radiative areas like around gas planets. Gravity is probable enough for humans. Soil is toxic on Mars but probably places with interesting organic materials on surface are much more toxic.
