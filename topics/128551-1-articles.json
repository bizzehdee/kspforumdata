I truly don\u0027t mean to be snarky but where do you stop? A tutorial about getting to orbit. That\u0027s nice, gives new players a helping hand. But now they\u0027re stuck because they want to go to the M\u00FCn. No problem - we can do a tutorial for that. Minmus - yep we can cover that too. The problem is that KSP is the kind of game where there\u0027s always another hill to climb and unless you want to provide tutorials for absolutely everything, at some point the players will need to start figuring stuff out for themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo show them how to use the interface and then let them cut their teeth on the early stuff and get into that \u0027figuring things out\u0027 mindset early on.

Changes under the hood from version to version can be just as frustrating for experienced players as learning the basics is for new players, if not more so. However, I worry about the size of the download for the game and for updates bloating if Squad tries to add tutorials for everything. Perhaps in addition to updating the basic tutorials that are already present, Squad could add links in the game\u0027s tutorial section that point to to well maintained wiki pages. It can be difficult to find current and relevant information through web or forum searches because of all the outdated information that already exists. And even if you find a current thread relating to a particular game change, it is often flooded with irrelevant opinions rather than actual fact based on game code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
