They\u0027re inverse functions of one another, and it\u0027s analagous to deciding to take the square root of a number instead of squaring it. For certain values of x, you\u0027ll get close enough to the right answer, but for most values of x, the answer you\u0027ll get will be very, very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-11T15:19:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2012 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by maltesh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T13:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEnhancedCookie, please spoiler your reaction images next time, especially rainbow-colored ones, that\u0027s a bit aggressive to the eye.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T14:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maltesh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maltesh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs Kosmo-Not implies, but I thought someone should explicitly state, you got really lucky here, and hit a mathematical coincidence.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was channeling Jebediah \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it would be nice to know if my implementation for hyperbolic transfer is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnhancedCookie","CreatedById":34037,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T09:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cykyrios\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cykyrios\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEnhancedCookie, please spoiler your reaction images next time, especially rainbow-colored ones, that\u0027s a bit aggressive to the eye.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk sorry, i was not sure how to...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlternNocturn","CreatedById":17872,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T08:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m doing wrong.
