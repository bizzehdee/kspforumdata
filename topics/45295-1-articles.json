But I have found that this causes the game to classify the modded ships as stock and makes it unable to be deleted. I wanted to know if there was some kind of bug or reason that people don\u0027t just include a ships folder in their mod folder. This would allow them to be distinguished from actual stock ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T12:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game only knows about 2 types of .craft files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is the /Ships/ folder, which it considers everything in their as stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe second is your crafts is /saves/\u0026lt;savename\u0026gt;/Ships/ These are the ones you can delete.
