I love trying design after design in hopes of finding the one that will take off! =D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it seems my imagination is being.... slightly limited by the current vanilla parts. If any and all are so inclined, can they perhaps suggest a good, maybe an excellent modpack and/or plugin? I am especially interested in ones which involve parts larger than the largest vanilla fuel tank, the Rockeo I believe? I don\u0027t remember off of my memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish to all good salutations, and safe and happy ( and in Jeb\u0027s case, crazy ) travels to the far reaches of space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECiao for now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - O.
