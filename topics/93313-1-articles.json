The \u003Cstrong\u003Eoriginal\u003C/strong\u003E parts are also darn expensive, heavy (30 tons/piece), and have weak attachments to each other which tend to cause Mass Accelerator stacks to break apart under the acceleration they create...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, from the first day I got my hands on the Mass Accelerator part, I went into the config and started making some modifications to make it more realistic.\u00A0 ORIGINALLY:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I increased the acceleration to 11760 kN/s (30 g\u0027s on a 40-ton rocket), and increased electricity consumption proportionally (this still needs some re-balancing: the original author states in config-file comments that he aimed for 1 MW per 100 kN/s- which equates to 10% efficiency, but it actually came out to 1 kW per 250 kN/s, if 1 EC = 1 kW).

It should always be available in Sandbox mode, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The vessel accelerated by the Mass Accelerator part MUST be a separate vessel. The easiest way to position something appropriately on the launchpad is to launch the mass driver \u002B rocket as a single craft with a separator-style decoupler between (one that doesn\u0027t remain attached to either craft), then fire the decoupler to break the two apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mass Accelerator will only work on a craft within about 10 meters of the loading end of the device (unlike a real Mass Driver, it can\u0027t work in either direction by reversing the direction of the electric current), and must be \u0022Armed\u0022 via the context menu before it can be set to fire. The craft must remain in range after the Mass Accelerator is armed, until it fires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mass Accelerator will tend to explode quite violently if the craft is not lined up straight, due to the vessel slamming into the interior wall of the Mass Accelerator during acceleration. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mass Accelerator only can accommodate vessels up to about 2.8 meters in diameter, although I wouldn\u0027t risk anything much over 2.5 meters if I were you... (these things are EXPENSIVE to replace)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mass Accelerator part obeys Conservation of Momentum! It *WILL* recoil if fired without being firmly anchored to the ground! This is actually a VERY USEFUL feature, though- you can set up a system of realistic Momentum-Exchangers in Low Kerbin Orbit, if you want, that steal the momentum of craft or debris you\u0027re de-orbiting (by firing them Retrograde), and transfer that momentum to other craft you\u0027re trying to boost to a higher orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Although not required, I recommend installing FAR with this mod, as it will allow a streamlined rocket to preserve more of its velocity from the Mass Drivers on the way up. A tall and well-designed 2.5 meter single-stack can EASILY have a terminal velocity of 700 m/s or more... (terminal velocity is normally the most efficient speed to ascend at from a Delta-V perspective)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Joint Reinforcement is also recommended. The stock KSP physics engine has a tendency to randomly shake large craft when they are loaded into physics (it\u0027s a fault of stock KSP, *not* this mod). This can be DEVASTATING to a 70-part stack of networked mass drivers weighing hundreds of tons held in place by Launch Clamps- so I recommend KJR to help prevent random launchpad explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-26T06:10:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2014 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T14:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFWIW someone on the Google\u002B forums was looking for a mass driver.
