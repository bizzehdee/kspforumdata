The Redstone did as I described and kept cutting the throttle, sending the vehicle tumbling out of control as a result of loss of vector thrust. The Saturn V however seemed to just ignore the terminal velocity limiter and simply burned red through the atmosphere to reach the targeted apoapsis in about fifteen seconds, although because the engine never cut out if flew straight and true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 seconds?

I was in a similarily long and eccentric orbit (actually I think it was somewhat longer and somewhat more eccentric, but similar orbit) with my ship between Laythes and Valls orbit with a new Laythe encounter right behind me when I tried doing fine tune closest approach to target (target being Laythe so I could fine tune the orbit I wanted), it simply refused to create the node. After I went past the apoapsis, it worked fine. So, I believe that error has to do with long travel times and the fact that the moons will have done many orbits in that period of time. Doesn\u0027t explain why it made the node successfully that first time and refused to the second time though.
