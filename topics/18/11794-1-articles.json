It keeps the song coherent and sticks it together like glue. \n\n3.)Voice - The timbre and actual pitch of the notes. Use this to bring character to your music. \n\n4.)Variation - This brings the song to life. Changes in the above elements help tell a \\\u0027story\\\u0027.\n\n5.)Melody - The beef of it. Major chords are perfectly harmonious, but minors are \\\u0027tainted\\\u0027 with a slight defect and sound beautifully off\n\nThe best songwriters can consciously control all of these things and make a masterpiece.\n\nExample:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrojrDCI02k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe low smooth voice and slow pace make this a calming piece. Little or no minor chords make it relaxing\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WuAwv1j8VA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe uke provides rhythm, with the strings and choir working together to vary the piece. At the end, with the trumpet, the change of pace and voice symbolizes the depression ending. \n\nHow to create original pieces:\n\n1.)A seed. Something to kick it off. Maybe you like a certain chord? Or have this mysterious tune stuck in your head? Good! Use that and \n\n2.)Apply the elements to the seed. It\\\u0027ll grow into a tree of notes and complexity, if you water it enough with \n\n3.)Emotion. This is what makes a song great. If you can capture a mood, or certain feeling, keep going! Learn how it works with\n\n4.)Experimentation. It\\\u0027s training to help you understand the notes and different methods. \n\nHope this helps!"}]}
