As I see it, the reason that all the organisms we see try to reproduce and further their genes, is not that that is inherent to life, but that the organisms that are best able to, and most predisposed to reproduce have more offspring, and thus are more populous. \n\nTake four bacteria. One really does nothing, it just sort of floats around in the water, another one who likes to eat copious amounts, number three which divides with abandon, and number four, which both eats and divides, it will probably not be long before only the offspring of number four are still around. Maybe number three will have some success, but not nearly as much. One and two were not going against some inherent rules of life, they just did not have any duplication of their genes."},{"CreatedByName":"Trann","CreatedById":83801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T05:34:41Z","Content":"Only humans try to find meaning in things.

In my opinion, life was never created or evolved with a singular goal in mind, so going off of that assumption you could say \u0022it has no meaning/purpose\u0022. However, life *did* spring from self-replicating molecules (at least according to most current theories) so from that standpoint, you could argue that the \u0022purpose\u0022 is to replicate/procreate. Actual meaning I don\u0027t think can be attributed to life, unless you believe life was created or evolved for a singular purpose, which seems highly unlikely to me, especially with the way evolution works. Evolution isn\u0027t targeted, it just rolls with whatever works best at the time. That\u0027s also the reason why evolution sometimes comes up with ridiculously intricate and complex solutions to problems which no logical thinking mind would ever come up with (seriously, have you *seen* the mechanics involved in human hand and finger motions?) but hey, they work.\n\nPersonally, I just don\u0027t think about it too much.
