I wound up in a full cast, elbow to fingers, for six weeks. Couldn\u0027t write a thing. Tried writing with my left hand, but it really wasn\u0027t legible. I wound up having to do most of my school work on a typewriter, which worked okay for prose and essay work, but math was a major pain in the keister. My math teacher knew that I was one of the smartest kids in her math class and that making me do busy work was unnecessary, cruel, even, when I was having to take an hour each night to tediously crank it out on a typewriter. So she told me, \u0022Go through the lessons each day and find the parts that you don\u0027t understand and make a note of those, and I\u0027ll tailor your lessons around those so you don\u0027t have to do as much homework.\u0022 The first day of this I brought the book up and showed her the only part of that chapter that I didn\u0027t completely understand. This particular math book was rather new, and it had a small section at the end of each chapter that showed how to perform that chapter\u0027s math functions in BASIC programming. I told her that this was the only part of that chapter that I was having any problem understanding. She gave a chuckle and assigned me a skeleton homework assignment for that night. But that got her thinking about it. And she did some research and decided that computers were turning into a big thing and that they should be teaching kids about them. So she put a proposal in front of the school board, and they approved, and she took a bunch of classes and got a bunch of certifications, and they bought a bunch of computers, and she started teaching the computer classes at our school.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I know this is all true because when I took my first computer class from her four years later she told this story in front of the whole class and said that if it hadn\u0027t been for my broken wrist she would still be teaching math classes. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T02:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish you well. \u00A0Its difficult when any part of the body is injured; whether we normally think about that part being useful\u00A0or just being there. \u00A0Turns out every part is important, but in the case of hands and communication, that\u0027s even more of a challenge without one or two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time you develop methods to overcome the challenges, you will be all healed up and will need to adjust back to normal. \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deaf3279","CreatedById":59456,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T04:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have horror itch in cast *grr* I tried use ruler to itch in there. my family told me \u0022It\u0027s bad idea!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T04:52:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222775949\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474950102\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259456\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deaf3279\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, Deaf3279 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have horror itch in cast *grr* I tried use ruler to itch in there. my family told me \u0022It\u0027s bad idea!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry a coat hanger loop... not the hook end, the loop end.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FOE16M2FI36FS0T.MEDIUM.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/16M2/FI36FS0T/FOE16M2FI36FS0T.MEDIUM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deaf3279","CreatedById":59456,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T16:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni dont see any those kind coat hanger loop since i was kid. now they sell huge plastic coat hanger\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T16:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n..you could use a mental trick and get used to the itch in the cast, accept it as a \u0022temporary\u0022 friend and maybe it won\u0060t bother you much anymore.
