I\u0027ve basically given up on trying to define \u0022The Best\u0022 of anything related to media: movies, TV shows, books, etc. Everyone is different, and everyone is going to have different criteria that define what makes a show or movie come out on top for them. I prefer to define things in terms of \u0022My Favorite\u0022. This was a show/movie/book that stood out for me and here is why. Even for me, it\u0027s difficult to nail down one show that is the top one. They all have different appeals in different areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake Babylon 5 for example. I think we tend to judge it through the lens of today. But 30 years ago, nobody had even tried to do anything like that on television. It was a five-season novel on television, where characters changed and grew and had story arcs. Back then that was not how you did television, especially science fiction television. It was groundbreaking. Joe Straczynski was lucky to get it made at all. It was a weekly event for us when it was in first run, we all gathered at my friend\u0027s boss\u0027s house, since he had the 80\u0022 Sony projection TV. We just sat on his couches with our mouths agape most weeks. B5 was probably one of the first things in my life I could probably say I was an actual fan of. So, it\u0027s one of my favorites. We\u0027re actually rewatching it as a family right now on DVD. (Because of course I have the DVDs...) Halfway through the second season right now and the kids are hooked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say another top favorite of mine (that may not be on everyone\u0027s list) is Lost. Fantastic show. It took the same idea as B5, a novel for television, and really polished it. It was all about the character development. The people who hated the show because they got all caught up in the mythology and the secrets and the stuff that didn\u0027t get explained totally missed the point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like a lot of the others listed above. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (The Body is still, I think, one of the best hours of television ever made. But you have to watch the entire show to that point to really appreciate it.)\u00A0 M.A.S.H. Firefly. I\u0027d like to make a couple other honorable mentions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix Feet Under is one of the smartest shows I\u0027ve ever watched. Probably the best series finale ever. I think it should be required viewing these days, considering the events of the last two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuturama is one of the most consistently funny shows ever made.

expect more than a couple few seasons, and had real no story line planned out, Hence why the 4th season really wanders.\u00A0\u00A0 Then that lack of planning is what got it cancelled in the 5th season (with plenty of warning, they were told they weren\u0027t getting renewed after 5 during 4).\u00A0 You can see the rushed wrap up in the 5th season and they try to round out the story lines.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 It\u0027s like JJ Star Trek vs JJ Star Wars.\u00A0\u00A0 He planned out Star Trek to the letter, while Star Wars was just an abomination of a cash grab.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, what actually happened is that when Abrams and Lindelof wrote the initial outline for the show, they were planning on four seasons. But the show was a smash hit, it (and Desperate Housewives, to be fair) brought ABC to the top of the ratings heap. So ABC kept coming back to Bad Robot, tipping dump trucks full of money on their doorstep, and saying, \u0022We need another season.\u0022 So they had to keep stretching what they had. Abrams wrote the initial story bible and kibitzed on set for the first season, but then he left for other projects and let Lindelof be the showrunner. But when it became apparent that the show was going to keep running way past four seasons, he came back in the third season and helped Lindelof rewrite the bible to extend the storylines. That\u0027s the main reason why the later seasons are weaker than the earlier ones. They had to stretch out the meat of the storylines and fill in with whatever they could come up with to make a season and a half worth of story fill out three full seasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-29T02:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224108163\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207431\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648519306\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270033\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, TheSaint said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had to stretch out the meat of the...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat explains the sawdust and bread crumbs....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224108041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207431\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648492606\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnight Rider, Airwolf, CHiPs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow those are a blast from the past I enjoyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224108017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207431\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648489863\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand believe it or not, the old Emergency!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Rampart, this is Squad 51...\u0022 still comes through loud and clear on my memory circuits.
