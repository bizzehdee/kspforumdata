It doesn\u0027t help that I am computer illiterate. My question is I\u0027m buying a laptop. I\u0027m on a budget. I\u0027m looking at the acer aspire e5-573g. Will this run ksp? Is there a better direction to go? Budget is 700 U.S. I\u0027m pretty positive this has been answered here before but like I said, I have searched all day and I still have no clue and I am 20X\u0027s as frustrated. Any help would be great. Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T03:59:05Z","Content":"As this is not about the game itself, the thread has been moved to the off-topic lounge."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T04:15:59Z","Content":"The thread you want is [The Computer Megathread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25004-KSP-Unofficial-Official-Computer-Building-Buying-Megathread-%28All-Questions-Acceptable-%29).\n\nShort answer: That laptop will run KSP, but not nearly as well as a comparably priced desktop will.\n\nLong answer: See the thread above ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ChikenHawkFL","CreatedById":149582,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:00:32Z","Content":"Thank you.
