I can\u0027t decide on a chip, and I\u0027d like to ask for some help.

I want to spend about $250 on the chip and motherboard at the moment, and both of those are in the neighborhood. Actually, the AMD is $50 cheaper and looks to be slightly faster in most multi-core processes, assuming I\u0027m reading the benchmark numbers right.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe i7s look nice, but I can\u0027t afford them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI am not opposed to finding an older 32-bit or 64-bit chip that will run KSP especially well; I have enough boxes and hard drives that I could actually put together a system dedicated to KSP. However, I would prefer to build for the future and be able to use the new chip for my usual stuff and my gaming.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI am not currently planning to buy a dedicated video card, but I can be pursuaded. Ubuntu really only plays well with nVidia, and even that is a bit of a hassle sometimes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand KSP for Linux has a 64-bit version, but I don\u0027t know anything about it. Does it utilize more than a single core? I thought the problem with 64-bit KSP was the fact that Unity is 32-bit at the moment, so I don\u0027t quite know what to think. Can someone shed some light on this for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not necessarily all AMD or all Intel. Most of my chips have been AMD, but that\u0027s more a function of familiarity and price than anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I\u0027ve seen the CPU Performance Database thread, and am working my way through it at the moment.

The Intel chip is going to be substantially better.

An i7 won\u0027t improve your performance much, as ~4 GHz is about the fastest clock speed you can get a core to go at, so the higher end cores are more focused on multithreading, something the Unity engine is not very good at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T23:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barefoot Friar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Barefoot Friar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo I need to expand my search a bit?
