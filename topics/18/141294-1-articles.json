I don\u0027t even know why, maybe it was the love to the American McGee\u0027s video game, maybe to the first book. I did read Alice in Wonderland, but the second one was obscured by everything else, and I don\u0027t really love reading, frankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what to say about the film - the critics (at least some) say that it\u0027s terrible. I say that it\u0027s just as terrible as Proton-M - you see it exploding many times, and laugh at the creators, but when it flies at the end, when you leave the theater, you realise - it\u0027s not that bad after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally the film is not horrific, but I do have some complains. First - I don\u0027t know if it was so in the book, but Alice is a ship captain. That seems somewhat strange, I doubt that in the IXX century women were really on ships other than on civilian ferries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story isn\u0027t very surprising too. Alice occasionally locates Wonderland using a mirror, and the old characters are like \u0022oh oh oh the hatmaking guy is feeling very bad go grab a magic sphere and save everyone\u0022. And guess what - that\u0027s exactly what happens!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can say some good things about it though. The visual effects are not bad and totally are enjoyable. I will not reveal any major spoilers, but the ending gives you a \u0022hope\u0022 that there will be no happy end. But yeah, the end\u00A0is semi-happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mark: A rusty mirror out of 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
