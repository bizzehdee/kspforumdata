It said there was an error and I needed to sign into account.live.com. It asked me multiple times for my phone number and multiple times I foolishly entered it. It wasn\u0027t until afterwards, playing a Minecraft server, when I realized my mistake. It had repeatedly asked me for the phone number, so many times that I should\u0027ve been suspicious. But I wasn\u0027t. Soon after, my phone restarted suddenly when I was using it. Like, minutes afterwards. Then in my Discord DM\u0027s I got sent a job application that looked fishy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the hell is going on?

I did every type of scan in my Avast Free Antivirus (boot scan, deep scan, explorer scan, etc.) and they all came up clean. I did a check of processes myself in Task Manager and there wasn\u0027t anything of interest... Actually, I tell a lie. There was one thing that slightly alarmed me. It was a process, supposedly Microsoft, running in the background called \u0022YourPhone.exe\u0022. I had no idea what it was and googled it.

I hope you had an enjoyable time on holiday! That was an interesting read. I would disagree (again not a cyber security expert or anything just a regular guy who knows enough to be spooked) that its harmless. Its still malware and this is just my own stance: malware is never harmless, it is there against my consent doing things I did not authorize. Id say even just using you as a farm is not ok.
