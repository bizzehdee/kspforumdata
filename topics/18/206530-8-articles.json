Then I watched or rather TRIED to watch episode 3. And after 10 minutes walked away. Its written badly. It treats the source material like its a suggestion. It feels more like a grotesque mockery of what Star Wars is. It has the feel of what a child would write as a story if all they knew of Star Wars were bad memes. Its clear its a cash grab and a shoddily executed fever dream of a flu induced fever dream of a bad bout of food poisoning would conjure up in the throws of a dehydration induced hallucination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy opinion ofc but id say the majority of star wars fans seem to agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n204007032024\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroWolfie","CreatedById":223932,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-04T05:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last episode was FREAKY\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-04T18:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224403373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719869658\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/1/2024 at 11:34 PM, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u2019t interested enough to watch at all, and the first episode wasn\u2019t too interesting but after I got to two a couple days later I watched all the way to the latest episode (5) in one sitting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s not astoundingly great but it\u2019s good, IMO.

For a long time those guys were pretty loud in asking for High Republic content and the moment it hit it turned into a poopstorm over the tiniest things. Then there were people complaining about the complainers, and complainers about the complainers about the complainers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStar Wars has always been political. Empire vs. Rebellion was an allegory for the Vietnam War (or what George thought about it anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe prequels opened the door to a little more \u201Cgreyness\u201D in the way the franchise approached politics, because you have the Republic fighting against the tyrannical Confederacy, but in the end it just results in it becoming the Empire. The Clone Wars animated series wasn\u2019t really able to touch on this because it was limited by the good guy vs. bad guy Saturday morning cartoon format, but Andor has kind of touched on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even then, Luke believing there was good in his father and him turning on the Emperor in the end is (a very tiny) degree of greyness in the OT, rather than black and white evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Although that probably wasn\u2019t what George intended originally, but that\u2019s a topic for another time)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree it often seems like they don\u2019t care about the story. I think part of why there a lot of prequel fans nowadays is because even though the dialogue wasn\u2019t great, it had a coherent story crafted by one man.
