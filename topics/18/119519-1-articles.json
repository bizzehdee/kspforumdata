Later on he mentions that he does this kind of thing all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do recommend watching this video, it shines a lot of light into the effort of making the anime. If you haven\u0027t seen it, I highly recommend watching it, even if you\u0027re not a particular anime fan. It shows spaceflight very realistically and has a great plot and believable characters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7XL3CbMRaQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T19:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing that he narrated that episode as it had a strong relation to his interests in space flight.
