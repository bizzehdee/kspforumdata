I want to throw up right now. I want to run out of the room, and just run back home. I don\u0027t mind looking at the insides of animals, like through computer programs, or 3d models or whatever, but not physically slicing open an animal and looking at the different parts. That\u0027s too much for me.

However, as someone who has lived through this part of a biology class, I can tell you some stuff you benefit it greatly be seeing it in person. Like for instance, they can tell in a manual \u0022this part of the whatever looks like this and is identified by some structure or something\u0022 But most of the stuff just looks like one thing. Like a brain for instance. Its all just white kinda fleshy stuff. That\u0027s something not conveyed by a 3d model or diagram, since it\u0027s all nicely divided up into menus or whatever. I also personally find it fun to explore into something you never get to see normally. Like, you can\u0027t often see how the small intestine is wound up inside of the stomach, or how the diaphragm separates the lung and the heart in a pig, or how the lung, while described as an air filled sac, felt and acted more like one fleshy-thing in a fetal pig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I looked at it is that the animal is dead.

We had one time mealworms and cockroaches in our class for some behavioral thing. I got permission to... kill two specimens and dissect them because I wanted to see what was inside. Let me just say before I continue, that these were bought at a pet store or something similar, where the animals were going to die, for food. The mealworm and cockroach were procured alive, meaning they had to be killed. The way I did this was by literally drowning them in hydrocarbons. Think acetone and rubbing alcohol. Not very fun way to die, before being cut open by me. Also, I think one of them was not quite dead... yeah I\u0027m not going to continue.
