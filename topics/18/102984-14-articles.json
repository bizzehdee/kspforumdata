I started bawling my eyes out.\n\nThen he started going on a stupid rant abt how attachments don\u0027t matter and how he would have ditched SpaceX if there were no profits. He essentially became how I picture Mortimer Kerman in my head.\n\nThen there was a huge earthquake, and Elon fell in a crater.....\n\nThen I woke up, and one of my teachers was shaking me awake, looking very worried.

As in, it literally felt and looked like when awake, with amazing realism.\n\nFrom what I recall (it was about 7 hours ago), I noticed something weird going on, and did a nasal reality check. I could breathe normally beyond a shadow of a doubt, so I knew I was dreaming. I was actually surprised by this, due to the incredible vividness. Felt like I was normally awake, but in another place.\n\nI don\u0027t remember the exact details, but I started off walking on the street, and went to a corner store to buy something. Bought it for about 5 currency units which I spawned inside my pocket by thinking, got the change, and started walking towards the exit. Just as I was leaving, someone I didn\u0027t exactly want to be there showed up, and I attempted to de-spawn them at least twice, with no success (I\u0027ve been refraining from speaking out loud, which is WAY more effective, due to being afraid of saying it out loud in real life. Not sure if that\u0027s a real risk, though.). So I just went and left, knowing there would be no consequence.\n\nAs I was leaving, I thought to myself, it would be nice if I could have a faster mean of transportation. Just as I thought that, my car was waiting for me, properly parked on the street and all. I just reached in my back pocket and got the keys, went inside it (everything looked correct), got ready and went for a drive.\n\nI was driving well, traffic seemed really realistic. The city looked nice. However, I started going up a hill some time after, and a thought struck me: I had no idea what was going on in the REAL world. Literally none of it. I could\u0027ve been doing something completely inappropriate by now and I wouldn\u0027t be able to know it. Just like how a pilot needs his instruments to know where he\u0027s at, what\u0027s happening around him and what to do during a storm or IFR, except my instruments were gone.\n\nI then attempted to suppress this thought, which I knew could destabilize my dream, by dismissing the real world. Then, suddenly this pain struck me, it felt like my kidneys were ten times their size inside me, or that there was some kind of rope getting tighter and tighter over my waist. I took my seatbelt off, but it didn\u0027t help at all. It was really getting uncomfortable, so I gave up and, unfortunately, woke up. I woke up lying sideways, but I have no idea if it was the reason for that.\n\nIt\u0027s really unfortunate I woke up, though.

From what I remember, it started off at some random university with a guy playing a recorder, while me and a few others were laughing ourselves off.\n\nThis teacher suddenly comes out of a room, unbelievably angry at us (speaking calmly though), to the point he sincerely wanted us to fail at anything thing we tried to do, saying we won\u0027t be allowed in his class, ever. Turns out we were his students, he was a chemistry professor.\n\nI didn\u0027t really care since I was actually supposed to take that class the next semester and would just pick another, less bothersome teacher. Thing is, for some reason I decide to go in anyways, just to find the weirdest scenario I\u0027d seen yet.\n\nClass was dead silent. The teacher didn\u0027t even acknowledge my existence. One of the guys I was previously laughing with was up front, writing sequences of letters on the whiteboard, while another dude was making a digital circuit diagram beneath it.\n\nI asked a girl who was beside where I sat down what the hell was going on, how bizarre this was. Apparently what the guys up front were doing was to accept they were wrong, and to be let back in to the class, knowing that they were going to be absolutely ripped to shreds when it came to grades no matter what score they got in tests.\n\nI was commenting on how this was messed up, what kind of powers does this teacher perceive to hold, how in this case I was actually supportive of reporting the teacher to the chemistry department. Heard a \u0022silence!\u0022 coming from him (directed at the entire class - we were the only ones talking, but he still had not acknowledged me), so I got my phone and signalled to keep talking over text.\n\nThis girl then starts saying I\u0027m next, how I should not accept his \u0022offer\u0022 (to be willingly screwed over) in any case. Suddenly, the teacher actually calls my phone. I had no idea how to react to all the nonsense going on. Went ahead and declined the call. Looked forwards, there he was. Looking through some sort of student registry, looking at my info.\n\nHe grabbed his phone, and I had now received a text from him, which I\u0027ve read to be \u0022Hello miss, I\u0027m here to inform you of your son\u0027s misbehaviour and how it will affect his semester\u0022. What?\n\nThe guy was actually trying to report this, I don\u0027t even know how to describe it, to my family as if I was in high school or under. I just looked at him, in disbelief on how out of touch with reality this guy must be. Dream collapsed.\n\nDefinitively the weirdest dream I\u0027ve had in terms of storytelling.
