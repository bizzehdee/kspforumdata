This was proven to be false by a player. Then the online requirement made the game unplayable for huge amounts of people because the EA servers simply died upon launch. This took weeks to fix and even prompted them to give out free content for compensation. Finally, after quite a bit of doing, they removed the online requirement, though other DRM measures seem to remain intact.\n\nThe game was launched March the 6^th^ 2013, while single player mode was introduced the 18^th^ of March 2014, so over a year later. Regardless of if and when they fixed things, things like these are exactly why SimCity gets such a terrible rap. Rightfully so, because it all is just polishing a turd and this is just a part of the problems.\n\nOn the surface they finally managed to make it look somewhat decent, but as soon as you play a little longer problems really start piling up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T10:29:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T13:58:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are they allowed to put \u0022PC-DVD\u0022 on the box for a code?

I spend about half my life tethered to a cell phone so I both worry about bandwidth caps AND bandwidth-hogging downloads. I let Steam run most of the time in offline mode, and only turn online mode to check for updates and buy a game. I have never, ever even been warned about my bandwidth.\n\nIf you have similar concerns, I suggest you click on \u0022Settings\u0022 on the forum above, and \u0022General Settings\u0022 on that page on the left.

I checked SystemRequirementsLab and that was the only issue for minimum requirements.\n\nThe specifications are not totally complete, so you would need to check the motherboard to see whether you have a free PCI-E slot - you most probably will - and the brand and cables of that 500 watt PSU. If it is a decent brand you can use it fine, but if it turns out cheap you will need an upgrade. If your video card requires additional power cables your PSU obviously need to have those available to provide it with the power it needs. If that is all in order upgrading is just a few easy steps:\n\n- Open up case\n\n- Ground yourself to prevent zapping parts with static electricity, for instance by touching the grounding pin (and none other!) on a wall socket or an unpainted radiator tube. Avoid wearing extremely static clothes, like fleece.\n\n- Unscrew and remove the appropriate metal back slot cover, slot in the video card and fasten the securing screw.\n\n- Hook up any and *every* power cable the video card takes\n\n- Close case\n\n- Hook up monitor to video card\n\n- Install appropriate drivers\n\n- Profit!\n\nIt looks like quite a list, but is in actuality a relatively simple procedure. If you don\u0027t do anything overly stupid, things should be just fine. Be aware that the processor is not the most powerful, so there is no use in buying an immensely fast video card.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what the inside looks like, it\u0027s probably full of dust, and I\u0027m afraid I might break something if I open it up. The other option is getting an entirely new PC.\n\nBy far the most likely way of damaging something is by static shocking a part. Electronics are sensitive to that. If you take care to prevent that you really need to stab something with a screwdriver or smear thermal paste into a socket to easily hurt things. Be gentle, of course, but things are not made out of soap bubbles in there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T13:40:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 01:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T15:19:25Z","Content":"You can bypass steam by opening games from their steam installation directory.
