Before that I used Cakewalk. In general, Cubase is highly recommended, two of the bands I was in used it, though I never went down that path myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are purchasing software, VST support is an essential feature. I can\u0027t think of a soft-synth offhand that doesn\u0027t use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magazine Computer Music features a lot of free software on their coverdisks.

You should be able to find a free vst-compatible one quite easily. Once you have that there\u0027s a whole world of free vst plugin instruments and effects to explore. Finding the right package for free may be a minor issue though - you\u0027ll probably find that commercial packages have larger communities and are easier to find tutorials for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
