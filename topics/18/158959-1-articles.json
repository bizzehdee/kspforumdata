We have 4 locations that are somewhat removed\u00A0from one another, two of them being in the basement where cellphone reception is mediocre to nonexistent, so communicating with guys that are down there requires someone to walk over there and back. The other two locations are currently covered by a regular landline\u00A0and wireless handsets that have intercom feature. We get our connection to the rest of the world via an optical cable that brings in phone, internet and TV. We would like to keep these services and preferably have the option for phone calls on all four location (both incoming/outgoing and call transfer and conference). We have our wired LAN stuff on all four locations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my understanding that IP phone system would meet our in house comms need, but I\u0027m not sure how does that work with outside calls. We don\u0027t need VoIP, we have regular phone line for that, so this system would only need to deal with local phones. How does IP phone setup work in that regards? Do we absolutely need a service provider, or can we use our own local PC to do the server thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp, I\u0027m really clueless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I think about it, handsets are an option too, but for the two basement locations the signal would need to penetrate several\u00A0\u0026gt;1m\u00A0thick brick walls diagonally (20-30 m distance). I\u0027m really not sure if the ones we currently have are strong enough. I\u0027ll test it tomorrow, but in any case, these particular ones don\u0027t support more than two handsets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-09T21:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a lot of different options for this, and I doubt I can easily make you less confused, sorry. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223015489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158959\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491761521\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my understanding that IP phone system would meet our in house comms need, but I\u0027m not sure how does that work with outside calls.

What you mean is that you don\u0027t want to replace your existing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_inward_dial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDID\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0service with a VoIP service, and that\u0027s fine. The piece of equipment you seem to be looking for is called an \u0022IP PBX\u0022. It can run an internal VoIP network with IP phones, or \u0022soft phones\u0022 that are basically software running on people\u0027s PCs. It will let those soft phones dial each other, as well as act as an interface to your existing phone lines, allowing your IP phones to make and receive external calls as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0build an IP PBX yourself using open source software and your own PC hardware. But it requires extra hardware to terminate the inbound phone lines, a lot of in-depth knowledge and experience, and a fair amount of ongoing maintenance work. I wouldn\u0027t recommend exploring this unless you\u0027ve got an idle programmer who\u0027s keen to get their hands dirty building telephony systems. But there are a lot of services around that can sell and set up the system you\u0027re looking at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cheapest option though is a standalone in-house communication system separate from your existing phones. Team communication apps like Slack and HipChat are free to get started with (although HipChat\u0027s voice/video calling features aren\u0027t in the free tier \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0), they\u0027re easy to use and the call quality is decent enough.
