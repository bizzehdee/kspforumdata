But you know what those puddles have? Plants, algae, and bacteria that act as a filtration system to process all the waste products of the animals that live in them.\n\n1. Bettas are tropical fish and they wont last long in an unheated bowel.\n\n2. A bowl without any kind of filtration will slowly fill up with ammonia until you do a water change. The constant build up and reduction of ammonia will stress and eventually kill the fish. Ask your sister how she\\\u0027d like to spend her life locked in a closet filled with her own waste and only having it cleaned out once a week. \n\nProperly cared for bettas can live for upwards of 6 years. Your sisters probably wont last more than a few months.\n\nIf she\\\u0027s actually interested in keeping it alive she needs to read this and take it to heart.
