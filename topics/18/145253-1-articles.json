The current trending science topic is the hyperloop, wich people think is a cheap and efficient way to travel. But i dont think its better, there are alot of things that are bad about the hyperloop, and i think people are going to learn a lesson someday if they build that thing, like the Hindenburg. Its like shooting a bullet in an expensive gold tube, and then trying to recover that bullet, without a scratch. Impossible. So is there a better way! Oh yeah! It only requires a spaceplane, no super long and hard to make tube. The idea is that the spaceplane goes on a suborbital space to a its destination that is far away. You could travel to the other side of the world in at least an hour. Its cheaper to set up than the hyperloop, and much safer. And its also more of adventure, because you get to feel zero gravity, and you get a very special view from Earth, via your window. And of course, im comparing this to the hyperloop (wich i call the steel tube of death), not to the normal airplanes, wich i think are even safer than the spaceplane idea. What do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T15:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypersonic airlines...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T15:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222701569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145253\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470152409\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypersonic airlines...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr suborbital airlines.

The cost projected for hyperloop is similar to the cost for two major airports, but then when you get more destinations and more possible routes the cost of hyperlooping them all goes up way faster than the cost of airports. Not to mention the world *already* has loads and loads of airports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major drawback to current-day commercial air travel is loads of waiting. Waiting to check in, waiting for security, waiting to get your bags back at the other end. Plus the time taken to get too and from the airport. The last time I flew it was about a two hour flight, but that ballooned to \u003Cem\u003Efourteen\u003C/em\u003E hours door-to-door. I could have driven instead and it would have been no slower. But that\u0027s not inherent in the technology, it\u0027s an operational issue. It will also be an issue with hyperlooop. You\u0027ve still got to get to and from the loop stations. And think about what might happen if someone sets off a bomb in a hyperloop car, and I\u0027d say \u0022airport grade\u0022 security would be warranted with all the delays and other negative aspects that entails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T17:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOil is - planes are.
