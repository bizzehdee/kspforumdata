But I guess I kind of drifted away the past few years, because I just now realized that Civilization V is out. I was wondering what you guys think of the game before I buy it. It looks really cool from the screenshots, and I\\\u0027ve read a few reviews, but I\\\u0027d really appreciate your opinions on the game. \n\nSome details I know I like so far:\n\n\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Less micromanagement\n\n\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Being happy in one city makes you happy in others\n\n\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Pretty amazing graphics\n\n\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Long-range fighting\n\nAlso, I was wondering if there was any way to get the map maker off Steam without getting the game from a box or from Steam itself; my parents are really untrustworthy about giving their credit card information, so I have to download it off Amazon, which we already have an account on."},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:06:32Z","Content":"Actually i hate the new combat system like the plague, but otherwise than that, there isn\\\u0027t much wrong with it.\n\nI feel like the game has been made \\\u0027\\\u0027child-friendly\\\u0027\\\u0027 and i am a micromanagement loving person."},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T20:10:13Z","Content":"Ah, you\\\u0027re in luck! I got this game last year, and just recently (2 days ago) started playing again!\n\nIf you have less than 8Gb of RAM, do not buy it.\n\nWhen I got it last year, I had 4Gb of RAM. The start of the games were fine, but the longer a game went on AI turns turned into crippled turtle races.\n\nEach AI turn took about 1 minute or longer. It doesn\\\u0027t sound bad, but it really is and makes it annoying to play/finish games.\n\nNow that I have 8 Gb, I\\\u0027ve noticed the game is MUCH more bearable.\n\nI\\\u0027ve noticed the AI turns are still slowing down a bit (I\\\u0027m on turn 400 or so, 1920\\\u0027s), but nothing like before.\n\nMy RAM usage is around 6.2 - 7Gb (I turned my system PageFile off though, so about 2Gb is just Windows, not the game).\n\nGraphics are really great. Things get jumpy while the AI take their turns, but I really think that\\\u0027s just a processing slowdown. During my turn, everything is pretty smooth.\n\nCombat:\n\nThe grid is a Hexagrid, not Octagonal.\n\nWhich is better? Eh, I don\\\u0027t really think one is better than the other, but I prefer Hexagrid. It just makes things more interesting, and a little graphically smoother in some regard.\n\nYou cannot stack units anymore. (Except when you have 1 unit guarding a city, and that city produces a new unit, then it will be stacked until you move 1. I\\\u0027m not sure how fighting works in that situation)\n\nPersonally, I like this. It makes warefaring much more lengthy and require planning.\n\nYou can\\\u0027t just create one super army that wipes through an entire nation.\n\nYou have to build many units, arrange them to encompass the city (without grid-locking them!) and have them all attack then.\n\nRanged units are great for this type of warefare\n\nYou can have a Melee unit next to the city and ranged units several hexagons away shelling the city.\n\nHowever the occasional grid-lock sometimes gets annoying, but not game breaking.\n\nYou units can pass *through* other units, they just can\\\u0027t land on top of them.\n\nFor some reason though, I couldn\\\u0027t pass through one of my allied City-States units. I\\\u0027m not sure why.\n\nCity-States are kinda eh.\n\nI never really found them useful. This past game I specifically designed my nation to utilize them (lots of bonuses to make City-State relationships more efficient).\n\nThey do give you units occasionally (which is very nice), but they don\\\u0027t really do too much more.\n\nTechnically they\\\u0027re like allies that can\\\u0027t backstab you (more or less), so if you are an ally with them, then they\\\u0027ll go to war with you.\n\nBut they don\\\u0027t really do much :l\n\nThey most I\\\u0027ve seen them do during a war is\n\nA.) Give me a unit\n\nB.) Serve as a distraction against my enemy. The enemy will attack the City-State instead of me (the States do a great job of defending).\n\nMy only other complaint would be Denouncing and Multiplayer.\n\nPlayers can denounce each other, which basically just means you\\\u0027re publicly declaring so-and-so is evil and should not be trusted.\n\nAI throw these things around like a hot potato. Even your allies, which is annoying.\n\nI had a great relationship with America, when suddenly he denounced me. Which caused all my other allies to denounce me .\\_.\n\nBreaking Peace Treaties, or randomly declaring war does seem to cause Denouncements to fly (as I\\\u0027d expect, this is good. It makes sense). I like that, I just wish the random ones would stop, although I have to admit that it *does* add a little twist to the game here and there.\n\nI\\\u0027ve only played on low difficulty too, so maybe this goes away on higher levels.\n\nMultiplayer I haven\\\u0027t tried, but it sounds god awful.\n\nIt\\\u0027s asynchronous turned RTS. Meaning everyone is playing at their own pace, and if they operate fast enough they can play the game/advance/attack/move before you make your click.\n\nIt sounds terribly frustrating. I think it MIGHT be okay if you\\\u0027re playing with a friend though.\n\nI haven\\\u0027t played anything past Civ2, so I don\\\u0027t know what\\\u0027s real different from Civ4 and Civ5\n\nBut there are lots of combat bonuses that help/hinder you\n\ne.g. attacking across a river takes a heavy toll on your unit\\\u0027s effectiveness.\n\nI\\\u0027ve played about 3.8 games and I\\\u0027ve almost put 50 hours into the game ???\n\nI like the large maps, making for really long games.\n\nSmaller games/maps would encounter less lag I\\\u0027m sure.\n\nI\\\u0027m on steam often, so I could describe it a bit there or if you do get it we could try multiplayer.\n\nI like the game a lot.\n\nAlthough I\\\u0027ve only played 3.8 games (and the .8 is the only one so far I\\\u0027m truly satisfied with due to the RAM issue), I feel like I got my money out of this game.\n\n50 hours is quite a bit. I didn\\\u0027t HATE those first 40 hours I played, it was just that the games ended with disappointment because of the severe AI turn lag."}]}
