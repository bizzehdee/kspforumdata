Antimatter for interstellar space, nuclear for in-system space. We don\u0027t see them decellerating, but that doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t. There are references to a \u0027five year trip\u0027, but we don\u0027t know how far Carpathia is from Earth. On the ground, a Transporter is just so much scrap metal with flats inside, so a settlement gets built around it - and that\u0027s Forthaven.

There are only so many things that we can do with current technology: 1.) Earth-to-Orbit, 2.) Earth-to-Moon, and with some stretching* 3.) Earth-to-Mars. With #1 and #2 you run into the biggest problem of making an interesting \u0027present day\u0027 television series- situations I like to call the \u0022Baa Baa Black Sheep Problem\u0022 (for #1) or the \u0022Deep Space Nine Problem\u0022 (for #2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Black Sheep Squadron Issue\u0022 I named for a series covering the misadventures of VMF-214 (The Black Sheep Squadron) during WWII. The actors were good, and the special effects were top-notch for the time period. The problem that killed the show was that there are only so many ways that you can shoot down a Zero, and there are only so many hooch-bars and nurses on one island in the South Pacific. Eventually, the show gets stuck in a rut and the audience will wander off to something less repetitive. Any \u0027Earth-to-Orbit\u0027 show will eventually hit this same wall- you can only launch a rocket into space so many times before it stops being interesting... heck, the actual Apollo program ran into the same issue!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny \u0027Earth-to-Moon\u0027 show would hit the same sticking points as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine- namely, there\u0027s no place to go but where you are. You just sit in the same spot with the same problems occurring over and over. Sure, the locale is strange and interesting, and the problems are exciting and out of the ordinary... for the first season or so. Then you run into the same kind of repetition that any show with a fixed locale gets: your viewers get accustomed to the dangers and problems of this location and become inured- and your show gets boring. This is the very reason that DS9 had to add the \u003Cem\u003EDefiant\u003C/em\u003E to the \u0027cast of characters\u0027; the ship gave them the ability to seek new problems other than what the show had already explored ad nauseum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn \u0027Earth-to-Mars\u0027 show might make a good \u0027summer series\u0027 or \u0027mini-series\u0027 but would only turn into a \u0027soap opera in space\u0027 if you tried to hang on to it too long. You wind up with the \u0027M*A*S*H* Dilemma\u0027 where your show actually lasts longer than the event it portrays would! You would have to begin backtracking and doing \u0027prequel shows\u0027 and \u0027filler shows\u0027 just to try and make your third season.
