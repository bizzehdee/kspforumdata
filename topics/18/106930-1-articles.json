I don\u0027t want to do this discussion over that thread because it would interfere too much in the current round\u0027s gameplay, so here we are. If you haven\u0027t played the game, come over and check it out, since probably only people who played it will understand the context of this discussion thread.\n\n---update---\n\nNew topic this time!\n\nThe number war is a complex game, and due to its vagueness (both intentional and unintentional), sometimes there are conflict between the teams that require an official 3rd party arbitration. The game master(GM) is the one handle such things, along with rule update and game progress monitor. As you can see, this game does require some effort to manage despite being just a forum game. Now,I am looking for a person who could be a GM to look after things when I am busy/away. This is on a purely voluntary basis and not binding in any way. I am not expecting you to check the thread all the time as that would be my job, it is just whenever you are free and I am not there and something came up and require a GM.\n\nBeing a GM means the following:\n\n- You are no longer allowed to participate in the game to maintain neutrality.\n\n- You have a responsibility to answer questions regarding to rules and help guiding new players with the game\n\n- You must have a firm understanding of the rules and its nuances, particularly on edge cases, and help updating rules/drafting new ones to ensure the game runs smoothly\n\n- Your decisions will be final for all cases of conflict, thus a fair judgement is required. \n\n- You will be aware of the existence of the hidden \u0022team zero\u0022, and while you are not allowed to rule favourably for them, you can still post messages of encouragement with this colour: #FAFAFA . PM me with #To the origin as subject if you can read this, and I can tell you more about team zero.\n\nThere might be some responsibilities \u0026 duty I can\u0027t think of now, but mostly it is about player interaction and cases arbitration. Post here if you have any questions.\n\nBeing a GM does NOT means the following:\n\n- You have to look for errors. This is the responsibility of the player, as per rule 6. However, keeping track of the general progression and noticing errors when it happens is still recommended to find cases that are skirting the rules and create a precedent. If you find one, talk with me and we can figure things out.\n\n- You have to revert progression with each error: A GM\u0027s revert is powerful, and can even null a win if required, so use it only when it is absolutely needed. Let the player spot errors and revert by themselves, while you stand by and check if the revert is valid in case someone brought it up.\n\n- Helping a team in anyway with your GM power. For example: you cannot help a team even if it looks like the other team are winning unfairly - as long as they play within the rules(and even if they are not sometimes), you do not intervene until you are called upon. GM intervention is only in cases where rules are not clear and requires clarification immidiately so people stop doing it.\n\nIf anyone is interested, PM me. Edit: Going to take 2 people, as 3 GMs would be able to resolve stalemate decision easier. While there are formal no requirement for this position (cause it is just a forum game, lol) it would be nice if it is a long time player of the game.\n\nNew Update: I have got my 2 GMs: [Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/127137-Dman979) and [Deutherius](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/128703-Deutherius) ! They will act in the same capacity as mine regarding ruling of the game whenever conflicts arise, and in the case I am not available to answer things quickly, please direct PM to them if they are available.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T13:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:30:16Z","Content":"I think the 1 min window isn\u0027t bad; looking back it seems that the problem is that certain people just don\u0027t understand that the window exists.

A great game should be easy to jump in with simple and straightforward gameplay, but gets harder as you start to familiarize yourself with its rules."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:18:11Z","Content":"I think that perhaps the \u0022rules\u0022 should be changed into \u0022how to play\u0022\n\n\u0022Rules\u0022 are referenced when something in the \u0022how to play\u0022 isn\u0027t covered; the more gritty details.\n\nThat skirmishing was allowed didn\u0027t quite get to me by reading the rules; the rules, being rules, tend to give the impression that you aren\u0027t suppose to break them.\n\nBut take a look at [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110598-The-number-war-Count-to-100-or-100?p=1887110\u0026viewfull=1#post1887110)\n\nThe rules EXPLICITLY say that you cannot post the wrong number and must perform a valid operation. Floppster\u0027s post is completely invalid, there is no relation to the previous posts; but this is a PERFECTLY valid tactic. He created an override point that could have been missed, and was reward a 10 posts revert for it!\n\nI think that, as a tactics game, this really is much more enjoyable. People often express confusion about the tactics because they generally only see \u0022Add or subtract one\u0022 but they too could leave a small timebomb and let the game drop back down to zero; so when they have the numbers, issue the revert and push to the end.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T20:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:30:40Z","Content":"Well, yeah. You are not *supposed* to break the rules, because breaking them makes your post nulled. But knowing them well enough and intentionally break them to null your own post to your advantage is indeed a viable tactic. \n\nIt is like the law. You are not supposed to break them. But you find loop holes in them and use those to your advantages. I think i will just call them rules but leave people to figure the true gameplay behind it after playing the game a bit. Lots of hidden stuff in this game, after all.\n\nBut lets get back to the original topic: rule 7. Anyone else have an opinion on it? Keeping 1 minute window or keep it in the same minute?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:51:25Z","Content":"Personally, I would leave the rule as it is. Perhaps give it a clearer explanation and/or an example so people know what exactly is meant by the \u0022give or take a minute\u0022. I also don\u0027t think it would help against the editing issue all that much... One can easily wait until the end of the page during a rush hour, post a valid number, let the spamming people continue from it onto next page... And just change it to something not valid within 3 minutes. How many people will bother to look back when there is so much action going on on the last page?\n\nAs for the spam problem... I think that changing the rule to \u0022within the same minute\u0022 would cause the same ammount of spam, just concentrated in pulses at the end of each minute. Sounds interesting to observe, but... Meh, I dunno.\n\nI may or may not be heavily biased because of the way I like to play this game, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:02:51Z","Content":"I was trying to point out that the idea of skirmishing wasn\u0027t actually represented by the rules very well; I feel the rule is continuously misinterpreted as a one min window because rules tend to make it feel like you\u0027re not suppose to break them, hence a fast accident. Getting people to look at the rules as tools meant to be broken would result in more closely examining the rules looking for loopholes to exploit.\n\nIt\u0027s the difference between explaining the \u0022sprit of the law\u0022 to the judge, and hiring a lawyer who knows how to manipulate the law. The person who doesn\u0027t understand that the spirit of the law isn\u0027t what \u0022the law\u0022 actually is, gets confused; perhaps even misuses the law...\n\n\\*\\*\\* Mostly, I am considering this from the confusion aspect...
