Premium tanks are a bit more challenging to get without paying, but it\u0026#39;s not impossible the game offers various ingame missions to obtain gold needed to purchase such tanks. Also premium tanks are mostly rubbish compared to regular ones of similar design, with their only benefit being better at generating ingame currency.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:19:31Z","Content":"\nThey have done this with the first killing floor by selling skins and gun...why is it now a problem?
