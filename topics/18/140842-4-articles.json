Since an Urncisa lander, launched all those years ago, touched the surface of the moon, it had taken pictures of the large structures on the ground, and avian creatures approaching the lander curiously. Their mission was to make contact, and the Grand Council had piled heaps of funding on them, which they had used almost flawlessly.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EIt was not to be said that the entire Elordian space program was flawless. They had their share of failures, mostly from new engine designs that went horribly wrong, or new rocket designs they were unfamiliar with. But they never lost an astronaut, and most of their launches were a resounding success. However, new life support tech and the rapid progression of rocket construction allowed for bases to be set up on the two major moons and the major asteroid moon. The innermost moon (which was also the smallest) was rich in resources, had a thick atmosphere, and was volcanically active due to gravitational influences from the other three moons. The second moon was an icy ball with a thinner atmosphere than the inner moon. It was freezing cold, and there were thin sheets of ice on the surface. After the astronauts used a nuclear reactor to melt the sheets of ice, they discovered a massive subterranean ocean. They found a basic biosphere with complex microbial life; nothing too complicated, but biologists were stationed there nonetheless.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EAnd then there was Urncisa. 19 years ago, after building the largest rocket in history, the space program sent a large lander to research possible colonies on this moon, but they found something completely unexpected.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EAfter entering orbit, the lander released two tiny probes to map the terrain for decent landing sites. After finding some anomalous structures, the decision was made to investigate the structure. The lander decelerated to land near the anomaly. It entered the atmosphere, and after much of the heat shield burned off, the parachutes deployed, and the lander drifted safely to the surface. The lander found bizarre geometric structures, constructed using wood and stone. After several seconds, with Mission Control utterly confused, someone spotted several small objects moving towards the lander. After zooming in the camera\u2019s view-field, they realized that they had just made contact with another civilization. Shock cascaded throughout the Mission Control building, and the Council members who were invited to the launch stared dumbfounded at the pictures. The lander was ordered to immediately start taking as many pictures of the buildings and creatures as they possibly could before the lander\u2019s power supply died. After an emergency meeting between the council members, Eppizeh and his core team decided to attempt to make contact with the civilization. The Council agreed, and funded them.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EAfter returning to the main building, the team planned, and decided to build a massive space station around Urncisa. The station would be crewed, and they would occasionally drop probes on the surface to \u2018enlighten\u2019 the other civilization. For several months, they designed the station, and the rockets that would carry it. Then, they began to recruit astronauts; luckily, candidates were everywhere, as the prospect of helping to enlighten another civilization was pretty exciting.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EIn orbit of Urncisa, homeworld of the avian creatures\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EHurs climbed a ladder from the rotating circular centrifuge to the main bus of the station, which contained the lab, hydroponics, life support, and control/communications. The centrifuge contained sleeping quarters, recreation, the gym, and the mess hall. Along with Hurs, there were three other astronauts (two females, one male; the astronaut selection committee thought it was best if the crew\u2019s gender distribution was even). Isrs and Parngs (female and male, respectively) were in the lab working on the avian creatures\u2019 language. It was a tedious process; they had been sending probes to teach them the Elordian language with basic pictures and symbols. But the avian creatures hadn\u2019t exactly \u2018figured out\u2019 the Elordian language yet, so Isrs and Parngs slaved away in the lab, with scientists back on Orsonis (their homeworld) giving them suggestions and helping out as well. In the meantime, Quv was in the gym located in the centrifugal section of the station. While the centrifugal section helped maintain their bone mass, it was still limited to one-fifth of Orsonis\u2019 gravity, since the ring was rather small \u2013 only around 25 metres in diameter.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EHurs headed to the hydroponics section of the station, where he checked up on the plants in the greenhouse. The hydroponics section needed maintenance every two days; not only was it the only source of food when their freeze-dried rations ran out (which it almost had), it also helped keep the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E levels down, reducing the need for life support to convert the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E into O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, which tapped into the station\u2019s electricity. After checking up on the plants, Hurs floated over to the lab, where Isrs was in a heated argument with one of the scientists back on Orsonis. They were arguing about the avian creatures\u2019 (\u2018Vurvians\u2019, as they were called) responses to the probe. Hurs smiled to himself. Whenever Isrs felt right about anything, she was usually right \u2013 even though her ideas were peculiar most if not all the time. That was, after all, how they figured out the Vurvians\u2019 counting system, and told them how to predict the next probes. The trouble came when another scientist walked in and presented his/her ideas that contradicted Isrs\u2019 ideas. That was when the (heated) arguments would start.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EHurs went to the observation deck and stared at Urncisa below.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EWhat a beautiful world,\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ehe thought. With its swirling white clouds, dense green forests, and small blue lakes, sometimes he thought it looked even more beautiful than Orsonis. There was a hurricane in the southern hemisphere, its thick white clouds swirling slowly from space.

However, scientists on Orsonis decided that four crew members for around a year would be better. For Hurs and Isrs, this would be their 2nd and 4th time respectively, since their skills were among the highest in the entire Astronaut Corps. The station was 43 meters long. On its aft end were docking adapters for crewed capsules and landers for the surface, as well as an airlock for EVAs. There was another airlock which led to the life support and hydroponics section. In front of that was the Habitat Ring, which had two airlocks. Then, there was a hall, with the lab on the left side. Slightly beyond the lab was the communications spire and the observation deck. The station was spacious, since astronauts would be on the station for long periods of time; the engineers who designed the station wanted the interior to be spacious, so the astronauts wouldn\u2019t feel cramped. It cost more, and required more powerful rockets, but had less of an effect on the astronauts\u2019 psychology.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EAfter half an hour of arguing about the Vurvians\u2019 language with the other scientists, Isrs floated out of the lab, pleased with the new discovery, and glided to the observation deck with Hurs.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201CWell, you look happy,\u201D Hurs said.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201CI showed that blasted scientist some evidence,\u201D Isrs grinned.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201C\u2026of?\u201D Hurs replied, raising an eyebrow.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201CI think I know how they say \u2018wow\u2019,\u201D Isrs replied.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201CYou know how they say \u2018wow\u2019?\u201D Hurs laughed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003E\u201CI know it sounds stupid, but it\u2019s progress.

Her job was to characterize the life on the frozen moon. When she was assigned to a two-year mission, she almost couldn\u2019t believe her luck. But now, she was here. Outside, she could see the thin wisps of clouds and snow falling on the moon. The atmosphere here was just thick enough for mild snowfall (but too thin for breathing), and thin clouds spotted the surface from space like bright, transparent wisps against the stark white of the surface. Rirns was still frozen solid, and water would either freeze, evaporate, or sublimate out there on the surface. The base was on the north pole of the moon, where the geologic activity wasn\u2019t extreme. However, it could be made to float very quickly should the need arise, and samples of the indigenous life were brought by robotic rovers, where the ice was thinner. The gravity was weak, only around one-sixth of the Orsonis norm, but it was still better than microgravity. She walked over to the lab to make samples. As far as they knew, only 47 life forms existed on Rirns. They were complex life forms, but they were microscopic. There were theories of larger types of life beyond the surface \u2013 in the deep oceans of Rirns, perhaps \u2013 but their technology hadn\u2019t advanced to the point that they could detect such life forms yet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003ERegardless, she observed the complex life forms, and found out how they bred, how they ate, their patterns and behavior, their genetic structure, and more. Despite being basically microbes, it was exciting to study. After making a log entry on R-18 and R-23 (the 18th and 23rd life forms discovered), she went to the airlock, suited up, and went outside to collect ice and air samples. They needed new samples every day to maintain data precision. The sky was bright white \u2013 almost as if it was overcast, which it wasn\u2019t \u2013 and made Yorson look brighter, and their sun look white instead of orange.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EShe looked around the base. Several workers were overseeing robotic workers to build more habitats and labs, while other were ridding the solar arrays of snow, and in the distance, was the spaceport. It was 30 kilometers from the main base, and was heavily reinforced so supply ships and ascent/descent vehicles wouldn\u2019t disturb the base. There was a large road that had rovers traveling back and forth between the base and the spaceport, and even a large habitat on both sides for the passengers to stay while they were waiting for transport to or from the base.

This was where probes were launched all over the solar system. The spaceport had been built several years ago as a project to explore their solar system efficiently; because the gravity well around the gas giant and its four main moons made it hard to send large payloads to other parts of the solar system without using Whackjovian amounts of fuel, they set up shop on this asteroid moon.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EIt was around 47 kilometers in circumference, making it the largest asteroid moon in the system. It was quite rich in minerals, orbited far enough out, and had such a weak gravity well, which made it a prime candidate for a spaceport. With the Spaceport established on Wurxis, they could send probes to the hot inner world Ferix. Ferix was much like Jorgience, except it was tidally locked. Its reverse side was frozen solid as well, with a small ice cap on the far side. Probes to the outer system could be sent as well; to the gas giant binary system, Zik and Eis, Zik\u2019s moon Vui, and its trojan planet Kit. Today, they were launching a probe to Kit. It was an exotic world; Kit possessed a very thick atmosphere, oceans of liquid ammonia, and it had little landmass. There was even something resembling a \u2018water cycle\u2019, where it rained ammonia, not water. It sometimes even snowed ammonia, and had dense ammonia clouds. The moon was a bit small as well, having about half the gravity as Orsonis, but it was extremely interesting. Therefore, the space program decided a large probe that had an orbiter, lander, and rover would be the best choice for exploring this moon.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EXaxis was part of the inspection crew.

A small Mission Control-like building on the asteroid activated the probe, while Burgi and his team watched it silently float through the hangar and out into space. After the probe made for the trojan planet Kit, it was recreation time. Xaxis took his to do an extended EVA and flew away from the hangar and the domes to look out into space on the now dark side of the Asteroid. He could clearly see the slanted edge of their galaxy, with Yorson on its left and stars everywhere. In the distance, he could see his home, Orsonis,\u00A0as well as Rirns.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EIt was worth all the work he had to do to make it here. He had graduated at the top of his class at a young age, and immediately signed up to become an astronaut. During the two most grueling years of his life, he trained harder and better than any other candidate. He would, of course, be accepted.

The doctor almost didn\u2019t let him on the ship. When they got into orbit, and he saw Orsonis from space for the first time, it was like he forgot to breathe. He just stared at Orsonis for hours, and when they made him do his shifts, he was always the first one finished so he could go back to the observation deck. Because of his exemplary work, he was the youngest commissioned astronaut to have a major mission: a year-long shift on Wurxis.

Thousands upon thousands of candidates had applied, and he was one of the lucky ones chosen, along with a couple hundred others.

Inside were eight centrifuges with entrances on the bottom. Elordians could stay outside to practically swim in the air, or could go into the centrifuges to be under the effects of gravity. The gravity in the centrifuges were only about 1/6 of what they were normally used to, but it was enough to keep them on their seats, eat without the food and liquids going everywhere, and sleep without having to strap themselves to a wall. They were spacious, big enough to hold 10 Elordians each, but at the time, only five lived here.

It is truly an exciting time to be alive.\u201D Everyone applauded, before quieting back down for Eppizeh to continue his speech. \u201CI originally wanted to give you all a very long speech, because this was such a huge gathering, but I couldn\u2019t think of all of the words. However, I do have this.\u201D At this, the crowd grew silent, and the lights even dimmed. \u201CFor centuries, we have dreamed of going into space. We wanted to touch space so badly, it hurt. Our civilization has advanced rapidly; less than 200 years after we cracked electricity, we now have a space program, and are living out the dreams of our ancestors proudly. If they were with us today, I bet they would be very impressed. There have been many empires, many countries; over a thousand years ago, we were just dreaming of flying machines, everyone said it was impossible, but our ancestors proved them wrong. Many Elordians thought space travel was impossible; we proved them wrong. Many Elordians thought alien life didn\u2019t exist; again, we proved them wrong. Need I go on? Every time we say something is impossible, someone finds a way to make it possible. It doesn\u2019t matter if it takes decades or centuries, but so long as there\u2019s that one individual who says that it\u2019s possible, and works tirelessly until they can prove it, we will continue to better our species and ourselves. Remember: if someone ever says something is impossible, they\u2019re most likely wrong. So keep dreaming, and let\u2019s explore the final frontier together. Thank you.\u201D Everyone gave Eppizeh a standing ovation, and he walked off the stage to the concessions.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.5pt;margin-left:0in;background:#FAFAFA;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, serif;color:#272A34;\u0022\u003EThe next day, when everything was being cleaned up, Eppizeh and his team began devising a new strategy to make contact with the Vurvians, once they figured out their language.

it\u2026 a bright flash against the sky, he gaped at it, and quickly changed course to follow it, extremely interested to know what it was, he could tell it was slowing down, the way the light was diminishing, and he thought he was going to lose where it was, when brightly colored \u2018domes\u2019 came out of the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EIt\u2019s a strange shape\u003C/i\u003E, he thought to himself, when he got close to it, it circled around it, and landed close to it, wondering what it was, as it got closer he moved out of the way, and when it landed, he noticed several others had come out, curious to what it was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the probe suddenly flashed bright lights every few seconds, some backed away, thinking it was evil, but some stayed to see what it would do, H\u2019ruc was right next to it, and put a cautious winged hand on its shiny body, it was still a bit warm, but had cooled substantially, he wandered around it, taking in every \u003Cspan\u003EY\u2019ru\u003C/span\u003E, wondering what it was made of. \u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ECertainly,\u003C/span\u003E not Iron, it\u2019s much too shiny, but perhaps it was made of steel, maybe some gold and silver as well, \u003C/i\u003Eas he pondered this he felt a slight excitement, he was curious, and wanted to know more, many of his kind didn\u2019t like his ideas, and rejected them, but he was a philosopher, it was his nature to ask questions, no matter how big.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe examined it \u003Cspan\u003Eclosely\u003C/span\u003E and saw panels, exposed metal rods, and a huge amount of strange looking objects on \u003Cspan\u003Eit\u003C/span\u003E as if the object itself wasn\u2019t odd enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater that night, some assumed it came from the night gods, their world was almost always above theirs, with bright lights on the dark side, so that\u2019s where they built their empire over a hundred Ri\u2019s ago, with a massive castle in the center, and villages skirting around it, some wealthy, and some poor, H\u2019ruc lived in one of the richer villages. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral hours after the strange object touched down, they constructed a shrine around it, honoring it, worshipping it, hoping it would end their problems, but alas, it did nothing, it just sat there, many thought it was doing its job \u003Cspan\u003Equietly,\u003C/span\u003E though, and continued putting flowers and other precious items around it, hoping for something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EH\u2019ruc came to the site every day, when, almost a year later, they saw another flash of light, and he assumed it was a trick \u003Cspan\u003Eof\u003C/span\u003E the light, but he thought it was brighter than the last. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone who saw it gathered around, excited to see what it was, when it landed, many started bowing to the lander, while H\u2019ruc approached it again, only this time, there was a large pad with buttons on the outside, with bright colors flashing in a pattern, he cautiously touched it, but it did nothing, and it kept doing the same thing over and over again, he examined it for quite some time after that, but came to the conclusion, he had to follow the pattern, when he followed the pattern, red, blue, blue, yellow, blue, blue, red, it blinked and made a small high pitched sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it showed him a \u003Cspan\u003Estrange-looking\u003C/span\u003E sphere, with thick white powdery looking stuff swirling around, green covering most of the visible surface, and some blue scattered around, when it suddenly zoomed in, and showed their empires, ending with theirs, and showing his species, before zooming back out, to show the \u2018\u003Cspan\u003ER\u2019ku\u003C/span\u003E\u2019 the giant object in the sky, that tried outshining its brighter but smaller brother in the sky, as well as \u003Cspan\u003EV\u2019sa\u003C/span\u003E, home of the night gods, it was then, did he realize, \u003Ci\u003Ehe was looking at his homeworld. \u003C/i\u003EHe stared at it, as it replayed over and over again, he stared at it until it was dark, as the \u003Cspan\u003EV\u2019l\u003C/span\u003E went on, less and less \u003Cspan\u003EM\u2019rix\u003C/span\u003E were out of their huts, and after awhile, no one else was there anymore, just him, and he soon dozed off to sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc obsessed over the strange object, he would draw pictures, write everything he knew \u003Cspan\u003Eabout\u003C/span\u003E it down, and tried doing anything to figure it out, many thought he was going insane, and he may be going insane, he sometimes wondered, but there was something about those moving pictures he just couldn\u2019t get out of his mind, several years, and another probe later, he saw a flash of light, but it was much smaller, dimmer, and faster, than the other flashes of light he saw. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe wondered about it for a while, wondering what it could be, when it happened again, he stared at it until it disappeared over the horizon, when it went over \u003Cspan\u003Ethe 3\u003Csup\u003Erd\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E time, he started timing it, using a sextant, every 110 \u003Cspan\u003EK\u2019ir\u003C/span\u003E, he calculated, he seemed to go over, and the next day, he met up with several other philosophers and a couple of mathematicians to discuss his findings in a royal library, they puzzled over it for quite some time, when someone remembered an old paper written about their world, and went to go get it, only to return happily around a half an hour later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe know that our world is round, and we also know how big it must be, I\u2019ve just been looking at this paper which tells us how big it truly is, here\u2019s the interesting part however, the bright flash you saw every 110 minutes, seems to make a perfect circle around our world.\u201D He said triumphantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo tonight, we observe it again, if it shows the same patterns, we can assume it circles our world.\u201D Said H\u2019ruc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D He replied.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat night, they observed the object all night, confirming their idea, when a second flash appeared several days later, it seemed to be following it, and as they timed it, they thought it was getting closer, and closer to the flash that they had seen a few days ago, one night, they saw the two flashes become one, they assumed it must\u2019ve fused itself to it or something, but they didn\u2019t know what it was, so they built a telescope. After getting a small telescope, they tried observing it, unfortunately, when they tried, it went by too fast to be seen clearly, so they scrapped their idea of seeing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany \u003Cspan\u003EX\u2019a\u003C/span\u003E went by, and several more strange objects had been sent down, \u003Cspan\u003EH\u2019ruc\u003C/span\u003E and a few other philosophers began studying it as it gave them displays of flashing lights, talking very fast to each other, and sketching out everything they saw as fast as they could, they sometimes saw flashes of light join up with the \u2018first light\u2019 as they called it, and wondered what it meant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter many years of studying, they still didn\u2019t know what its purpose was, it seemed to be trying to teach them, but teach them what? There were times when H\u2019ruc would stop studying in frustration, and a few weeks after the latest object, guards approached H\u2019ruc, saying his king had requested to see him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EWhat?

information on them, they seem to be sent down regularly, about once every 18 X\u2019a now, each one with something new to show us, the first time, I believe it showed our homeworld, it zoomed in on the weird looking sphere, showed images of our empires, and zoomed back out, showing R\u2019ku and V\u2019sa, an-\u201C\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait,\u201D

related to the objects, because it appeared after a couple objects had touched down, And as for figuring it out, the objects are getting bigger, with more information each time, I t-think something

when it arrives.\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO\u2019as nodded in approval, \u201CI cannot wait to see what it is, but with all of these clues, it may be something extraordinary.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnother thing, it seems that the objects are getting more and more complex, new puzzles, new pictures, new moving pictures, new symbols, I think it\u2019s trying to teach us, and I\u2019ve been collecting information on \u003Cspan\u003Eeveryone\u003C/span\u003E, here\u2019s all the information I\u2019ve collected on the last object which touched down yesterday, the scroll with more information on what could come after the arrow is complete is In the largest one.\u201D Said H\u2019ruc, walking up the throne, and passing a few scrolls to him, and stepping down, with his wings positioned behind him in a respectful manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO\u2019as took the largest \u003Cspan\u003Escroll\u003C/span\u003E and opened it, his eyes widened as they read more and more, and he didn\u2019t speak for several minutes, when he finished, he said, \u201CYou think they\u2019re going to take one of us?\u201D \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc nodded, \u201CIn the latest object, there was a moving picture, of a much larger object with someone inside, it seems to have landed in a clearing several \u003Cspan\u003EM\u2019az\u003C/span\u003E away, which would be in the direction of the arrow, and they took one of us to the light flash, I don\u2019t know what happens after that however, there wasn\u2019t anything after that.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO\u2019as lowered the scroll slowly, \u201CI wonder who they\u2019re going to pick,\u201D He wondered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wonder that as well. But, that is all I have, and you may keep the scrolls, I\u2019ve made copies as usual.\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nO\u2019as smiled, \u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWell\u003C/span\u003E if that is all, have a nice V\u2019l, and good luck with you.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, I\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201D He said, before turning around, and walking out of the palace, nodding towards the guards in farewell, and swiftly climbing up a tree, before gliding back to his home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he arrived back to his village, past the incomplete arrow of objects, he landed swiftly, and was about to walk back to his home, when he walked past a small pavilion, and saw one of the philosophers pouring over several papers, He strode \u003Cspan\u003Eover\u003C/span\u003E and was reluctant to interrupt him, but when he took a seat, to wait until he finished, he suddenly looked up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cspan\u003EHello,\u003C/span\u003E H\u2019ruc!

How could it be me? The very thought.\u201D He said shaking his head.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell\u2026 For example, you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s been making detailed observations on it, you\u2019re the only one who finds the object in the sky first, and goes up studying it as soon as it lands, you hardly say anything, it\u2019s like you\u2019re trapped in your own little world whenever one lands, you\u2019ve solved all of the puzzles so far, if they\u2019re planning on taking someone, it\u2019ll probably be you.\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc looked down, lost in thought, \u003Ci\u003ECould they pick me? What are they like? What are they going to do?\u003C/i\u003E He looked up slowly, \u201CIt could\u2026 be me.\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc stared at the village, young, gliding around, racing each other, seeing who can stay in the air the longest, old, sitting in their homes, looking out, gazing at the world, \u003Cspan\u003EKir\u2019uv\u003C/span\u003E of all ages, walking around, making trades, walking their goods around, blacksmiths, building weapons and tools, farmers in the fields, picking the plentiful harvests, workers picking straw and sticks to build homes and shelter, the expansive forest stretching out forever. \u003Ci\u003EWhy couldn\u2019t it be me?\u003C/i\u003E He thought to himself, \u003Ci\u003Eif they\u2019re watching, they\u2019ve probably memorized my face by now. \u003C/i\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EH\u2019ruc turned back to G\u2019ex, \u201CYeah, why couldn\u2019t it be me?\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nG\u2019ex smiled at his friend, \u201CYou just \u003Cspan\u003Ewait\u003C/span\u003E. When they come, you\u2019re going to be the one they look for.\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes\u2026 I suppose so, but\u2026\u201D H\u2019ruc started, but G\u2019ex cut him off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut nothing, they\u2019re going to pick you, now, don\u2019t you have some more research to do?\u201D He said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc nodded, \u201CWell, it\u2019s been good seeing you, I will see you later.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the same to you H\u2019ruc, have a nice day.\u201D Said G\u2019ex, before going back to his papers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc walked towards the objects, since being authorized by the king to study the objects when they landed, H\u2019ruc was one of the only ones allowed to approach the objects, anyone else who approached it, could, at the most, just worship it, H\u2019ruc was the only one allowed to touch the objects, and even took off panels sometimes (Much to the distaste of others who didn\u2019t know, or did not like him messing with them).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc stared fondly at the first object when he came upon it, silent for many, many Ri\u2019s, there were signs of weathering and decay, rust had overridden the steel on it, many other objects shared the same characteristics of the first object, decayed from the extreme humidity, and time they have been on the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeeds and plants would\u2019ve sprouted up around them, if nobody hadn\u2019t made sure the area was clear, H\u2019ruc himself went to clear the area from time to time to keep it from getting overgrown, while some of the farmers went to it every day, clearing it out, making sure nothing grew on or around the objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he arrived at the latest object, which was still projecting the image on a screen, as were several other objects which had been on the surface for a while, he was startled by a sudden flash of light, another object was coming \u003Cspan\u003Ein for a\u003C/span\u003E landing\u2026 \u003Ci\u003EFour X\u2019a too early. \u003C/i\u003EHe thought to himself, he stepped well out of the way as it\u2019s large domes came out, slowing it down, with the landing legs extending, as it slowly approached the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc stared curiously as it came down, \u003Ci\u003Eit\u2019s much too early for another one. \u003C/i\u003EWhen it landed, he approached it immediately, seeing the usual puzzle, and then rushing to his hut to grab some paper and pens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he got back to the probe, he saw a weird puzzle, there were keys below it, with symbols on it, that resembled huts, trees, numbers, among many other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother weird thing, was that it was making noise, and he saw what was on the screen, himself, and something, no, someone else, he had never seen anyone like them before, they had golden brown fur, large black eyes, a wide nose, and a weird looking mouth, the thing was making strange sounding noises, and there were others too, appearing, and disappearing on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc didn\u2019t know what to make of this, but then it started pointing at him, and saying something he couldn\u2019t understand, he tried imitating the thing, but with poor results, then it pointed down, and one of the weird keys started blinking with light, as it started repeating the same thing, over, and over again, then it dawned on him, \u003Ci\u003EThat\u2019s how they say tree, but why can\u2019t they speak our language?. \u003C/i\u003E\u201CT-\u003Cspan\u003Etreeee\u003C/span\u003E.\u201D He said slowly back to the thing on the screen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey did something funny with their head, and pulled up a piece of paper, at least that\u2019s what he thought it was, but it was \u003Cspan\u003Ewhite\u003C/span\u003E and looked cleaner than their paper, yet they could still write on it, and pointed at a weird set of characters on it, and pointed at it, saying tree, H\u2019ruc scribbled it down quickly, and drew a picture next to it so he wouldn\u2019t forget what it meant, if he could anyway, but better safe than sorry, and started saying something else, this time, the key for \u2018Hut\u2019 started blinking, and they pointed at another piece of paper that had another weird set of characters on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt kept saying it over and over again, and after awhile, he said it himself, \u201C\u003Cspan\u003EHuut\u003C/span\u003E.\u201D He said, writing it down as well, and drawing a picture next to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the next several hours, he learned many new, different ways of saying and spelling words, Probe, Plants, Food, Water, Video, many numbers and colors, Farming, Metal, Wood, and Clothes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they were finished with clothes, the thing did something funny with their mouth, and the screen went black.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared dumbfounded at the black screen, and looked down on his paper, he had gone through 4 sheets of paper, front and back, in order to write everything down. \u003Ci\u003EWere they teaching me their language? \u003C/i\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stayed where he was for quite some time after that, in stunned silence, he thought he just was what their gods looked like, and they communicated directly to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe didn\u2019t get any sleep that night, and stayed up all night in the candlelight, studying his notes from earlier in the day, and trying to imitate saying what they said all night, the next day, he thought, he was going directly to O\u2019as.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter getting a few hours of sleep, he \u003Cspan\u003Eset off\u003C/span\u003E for the king\u2019s castle immediately, with a bundle of notes in his pouch, instead of walking respectfully to O\u2019as\u2019 throne, he glided to it, and O\u2019as looked at \u003Cspan\u003Ehim\u003C/span\u003E curiously, with one of his advisors who suddenly stopped talking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nH\u2019ruc \u003Cspan\u003Ewas breathless\u003C/span\u003E at the throne for a few moments before looking directly at the king.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CO\u2019as, \u003Cspan\u003Ethe.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EThe gods,\u003C/span\u003E they dropped another \u2018probe\u2019,\u201D He said, making a noise that sounded strange to O\u2019as, \u201CAnd communicated directly to me, they were teaching me their language,\u201D he pulled out a bundle of notes, and handed them to O\u2019as, \u201CThat\u2019s all the words they taught me, I not only heard them speak, I \u003Ci\u003Esaw\u003C/i\u003E them.\u201D O\u2019as perked \u003Cspan\u003Eup\u003C/span\u003E and stood up walking over to H\u2019ruc, while his adviser stared curiously between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre\u2026 Are you sure?\u201D He asked, wide eyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, there was

That they\u2019re probably the creation, or experiment of an ancient Alien race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you know what they look like?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, not at the moment, they\u2019re working on \u003Cspan\u003Eit,\u003C/span\u003E though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe council members muttered to each other for awhile, before looking back on Eppizeh, \u201CFigure out who these beings were, and what they did.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEppizeh nodded, \u201CI need to get back to the space center now, I\u2019ll update you digitally, and by the way, when do you want to go public on this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Council members stared at each other, and talked amongst themselves for a little while longer, before addressing Eppizeh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll tell the public in a few days, continue studying this civilization.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEppizeh nodded solemnly, and strode out, to go on the self-driving vehicle back to the space center and making new plans for missions to Kit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral days later, the Council addressed the world with \u2018Possibly the biggest announcement ever made\u2019, many thought it had something to do with the \u003Cspan\u003EVurvians\u003C/span\u003E or the life on \u003Cspan\u003ERirns\u003C/span\u003E, but they didn\u2019t have to speculate for \u003Cspan\u003Elong\u003C/span\u003E and tuned in to see what was up, as expected, it was the largest \u003Cspan\u003Elive stream\u003C/span\u003E ever, with most of their civilization watching in overwhelming curiosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello everyone, a few days ago, the probe launched towards Kit, the exotic world with liquid ammonia oceans, landed, we didn\u2019t tell you this immediately because of a huge discovery that was made, but we\u2019re ready to tell you all now. The lander found the remains of an ancient outpost from an advanced Alien civilization, which has been there for roughly 800,000 years,\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll around Orsonis, everyone stared at their screens in awe, around the Urncisa station, Far-base one, Far-base two, and Spaceport one, only a few knew of the information beforehand, for everyone \u003Cspan\u003Eelse,\u003C/span\u003E though, they stared at their screens in shock, another civilization was discovered. \u201CThe civilization is older than both our civilization, and the Vurvians, which as you know, are about as old as we are, so we suspect that this civilization, probably created us, or influenced us to be more intelligent. This is shocking news, and I know it might be hard to absorb, but we will get more data as soon as possible, Spaceport one already has orders to build a much larger probe. That is all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEppizeh finished watching the \u003Cspan\u003Eannouncement\u003C/span\u003E, which was followed by dozens of messages his way, he tried answering as many as he could, but they \u003Cspan\u003Eoverwhelmed him, a couple hours later, he got one\u003C/span\u003E from mission control. He \u003Cspan\u003Esighed\u003C/span\u003E and went to mission control for the update\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Eppizeh entered the vast room, they were staring at the screens in awe, the rover had been sent inside what they thought was a habitat, that was found to have a hull breach large enough for the rover to fit through, the stream got fuzzy when it went inside, and when it turned on its brights, it found something extraordinary\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003ESpaceport one,

the Spaceport who was assigned to the new Kit probe, and was watching a replay of the stream, as he was on an EVA as it happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, yeah, it\u2019s amazing, they found direct evidence of an ancient civilization.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s spread out over a few Jiv, I think it\u2019s more of an outpost actually.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, let\u2019s suit up and get to work, this probe is going to be a beast.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright.\u201D He said as he followed the other engineers out to the airlocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the next few weeks, they began construction on the main probe bus, while another team of engineers designed and built the payload, several orbiters, and several rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission plan was to do full orbital scans of everything between geostationary orbit, and the atmosphere, to look for \u003Cspan\u003Esigns of\u003C/span\u003E any ancient spacecraft and satellites, while the rovers would do full studies of the entire site, taking all kinds of scans, and sampling everything they could, a manned mission would \u003Cspan\u003Efollow to\u003C/span\u003E closely study the technology, and try to replicate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe would take many Hix\u2019s to complete, meanwhile a probe to study the Gas giant binary, and its Moon was sent, after releasing its orbiters, they found they had enough fuel to get into an elliptical orbit around Kit, and decided to use the probe to do further studies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shifts for the probe were long, and \u003Cspan\u003Emuch\u003C/span\u003E more Astronauts were sent up to help clear the backlog of \u003Cspan\u003Eprobes\u003C/span\u003E and to help construct the probe to Kit faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo,\u201D Started Ols, as he and a few engineers jetted over to the spaceport, \u201CHow\u2019re you all feeling right now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTired.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHungry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike I want to die.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, you guys sure are in a cheery mood today, today\u2019s shift will be half as long as \u003Cspan\u003Etoday\u2019s\u003C/span\u003E since mission control finally decided to stop making you guys do super long shifts, and are letting you guys rest now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere \u003Cspan\u003Ewas\u003C/span\u003E a chorus of tired cheers from the engineers at this, Ols chuckled to himself, \u201CAlright, let\u2019s get to work.\u201D He said as they entered the hanger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EIn orbit above Urncisa\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWow, I mean, wow,\u201D Said Isrs, after talking to H\u2019ruc again. \u201CWe\u2019re \u003Ci\u003Efinally\u003C/i\u003E breaking the communication barrier!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, that\u2019s\u2026 Incredible.\u201D Said Parngs, \u201CWhat\u2019re we going to talk about tomorrow?\u201D He asked, addressing the scientists on the screen who looked like all of their dreams had come true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTomorrow, we\u2019ll teach H\u2019ruc more words, obviously, but we need you to draw more pictures, not just for communication, but for the next probe, the engineers are going haywire designing it,\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait,\u201D Interrupted Isrs, \u201CWe have plenty of probes up here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, no, we\u2019re talking about steam powered technology, you\u2019ll be discussing that next time, as a future probe will have some primitive technology on it, we\u2019ll be sending you essential information about it, how we want you to present it to H\u2019ruc, what each piece does, and how they can replicate it, we also be sending slightly more sophisticated blacksmith equipment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd how will they know how to use it? We haven\u2019t gotten \u003Ci\u003Ethat \u003C/i\u003Efar in communication yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe probe will take around a year to complete, so you\u2019ve got time to teach H\u2019ruc more about our language, then, in one to three Fir, we\u2019ll send him up here, finish teaching H\u2019ruc our language, while also teaching H\u2019ruc about our science, technology, and how we want him, or her, to lead their world into a Utopia.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsrs snorted, \u201CWe haven\u2019t even figured out how to make a Utopia, how\u2019re we going to get the \u003Cspan\u003EVurvian\u2019s to\u003C/span\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve gotten close, besides, they\u2019ll probably do whatever we say without question, they think we\u2019re gods after all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know, that type of arrogance is going to screw us over, we can\u2019t go parading that type of stuff.\u201D Snapped Isrs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientist who had spoken tried to say something, but couldn\u2019t get the words out, Parngs, went off-\u003Cspan\u003Escreen\u003C/span\u003E and smirked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet the Council on this, you guys aren\u2019t going to tell us how to give them a new government.\u201D Said Isrs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re busy with a country of their own right now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, I\u2019m pretty sure they can spare a couple members for a couple days at a time.\u201D She said dismissively, \u201CWhat kind of steam power?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COnly a couple types, piston steam engines, and locomotive steam engines, we assume that with their current technological advancement, they should have some idea how steam power works, we\u2019ll just be giving it to them in a pretty little box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen will you send us these details?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow, in fact, the data transfer is already in progress, when the upload is finished, we want you to begin studying up, you have a lot of words and pictures to prepare.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsrs nodded, \u201CWe\u2019ll get on it once the data link is complete.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood, make sure that you make it clear that H\u2019ruc will be on the ship for up to a year, possibly longer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout that, how will we get H\u2019ruc food?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ll tell him or her to take the food, we\u2019ll bring it up, and figure out how to grow it, remember, our life is pretty close biologically due to being so close to one another, and the plants on that Moon grow very similarly to plants here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, you guys have been working on this for awhile now, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, for over a Fir, we have, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got it figured out, just break the communications barrier so when we get H\u2019ruc up here, it won\u2019t take as long to prepare his or her role as the Ambassador.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wonder how genders work \u003Cspan\u003Ein\u003C/span\u003E that world, it\u2019s getting annoying saying \u2018him or her\u2019.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, when you\u2019ve broken the communications barrier, you can ask, over and out.\u201D The scientist said before the screen went black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsrs and Parngs nodded, and got to work on the drawings and words they would be teaching over the next few Hix\u2019s, when the data uplink was finished, Parngs, \u003Cspan\u003EHurs\u003C/span\u003E, and Quv got to work on how the information would be presented, and Isrs went over to another table to figure out how to fully communicate with H\u2019ruc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile \u003Cspan\u003EHurs\u003C/span\u003E and Quv didn\u2019t have to do it, they were as curious as anyone else to study the Vurvians, and there was a lot of papers to go through anyway, so they decided to help out with communications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo uh, how do we want to do this?\u201D Asked
