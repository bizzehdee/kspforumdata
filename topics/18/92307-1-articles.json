The physical copies would have a few different varieties of pre-order deluxe editions, depending on where you bought it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PC release is for Origin only, and it contains SecuROM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t mod the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would have to pay to bring back dead Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, Bob, and Jeb require $/\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3/\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC10 DLC to be on your ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets just disappear when you crash them.

He would look like something from Dead Space, and you would encounter him fairly often. If you have weaponry on your ship, you get to defeat him with a sequence of quick-time-events. If you don\u0027t, he breaks into your ship and kills all your crew in a manner reminiscent of the worst Dead Space cutscenes. He can be removed from the game with $/\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3/\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC10 DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery so often, Kerbals from a rival nation attempt to invade the Space Center. The game then becomes a poorly-designed muliplayer third person shooter. It plays like someone put two games of whack-a-mole across from each other and gave the moles plasma rifles. Also, you can pay to get new weapons for these stages.There is also a rocket racing multiplayer minigame where all physics get thrown out the window. They shut down the severs after two years of release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had the guts to purchase the game pre-owned, you would have to pay money to get features that would be present in new copies of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game would be extremely linear in it\u0027s progression. You have to advance the game with a series missions (e.g. sub-orbital, orbital, munar, Minmusian, etc.), and don\u0027t you DARE try and skip a stage! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are severe bugs on the release date that require 15 patches in the first month of release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey attempted to give all the Kerbals personalities and give them spoken dialogue on the level of poorly-written fan fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople from NASA would be paid to make public statements about it being \u0022too unrealistic\u0022 in an attempt to highlight how fun the game is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
