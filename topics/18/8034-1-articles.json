The RP forum isn\\\u0027t just military escapades either. Diplomacy and trade are essential to the board. If you\\\u0027ve been to the forum, you may have noticed the Grand Council, and its Senate in which we vote for laws. Of the wars we have fought, not a single war was fought for fun or for territory. All of them were fought for either defense or the solving of a specific problem. Intense negotiations have occurred at summits, and cartography skills are used quite extensively. In a sense, the RP forum isn\\\u0027t just warfare, its a game I would pay 70 dollars for, and would have done so on the spot. Violence is to be expected from humans, and that\\\u0027s nature. Yes, there is a violent trend, but it is not to the extent that is mentioned.
