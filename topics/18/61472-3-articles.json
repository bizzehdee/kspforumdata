You can fly around and land, affected by gravity like the other prototypes. You can also see the image degradation system at work in those images. There are at present several presets for it to choose from, which control a stack of effects (greyscale, bloom, image grain, resolution reduction, FPS reduction, etc). The aforementioned image grain is also controlled by the strength of the connection to the base station (which doesn\u0027t exist yet in its true form, but a test script with the same equations is working fine). In addition, the image cuts out entirely if you lose line of sight to the transmitter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/575558/SotS/signal.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022signal.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side note, I made an early version of a control method that makes aiming your ship around much easier. It\u0027s a \u0022pulsed thrust\u0022 mode. When you hit W, for instance, it lets out a puff of RCS that starts you rotating. When you release W, it makes an opposing puff to stop you rotating. At present it simply applies a torque to the ship but later it will be done with actual thrusters (and will have a spoolup time as a result). You can also switch to \u0022continuous thrust\u0022 mode, which functions just like the RCS in KSP, and is better when you\u0027re trying to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T20:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe biggest planet that can be found might stretch to an astounding two hundred meters in radius\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeters?
