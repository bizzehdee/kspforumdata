Things such as filenames and HTML code have special meanings for some characters. And there are ways of sending those characters so the special meanings aren\u0027t applied.\n\nThe apostrophe has always been represented by the numeric value of 39, since the days of ASCII. Of course the computer handles it in binary, but 39 is the decimal equivalent. It\u0027s just that, unless the computer is doing something special, that 39 in the file pops onto your screen as an apostrophe. And those odd-looking strings are a standard way of saying \u0022show the character for which this is the code\u0022.\n\nSometimes that gets mistaken.\n\nAnyway, if your browser shows the URL of the page you\u0027re reading, this page\u0027s URL will show a different way of encoding the odd characters, but that last code isn\u0027t decimal. It\u0027s the same idea.\n\nI can\u0027t fix it for you, but either something needs changing on your browser, or something has been lost from the file. It sometimes happens when the computer is set up for a different language to US English. If I saw the sort of error you report, I\u0027d want to check my language setting.\n\nIt might have some other cause. It\u0027s just somewhere obvious to check.\n\nMy browser does have settings for the language it uses. The default is what the OS uses, which affects the display, the spelling-checks, and the keyboard. I know it can get complicated if you use a different language, or more than one language.\n\nWhat I have just works. I don\u0027t see the weirdness. May it will go away as mysteriously as it appeared."}]}
