While enjoying a nice evening, I went outside to see if the moon was out yet. To my great amazement, I saw some kind of large-ish reddish, almost flaming object, streaking across the sky. I got a very bad picture, and I was wondering what it could be! You can see it in the top of the picture, it was moving pretty fast and disappeared before I could take a good shot, and this was taken with zoom! If anyone knows or has a guess please say so! : )\n\n![P2810964.jpg](http://s22.postimg.org/q4pvpaxb5/P2810964.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:56:04Z","Content":"Nice trees..![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nYou didn\u0027t use the camera viewfinder, I take it. \n\nWell, at the risk of placing yourself under observation... it\u0027s a cloud, or a weather balloon.\n\nDo you live near an airbase - That there is a small cloud there, and you say it was traveling at \u0027high speed\u0027.. there would have been a longer vapour trail, maybe horizon to horizon.\n\nNah.. just trees and a cloud\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:57:00Z","Content":"My guess: Jet contrail illuminated by the brilliant orange light of sunset at its altitude. It\u0027s a very striking phenomena - sometimes local atmospheric conditions will leave only a short span of contrail, which makes a short dash of flaming orange in the sky without an apparent source. And, sometimes, they disappear almost as soon as they\u0027re formed, which could create what you observed."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T06:06:28Z","Content":"Haha, thanks. And no, I was using the LCD screen. Very interesting, a cloud. And no, I don\u0027t live near one, and I\u0027m not sure, it wasn\u0027t that small. It had a long trail, it just looks like that because of the bad shot! \n\nIt could be, although it was a bit shorter than the average jet trail. If it was, then it is, it was very nice. If it was very short, then it could\u0027ve been that! I think it was probably just that! : )"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:40:58Z","Content":"It could be some sort of meteorite.\n\nWhere do you live?"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatGuyWithALongUsername","CreatedById":140817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:37:44Z","Content":"Wrong.\n\nAliens."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:43:40Z","Content":"I concur.

And it could be a meteor, that would be very cool! I\u0027m not sure exactly how fast, but pretty fast; it was gone almost as soon as I grabbed my camera, that\u0027s why the shot is so poor. It seemed to fade out a little, and disappeared over the hills. I would\u0027ve been able to see it more and tell you more details if the hills had not been there! Kryten, Western Canada. I didn\u0027t know about this, this is very interesting. They do sometimes re-enter before time, and it was very recent. I started the thread 10 minutes or so after I saw it."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:33:38Z","Content":"I have to agree with others... if it was a meteorite you should see a small dark speck at the front, which is clearly absent.
