Its rarely used by courts because companies dont typically go out of their way to commit crimes. And most companies go out of their way to not comingle personal and business assets and finaces. If a company is found guilty of a crime, but business assets and finances are separate from owners/officers/shareholders personal assets - no \u0022piercing the corporate veil\u0022. Both conditions have to be true, along with a couple other conditons. Its very rare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short, and back to my original point - an LLC is designed to protect an owner from company liabities like debt incurred from screwing up a $1M project. The owner is very likely to have zero \u0022skin in the game\u0022, as you claimed. No more so than any other business owner. An LLC business owner is no more likely to care about why a project failed than an incorporated business owner. Or a non profit business owner. Or an owner of a 10 billion dollar publically traded company. They all have an interest in knowing why a project failed, but how they registered their business with their state isnt a consideration in that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-28T15:41:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2024 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 28\u0022\u003EJuly 28\u003C/time\u003E by SmokerCraft\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-28T20:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who identifies as an LLC (Skorj has his own address and phone number, even), let me see if I can explain this better.\u00A0 There\u0027s no major difference between an LLC partnership and a closely-held corporation (where the shareholders know each other).\u00A0 The devil is in the details, but the risk is about the same.\u00A0 Everything you put into the business is at risk,and that\u0027s a lot, but you have some protection for other businesses and personal assets.\u00A0 There\u0027s a big difference is between that, where you both own and manage the company, and big (especially publicly held) corps where the owners and managers \u003Cem\u003Eare different groups of people.\u00A0 \u003C/em\u003E(Founder led public corps tend to split the difference.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBringing this long tangent back around to the topic: owner-run companies tend to have some vision beyond short-term profit maximization, some product they want to sell, some long-term plan, and always an eye for actually making money over the mere appearance of such.\u00A0 The KSP IP might be in good hands with such, and if it wasn\u0027t working out they\u0027d be well motivated to either end it gracefully in a reputation-preserving way, or sell it at the best price they could reasonably get.\u00A0 A detailed post-mortem would be both a learning experience and a chance to show the sort of transparency gamers appreciate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut instead it\u0027s managed by people looking after their own careers first and foremost, with minimal concern for investors and none at all for reputation with gamers.\u00A0 From their point of view, the primary goal with KSP is to be able to remove any association with it from their resume, problem solved.\u00A0 Any future involvement would be a career risk, even to be part of selling it (unless for an outrageous amount).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a sad situation, but it\u0027s an imperfect world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmokerCraft","CreatedById":233464,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-28T21:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaying privately held companies typically have long term visions beyond short term profits while publically traded companies dont is a huge generalization and not accurate.
