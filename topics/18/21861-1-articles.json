Transportation is expensive and time consuming, and only the rich do it, as status statement. The only things physically transported are crops and raw materials. The shipping carriers operate at huge loss and are subsidized by a failing U.S. government that lives off it\u0027s inexplicably large remaining reserve of natural gas. Blimps have made a comeback in the private sector. Most of your time is spent interacting in the global virtual worlds online. Most of what you need can be download and manufactured or grown within a few miles of home, it\u0027s that or you can\u0027t afford it anyways. Netspeak is completely incomprehensible to old folks without years of training and immersion. Africa is still starving. The middle east is still fighting. You carry a battery with you during the day and it is the only thing in your pocket. it is about the size of a typical cellphone battery without the cellphone but it holds hundreds of times more energy. You can buy a new one if you lose it for about half the price of a meal. If you need a computer or phone, any random piece of gadgetry within arms reach will suffice once you power it, root it, and give it a tunnel to Sweden, you primarily interact with things via cameras and micro-projectors. Space around earth is very slightly less empty. Most of the stuff up there is broken. There\u0027s lots of little solar thingies the size of a coin flying around in the upper atmosphere though for God knows what reason, but they\u0027re cheap. There\u0027s a bunch of these in the atmospheres of other planets too, accidently DDOSing the only relay satellite. There are a mind numbing diversity of currencies in use. None all that much more reliable than say, the Peso, with the exception of natural gas.

Unless of course those guys in Arizona perfect their thing that takes carbon dioxide and water vapour from air and turns it into petrol, we\u0027ll either be using electrric or hydrogen fuelled cars - most likely a combination of both with hydrogen being prevalent. Because of lack of fossil fuels, most non-renewable resource fired power stations will have been shut down and replaced with either nuclear or green energy generation facilities. Nuclear could refer to fusion too - the biggest problem with fusion in 2012 is getting funding for a reactor large enough to sustain fusion reactions. By this time, the concept will have been proven and several nations rich enough to do so will have constructed fusion sites. For fission, it will be divided between conventional reactor types and Molten Salt Reactors - those are currently in development, but have a lot of advantages over uranium fuelled plants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlobal warming would be making life difficult across the globe - despite efforts to reduce carbon emissions [mostly successful now that oil and gas have been exhausted] CO2 will continue to affect climate until it can be brought back to safe levels.

This will cause more wars, sudden famines as the agricultural systems collapse (thank you Monsanto!), the return of auto-immune strains of diseases, and so on... At this point, the World\u0027s population will rapidly decrease, with lots of suffering and pain. We might go extinct, but more probably we will reach a bottleneck of a few million people like we already have.

It used to be about creating wealth based on growth, but infinite growth is impossible in a finite system. Wealth can no longer be created ex-nihilo. Resources and habitable/arable land surface don\u0027t grow, while population grows exponentially. This means that either we need to share our wealth (this means that rich countries have to give up their lifestyle, which they are not prepared to do), or we have to just accept that fewer people get richer while more people get poorer (which will significantly increase social pressure both on national and international levels).
