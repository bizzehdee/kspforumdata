I told him most of what you read above but he insisted on coming to the planetarium so he could see the star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen he arrived, he told me that he\u0027d received a certificate with coordinates for his star, a star map with his star circled, a letter from the company congratulating him on his place in the heavens and an order form for the book with his name in it. Unfortunately, he brought none of this with him. He\u0027d written down the coordinates on the back of a supermarket receipt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I went to my computer and checked the coordinates using an astronomy program. Then I used a second program. Finally I pulled up a third program which showed stars to 15th magnitude*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI explained to him that astronomers use fairly high precision numbers for stellar coordinates. The coordinates he had were only accurate to minutes of arc rather than seconds of arc.** Within a one arc minute circle, there were half a dozen stars. I told him he could take his pick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe went into the planetarium where I pointed out the region of the sky where his star resided. Naturally, because our planetarium only shows stars down to about 6th magnitude, there was nothing for us to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not exactly sure how the next turn of events took place but he demanded to see my supervisor. When the boss came down, my visitor complained about my inability to show him the star he\u0027d bought. From his perspective, if I couldn\u0027t find his star, I must not know much about astronomy. My boss, who just retired after 33 years in the planetarium field, told him that he couldn\u0027t find it either; it was just too dim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guy was pretty hot under the collar when he left and I haven\u0027t seen him since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you wonder why all of that comes from web.archive:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ISR threatened Perkins Observatory at Ohio Wesleyan University with legal action when assistant director Robert Martino put up a website criticizing star-naming companies, despite it being factually correct.[6] Even after Martino removed any direct reference to ISR, he was warned that he should not talk about star-naming at all.[citation needed] Eventually Martino was forced to host his criticisms privately and on newsgroups.[7]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-25T11:41:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2014 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aghanim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T15:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell hopefully you\u0027re not too disappointed at the news of your certificate being worthless.
