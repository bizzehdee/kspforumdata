They stream live on most Saturdays, and generally get just a few thousand views per recorded episode put on Youtube. But they\u0027ve still managed to consistently snag very impressive interviews with people in the Newspace movement. Just to name a small subset of examples: Mads Wilson from Copenhagen Suborbital came all the way to California to be in the studio (for a few thousand views on youtube...!); they\u0027ve had Dave Masten talk very candidly about his passions and projects both in the show and in a completely unscripted after-show session; they\u0027ve had firsthand eyewitnesses report from Mojave after the SpaceShipTwo crash; they at one point (years ago) even had Elon Musk on the show; and in the most recent episode had the CEO of Mars One personally speak a little about how he thinks they can totally pull it off after all. The show covers a very wide range of spaceflight related topics, and it\u0027s well worth to go through the archives and watch (at least) some of the 2014 episodes if you\u0027re interested in that kind of thing. Which I assume you are, because you\u0027re playing Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to the purpose of the post: the first episode of 2015 has been teased to, and I quote, \u0022be a little Kerbal-based, hopefully\u0022.

One of Rowsdower\u0027s under-the-hood dealings he mumbles about in every Devnote Tuesday but somehow never is ready to reveal just yet? Might we possibly see Maxmaps or even HarvesteR join the TMRO people in the studio? Or perhaps something entirely different, like a community event?
