day i live, i grow more and more concerned about the future of our species, i firmly believe were not thinking hard enough as a species about where we want to be in 100 years, weve made it so far, weve modernised to a point that its possible no other species in the universe has yet reached our level of advancement, we were\u00A0fortunate enough to evolve higher than average intelligence in the mess that is the evolution of life, and yet we choose to destroy our planet without thinking about where were going to go next when the planet can no longer support us, were well aware of the effects we have on it, and that were relying on outdated and non renewable methods of obtaining energy, so we cant be a stay at home civilisation as it stands, and were not certain such a civilisation is even possible, we fight each other, hunt species to extinction, and have extremely closed minded thinking when it comes to our view of the world. im going to get to the point now, if we are to continue surviving as a species, we need to leave the planet, this is extremely clear at this point and yet people only think of themselves and what the taxes they pay to the government can do for them personally, at this point theres probably a few people who think im a hypocrite for saying these things \u00A0but let me make it very clear, i want the taxes they\u00A0pay to go to turning us into a spacefaring species, not into weapons to wage war, not into a health care system ill only take advantage of later in my life, and not into construction projects to create jobs, none of these things matter while the clock counts down to the time when we run out of non renewable resources and no longer have a way to leave the planet weve now destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif we invest in our space programs, things will be rough for a long time im not going to deny this truth. people in first world countries who dont have jobs will still not have jobs, the national debt in the case of the united states will still be there, people in first world countries will still starve and have no access to clean water, but with the population growth running as rampant as it is, we do not have the means to solve those problems directly no matter how much time and resources we put into it, but if we had access to the solar system weve been ignoring for next to no reason other than the general public isnt interested in \u0022that waste of money, build more weapons to keep us safe, and my brother johnny still has no job\u0022, we would have the resources to solve all those problems and more, and the economy would enter a boom for the next couple of thousand years. my personal feelings are that we need to stop giving government run space programs pocket change that they can barely do anything besides send a small probe to some place with, and start giving them large amounts of money they can actually make some progress with, commercial spaceflight shouldnt just be about touring low earth orbit, it should be about settling humans on other worlds, we have access to so many asteroids we could gather valuable resources from, and use as space colonies using the rock of the asteroid to shield us from radiation extremely close to us on a cosmic scale, were missing out on a very powerful kickstart to completely solving the problems we have here on earth just because we feel we should focus on them right now, but the direct approach is not always the best as weve proven countless times throughout history and appear to be proving yet

population problem by giving them somewhere relatively nice to go, because you can afford to have nice places like that for them, now that you have a Quintillion dollar mining industry among many other industries, and they can afford to go there because of their newly found well paying job, you also now have access to more of the suns energy and the capability to build as many solar collectors as you so please, creating another massive energy based industry for people to find employment in, you also now have an entire solar systems worth of farming land to grow food from, and a trillion

people say is that one asteroid contains more gold in it than humans have found in all of human history but asteroids arent just gold and platinum, you can make rocket fuel from the resources you find in asteroids, asteroid spaceships have been presented as a viable option for space travel within the solar system, not to mention the massive amounts of water, which isnt something thats really going to tank the global economy considering that we use it for so freaking much, with this new abundance of useful resources i believe the economy would be at the best its ever been since economy started to matter, same with iron and aluminum and copper and we can probably even find some carbon and oxygen mixed in there somewhere, the last thing on my mind and on anyone sane\u0027s mind is gold and

it means people were going to start leaving the planet and there was a brighter future ahead for our species, theres probably no one on this planet who shares the same opinion as me but as unfortunate as it is, theres also homeless people and people in 3rd world countries who are starving and dont have access to clean water and are suffering from the effects of industrialisation in their respective regions and overpopulation, those people dont act based on what they want they do what they need to in order to survive and find a better life at some point hopefully, dangling a $40-100/hr job in front of them building infrastructure in space and offering them access to food and clean water and a decent place to live to boot, they may not want to, but that is the best opportunity they have and that gives them a chance at a much better life, just like how people will immigrate to other countries in search of a better life, not because they particularly want to, but because its often the only choice they have, just no instead of it flooding our respective borders with immigrants, we have a place to put them, and a moderately nice one at

as a viable option for space travel within the solar system, not to mention the massive amounts of water, which isnt something thats really going to tank the global economy considering that we use it for so freaking much, with this new abundance of useful resources i believe the economy would be at the best its ever been since economy started to matter, same with iron and aluminum and copper and we can probably even find some carbon and oxygen mixed in there somewhere, the last thing on my mind and on anyone sane\u0027s mind is gold and platinum, also in this case a monopoly on those

is ignoring the problem hoping it will go away itself now, except that i would be doing something to try and help even if i succeeded only halfway, i would be able to stand tall knowing that i at least tried and made a difference, for me its not about propelling humanity into a golden age, its about ending as much suffering as possible, fulfilling my dream to see humanity explore space, and insuring that we at least add a few more thousand years to our life expectancy as a species, i want us to survive not prosper,i understand very well that simply going to space wont insure humanity

surviving the next 10\u0027000 or so years and continuing the journey that was set in motion by me, because if i was able to set in motion said events, i wouldnt just be directing everything, i would
