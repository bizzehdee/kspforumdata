But, I ask, why even make KNO3 motors? There are a wide variety of motors that you can purchase online or at your local hobby store. They offer a wide variety of different thrust levels. There are even motors that you can purchase, \u003Cem\u003Elegally and without a license,\u003C/em\u003E almost as powerful as the one I flew this rocket on. And, if you get a \u0027high power certification,\u0027 the sky is no longer the limit: Bigger high-power rockets can track up to the edge of the atmosphere, with motors that have been legally made by a prominent manufacturer. (Try Estes or Quest for your smaller motors, and Aerotech/Animal Works/Cesaroni for your higher-power motors.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my advice to you. Join a rocket organization called the NAR (National Association of Rocketry). Fly your rockets at one of the model rocket clubs that is likely not too far from your home. Look at the rockets they fly there, the ones that are bigger than yours. Ask lots of questions. Gradually, work your way up, until you are flying rockets around the size of the one shown in the video. At this point, you can legally get the permits from a rocket organization called Tripoli. Get into a website called The Rocketry Forum; they have a great \u0027research motor\u0027 section. But as you rise through the ranks of rocketeers, you may find that commercially produced model rocket motors are just as good and fun as their KNO3 counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a nice day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firov","CreatedById":57445,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T23:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould... could you help me out with something?\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m slowly pushing my way into model rocketry, and I want to start making Kno3 rockets, but the nozzles...

These are fun to make. I assume you\u0027re talking about KNO3/Sugar rockets, AKA candy rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a rocket powered by a \u0022G\u0022 class KNO3/sugar engine for my senior project in high school. It actually worked extremely well, considering how I had to machine the motor, design the rocket, and cast the fuel grains. Now that I think about it, I\u0027m kind of amazed my teachers allowed that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what are you making the rocket casing out of? Metal? Or are you trying to use a PVC casing with a graphite nozzle? I used low carbon steel (AISI 1018) for the nozzle and forward bulkhead. I used electrical metallic tubing for the motor casing. However, it\u0027s also possible to make \u0022disposable\u0022 rockets using a graphite nozzle. Just don\u0027t expect it to last through multiple launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the following link. It\u0027s a site run by Richard Nakka, who\u0027s about the closest thing to an expert on KNO3/sugar fuel you\u0027ll find. I\u0027d suggest taking a close look at the A-100M rocket motor design and test data on there too. It\u0027s an excellent starting point for making your own KNO3/sugar rocket motors. Plus, when you\u0027re getting started with these, you don\u0027t want to jump straight into a large motor. It takes time and practice to perfect your methods for casting fuel grains into the motor casing. Plus, as long as you\u0027ve got a good recovery system it\u0027s reusable, and actually really cheap to run unlike commercial rocket motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nakka-rocketry.net/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh. Looking over it now, it looks pretty much the same as when I referenced it for my high school project back in 2006. Still, the information on there is excellent, no matter how old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would be very careful with the fuel mixture when you\u0027re casting it. While it might be called \u0022candy rocket fuel\u0022, it\u0027s not something to be trifled with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T04:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould... could you help me out with something?\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m slowly pushing my way into model rocketry, and I want to start making Kno3 rockets, but the nozzles...
