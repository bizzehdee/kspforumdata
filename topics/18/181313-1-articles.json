Easier to keep track of anyway. I\u0027m intentionally being vague about details here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo background information. I moved in with friends 5 years ago into a big house with the ultimate goal of cheap rent for everyone, a garage to learn to fix cars, and a sizable yard. Sort of worked at first but the one person with their name on the paperwork claimed more and more of the house for their \u0027business\u0027. Their business wasn\u0027t a particularly clean one. No amount of arguing or attempting to compromise accomplished a single thing. This person had two dogs which don\u0027t get much more than fed and let outside. One they insisted on getting as a puppy and didn\u0027t do much in the way of training. The other actually came in through a person that was there briefly and is about the nicest dog in the world named Zeus. I and another friend of mine brought him to our rooms so he got to be with hoomans that actually care about him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there was a final catalyst and we both decided it was time to move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up moving in with my cousin short term although i had looked at several apartments, and a couple houses but held off due to not really having the money saved up and another factor I don\u0027t wish to dig into here. As you can probably imagine the previous person in charge wasn\u0027t willing to give up Zeus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI brought my cat, but i couldn\u0027t bring Zeus. My cousin is in a apartment and most apartments frown on big dogs. My cousin might have a hard time handling him if needed. Although the worst he\u0027d ever do is sit on you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen a number of posts of peoples dogs online lately and it\u0027s getting to me. a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s ok there mostly. He gets food and water and goes out. He\u0027s getting old though and I\u0027m hoping i can still get him out in the few years he has left.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI miss Zeus. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-11T23:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2019 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceMouse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T02:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait, it gets worse.
