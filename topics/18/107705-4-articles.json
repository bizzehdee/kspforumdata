Staging was never really implemented in AI, so when you turn on the engines, it is turning on all the engines and the flames from the engines will blow up stuff that they burn, you can click engines to turn them on and off though, that might solve your problem.\n\nPlanetes already has a download available, there is a link for the pc and Mac version on the first page of this thread. I do not recommend trying it just yet as it was a very early demo. I plan to put up a new download in a week or two that should be much better.\n\nThanks for your interest in the game!"},{"CreatedByName":"CAKE99","CreatedById":150099,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T03:50:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a expert, [but I think you may have some issues over the name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetes)"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T12:44:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, CAKE99 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not a expert, [but I think you may have some issues over the name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetes)\n\u003E \n\nHaha, yeah I was a bit concerned the first time I did some research on the name and that show popped up, but I talked to a copyright lawyer who said it should not be an issue for several reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"LordOfMinecraft99","CreatedById":159942,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T12:56:08Z","Content":"Your game is really cool!

More parts are certainly coming, but I have been primarily working on AI, the player astronaut and controls for that, the beginnings of the resource system, and general ground work for the vehicle interiors system (no point in adding habitats until there is a system for actually walking around inside the spacecraft ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) ) \n\nThanks for the bug report, I have known about that one for a little while and keep forgetting to fix it.\n\nI studied game development/art/programming at university, but honestly the majority of what I know I learned on my own."},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T14:32:47Z","Content":"Hey we got the game greenlit!\n\n![nIq7zUa.png](http://i.imgur.com/nIq7zUa.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Devonian","CreatedById":154504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T05:36:25Z","Content":"Hey, how\u0027s progress on this game going?
