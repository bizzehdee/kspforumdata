And I immediately found that OBS doesn\u0027t REALLY record at full resolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a screencap I took of an OBS video where I recorded my monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VpxS8vj.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VpxS8vj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest image is the actual window the video player is in. It\u0027s the ACTUAL resolution of my monitor, or at least after Imgur processing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next image down is what OBS saw of itself. Notice the considerable drop in resolution? Yeah, that\u0027s what this thread is about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know how to fix the resolution issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy monitor is 1280x1024 (not a widescreen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T02:36:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnionPacific1983WP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnionPacific1983WP","CreatedById":140982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T22:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone with knowledge of OBS know how to fix this?
