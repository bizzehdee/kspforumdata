Bad science, I know, and a lot of contrived things in it. But in spite of these things, it still managed to give me a sense of wonder that I haven\u0027t gotten from a fiction film in a long time. More classic examples include the original Journey to the Center of the Earth film (the remake did nothing for me), and Fantastic Voyage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt made me wonder if there other movies out there like this that I may not have ever seen. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s ultra-realistic, or if the scientific knowledge is too outdated.
