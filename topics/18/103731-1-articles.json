I find the wide field of view you get with bins much better for sky-scanning and learning your way around the various bit\u0027s and bobs, where as a telescope is much more complex to set up and aim (in general) and with a much narrower field of view so you really are going for a targeted spot in space.\n\nIf I was to give some advice though it would probably be as follows (regurgitated from pro\u0027s when I was looking):\n\nSpend a lot of money on the mount/tripod, it\u0027s virtually as important at the actual scope, I would say more so but there\u0027s no point in having a lonesome mount.\n\nIgnore magnification power - This is because you can put a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chigh power\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 eyepiece on basically any telescope and get a ridiculously high magnification power, but unless the telescope has a large enough aperture and quality optics to support that magnification, you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to get a sharp image.

Sure it\u0027s not getting all wrapped up and heading out to a dark sky sight, but it is very very rewarding, and when else would you be allowed to control a half meter Ritchey-Chr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9tien or a 20 meter radio telescope!?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It is nice for the sort of casual observation you seem to be going for. I have done a little photography with it, and it is not that great of course, without tracking et cetera, but it works. I have visually resolved some things of interest, easily all four large Jovian moons, as well as some bands, the Red Spot, crescent of Venus, Saturn (initially found by pointing at a bright but unidentified star. That was fun), lots of craters on the Moon (who would have guessed?) and the Orion Nebula, among other targets. I have not really looked at Mars, however, which strikes me as strange. I will have to remedy that.\n\nRegarding aiming, the viewfinder is pretty good as relates to finding what you are looking for, iff you know where it is to begin with, and especially if you can actually see the target visually (or with binoculars). It is possible, but slow to point it without, and seems to me easier to align the viewfinder than some larger telescope viewfinders (with the obvious drawback of the 0 magnification one here).\n\nStructurally, the base and telescope are sound. Granted, I have treated mine delicatley, but all the components are sturdy, and can hold up well after several years of bumping around. There is one exception, in my case at least, as one of the grips on the focus broke off fairly early on. This, however, poses no problem for overal useability and seems an anomoly.\n\nAs far as transportability, it is not as easy to pack and move as many smaller telescopes; it is bulky and somewhat massive to carry by hand for long stretches, but as a Dobsonian, it is very easy to set up once you get to a flat place, essentially just set the two parts together and lock some springs to hold the telescope to the mount. If you have a car/truck to move it with, you should be good, without need for any help.\n\nReading over some of your desired parameters, I would imagine that it would suite your needs pretty well, and I would gladly answer any specific questions you have about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:24:19Z","Content":"Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread, after a lot of research and input from forum members in this thread, I have decided to make my own 8\u0022 Dob."},{"CreatedByName":"Hunting.Targ","CreatedById":141427,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T05:05:12Z","Content":"Well, congratulations and godspeed!

It is now mine, and I have not used it much in the last 10 years. When building your own, learn a lesson from the Hubble; the specifications for the primary mirror are of critical importance. Be sure your intended focal length and concavity are compatible with an existing line of eyepieces, or you may need those to be custom-made as well. The primary mirror should either be special-ordered or fabricated professionally, just like a major observatory; glass grinding, polishing, and coating is by no means a DIY project anymore. Also, it would be in your interest to subscribe to a periodical for amateur observers; if you are just interested in skywatching, I\u0027d recommend [S](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/)[ky \u0026 Telescope](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/) ; their focus has always been on observing the night sky.
