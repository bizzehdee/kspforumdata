Last year I received a DLink DIR-835 wireless router, with a USB port. This year, I received a WD MyBook 3TB external HDD, with the thought I would hook it to the router. No dice! The HDD works fine directly connected to a PC, but not the router. My research on the dlink forums has found that it\u0027s too big for the router to read. Apparently a lot of the DLink routers top out at 500GB-1TB. I haven\u0027t found any more recent info or updates on this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone suggest a workaround for this? Failing that, any suggestions for an affordable wireless router with an USB 2.0 or 3.0 port that can share and stream from this HDD?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T05:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee if you can flash a firmware on your router that supports DLNA and drives larger than 1 TB.
