I played the Civ 1 version as an undergraduate. However, my passion for this game combined with the demands of graduate school led me to a difficult resolution: to desist from _all_ gaming until after I had finished graduate school. That was a good solid ten years from immediate post-baccalaureate until I started gaming again (1993 to 2003). When I returned to gaming, it was of course the latest Civ of that day to which I turned, Civ3. Civ3 with the Conquests expansion was, IMO a pretty close to perfect strategy game, and I have played in the years since then, many, many different computer strategy games (strategy board games were a hobby in high school).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day I would like to see a game that comprised a fusion of an historical simulation game such as Civ with the space flight and exploration features of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically: Imagine Civilization with KSP. Wouldn\u0027t that be AWESOME!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Supreme Ruler series, or Europa could just as well serve as the \u0027model\u0027, though I think the inclusion of culture, technology, espionage, religion, etc. in Civ 4 would make for an excellent fusion with a space sim like KSP. Games like Galactic Civlizations or Distant Worlds could suffice as the model to \u0027fuse\u0027 with on the other end of the historical developmental continuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what Squad would think of this, but it almost seems to me that the planetary \u0027canvas\u0027 has been left intentionally \u0027blank\u0027 for some reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust imagine a game where you start in the era of Galileo, and guide your society through both competition with other societies, and guiding of your research and intellectual development toward interstellar ascendance. It seems to me that the KSP engine would suffice VERY well for the period after flight and all the way through faster than light travel, and in the long run, perhaps even galactic colonization?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T02:19:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 3 games that i\u0027ve always dreamed of making:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper Coup Simulator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelf-Explanatory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECall of Duty: Padded Chair \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(NOTE: Completely stolen from The Colbert Report without any remorse or regret)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESit in a padded chair looking at a radar screen.

Suggest starting with the 2020 one (or whatever it is) NOT the Cold War one. That is the order in which I did them and I think you\u0027ll get the most mileage out of it that way. Both are awesome games, but the 2020 is the older one and _slightly_ more simplified. Great forum community too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn and one more thing: I suggest playing as Egypt. Great starter nation, not too powerful, not too weak and with lots of potential. Good learning starter position in both games actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T13:05:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T16:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECiv and KSP, an awesome concept.
