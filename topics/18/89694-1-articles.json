Just a year ago I purchased a NexStar 4SE, which is smaller and a little different from the one you are looking at, and I like it a lot. From even the 4SE I get good views of Jupiter and Saturn, Mars is decent, and Uranus and Neptune can be seen but they appear as stars without higher magnification (eyepiece). In terms of deep sky objects, I\u0027ve seen several galaxies and nebulae with not much problem. With yours, you should get even better results. Keep in mind you need a dark sky site. I could see more with my 4 inch scope out in a dedicated observing site than you could ever see with an 8 inch from a big city, light pollution is a big factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree with what everybody else is saying about going big. If you have the money, start big. 8 inch is a good size middle ground telescope and seems to be pretty good middle ground in terms of power vs. portability. I actually wouldn\u0027t go much over that for a starter scope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My biggest piece of advice would be to get yourself some good eyepieces! I\u0027m stuck with some old eyepieces I got from a cheap telescope years ago and they are the bane of my astronomical viewing. It looks like your scope might come with a 25mm eyepiece, mine did too, and that is a good starting point. I would try to grab something around 10-15mm for a good balance, and somewhere between 5mm-10mm for planetary viewing. For your power problem, I use a portable power pack sold by Celestron, it\u0027s rechargeable and you just need the right cord to plug it right into the scope for power. Lots of other good stuff too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.celestron.com/browse-shop/astronomy/accessories/other-accessories/powertank,-12v-power-supply\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.celestron.com/browse-shop/astronomy/accessories/other-accessories/powertank,-12v-power-supply\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely recommend Orion Telescopes, it is a good site that I have bought just about everything from! The Celestron site isn\u0027t very clear about what comes with the scope, but Orion has a page about everything included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.telescope.com/Celestron-NexStar-8SE-GoTo-Schmidt-Cassegrain-Telescope/p/9756.uts?keyword=nexstar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.telescope.com/Celestron-NexStar-8SE-GoTo-Schmidt-Cassegrain-Telescope/p/9756.uts?keyword=nexstar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Final advice: Think about whether or not this is a hobby you want to get really serious about, or just want to get casual looks through the scope. I\u0027m warning you: it\u0027s addictive! If you are interested, you could seek out an astronomical club in your area. I joined one near me, and I have gotten a lot of help from them and they are fun to talk with. If, however, you don\u0027t plan on being very active with the hobby, consider something lighter and cheaper. Obviously, a larger scope will require more dedication.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T23:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend the Orion StarMax for details on the moon, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s good for the gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T03:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start with I wouldn\u0027t buy from Amazon. Better off with an actual telescope retailer who know what they\u0027re selling and can give proper support if you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, start with a realistic idea of what to expect. The Moon will look spectacular, it does in just about any scope, but the other planets will look small. \u0022Pea-sized\u0022 is the common analogy. That said, a good scope and good eyepiece in good conditions can give a view that\u0027s crisp and detailed, and can\u0027t be imitated by print or screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for deep sky, bear in mind that most things you can see in a scope you can only \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E see. There\u0027ll be a few objects that are easy and that show some detail, but many more that take effort and technique to even see at all. A larger scope will move some things from the second group into the first. And expect a black-and-white view - very few nebulae show colour to the eye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d do well to look for sketches, rather than photographs. Cameras can do a lot more with the same size scope, but a sketch shows what the eye can see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour budget, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour portability requirements. Some scopes are bulky or/and heavy. An 8 inch Dobsonian for example will fit in most cars but isn\u0027t something you can carry in a backpack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want a computerised \u0022GoTo\u0022 scope? They seem great - input what you want to look at in a handset and the scope will point to it and then continue to follow it. But there are drawbacks. The systems need to be aligned first and the process can be confusing. The mounts often can\u0027t be used manually so when the batteries run out it\u0027s observing session over. The handset might be able to point to ten thousand things but that\u0027s no guarantee you can see them. And ultimately they mean spending money on electronics that could be spent on optics or mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
