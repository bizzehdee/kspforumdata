So \u002B1 to the two people working on Kenshi atm. (although it was just one guy until recently, going by the name of \u0022Captain Deathbeard\u0022. Yeah... He hired an art guy off the back of sales from greenlight publicity so the game should start looking a lot nicer over the coming months/years)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general idea is that everything that happens in the game story wise, is all emergent, and only partly depending on your actions. The entire world, and everyone in it, are all persistent, and simulated real-time, so that group of bandits that attack you, loot all your stuff, and leave you for dead in the first few minutes of the game (if you\u0027re stupid enough to get into a fight that quickly) will still be out there somewhere, getting into fights, growing in number and getting better stuff, right up till the moment you raid their camp with an army crying \u0022REVENGE!!!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFactions will war, make alliances, trade, expand, shrink, maybe be totally destroyed, all based on the unscripted actions of the NPCs, Stuff won\u0027t sit around waiting for you to get involved, big paradigm shifting events will catch up with you eventually. Even if you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bother getting involved and actively avoid it, the world around you will change regardless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this cool stuff is currently not yet implemented, and there\u0027s so much more planned. There\u0027s no way I could go into all of it, but it sounds fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the game stands, there\u0027s not much to do other than go out into the desert and survive, get stronger, fight bandits (or be bandits) and build a large squad of elite characters, fitted out with the best equipment, and maybe build a few bases here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedical system is nice, inventory is a lot like Shores of Hazeron, 4X timewarp for traveling across the desert at a reasonable speed, combat feels pretty smooth, the vast desert wasteland is a vast desert wasteland (but full of trade caravans, empire patrols, and bands of raiders/bandits). The next few updates (in the coming few months) should be a new set of character types, mining, and possibly crafting/manufacturing and research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome links:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(official website FAQ, good reading)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content\u0026amp;view=section\u0026amp;layout=blog\u0026amp;id=6\u0026amp;Itemid=53\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content\u0026amp;view=section\u0026amp;layout=blog\u0026amp;id=6\u0026amp;Itemid=53\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(year old trailer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXcuZV77UJY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(because Desura)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.desura.com/games/kenshi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.desura.com/games/kenshi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(indiDB reviews)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.indiedb.com/games/kenshi/reviews\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.indiedb.com/games/kenshi/reviews\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s one of the 9 greenlit games on Steam too, but Steam\u0027s community website is being awkward as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s free up to 2 characters, don\u0027t know if the demo has any other limits but the character one, don\u0027t think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone here playing/played the game?
