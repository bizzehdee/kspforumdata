I got into Orbiter after playing KSP\u00A0which helped me because i already knew the basics of orbital maneuvers. But other than in Kerbal Space Program i don\u0027t think you can learn the mechanism of Orbiter through actually playing the game. I spent a lot of time reading manuals and watching tutorials to understand the Multifunction displays and their uses,\u00A0and after flying a few missions to the Moon, Mars and a big one to Jupiter and its moons Io and Europa, i basically lost interest in the Game. I\u0027m glad i spent time with it though, seeing as it was part of the inspiration for KSP, but i can\u0027t see me returning to playing it very soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t recommend it as a teaching tool, but i would recommend you to try it out for yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-23T13:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP focuses more on the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0aspect, it\u00A0simplifies many things, making it playable, but at the same time, losing its realism.
