Small dots, some bigger some bigger, some smaller. We know they are there. We look up in sheer awe, moments later, the awe is gone, and we continue on with our lives as if nothing ever happened. I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look up in the cloud free starlit nightsky, I am captivated in a way few else are. I feel so\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 overwhelmed. I see the pure beauty of it all. When I look up I see everything. Everything from the mechanics that makes it all, to the reactions that annihilates it again. I see that which is common knowledge, and I see the unknown, what we yet have to study and understand. Everything from the smallest particle in the universe, to the largest structure that we have discovered is all within my field of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of photographs out there of the beautiful deep red, blue and green nebulae\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and galaxies out there. But of all those, there is one in particular that when I saw, it made me cry when I heard astronomer Carl Sagan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s little speech, the Pale Blue Dot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my little tribute:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhen I look at this photograph of Earth through the camera lense of the Cassini/Huygens space probe orbiting Saturn, I see but a dot of light. But my knowledge tells me otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that very dot of light is what we are. That dot of light is the light reflected from the planet we hold so dearly. That small dot of light is the place you were born, raised and the place you die. That is the place were your family lives, and will live on after you perish away into what we know nothing about. That single point in the distance is what keeps us alive, protects us from the insustainable dangers of the cosmos and still we destroy out only source of life. We ruin it, we mistreat it, yet we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care. On that dot we call home, is everything from the past, all that is right now and everything that will be.
