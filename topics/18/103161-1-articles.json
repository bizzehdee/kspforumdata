The first took my interest for a bit, but then the horrible FoV made me feel ill and I never played it again. HL2 just seemed a standard FPS. Mechanically sound, and I enjoyed throwing toilets around with the gravity gun but it just felt like a gimmick really. Nothing particularly special or memorable about it. I\u0027m not really a FPS fan and it didn\u0027t do anything to change my mind.\n\nI really loved Portal though. One of the best games I\u0027ve ever played. Portal 2 was very good, but maybe a bit bloated by comparison. And \u0022Still Alive\u0022 is indeed the superior ending song. Possibly my favourite song in video gaming.

Valve cut some things from the original, and its just unpolished.\n\nSo What I plan to do is play \u0022[Black Mesa](http://www.blackmesasource.com/)\u0022 basically a fan remake that is\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2TI4KWbYFs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nbut since: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The first of two releases of Black Mesa is currently available free for download. This release includes over 8 hours and 14 chapters of gameplay. The final release, via steam, is under development.\n\nsome of the final levels are not finished yet, so I\u0027ll just use console commands to skip right to where Black Mesa ends, and play the original to its end.\n\nThen [since Half-Life 2:Update just released a few days ago](https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-modders-have-made-valves-classic-look-bette-1693838716), I will play that version of the game, before moving to the 2 episodes.\n\nIm excited.
