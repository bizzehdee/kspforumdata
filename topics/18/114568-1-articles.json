If you think it is about it being video game related, you are missing the point. It is not only about coding and having experience, it also tells people you are having fun with code in your spare time, plus that it is a type of voluntary work. All those messages show good work ethics and that you enjoy doing the work you are applying for (rather than being another trained monkey hitting keyboard keys in exchange for money)."},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T06:49:16Z","Content":"True, but video gaming is just becoming socially accepted.
