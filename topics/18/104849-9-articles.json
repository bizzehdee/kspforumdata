Thats not to say the movies from books haven\u0027t been totally antithetical to their movie counterparts. Based on what I have seen from the trailers it looks like thay are going to be fairly loyal to the book. Also we have Andy Weir in his own words, said they were pretty loyal to the book. He had advanced copies of the script. Also I edit video for corporate events, parties, commercials, etc. and I can tell you the trailers are heavily edited. Now it doesn\u0027t take a person with my experience to know that trailers are heavily edited, however I can tell when someone is trying to tell a specific story and lead people towards believing something. In this case I can tell that the editor was trying to show how beloved the character is by showing everyones reaction to him still being alive. Thats all I am trying to say. I am not trying to figure out the entire plot. Call it hope that they are going to stay loyal to the book and that I am using all of knowledge to justify it to myself and other lol."},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T04:30:05Z","Content":"Heck, I think Matt Damon\u0027s gonna make a great Watney.

I mean October 2nd is less than a month away. So I would like to jump start the discussion to the book readers. What absolutely needs to be in the movie? They can cut everything else out what absolutely needs to be in the movie? Kinda a similar question but what are you looking forward most to seeing on the big screen. \n\nFor me honestly I am just happy to 1) Go to the movies and not see a huge superhero summer blockbuster. 2) See a movie that is 100% derivative of earlier movies. 3) a remake of a cherished childhood movie. 4) The conclusion of a series of movies that just has to be split into two. The martian is the answer to all of those things. As I said there is a reason hollywood sunk its teeth into the martian. In many ways its a unique movie. Obviously the stranded alone idea has been done but this the martian is a hugely optmistic book. Watney never gives up. The human race unites around him. Even the idea of us visiting and exploring mars is hugely optimistic. So that is what I am really just excited to see. Even if the movie isn\u0027t that great there is always the book. I am just happy its something different. I suppose to answer my own questions from above. I am really looking forward to seeing all of the space infrastructure. The hermes, the rovers, the mav, the hab, the suits, etc. It should all look wonderful. Also say what you want about movies like Prometheus, even though the story wasn\u0027t all that great. It was a gorgeous movie. All of Ridley Scotts movies are beautiful to look at, along with the props, and practical effects. So even if it sucks, at the very least will look beautiful."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T01:51:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So even if it sucks, at the very least will look beautiful.\n\nI\u0027m tired of movies like Gravity and Interstellar.

Why? Because they both had outstanding visual effects(Gravity did incredible CGI and Interstellar went for a great blend of CGI and practical effects), they were much more realistic than most space movies out there(ahem Armageddon, Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Event Horizon, Star Wars etc.) and they had good stories. Gravity\u0027s was simple, but used a lot of metaphors to convey the message of the movie and the protagonist\u0027s dilemma. Interstellar was a tad bit more complex, but was still very touching and logical, and by itself is an important movie because of the real issues it addresses, showing a not-too-distant future that seems much more real than other dystopia\u0027s we have been exposed to before.\n\nI have high hopes for The Martian. The book itself was great, and the movie\u0027s director is promising, as well as the cast(some of it from Interstellar too).\n\nI just hope they manage to put enough information into the movie and don\u0027t end up skipping important parts of the book."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T15:10:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see your point here.\n\nWe\u0027ve had these discissions before on this forum and I respect your opinion. But that doesn\u0027t change the fact that those two movies are highly polarizing. Some people really like them while plenty of others immediately think of them when the tooic of movies that are visually stunning but otherwise flawed is raised. I am looking forward to hearing what others think about The Martian when it is released. Hopefully it manages to live up to our high expectations."}]}
