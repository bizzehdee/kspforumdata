The main bass hook seems to be based around the three notes D#, G# and A. Apart from that there\u0027s that rising bit then up to a high note and back down for the main hook. The rising bit to me could be any four notes between E and A, I honestly can\u0027t tell (but I\u0027m leaning toward F# to A in semitones). After I\u0027ve tried it so many times they all sound virtually the same to me. Then I\u0027m not sure maybe the high note is an A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp if you please!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
