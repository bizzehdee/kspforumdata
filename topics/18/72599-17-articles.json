Because love is a powerful force to whoever experiences it. It makes us do things we wouldn\u0027t normally do. It gives us a will to survive for other people\u0027s sake, not just our own. Brand wants to follow her love because it compels her to do so. Of course that\u0027d be a lot more affecting if they\u0027d made her character slightly compelling and instead it comes off as \u0027I believe that love is a fundamental force of the universe!\u0027 which I\u0027m pretty sure isn\u0027t what the filmmakers intended. The movie as a whole could use some sharper editing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again I am not arguing that \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u003C/em\u003E is perfection. It is far from it. But saying it sucks is uncalled for. Sure it has its flaws (a lot of them) but at least it\u0027s a movie trying to get people interested in science and space travel in a way which is about exploration instead of about war and violence. It makes an effort to try to get things right where the plot allows it instead of making up a load of handwavium (tesseract aside) and on an artistic level it succeeds. Personally I think it\u0027s a great time to be a space fan. We\u0027ve had \u003Cem\u003EGravity, Interstellar, Europa Report\u003C/em\u003E and now \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E (which will hopefully be pretty scientifically accurate) in the space of what, three years? You can\u0027t expect movies to get everything perfectly right and lots of the time the needs of the story and the will of the director outweighs the benefits of scientific accuracy, but at least it\u0027s getting science out there in the public opinion. I bet thousands of people have gone out and learned about time dilation now who never knew it existed before thanks to \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u003C/em\u003E. We should be encouraging films which get people interested in space not saying they suck just because they don\u0027t meet our standards of scientific accuracy. You need to detach yourself more and enjoy the film for what it is, an illusion, a piece of entertainment, not a statement of fact. I think the movie suffered from mismarketing in that respect. People (including me) were expecting more scientific scrupulousness than actually happened but if you can look past that it certainly doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Esuck\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI intentionally didn\u0027t read much about Interstellar before seeing it recently to avoid spoilers and have an open mind about it.

If I find myself saying \u0022why aren\u0027t they dead?\u0022 when they clearly should be, or other errors, it pretty much wrecks suspension of disbelief. It is the same reason we rarely watch medical drama at my house, my wife rolls her eyes and instantly points out what is utterly stupid in real time (she\u0027s a surgeon).
