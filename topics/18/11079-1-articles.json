I\\\u0027ve only seen one other Annular Eclipse previously, and in some ways I enjoy it more than a total eclipse.\n\nWhat I find interesting about all this, is that the angular size of the Moon is directly proportional to the angular size of the sun (I think I\\\u0027m getting that nomenclature right), which allows us to see total eclipses at all. In a few tens of thousands of years, there will be no total eclipses ... everything will be annular eclipses, since the Moon is receding at about a little over an inch per year away from us (in 60k\u002B years, it will have redeeded about a mile from the earth). It won\\\u0027t be long until events such as tonight\\\u0027s will be more common-place, and total eclipses will be rare at best. On top of that, 65 million years ago, there also wasn\\\u0027t total eclipses ... the moon (being a LOT closer than it is today) completely BLOCKED the sun during an eclipse. Imagine those brief 20-30 minutes when the sky was as dark as the night, and all the stars were shining in their glory during the \u0027day,\u0027 and there was no \u0027diamond ring\u0027 during such an event. I daresay even the annular eclipse wasn\\\u0027t around back then, though I could be wrong.\n\nAmazing stuff!"},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T21:04:02Z","Content":"We had an eclipse party at our house, and we made a comedy sketch video based on the eclipse\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRFQ3ub9k1k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T01:20:28Z","Content":"Did someone fall down into it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T06:58:04Z","Content":"The view at my mother-in-law\\\u0027s house (visiting the in-laws paid off for a change):\n\n![Eclipse2.png](http://anachronda.homeunix.com:8000/~rivie/WoW/Eclipse2.png)\n\nThis was taken through two aluminized mylar pop tart wrappers, which are the source of the fuzziness."}]}
