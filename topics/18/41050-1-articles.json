The US was helped immensely with lots of lucrative contracts and jobs sent to high-level research and scientific programs, and NASA stuck it out as the forefront of human spaceflight. As for the USSR, the space program was a drain on finances in Khruschev\u0027s/Brezhnev\u0027s already weak economy held up by lackluster Five-Year Plans.
