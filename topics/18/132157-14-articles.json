The CurseForge search works a bit better than the Curse.com search and is being improved. Once the code base CurseForge is built on is ready (I have no idea what\u0027s left) it will be used to replace the Curse.com backend and fix a lot of the current issues Curse.com has while adding the improvements CurseForge already has. (This is my understanding of the solution planned)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the topic of ads:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ads on Curse.com mod pages (there are none of CurseForge) are used to cover the author rewards program where authors can earn points for downloads and exchange those points for Paypal, Steam or Amazon cards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople often seem to have an unrealistic view of how much ads are worth. A few ads on 1 site does not cover author rewards,\u00A0server costs and salaries for\u00A0coders, admins, reviewers, moderators, etc \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E have profit left over. Most people seem ok with the idea of ads as long as its offsetting the \u003Cem\u003Epersonal\u003C/em\u003E cost for a single person running 1 site. I am unsure why people get annoyed by ads offsetting the cost for a team of people maintaining multiple sites and giving the community content creators who host with us some reward for their time and creativity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETLDR\u003C/em\u003E: The ads on Curse.com are\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.)

People complain if anything goes wrong (understandably) and if everything is working, it often feels as if no one appreciates the volunteer work. Being paid a salary means someone like me doesn\u0027t burn out reviewing hundreds of files a day, monitoring 8 different forums for problems, and answering support questions that are frequently abusive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have made content that was used by millions of people with no appreciation and tons of complaints. I have been a volunteer for community sites. In fact, that\u0027s where Curse found me, volunteering as a site admin/manager and content creator for Minecraft. Then they offered to pay me to do the same thing but on a schedule. Having worked with both sides volunteer and employment, while I like the idea of community sites, I prefer the stability of sites where the admins/moderators are paid a living wage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Hosted and Run Platform:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Usually 1 person covers the costs - meaning they have to work a job too\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Volunteer staff: frequent burn out, difficulty scheduling coverage, has to take a back seat to real life and real jobs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Susceptible to closure when the founder gets bored, is tired, loses interest or any number of other issues that could occur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProfessional Platform with paid staff:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cost is not restricted to 1 person\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The staff are paid, they don\u0027t have to worry about feeding their kids or having shelter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Since staff are paid, if staff get bored with the topic, it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Easier to schedule coverage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- More stable, less likely to have service interruption\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Highly unlikely to vanish (I\u0027d say impossible, but I try to never say that)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sad that the founder of KerbalStuff felt it was time to move on. Having been there though, I understand exactly how depressing it can be when the people using what you created seem to only complain. Even when some people do express gratitude/appreciation , the complaints can overwhelm you and leave you feeling trapped and depressed. That\u0027s why I gave up on volunteering. Its much easier to handle criticism, complaints when its a job you are paid to do instead of a hobby you do because you love it. The complaints end up killing the fun of a hobby.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-18T05:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2016 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jadedcat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eelaboration and explanation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concodroid","CreatedById":153976,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T22:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy?

The CurseForge search works a bit better than the Curse.com search and is being improved. Once the code base CurseForge is built on is ready (I have no idea what\u0027s left) it will be used to replace the Curse.com backend and fix a lot of the current issues Curse.com has while adding the improvements CurseForge already has.

Most people seem ok with the idea of ads as long as its offsetting the \u003Cem\u003Epersonal\u003C/em\u003E cost for a single person running 1 site.

People complain if anything goes wrong (understandably) and if everything is working, it often feels as if no one appreciates the volunteer work. Being paid a salary means someone like me doesn\u0027t burn out reviewing hundreds of files a day, monitoring 8 different forums for problems, and answering support questions that are frequently abusive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have made content that was used by millions of people with no appreciation and tons of complaints. I have been a volunteer for community sites. In fact, that\u0027s where Curse found me, volunteering as a site admin/manager and content creator for Minecraft. Then they offered to pay me to do the same thing but on a schedule. Having worked with both sides volunteer and employment, while I like the idea of community sites, I prefer the stability of sites where the admins/moderators are paid a living wage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunity Hosted and Run Platform:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Usually 1 person covers the costs - meaning they have to work a job too\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Volunteer staff: frequent burn out, difficulty scheduling coverage, has to take a back seat to real life and real jobs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Susceptible to closure when the founder gets bored, is tired, loses interest or any number of other issues that could occur\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProfessional Platform with paid staff:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Cost is not restricted to 1 person\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The staff are paid, they don\u0027t have to worry about feeding their kids or having shelter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Since staff are paid, if staff get bored with the topic, it doesn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Easier to schedule coverage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- More stable, less likely to have service interruption\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Highly unlikely to vanish (I\u0027d say impossible, but I try to never say that)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sad that the founder of KerbalStuff felt it was time to move on.

Even when some people do express gratitude/appreciation , the complaints can overwhelm you and leave you feeling trapped and depressed. That\u0027s why I gave up on volunteering.

It not really that Squad is to blame for KerbalStuff\u0027s closure (especially since what hurt\u0027s the most is the sudden closure -\u00A0without much notification). Its all the other things that happened over the years. Remember the additional planets that were going to be added to the game? People were upset when resource gathering kept being pushed back (I still do not use it though lol). The clouds that still have not been added. After years in the alpha stages of development, the beta-launch was rushed within a couple months. The multiplayer system that has not been mentioned in a while, etc... (let\u0027s not forget the forum catastrophe!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo many features and mechanics\u00A0that slipped through the cracks over time. Each one of us had that one or two specific items in the old\u00A0\u0027planned features\u0027\u00A0list the\u00A0WE wanted but did not get (or at least not yet). It made some of us feel like Squad was not listening to US. Some people have even\u00A0stated that Squad will not implement certain features because modders could do it instead, even though that hasn\u0027t happened yet (Implemented: DRE, KJR, portions of FAR, etc..).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had mods up on the old Kerbal Space Port site, and aside from the comment/remarks section (which filled up quickly with negative comments from people who did not know how to install mods - modding was different back then) I though it was pretty good. I was even eager to see Kerbal Space Port II.\u00A0I was not expecting\u00A0the\u00A0outsourced mod hosting site we got. When I started a new mod I began looking for a host, and decided upon KerbalStuff. Why? Because it was specific to KSP, and it\u00A0was community driven. Besides I could always upload it to Curse if I didn\u0027t like it. As it turned out, it was perfect. As a mod\u00A0uploader, I cannot express how great of a tool it was to leverage. Many, many\u00A0features that I will now forever consider essential. Plus, at the time it was being developed, WE (us modders) were providing input to develop the features WE wanted (like analytics). A mod site developed by the community FOR the\u00A0community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is why\u00A0a lot of people feel that KerbalStuff is superior to Curse, and rightfully so. With Curse\u00A0(for some) it feels more like we are putting our mods on someone else\u0027s shelf in someone else\u0027s store so that they can make money off of our work (more than likely the REAL problem some people have with ads). Creating mods is time consuming and often difficult, and we care more about these creations that\u00A0most would\u00A0think. Take a look on these forums at the time and effort put into making the first post of a mod organized and visually appealing. Instead of simply stating what the mod is/does along with a picture of the item/action; modders create elaborate posts with different fonts, sizes, and colors - pictures, videos, graphs, charts, etc.. All of this because of the love we have for our mods, and the community that we bring them too. It is because of this care for our mods that many of us cling to KS, and honestly\u00A0for some people - if Squad had taken over KS, it likely would have lost some of its appeal (whether most people realize it or not).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately,\u00A0that is also why some people want to blame Squad. As stated above; for some people it is just Squad, once again, not listening to us. KS is what people wanted. There is no arguing the facts - there were twice the amount of mods on KS than Curse. KS was more popular. And, I suppose many thought Squad should have stepped in to financially help a site that was doing superior to there own chosen successor to KerbalSpacePort. After all Squad has been know to outsource\u00A0from the community before; programmers and modelers of exceptional mods have became employee\u0027s on multiple occasions..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as I have already stated, if Squad had stepped in and taken it over as the official mod hosting site - it would have lost some of its appeal. It would no longer be a mod site developed by the community FOR the community. I for one, am grateful that they left it alone (unless it was to be managed and developed\u00A0BY the community - which would make no sense).
