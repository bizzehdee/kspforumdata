If you intend to speak, make sure you adjust the audio levels accordingly, so that your voice isn\u0027t drowned out by the games. Alternatively, record your voice separately in a program like Audacity and sync it with the video track in editing, which is probably the best option."},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T03:52:29Z","Content":"As someone whose toyed with the idea of doing this (and that did involve some test uploads), I really like OBS (open broadcast software). I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find anything better without paying money. It\u0027s a bit more feature limited than something like Dxtory with regards to stuff like recording formats, but it works just fine once you set it up properly. That may be the biggest downside to it really, that it is almost certainly not the easiest recording software to setup, so you\u0027ll probably want to spend a couple minutes googling recording settings, and watch a video or two on youtube. I can provide the settings I use to record if you like.\n\nAnd of course, if you ever get into streaming, that\u0027s actually the bread and butter of what OBS does, so you can do both with the same program. One of the youtubers I watch has actually started recording everything with OBS instead of using dxtory for his youtube material to make his life a bit simpler.\n\nYou\u0027ll still need a program for video editing. For simple stuff, like cuts or some text on the screen, you can absolutely get away with windows movie maker, and I\u0027d actually recommend that you do exactly that, at least long enough to decide if this is something you want to keep doing and spend money on. And actually, to that end, I\u0027d definitely suggest starting with OBS and windows movie maker, since they\u0027ll at least be able to meet your needs long enough for you to decide if you want to keep going or not."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T04:32:50Z","Content":"There\u0027s a lot of stuff folks use, but I always turn to AV Linux ... it\u0027s free, and it\u0027s got a ton of stuff to work with.\n\n[http://www.bandshed.net/AVLinux.html](http://www.bandshed.net/AVLinux.html)"}]}
