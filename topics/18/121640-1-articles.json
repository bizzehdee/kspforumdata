Feel free to skip/ignore it entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like space. I\u0027m pretty sure most of us on this forum here do. As a kid, I thought space was the coolest thing ever and if you\u0027d have asked me back then what I wanted to be when I grew up, \u0022space engineer\u0022 would definitely have been extremely high up on the list (for some reason I wasn\u0027t that into being an astronaut, don\u0027t know why)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I grew older however, I somehow lost interest in space (what with the decommissioning of the space shuttle, budget cuts to NASA and all that stuff)... When the time came to go to university and choose a field of study, I chose to become an engineer, but not one that is even remotely specialized in the space industry: I work as a quality assurance engineer in the pharmaceutical industry. Today, my love for space has been re-kindled and redoubled (thank you KSP!!!!!) and one of my biggest regrets is that I didn\u0027t choose an education in aerospace. Oh well, at least I still get to go to space in KSP and get all excited over launches and SpaceX\u0027s efforts to land a falcon 9. Can\u0027t win \u0027em all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then yesterday, something amazing happened to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI work for a consulting company, and yesterday was my yearly evaluation. Now, working in the pharmaceutical industry, I get to know sterile cleanrooms and sterile working conditions pretty well. I also know that in order to build space probes, you need a dust free environment which essentially boils down to very similar cleanrooms and working conditions as we use in the pharmaceutical industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tell my manager I\u0027m open to projects in other sectors, and I hesitantly mention the space industry (hey, you never know, right?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.... it turns out that the majority of our company\u0027s projects are, in fact, in the aerospace industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that there\u0027s one particular client company that produces rocket and probe parts and who from time to time ask for experts on cleanrooms and cleanroom conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that the aerospace business managers also tend to ask their pharmaceutical colleagues if they don\u0027t have any consultants who know about cleanrooms since there aren\u0027t enough of them in their own sector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that she\u0027d be more than happy to present my profile in the future should the opportunity arise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just sat there with the biggest grin on my face, unable to speak for like 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuys... I might become a space engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is definitely long-term stuff for in a few years at the earliest and there are absolutely no guarantees that I\u0027ll be able to actually land a project with said company, but the possibility is definitely there. There is an actual, realistic possibility that I might just get my boyhood dream.
