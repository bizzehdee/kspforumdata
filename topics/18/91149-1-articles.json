I think they only went back to space once....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the show was fairly unrealistic in some aspects--we\u0027re nowhere near perfecting SSTOs, getting a little better at soft landings, etc.--it was still very well done for its time. Isaac Asimov was the show\u0027s scientific advisor, and that meant far less hand-waving than, say, the typical Star Trek episode. Discussions of fuel mixtures and orbital mechanics can be found in the pilot, and it\u0027s satisfyingly geeky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most relevant--I can\u0027t help but look at Harry Broadrick, Andy Griffith\u0027s character, and see shades of Jebediah Kerman in there. Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co. seems to owe a bit of a debt to Jettison Scrap and Salvage Co. And both Harry and Jeb have a similar outlook: They might not know how to build rockets, but they can find people who do, and when they do, ROCKETS WILL BE FLOWN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, if you remember the show, post your favorite memories here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T18:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I\u0027ve seen that, it\u0027s hilarious how silly it is.
