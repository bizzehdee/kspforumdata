It\u0027s going to be somewhere in the 700-800 dollar range, so I think it\u0027ll be a dobsonian one (the larger the aperture, the better).

There is clear chromatic aberrations, grain, hot areas, etc. He obviously used a tripod due to the extreme zoom though, but old tripods are just as good as new ones.\n\nPoint and Shoots are powerful for what they are and are very cost effective for the individual.\n\n\\*Of course, getting a CHEAP \u0022interchangeable lens\u0022 camera and using an adapter for a telescope isn\u0027t too bad either.
