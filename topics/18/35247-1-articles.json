I recently decided to look around at some apollo conspiracy stuff, and while I was knowledgeable enough to be able to shred every argument I found, in most cases without doing any research, I realized that these arguments could carry weight with people that don\u0027t have a scientific background. If all you\u0027ve got is a layman\u0027s understanding of radiation, the Van Allen belts can seem like a much nastier problem than they actually are. If you don\u0027t understand orbital mechanics, you wouldn\u0027t understand that reaching LEO really is well over half way to the moon in delta-V terms, despite being a few orders of magnitude short distance-wise.

Well, after seeing and understanding just how bad but possibly convincing the apollo conspiracies are, I\u0027ve gotten a lot more skeptical about the other ones, just because I see how easy it is to sound knowledgeable when the listener is trying to use common sense rather than actual knowledge to evaluate the argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, the world seems a less wonderous place to me now, which may be the fourth factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
