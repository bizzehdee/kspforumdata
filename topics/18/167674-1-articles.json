I\u0027m not entirely sure if it can crash your computer but it\u0027s never bad to check such things. Unfortunately, Windows have a bad detection for partitions it didn\u0027t made when installed, so you might want a second OS, or bootable OS (likely some form of linux)\u00A0from a flash drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-19T03:10:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2017 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
