And it looks like Vulkan is making use of all 4 cores in the bigger/faster moving scenes, which is nice.\n\nIf this was able to be directly applied with proportionate gains to KSP, I might actually be able to make interplanetary ships ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
