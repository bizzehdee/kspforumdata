His other stuff can be quite bloated with too much music. Mozart has a way of varying notes in his music rapidly, so rapidly that if his music were a story, it would be like lots of stuff happening all at once. It is actually difficult to keep track, so that hardly any Mozart music can I hum a tune to. Why? His music changes direction so much it is near impossible to remember a tune to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, I still love some of his violin sonatas, since while I cannot hum them, they are quite pleasant and pretty to listen to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso.... probably more importantly, Mozart\u0027s music is free. If you know where to look.
