The World Health Organization found that there was no risk to the general public inside or outside Japan, and predicted only a minor increase in cancer risk in Fukushima Prefecture. Despite this, the original incident received the same level on the international scale measuring nuclear incidents as the Chernobyl explosion! A Pew Study recorded that 51% percent of people watching coverage on the earthquake in Japan focused on the damaged nuclear plants\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E--how many deaths did the damage cause? As far as we know, zero so far.
