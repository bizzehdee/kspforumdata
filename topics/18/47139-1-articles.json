I looked down and saw the assault of enemies, as the foot comes back in. I start to climb up on every opening or wire that I can support my weight on. The miniguns mounted on the side of the legs blast, and I keep climbing. I reach the point where the legs connect, about 3.5 meters. I slap a magnetic grip on, and pull myself up. I grab hold of the handle just below the cockpit. I grab my pistol, and pull myself up one more set. I fire four, maybe five, rounds into the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
