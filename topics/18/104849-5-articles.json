Some dust, then nothing would be better, IMO.\n\nAt 2:30 or so in the video, the base of the ascent rocket is shown. It looks like this:\n\n![gTIEOmy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gTIEOmy.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m not sure what those little side-mounted rockets are, but I have good reason to believe that they are strap-on SRBs that just augment the main motors through the beginning of the boost. In that case, there would be SRB smoke a la Delta II. But again, this is just speculation based off some iffy source material.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Regarding the video, bandwidth is not a problem from earth at all. They can broadcast with vastly more signal strength than a small space probe. A manned craft with a nuclear reactor should not have much of a problem, either, frankly.\n\nOkay, that\u0027s fair. However, I still don\u0027t see why NASA couldn\u0027t have just sent a single image. Even if bandwidth wasn\u0027t a problem, sending that sort of video would be pointless.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You are 100% correct about the idiotic landing site. The reason is cinematography, I would imagine. They filmed in Jordan, and wanted it \u0022scenic.\u0022 They could have put it a little farther from the hill, and made a line saying that the MAV ended up closer to terrain than planned due to a problem.\n\nThat would have been nice. Alas, it was not so.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh right, since that rocket is lifting off from Mars ambient pressure, the plume should be way wider than shown! It should also be nearly transparent, because the fuel is almost nessecarily hypergolic. You are right about the lame landing site.\n\u003E But about the spacesuits, I was really discussing aesthetics. It simply doesn\u0027t *say* spacesuit when you look at it. At least Hermes shamelessly stole enough cues from Space Station to look like a real spacecraft. Even if it\u0027s completely unrealistic.\n\nIf I\u0027m understanding your original post correctly, it\u0027s not so much of \u0022bad aesthetics\u0022 and more of \u0022putting aesthetics before function.\u0022 And in my opinion, the spacesuits weren\u0027t really unrealistic... though they could have been done a bit better.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You know, if I\u0027m honest, this sort of attitude is why a lot of people find hard science fiction and its community rather alienating.\n\nIf I may counter with a statement:\n\nIf one creates a film that\u0027s supposed to be \u0022artsy\u0022 and it has terrible art direction, all of the aesthetically-oriented critics will bash it into small pieces. If a movie is supposed to have great sound design and it actually sounds like a cat vomiting, all of the sound-oriented critics will get out their sledgehammers and blowtorches. If a movie adaptation of a book is done improperly, all of the book\u0027s fans will grab pitchforks and sharp pieces of glass. If, however, a film is supposed to be accurate to science and it\u0027s not, you get a bunch of irritated people complaining about the scientifically minded individuals in the audience. \n\nI really don\u0027t understand this dynamic. I think it\u0027s caused by peoples\u0027 general lack of knowledge of science. At any rate, it\u0027s a little annoying.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...As for the \u0027sticks\u0027 - I went to a lecture from one of the Curiosity surface mission planners. Really interesting talk, lots of cool pictures, including ones of a rock formation that looked like nothing so much as the edge of a Styrofoam sheet poking out from under the sand. I was tempted to ask whether that was just the stage crew being sloppy with the packaging when they filmed that part, but thought better of it.\n\u003E So I can live with odd things on the Martian surface too. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI see where you\u0027re coming from. I should note, however, that there could not possibly be a cause for stick-like formations on Mars... *unless* they\u0027re mineral veins that were denser than the surrounding substrate. The substrate could have been worn away, exposing the small linear veins. However, this is quite unlikely, given that we\u0027ve only seen these mineral veins in a few places on Mars.\n\nThe \u0022sticks\u0022 are more likely pieces of the broken communications antenna (the one that stabbed poor Mr. Watney in the chest). Even then, though, there are a few problems. The relatively light sticks would have been blown much further than Watney was, and besides, the antenna probably wouldn\u0027t have come apart into so many tiny pieces.\n\nAs for NovaSilisko\u0027s theory that the set may have still had little scraps and such on it, you\u0027d think that they\u0027d at least try to clean up the scenes *that would be in the trailer* before releasing it. Failure to do so would be rather shoddy and would not bode well for this film, in my humble opinion.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:56:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Plus that front bit could be an expanding or inflatable HEART sheild.\n\nWrong movie... \u0022the power of lurve!\u0022 was interstellar."},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:32:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I may counter with a statement:\n\nYou\u0027re missing my point.

All they do throughout the interview is gush about the book. But Weir talks and admit happily about all the stuff that he got wrong. I think the trailer is getting alot from the book right. Its hollywood everything has to look cool or else people might not be interested int it. I love the suits I hate the helmets. Remember these have to be suits that he has to take on and off alone. Real spacesuits are impossible to take on and off alone. So the suits in the book take a giant leap forward in spacesuit technology. Again from the trailer you can clearly hear the abrupt cutouts and sound editing to make it all sound more compelling in a three minute trailer. There is no way they throw away the plot of the crew not knowing. Its too good a plot. So that bunch of pictures is probably Watneys FIRST transmission to NASA. Listen to it again its an abrupt cutout. Its \u0022Houston be advised\u0022 in one tone and then \u0022we are receiving a video message\u0022 in another tone. From the sound of it, its two differnt people actually. Jessica Chastain first and then Kate Mara. Then it flashes to the pictures. How do you know thats not some NASA engineer piecing the pictures together. To be critical of that part of the trailer really annoys me because it is clearly a nonlinear chain of event edited together to create a cool moment in the trailer. The hermes is gorgeous. Also to be annoyed at a transmission is ridiculous! It is nit picky and pedantic beyond anything that is acceptable. I am disappointed it doesn\u0027t look more realistic but lets pretend for the movies sake that NASA all of a sudden has an unlimited budget. And again its hollywood deal with things looking pretty!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T18:36:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:35:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re missing my point.

Only issue I have with it is the offset nose section, which might alter the center of mass a bit much. However, I would assume the engine could be angled in some fashion.

But yeah nothing can save a bad plot."},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:54:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...note that Squad is creating a group of people that notice as a *gut reaction* things wrong in Gravity that before only physics/astrophysics/areo-astro engineers would have likely noticed before...\n\nI unfortunately have this syndrome that has ruined Gravity, Interstellar, even the new Star Trek (the old ones are fine for some reason) and many others for me.

By all means, inaccuracies can be pointed out, but *damn it* there\u0027s no requirement to be completely condescending and pedantic about it all. *That* is what alienates others. There\u0027s almost never any credit given to what\u0027s done right or how much better it is compared to the current status quo. And, you know, it\u0027s almost exclusively done in these case by the armchair experts. In my observations, the *actual* scientists and experts are usually a lot more enthusiastic about a given film/book/series/whatever than those those in \u0022fan\u0022 communities, and are a lot more laid-back about things it got wrong.\n\u003E It eventually becomes this endless cascade of \u0022everything\u0027s so *horrible* and scientifically inaccurate and I hate it and I\u0027m not even going to *bother* with any movies anymore because hollywood will *never* learn how to do this right...\u0022 and so on.\n\u003E \n\u003E I tire of it. Greatly. And of course, I expect now to be pigeonholed as someone who doesn\u0027t understand science or spaceflight and is just trying to defend their ignorance, because that\u0027s usually the reaction I get to pointing this sort of stuff out. \n\u003E \n\u003E I *love* scientific accuracy in movies, and you know what? I\u0027m always very happy for what they get *right.* Negativity-for-the-sake-of-it just gives me gas.\n\nTo be honest, Nova, I don\u0027t disagree. Which is precisely why I said numerous times over the course of the video I made that I was being pedantic and actually apologized at the end. I understand your point of view, and I\u0027m sorry you feel that way. I think my inherently OCD nature got the best of me here. It won\u0027t happen again. (or at least, I don\u0027t *think* it will.)\n\nThat being said, there only really seem to be two or three people in this thread that are being overtly negative about the film, with the remaining group being neutral-to-positive. That\u0027s hardly a sign that our community is going in the \u0022I-hate-this-movie-and-it\u0027s-so-scientifically-inaccurate-and-wrong-and-Hollywood-sucks\u0022 direction.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh and UpsilonAerospace, sticks, really? That\u0027s getting conspiracy level pedantic in my books.\n\nConspiracy theorists are so awful because they draw absurd conclusions from seemingly normal images and ideas.

It alleges that Mars has a bunch of big buildings built by aliens long ago... and as evidence, it shows some lovely pictures of sedimentary rocks. It\u0027s quite difficult to believe because it\u0027s implausible and backed up by scant evidence.\nOn the other hand, with the sticks, I merely commented that there were a bunch of little linear things in the sand that really looked like sticks, and that I wasn\u0027t sure how they got there. It\u0027s not implausible that the filmmakers were shoddy and left a few sticks on the dunes. It\u0027s not implausible that the \u0027sticks\u0027 were meant to depict something else, either, which is why I never said that the things were sticks. I just said that they looked a bit like sticks, but whatever they were, I didn\u0027t understand why they were in the shot.\n\nI do agree that I need to become a bit less pedantic in the future, though. I suppose next you\u0027ll be telling me to watch movies because it\u0027s fun to do so ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T22:16:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"}]}
