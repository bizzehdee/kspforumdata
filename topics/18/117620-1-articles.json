It was awesome and i got to see some nice scenery\n\nMy hotel was surrounded by mountains. (I\u0027ll post some pics later on). I also got to go on a plane again which never gets old ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI went to see some historical sites also like the snow like place of [Pamukkale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale) which was really weird but awesome at the same time. \n\nI wanted to go to Ephesus but it was too far to go with my little bro so i suppose that is for if i go back to Turkey again.\n\nAny ways i just posted this to say i am back. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHere are some pictures.

I am not sure how powerful it is in relation to others because it\u0027s the first one I have got. It says less than 100 mW. It\u0027s really good for pointing at stars.

Pointing lasers in the sky is not illegal in any country in the world.\n\nPointing it at an aircraft flying, that is illegal if the power output is above a certain level.

I\u0027m not too far from [Lakehurst NAB](http://www.jointbasemdl.af.mil/units/lakehurst/)... they tolerate very little; You don\u0027t question much when you see big black SUV\u0027s with Govt plates cruising your neighborhood investigating things. They do such for less around here; I made the mistake once of stopping on the highway to take a picture of the static Blue Angel which sits out at the entrance on display ... I had armed MPs show up out of nowhere to ask what I was doing, check my credentials, and then advise me to \u0022*Move along. No picture taking allowed.*\u0022 ..... and I live here no less, even have done volunteer work at the base.

Should make for good entertainment. If the local police nab you, you might make the news. If MPs nab you, I doubt highly we\u0027ll hear about it. This I can tell you, they\u0027re actively seeking those who do such.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, and they way things are going these days, if people keep this stuff up, it won\u0027t be long before there is a law/regulation about sale/ownership of lasers and pointing them skyward.\n\nAnd I forgot, there\u0027s also news of this out in California.
