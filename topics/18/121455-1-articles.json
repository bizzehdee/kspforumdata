Most of the golden age stuff was published when the popular understanding of the planet was vastly different than now. Canals and aliens and whatnot. Even the works from the 80s and 90s are a bit off. Of those I\u0027ve read I can strongly recommend Kim Stanley Robinson\u0027s Mars Trilogy (in which I\u0027ve just made it to Blue Mars).
