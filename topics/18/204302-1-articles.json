I imagined it from the point of me if I were on the starship.\u00A0\u00A0Anyways, I hope you don\u0027t think it\u0027s horrible \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E:\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELog entry: 2042-01-29:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs usual I woke up a couple of minutes before my alarm could go, I pulled one hand out of my sleeping bag and checked my phone, 05:57, it said, I unlocked it and turned my alarm off before it went. I unzipped my bag and, still half asleep, drifted towards the roof with Leeutjie (my teddy lion I\u0027ve had for as long as I can remember, his name means small lion in Afrikaans) under my arm. I blearily took my toothbrush from it\u0027s velcro attachment and brushed my teeth, before putting my phone, Swiss army knife, and packet of duct-tape in my pockets, then I silently opened my cabin\u0027s sliding door and coasted towards the center (vertical) hallway. I grabbed a handle-bar at the top and swang\u00A0around so that I was travelling feet first, towards the cafeteria, when I arrived I swang myself inwards and navigated to the stockpile (where all the food is). The rest of the crew would be waking up at 06:30, I have to wake up earlier so that I can be in the caf before they arrive, (I\u0027m a robotics engineer and I will really only have a job to do once on Mars, so they assigned me to bar-tender duty while on the way). I took some sausages, some mango, and some dro\u00EBwors (a popular South African snack, we could pick some of our own food to bring with us, so I made a version which doesn\u0027t make a mess in 0g), and began eating.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI was halfway through my mango, when Cap (our nickname for our commander) came in and asked for breakfast, after getting her breakfast she left and went to check on the equipment, taking her breakfast with her. I was almost finished with my mango when the rest of the crew\u0027s alarms went off in the 2 hab floors below me. I gave them breakfast while taking a bite of my own food every chance I got. After they were finished I ate the last of my sausages, and kept the dro\u00EBwors in case I needed a snack, after that I had to restock the stockpile, so I went to the \u0022tip\u0022 (our constantly pressurized cargo bay which would also work as a launch escape pod, it has high-g chairs for all 50 of us, all our personal cargo, which we have now moved into our cabins (we had a max of 10kg each of personal items) and our food supply), I once I arrived, I let Leeutjie float (sidenote: he was our 0g indicator on launch) and pulled out the next month\u0027s food container, before grabbing Leeutjie and coasting back down with the container, past the observatory/\u0022rec\u0022 and into the caf. It would take a while to pack it all out and sort it, so I asked for help on \u0022ship-net\u0022 (the ship\u0027s personal network, we can message each other, look things up, watch movies, tv, or read books on it and avoid long transmission times with it) and Luis, (one of the other guys who also has almost no job on the way to Mars), came to help.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWe finished around 09:30. After that I went to the bathroom, shaved, went to my cabin, and watched an episode of MythBusters (Rest In Peace\u00A0Grant Imahara). Then, around 11:00 I had to go to one of our two daily gym sessions, I mostly jogged on the tredmill. I finished just before twelve o\u0027clock and went to my cabin, where I relaxed, continued re-reading the Hitch-hiker\u0027s guide to the galaxy, and played some KSP-2 on my laptop. At 1 pm, we had lunch, and it was basically the same ordeal as breakfast, after that a couple of us played a game I came up with, Zero-g drone racing, in the \u0022rec\u0022, I\u0027d built a small drone, fitted it with a massive battery, and made a course, I coded it to pilot it in 0g. It is a lot of fun, although I usually lose. After that I went down to the lab (situated below the lowest hab floor but above the main unpressurized (the whole thing will act as an airlock on Mars) cargo bay), to help one of the other engineers to get the 0g 3d printer up and running again. After that I spent a while in my cabin relaxing, competing in a race around the Ovin eleven (Ovin, it\u0027s rings, it\u0027s moons, and a couple of stations we made around it) in KSP-2, I came second out of the 5 of us who raced. after that I finished re-reading Hitchhiker\u0027s, went to gym session 2 and did practically the same as lunch when we had dinner.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAfter dinner, our data-dump came through and Jo-Ann, our sysop showed us the news, nothing much, just a new rocketlab Graviton launch, a small status update from the martian colony, and a couple of other things on Earth. After that I read some Asterix (a very funny French comic) and updated this log, anyways, it\u0027s almost bedtime, Good night.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you thought it was ok, I had a lot of fun writing it. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBy the way: Yes, I really am South African, and yes, I do sleep with a teddy lion named Leeutjie (pronounced Lee-oo-ki) and no I am not ashamed \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-11T13:28:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2021 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
