People teleportation (like in Star Trek).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, computer scans you, in the process your body is destroyed. Then information about your body is put in computer buffer (sometimes due to glitch for hours). Then computer rebuilds your body in other place using stored information. For me its just death of person in one place and creating copy in other. But nobody is disturbed by this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Infinite number of parallel worlds with copy of human population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike in SG-1 in few episodes. Sometimes one world helps another world, leaving 99,9999% others to its doom. Or not, because something is slightlly different in those. I don\u0027t like that - you would want to have your world somehow unique, and if there is device to travel between worlds you could easly transport army, goods between worlds. Something like in Terry Pratchetss \u0022Long Earth\u0022 - there are infinite number of worlds, but humanity is unique. So i accept parallel worlds as long there are no human copy on other worlds, or when parallel worlds number is not infinite (like in Fringe, there were 2 Earths, not more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have others (not \u0022no sound in space\u0022, but those somehow scientific) ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T07:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeh I think beaming people around is a bit of a cheat, probably the best thing about ENT is the fact they are forced to use shuttles a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Asgard can have it, so can the Alterans (as they made the gates) but no one else should IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to alternate realities \u0026amp; time travel, well I am not so bothered by that, except in X-Men, man that cartoon made my head hurt as an adult, how did it not as a child!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adammada","CreatedById":29884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T07:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to alternate realities \u0026amp; time travel,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, time travel - i\u0027ve forgot about that one.
