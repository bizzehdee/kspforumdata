After watching the first 2 episodes I can\u0027t say the show is really gripping me. I find the premise that scientists are massively offing themselves because they find out their science isn\u0027t right wholly unbelievable - then again, maybe they are being offed by some agency that hasn\u0027t been introduced yet (don\u0027t spoil it if that\u0027s the case \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it very fascinating to see how Chinese TV tropes are different from western ones though. It\u0027s extremely rare for anything Chinese to make it to my screens, and the ones that do are usually literary or historical dramas - not my cup of tea.
