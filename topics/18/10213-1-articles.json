This 8th-magnitude speck only gets about as far from Saturn as 6th-magnitude Europa does from Jupiter. It needs large, high-power binoculars. Saturn\\\u0027s rings, unfortunately, cannot be seen very definitely with magnifications less than about 20x or 30x.\n\nSooooo, you\\\u0027re probably not going to be able to pay less than about $120US (unless you find an online deal) for a decent pair of astronomical binoculars.\n\nThat being said, I observed Titan WAAAAYYYY back in my teens with a cheapo store-bought refracting telescope about 20-25 years ago.\n\nIncidentally, you can *make* you\\\u0027re own reflective telescope (a Dobsonian ... google it) for almost the same prices, provided you do your research and want to start an interesting hobby ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)[http://astroguyz.com/2007/12/27/making-a-newtonian-reflecting-telescope-for-less-than-50usd/](http://astroguyz.com/2007/12/27/making-a-newtonian-reflecting-telescope-for-less-than-50usd/)\n\nOr, if you want to armchair things and not spend a dime, check this article out ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif): [http://www.astrosaur.us/2012/05/01/amateur-astronomy-without-leaving-the-house/](http://www.astrosaur.us/2012/05/01/amateur-astronomy-without-leaving-the-house/)\n\nLots of options out there, and most are not prohibitively expensive.\n\nWith my cheapo refractor (parents probably paid less than $50 for it, I was able to map sunspots, the four largest moons of Jupiter (just like Galileo!), and map the \u0027illusion\u0027 of the changing inclination of Saturn\\\u0027s Rings, as well as the orbits or 2 or 3 of her moons. Also chronicled the phases of Venus, and managed to capture Mercury one time at crescent, just by accident. I *think* I even found Uranus, but as it was just a tiny speck, I can\\\u0027t be certain ... was in the right place at the right time, and most of the stars visible lined up correctly, but not all. Fun times back then."}]}
