Eventually your card is getting too hot and throwing too many errors, to the point where the whole thing locks up, taking windows with it... hence your need to ctrl-alt-del (\u003Cem\u003Eedit:\u003C/em\u003E no, hard reset.. ctrl-alt-del generally won\u0027t even work then.. but I think you said that already) and the bios temp warnings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeforce experience itself isn\u0027t causing the problems - the settings it\u0027s applying (which in theory your card _should_ be able to handle) is what\u0027s doing it. Given that you have a pair of 460s in there, I\u0027d guess they\u0027ve been in there a while... have you opened your case up and cleaned them up at all? You\u0027ve probably got a nice little felt blanket of accumulated dust and crud stuck all over the heatsinks and fans. Give them a bit of a brush with something soft and a good blow out.. Worst comes to worst, try leaving the side of the case off - you might find it lasts a little longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess though would be that one or both of your cards is on its last legs.

GeForce experience has a thing called GPU Boost, and from what I\u0027m seeing, it looks like your card isn\u0027t getting enough power. I have a suspicion that GFE is auto-enabling GPU Boost and overclocking your card past what your PSU can give it, causing that artifacting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I have GFE, but have it installed anyway because I\u0027m too lazy.
