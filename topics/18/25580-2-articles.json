Building a modern fighter aircraft for a single domestic market is not viable any more, as France has proven by going with the domestic Rafale instead of participation in EuroFighter. A single country like Canada (or France) can\u0027t maintain the critical number of fighter jets for which it becomes economical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the planes are built, you still need to maintain assembly lines and tooling for spare parts, which means that you have to keep ordering parts from the contractor companies even if you don\u0027t need them. This is viable when there are thousands of aircraft of that model, but when there are only 200 or so, it ends up way too expensive. France recently had to order 100 more Rafales, not because they needed them or could even afford them, but because the Rafale has been a failure on the export market and if they didn\u0027t, the contractors might close down, which would cause supply problems on some vital spare parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one advantage of the Rafale is that it is truly multi-role.

Therefore instead of maintaining several aircraft types, you only have one type and it costs less. The US has the F-22, the F-18, the A-10, and still lots of F-15, F-16 and a few others. Although it\u0027s nice to have specialized aircraft, it costs a lot to maintain a supply chain for all those different aircraft types.

These are non-CATOBAR carriers, so they are stuck with STOL/VTOL unless they are converted to helicopter carriers.

Whether it comes from the fact that the plane can get around the battlefield much easier using stealth, or the inherent difficulty of flying the plane.
