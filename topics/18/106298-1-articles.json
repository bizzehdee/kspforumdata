In *theory* then higher speed would improve. At a certain point you can\u0027t really make any more improvements though, which is I think Aramchek\u0027s point. I just built a computer in the last few weeks with an AMD FX-6300 and it runs the game perfectly at 3.5GHz. Of course, I was using a Core Duo laptop before so anything would have been an improvement."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:18:11Z","Content":"As this is not about the game itself, it has been moved to the off-topic lounge."},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:19:29Z","Content":"Unity 5 (which KSP will be upgraded to in the next update) makes use of hyperthreading.\n\nPlease be aware you\u0027ll need to change the motherboard for either the 4th or 5th gen.
