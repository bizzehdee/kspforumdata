Actually, worse, since the only plausible way anyone is alive is that said vehicle is entangled in the shipwreck.

If so, what is the transit time of those assets to the \u003Cem\u003ETitanic\u003C/em\u003E wreck site? If \u0026gt;96 hours, then even if dispatched the second they closed the hatch, the occupants are dead. Dispatched after 9-10 hours it took to notify the Coast Guard? Transit time needs to be \u0026lt;83 hours (transit time, plus 2.5 hours to descend to wreck depth assuming it\u0027s the same as \u003Cem\u003ETitan\u003C/em\u003E). All this assumes they have zero search to do, BTW\u2014a fair guess since the only possible way they\u0027re alive is tangled on the wreck, and that site is known.

Even having the ROV is pointless without a way to pull the sub up (unless it\u0027s powerful enough to push the target, or bend metal it might have been caught on). The USN sent a special crane (as of Wed it was reported they had sent it), but it needed another day to be welded to the deck of a ship (assuming it arrived yesterday). Then of course it\u0027s 400 miles to the wreck... call it 20 knots?
