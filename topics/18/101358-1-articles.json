Its surprisingly entertaining and very powerful, especially for someone that regularly reads books on the subject.\n\nThey go from the famous Kennedy \u0022We choose to go the moon\u0022 speech, to news coverage of Sputnik, to a BBC interview with Yuri Gagarin, to the solemn report of the Apollo 1 Tragedy, all the way up to the apollo 11 landing and beyond.\n\nLink to a music video is below (I don\u0027t know how to embed these):\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wY-kAnvOY80?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou guys should seriously check it out!"},{"CreatedByName":"Diire","CreatedById":138767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:39:42Z","Content":"I freaking love this CD.
