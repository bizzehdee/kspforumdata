The research is less about useful applications for the cooling method, and more about what happens to extremely cold particles. The intensity required is a fair bit beyond what a photovoltaic cell would be able to provide for, so the method probably isn\u0027t all that practical for that specific application, especially as more efficient cooling methods are available for such fields. We use lasers because we need extreme cold, not because they are inherently efficient or such.
