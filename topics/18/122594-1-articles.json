It will have a 6-m antenna on a rotating platform to measure soil moisture. Spent quite a while talking to a NISAR engineer about their mission (working together with India) to monitor millimeter level changes across Earth using Synthetic Aperture Radar - they will be using a similar antenna to SMAP, but 2x as large. Also talked a bit with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 PI - The mission is nominally 2 years, but they have consumables to last a decade or more. However, the mission is single-string. They have plans to put up a duplicate instrument on the ISS, so in the event of failure they will continue to collect some data. The ISS orbit covers most of the populated planet, so the data loss isn\u0027t catastrophic. Their data is now being released publicly, would be interesting to have amateurs try and generate videos from it, but I think it might be difficult. AVIRIS is a fascinating mission to observe coral reef colors with high-resolution spectroscopy to monitor health - the PI was starting with plane based instruments to understand the process and limitations, but was hoping to launch a space based mission to provide long-term coverage. I was impressed with the number of plane-based missions @ JPL - these typically don\u0027t get much press, but they are still critical for timely data, and proving out new instruments.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#141823;\u0022\u003EWe hit the planetary exploration hall right before the end of open house, so we didn\u0027t get a chance to talk as much as I\u0027d have liked. We saw a nifty Enceleadus model with steaming geysers (I took a few pics but no video, trying to conserve memory space). Got to talk with some people about Dawn. Talked to an engineer in front of an RTG display for a while - he was impressed with our level of knowledge of the RTGs, and their dire situation re: Pu239. Even with the restart, the amount of material is just a trickle compared to the number of missions that could use them. Stirling engines are great, but lack the long endurance track record, and with their mechanical parts mission planners are reluctant to use them. We need another series of Deep Space missions I guess to prove their long-term viability. I jokingly suggested a Kickstarter to setup a Stirling RTG long duration experiment in a lab corner - most boring webcam ever, next to\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smp.uq.edu.au/content/pitch-drop-experiment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#141823;\u0022\u003Ehttp://smp.uq.edu.au/content/pitch-drop-experiment\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#141823;\u0022\u003E but I\u0027d still put some money on it!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#141823;\u0022\u003EReally disappointed in the t-shirts this year.
