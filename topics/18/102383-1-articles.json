I suspect it would be better to get an external mixer and mix your PC and audio output together there rather than trying to mix it in the PC (a simple analog mixer should be less than $50 or so). Though in my case, I just had the PC play through its speakers while the guitar played through the amp, pretty simple but not suitable for using headphones.\n\nSide note: If you get halfways serious about playing, I cannot recommend [Guitar Pro](http://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php) strongly enough.

Behringer makes a line called Xenyx. Google that for an example of what I\u0027m talking about. One channel in from the amp, the other channel in from the PC, mix and out to headphones. Most of the Xenyx line are also USB interfaces. Your amp is one too, if you can send audio into the PC over the USB.

If your guitar fails either of these and you\u0027re serious about playing, take it to a professional to see if there is any hope of having it set up correctly. If there is not, get a better guitar.\n\n3) playing guitar takes a lot of patience and discipline, especially at first when you have no calluses and it can be literally painful. Keep it up.\n\nI\u0027ll add: \n\n4) even 10 or 15 minutes a day, if focused, will contribute towards success \n\n5) you\u0027ll get better a lot faster if you have an instructor who is trained to teach and is fluent in the style of music you want to play. You can learn a lot of stuff on your own, including bad habits. A good instructor can help you avoid those and also tell you where to focus your time and effort during practice.\n\nGood luck and keep it up!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nActually, there are two other pieces of gear that are also essential: a tuner and a metronome.
