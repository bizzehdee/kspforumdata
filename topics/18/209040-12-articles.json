Each team spends years training to perfect what they do and it is, IMO, an art.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I don\u0027t know to what extent the average sports spectator appreciates this. Intense team rivalries likely originate in how many modern team sports were invented at Victorian schools, and later the advent of the railway allowed schools to reach and compete with each other more easily. So in that sense it originates in institutional competition. Capitalism also influences it to a great degree as team names become brands, and there is a competition to increase notoriety and prestige by winning more competitions. Of course, this was perhaps prevalent in the ancient times as well, as Greek Olympians\u0027 achievements were used as political capital by the different city-states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExhilaration from watching sports can either come from enjoyment of the art of the game or enjoyment of one team bidding to dominate over another. A person doesn\u0027t like every single form of art on the Earth and not everyone enjoys cheering on the metaphorical mounting of one entity by another. So I\u0027d say there is nothing wrong with you. Being in the minority is not a negative attribute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, humans are social animals, and therefore if they feel they aren\u0027t properly engaging with other humans, they will instinctively doubt themselves to try and get on the \u0022correct\u0022 course, because fitting in is (was) necessary for survival. So your feelings can\u0027t be helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-02T14:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206402-sunlitzelkova/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206402\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206402-sunlitzelkova/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SunlitZelkova\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thanks for the succinct and and knowledgeable response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroWolfie","CreatedById":223932,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-02T14:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/8059-pakledhostage/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00228059\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/8059-pakledhostage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@PakledHostage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I find watching sports fun, but if I have to play them (other than some nerf games, me and my bros have high power blasters), I hate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-04T17:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo im out getting food right?
