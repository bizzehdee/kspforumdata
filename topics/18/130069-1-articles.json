I\u0027ve only ever had one of these, until today that is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IVugt0Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IVugt0Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason I got that I think is because I hung back from the initial fight, long enough at least where everyone had already used their abilities besides myself.
