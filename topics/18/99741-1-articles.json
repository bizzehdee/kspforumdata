They\u0027re brake-by-wire, so there\u0027s no physical connection between the brake pedal and the brake calipers. Without the right manufacturer-specific tool plugged into the diagnostic port you cant wind or press back the brake pistons to fit the new, thicker pads - valves in the abs system block flow to \u0026amp; from the rear calipers when the vehicle is stationary or turned off. You can\u0027t bleed the brakes or change the brake fluid without it either - else the brake hydraulic controller interperets the opening of a bleed nipple with the car electronics active as \u0022the pressure from my brake pump has just dropped, ALL POWER TO THE PUMPS!\u0022.
