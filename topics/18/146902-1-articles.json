What matters is trying to make good on them. And all it really takes is that one moment where you decide to just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estart\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s it. Find out what you need to make that idea a reality, take it one step at a time, piece by tiny piece. But if you never take the time to start, to even try? That says all those ideas swimming around in your head aren\u0027t even worth\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0time and effort, and if they don\u0027t interest you enough to make the attempt, they certainly won\u0027t interest anyone else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell one realistic issue is by the time I\u0027ve gotten the (mediocre) skills to do it, I likely moved onto others making the time and invested effort worthless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222738877\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146902\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472770940\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why there are development teams. Find people out there who are willing to help you out. You may just be the idea guy, but you can also be the guy who organizes the efforts of people across the world. Or the story writer. Use the skills you do have, in conjuction with people who have other skills, and work together to create something awesome. Not everyone\u0027s a programmer, but more importantly, the programmer is not expected to do everything for a video game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue is I have no connection or otherwise an ability to find a team who would like to make the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T23:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222738883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146902\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472771075\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue is I have no connection or otherwise an ability to find a team who would like to make the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are people here on the forums that might\u00A0take you up on your offer, and if they don\u0027t, they will probably point you in another direction.
