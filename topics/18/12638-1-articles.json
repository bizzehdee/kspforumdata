I know, I know, a little late right. But better late than never. Anyway, I don\\\u0027t really know what to think about it. I think of myself as a major sci-fi fan but this was just weird. Sure the special effects and models are all great and the start is great and has some mystery over it but what the hell is up with the ending. That freaking acid trip during the last 30 minutes?? Bunch of colours and shapes for like 20 minutes and then the end scene. The rooms, Dave seeing himself. Nothing is really explained. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Dave is all alone in this place, where does he get his food from. Is he a lab rat for some super advanced alien species???

Most people who watched the movie sober were wondering what the hell they watched by the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was mosty helped by the fact the book was practically released the same time as the movie.

It wouldn\\\u0027t be for almost another decade before they made another leap on the screen with Battlestar Galactica. (And then those other movies a little later that people talk a bit about, Star Wars and Star Trek:The Motion Picture). The soundtrack was a true treat, as well. One has to wonder how many thought The Blue Danube was a fitting piece of music for a space setting before 2001 came out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe book is an excellent read.

Clarke, based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick\u0027 to reflect their preeminence in their respective fields.[34] In practice, however, the cinematic ideas required for the screenplay developed parallel to the novel, with cross-fertilization between the two. In a 1970 interview with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick explained:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of differences between the book and the movie. The novel, for example, attempts to explain things much more explicitly than the film does, which is inevitable in a verbal medium. The novel came about after we did a 130-page prose treatment of the film at the very outset. This initial treatment was subsequently changed in the screenplay, and the screenplay in turn was altered during the making of the film. But Arthur took all the existing material, plus an impression of some of the rushes, and wrote the novel. As a result, there\\\u0027s a difference between the novel and the film...I think that the divergences between the two works are interesting.[35]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the screenplay credits were shared while the novel, released shortly after the film, was attributed to Clarke alone, but Clarke wrote later that \u0027the nearest approximation to the complicated truth\u0027 is that the screenplay should be credited to \u0027Kubrick and Clarke\u0027 and the novel to \u0027Clarke and Kubrick\u0027.[36]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)#Writing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)#Writing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E.\n"}]}
