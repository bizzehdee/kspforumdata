So the reason I post here is because my friend and I got into a discussion about why Nasa or any other space agency cant provide a true LIVE 24/7 365 uninterrupted\u00A0feed. ( ISS doesn\u0027t cut it apparently )\u00A0Hes a personal buddy of mine who doesn\u0027t have the greatest appreciation of space flight to say the least. His argument is essentially if they can provide 8k images every ten minutes like this why cant they provide an actual live feed with a lesser resolution. So besides the scientific need for the present images... why is that exactly? I couldn\u0027t give him a precise answer so I figure id turn here. Also I assume some of my figures may need some correction o.O\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-14T18:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2016 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
