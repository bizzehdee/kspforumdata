Those are not very reliable storage methods.\n\nI know very well the risks of each storage method, but I am willing to accept those risks and have planned accordingly. I also don\u0027t have a lot of money to throw towards a new hard drive or external hard drive, even a 50-100 GB one, let alone a bulletproof backup system. All I have in the means of external storage are a stack of CD-R\u0027s and a few old flash drives that I\u0027ve had for well over 5 years that were bought for very little and that have served me very much. I am a man of small and limited means and I use whatever will work, two examples being using epoxy, superglue, and electric tape to repair my headphones which had broke in half and the wire of my headphones being held in a specific position with superglue because the wire broke internally and would only sound when bent in a certain position. If there are risks, I plan for them, and so far my planning has worked very well for me. Ultimately, all I have to say is this: mind your own business.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T19:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacetraindriver","CreatedById":149403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:46:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyone see this yet?
