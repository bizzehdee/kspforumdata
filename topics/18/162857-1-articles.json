Me and a friend spent the morning organizing stuff and moving stuff around, most notably in two rooms filled to the brim with paper and no fire extinguisher I could see. Then we took a break for lunch, with drinks from Sonic courtesy of some faculty members who decided to thank us for our hard work. Then after lunch, we had the task of moving a bunch of books from the 1950s to a building that had once been a Spanish classroom but was now being used for storage. We get in, nobody else is there- wait, where do we put these? The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eentire room\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eis filled with chairs, tables, books, etc. There\u0027s nowhere to put the new load of ancient copies of \u0022Frog and Toad are Friends.\u0022 Even though at this point it was pretty clear that where the books actually needed to go was the recycling, we worked our way past the jungle of table legs and plastic chairs and arrived at the back of the room where there were some shelves and cabinets. There was no space on the shelves, so we opened up one of the cabinets. There was\u00A0like half a cubic meter of space left there, so we put in our books and then left to get the next load. At this point my friend and I got seperated, so when I returned to the storage room a while later with some more decades-old\u00A0books about how \u0022Pat the fat cat sat on the mat\u0022 I was alone. I climbed into the back of the room, set down my books on a nearby table, and nudged the cabinet door open a little more. At this point, something I had failed to notice at first suddenly became extremely important. On top of the cabinets there were a bunch of cooking items for potlucks, Thanksgiving celebrations, and the like, most notably some crock-pots and roaster ovens. As I opened the cabinet, one of the roaster-oven boxes was struck by the door and fell off of the shelf. It\u0027s worth pointing out I was standing in between the door and the cabinet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter about thirty minutes of holding a leaking ice pack to my head and testing myself for concussion symptoms, I went to the doctor. That is, I went to the dentist for an appointment that had been scheduled for months. And when I came back into the storage room the next day, that roaster oven was still on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T20:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was little I thought the round things on big power lines were buoys to keep the lines afloat if the river underneath flooded.
