If you don\u0027t know what it is, it\u0027s a sci-fi Mecha anime that tells a scary side to war (in my opinion. I recommend it). After growing up a little and playing ksp, I\u0027ve been thinking. Orbital mechanics says if you accelerate, then your trajectory changes. So do the ships and gundams just have so much dv to waste to get to their targets? How do the ships even close in on each other?! I\u0027m curious! I\u0027d like to hear your reasonings, as I\u0027m sure the anime adheres to !SCIENCE!
