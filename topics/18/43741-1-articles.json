When we get past the stage that is \u0022space exploration\u0022 and finally move on to \u0022space exploitation\u0022, there will come a time when human presence is absolutely required for the finer tasks and duties that robots alone just cannot adequately perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does this mean?

Jeez, we haven\u0027t even managed to economically and reasonably maintain human presence in LEO yet!) and should be cancelled/terminated, but I am all for moving forward in projects such as next-generation propulsion technologies, next-generation life support systems, new forms of agriculture that is possible and sustainable in space, creation of new materials/techniques that can better shield against radiation and debris damage, biomedical advances to better maintain human health in space, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is a company like SpaceX buying this?

Lets hope for a miracle (i.e. more funding) and an actual reason for space flight and put a stop to this decay. Even if your not an American, you can not deny what NASA has done. NASA is the only organization to have put humans beyond LKO. Not only that, but bring them back alive. The Apollo program was mankind\u0027s crowning achievement as of now. I personally think we should have kept going, following all the projects drawn up by AAP. Instead it seems we allowed ourselves to stagnate in LKO and lose funding.

Did you not even read the article?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile platform is one of THREE they own. They no longer need three, they probably never actually needed the third one since the shuttle was supposed to fly even more often than it did during its heyday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOwning and maintaining assets is expensive, and that cost is wasteful if its something you don\u0027t need. Its GOOD they\u0027re getting rid of one of the mobile pads, and someone like SpaceX will make great use of it. They\u0027ll still have one to use with the SLS - do you really ever see a point where the SLS program would need 3 crawlers at once, even if we\u0027re in an active exploration phase? I seriously doubt it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same applies to divesting one of the LC39 pads; Its going to be primarily used by a launch partner in the commercial crew program.

They had to do extensive work to refit in for the SLS program, and that is expensive, perhaps moreso than making a new facility.

Its a local/state organization. The shuttle is dead, its not coming back, and NASA has no current plans for another winged spacecraft in the works. Dreamchaser or something like SpaceshipOne might use the runway, and that won\u0027t change because Space Florida runs it instead of NASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a GOOD thing that NASA admins are able to be flexible and change with the times, cutting costs where they can and getting something out of their assets instead of letting them sit and rust or crumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really can\u0027t fathom why people think NASA is dying, and it boggles my mind that anyone who has played KSP can seriously ask why we\u0027d need a manned program.
