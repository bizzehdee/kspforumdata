As in you get bogged down in slow slow slow progress as your empire grows. You seem to asymptotically approach winning without actually getting there, as the closer you get to winning, the longer the admin per turn takes. And like happens in a lot of 4x games, delegating some of the admin to the AI is just a sure formula for losing. To keep your civilization from doing stupid things, you have to control it manually.

I would say that they are roughly equal in terms of enjoyment. If you enjoy 4x turn based games, you would enjoy both of them, though GC2 fits the bill of Civ5 in space better than endless does if that\u0027s what floats your boat. If you don\u0027t need your 4x game to be turn based, I would recommend Sins of a Solar Empire (either the original game, or the standalone expansion \u0022SoaSE: Rebellion\u0022). In my personal opinion, GC2 does a better job of making you feel attached to your empire, like, as you see Korath Clan ships nerve gassing your capital, you feel like you\u0027ve failed your people, and like 100 turns later when you\u0027ve made a comeback and grind their fleet into dust, you feel like such a boss. On the other hand, in Endless, when something similar happens, you\u0027re sort of like \u0022well that\u0027s going to be inconvenient\u0022 (The same thing in SoaSE results in cursing. Lots and lots of cursing). So that\u0027s really the big difference in the feel of the games. The other differences are mainly technical/mechanics (though I will say that the fact that there\u0027s no clear documentation on how \u0022weapon strength\u0022 and \u0022defense strength\u0022 of military components impact performance in battle in Endless, other than \u0022Larger numbers are better\u0022 which kind of bothers me, but oh well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo overall, GC2 has better flavor, Endless is slightly closer to chess on the chess-\u0026gt;civ5 continuum (and has a slightly nicer and vaguely less cartoonish interface). Also, if this matters to you, GC2 doesn\u0027t have multiplayer, Endless\u0027s diplomacy system is (imo) stupid, and SoaSE is better overall if you\u0027re ok with real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T23:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo pretty much I like Sins of a Solar Empire (I don\u0027t mind real time), Sword of the Stars and Endless space.

Obviously things like orbits aren\u0027t in there but given the background of the game it does make sense. Other than that most of newtons laws are obeyed. So you can do things like disable the engines of a ship and it will continue to float in that direction.

One thing I will say is; if you do get ES, get the Disharmony expansion. It adds another faction, and while the combat is still \u0022cinematic\u0022 it\u0027s a lot more fleshed out. They added fighters, bombers, targeting commands and formations (what ships get targeted first by the opponent) for your ships.
