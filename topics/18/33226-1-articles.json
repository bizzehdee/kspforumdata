One of the ways they work is by installing code that changes your firewall settings and then disables it. If you cannot access your windows firewall, you know you have serious problems. I suggest you search for some help from an experienced tech. You need someone that can identify problems from a hijackthis analysis and also identify problems in the registry. I have cleaned hijackers before, but it took hours of research and restart after restart after restart...........\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T06:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://blog.anvisoft.com/hijackers/how-to-remove-basicserve-com-from-my-browser/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://blog.anvisoft.com/hijackers/how-to-remove-basicserve-com-from-my-browser/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try malwarebytses.
