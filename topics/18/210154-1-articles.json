It seemed to work well enough, without apparently slowing our computers down. But we got tired of Shaw, issues were cropping up and support was hard to get. So we switched over to Telus, which had just installed fiber-to-the-home in our \u0027hood. So far, so good\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe McAfee that Shaw provided is still updating and working fine, although we quit Shaw 8 months ago. But my son got a new laptop 6 weeks ago, and the free McAfee that came with that has expired. So I\u0027m looking for suggestions as to what the best options are for AV in 2022, free or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, Telus doesn\u0027t offer a free AV with their internet service, but they\u0027re more than happy to offer a Norton-based online security package on a subscription basis for $15/mo, that will cover the four iphones and four PCs in the house. Don\u0027t really want another subscription though, and last I heard (a long time ago) Norton was a resource hog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, are there any decent free AV\u0027s out there these days? Is Norton still a resource hog? Will expired McAfee still do the job on my son\u0027s laptop? Is my Shaw-provided McAfee sufficient, even though I\u0027m no longer with Shaw? Enquiring minds wanna know!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: My biggest annoyance with modern cablenet packages (including our previous Shaw) is that they now run the cable TV though the internet modem, with one coax providing the signal for everything. So if I want to kill the internet in the house (by unplugging the modem) as a hard shutdown on those pesky kids, I can\u0027t watch cable TV! And changing the Wifi password all the time is a pain...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chemp","CreatedById":154483,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-19T05:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried Avira?
