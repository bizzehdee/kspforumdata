He really was a special pet and I am thankful for the short five years we had with him. I have seen lots of cats in my life, but none that would enjoy human company as much as he did. He loved to be part of our loud dinner parties and was patient with children. He let my friend\u0027s two-years-old kid grab and chase him around. We would walk him daily around our back yard much like you walk a dog. We even had a leash on him to keep him from attacking other pets - which did in his younger years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:14px;padding:1px 0px;\u0022\u003E\nHis end came pretty quickly. He was hiding a monstrous liver growth from us till the very end when it ruptured and caused him immense pain. We knew that we had to say good-bye one day, as he was showing signs of old age (and maybe related to his liver problem) but we never expected it to end so quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:14px;padding:1px 0px;\u0022\u003E\nI uploaded some pictures to imgur, if you want to check them out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:14px;padding:1px 0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/TZzt5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/TZzt5\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-02T17:15:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2017 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Three_Pounds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-02T18:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLosing a pet is a lot harder than many people realize.\u00A0 I think it\u0027s because there\u0027s often a special bond between the pet and the human-- one that people without pets don\u0027t really experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been a year since we lost our \u0022little old lady dog\u0022 and I still get sniffly about it at times.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish you peace and comfort.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-02T18:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCute cat.
