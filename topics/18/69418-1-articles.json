I never really owned any indie titles before KSP, since then I have picked up Outlast, State of Decay, Next Car Game, (ok, Bugbear has the Flatout series, so maybe their not strictly indie, but definitely not a AAA house), and Don\u0027t Starve. (the one exception to this was 2D boys World of Goo, which I only got after reading amazing reviews of it by people who normally were considered \u0027hard core\u0027 gamers. That piqued my interest)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the smaller studios HAVE to take risks in order to be seen above the glut of games coming from the major publishers, 90% of which are merely sequels or rehashes of the same old games. This I think, spells nothing but good things for gamers. The indies have to put out better code, playability and originality or be drowned in the chaff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an opinion from an old guy who only dabbled in programming back in the Paleozoic era...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027splosions are the sprinkles on your ice cream sundae....Jeb \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESmaller companies are exactly that, smaller: no share holders to satisfy with timely releases (of questionable quality) every few months, smaller meetings and faster decisions, no big marketing costs for the masses as they appeal to niche gamers mostly (e.g. KSP for the brain people \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E ), no big real estate costs, less people to pay ... but as hinted above, AAA houses are no longer AAA, which is the biggest asset of indies, the big ones fail left and right most of the time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027m not a moderator, but get back on topic guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: You should read my post on the strategy I\u0027m going to use when playing this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"95tiger59","CreatedById":92346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T22:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was reading an interview with the main developers and they said custom units would be included I\u0027ll see if I can find were\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stormy1997","CreatedById":38554,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T21:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow either this is the biggest coincidence ever or there is a God and he answered my prayers...
