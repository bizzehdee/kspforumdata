I\\\u0027ve noticed that many people who play Minecraft don\\\u0027t actually know how to use this, or even how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does it work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo repair a tool, you simply take two tools of the same type and material, such as two stone picks. After placing them in the crafting grid, the result would be one Stone Pick with slightly more uses left in it. The algorithm for determining the amount of uses in the repaired tool goes as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Efloor( Item A uses \u002B Item B uses \u002B (Max uses / 10) )\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game takes the amount of uses left in one tool, adds them to the amount of uses left in the other, and then adds 10% of the total amount of uses a tool of that type and material would get. Floor means it rounds that number down to the nearest integer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat\\\u0027s cool, but how do I benefit from this?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To put it simply, you get a small amount of free uses for repairing tools!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s try this out. When I use tools, I wear them down until the last bit of the red usage bar has disappeared. On stone tools, that means you have six uses left. I\\\u0027ve now got two picks with 6 uses left on each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Efloor( 6 \u002B 6 \u002B (Max uses /10) )\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of uses in a freshly crafted stone pick is 132.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Efloor( 6 \u002B 6 \u002B (132 /10) )\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some simple algebra, we get 25 uses - just over double the amount of uses that would have been left normally. You can keep repairing a worn-out tool until it reaches the full amount of uses that a tool of that material will give. Personally, I like to leave off repairing it to full usage, because that may eliminate a few uses. You can just start on another tool when you hit that cap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T21:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I just ask, is Repairing tools in Minecraft really that complex?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misterspork","CreatedById":9507,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T21:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I just ask, is Repairing tools in Minecraft really that complex?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm, that\\\u0027s really simple math...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 \u002B 6 \u002B (132/10)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T22:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Misterspork\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Misterspork\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm, that\\\u0027s really simple math...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 \u002B 6 \u002B (132/10)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\\\u0027m just referring to the fact that he used so much space to describe something so simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T23:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\\\u0027m just referring to the fact that he used so much space to describe something so simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to make sure there was no confusion with how to repair tools, or how the game decides the amount of uses left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T23:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only have this to say: I hate the minecraft update numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still remember beta 1.8 and then they reverted it to 1.0 again on full release... headache.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Polecat Industries","CreatedById":11224,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T00:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cardgame\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cardgame\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only have this to say: I hate the minecraft update numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still remember beta 1.8 and then they reverted it to 1.0 again on full release... headache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 1.9, the update that never officially existed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T04:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA side note: I managed to salvage about 2 and 1/4 picks from a starting set of 24.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T10:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 1.9, the update that never officially existed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s because 1.9 was 1.0 (full)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T10:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhh... since when did this exist? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I reverted to Alpha 1.0.15. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T18:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait this was built into MC?
