So you windows files, games, programs that are pretty static will reduce in read speed after a few months usually and then degrade rapidly.

Problem is not just during benchmarks but confirmed by many that real files actually reads slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been involved with many effected users in IRC and other forums so its a big problem and not just a few effected users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI my self own an 840 EVO and an 840 but also have access to another 840 500GB that is 1.5 years old that runs at an average 50MB/sec on about 1/5 of its storage space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheory\u0027s on the problem are many, bad ware leveling that places old static data in a way allowing slower access like only on channel being used from the controller. Others think the TLC is bad some how others thinks its a TLB bug with the look up table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung seems to be investigating but since there support is supplied by a 3:e party its hard to say what they are actually doing about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver at overlocker.net a user developed a program that will allow on to test any files for read speeds to make it easier to find effected files instead of manually copying files to ram disk or an fast realiable SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI my self have contacted samsung support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also contacted sweclockers.com and nordichardware.se and they are looking in to it since they found the evidence very compelling and will have drives available for testing later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont know yet what will come of that tough but I hope for an article.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some images on how an effected 840 or 840 EVO will look like in HD tune 5.5. This one is a 1.5 year old 840 500Gb running windows 7 premium installed the normal way (no cloning etc) so TRIM is on (Dont effect reads any way) and should be aligned properly since windows 7/8 is SSD aware.

Yes you should not do that to an SSD since it has no purpose on a \u0022proper\u0022 working one but since rewriting the data on the 840 and 840 EVO regains some if not all off the lost performance temporarily a defrag will re-orientate the data since the defrag program assumes its a hard drive and realy has no control over what LBA\u0027s is addressed to what cells since the SSD will change that all the time to even out any ware on the cells. Also using Secure Erase will work but for some max performance have not been restored but a new some what lower base line. But Defrag rely only works once on static data since the defrag program will think the data is ordered systematically since it dont know how an SSD works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecure erase should work every time but doing that every 2 months realy sucks. And I have spoken with users that have done it 2 months or so ago and its not a long term fix even if some users seems to think so but thats simply because the problem takes a few weeks at minimum to manifest again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I urge you all to test your drives, you can post dumps of HD tune 5.5, HD Sentinel 4 since they read existing data of the SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other programs that do this to but you must know for sure that this is the case when you test. IF it writes data to do its read test performance will not be effected since what ever is wrong is done to the data after a longer period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issue is not a small one and even people thinking this is a user error have found there 840 and 840 EVO effected once they have tested them and just like me people owning two or more have found most if not all of there 840 and 840 EVO effected by the slow read speed on old data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI my self have own other SSD\u0027s (intel 320, Crucial M4) and non of them have them has this problem. It only seems to be Samsung TLC based drives (840 and 840 EVO), MLC drives for other manufacturers and from Samsung so fare has not shown the problem so no need to worry about other units.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-17T17:48:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2014 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you very, very sure you are using a native port and not one on an external controller?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T17:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead what I wrote and posted.

TLC is more prone to errors, has lower write speeds, less durability (write cycles) and is more power hungry. Samsung has done a wonderful job of compensating for some of those, but the durability (combined with firmware) might be the issue we see here. The situation is a little more complex than just plain write cycles, as firmware has to deal with error correction and things like write amplification. We have seen in a number of other cases that getting everything right with the controller and firmware is still hard, as the technology is still relatively new and manufacturers are still figuring out how to deal with various things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really do hope it is not a hardware problem - or a hardware problem caused by firmware - as that would mean potential problems for a lot of people.

On all our systems we will never hit the advertised write limit. Also only one system can fully exploit the performance due to sata 6Gbit, the rest are stuck on 3Gbit and are basically boot drives for Linux and some basic services.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack when Gen1 and 2 SSD\u0027s where out static life span of data was some times in the specs. if I recall 10 years where not uncommon for SLC and MLC drives back then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basics of NAND is that SLC uses two voltage states to reprecent 0 an 1. MLC represents it with 4 states to encode 00, 01, 10, 11.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLC needs 8 states to encode 000 to 111. The controller basically programs the cell with a voltage it knows represents a series of bits. Problem is if you try to store 3bits with 8 states in a 3V range the margin is half compared to MLC with 4 states and a 3V range. If I recall teh 840 EVO programs it cells with 15-18V so the 8 states needs to fit in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So that means the controller need to write very accurate voltage level but also be able to read it back later and determent what bits the voltage represent on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me the later seems to be the problem. The TLC might just be degrading so fast that ECC has to kick in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall anandtech wrote that TLC used 24bit ECC and MLC 15bit ECC. Couple that with MLC being more proved and should take a lot longer to degrade where it would cause problems for the controller this might explain the slow read performance on 840 EVO afte a few months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso even if the TLC is at fault a firmware should be able to refresh cells making the Tech more viable. For light use, typical desktop or boot drive even if the TLC drive shuffled the static data around every so often it might cost 6-12 PE cycles on a 100% full drive etch year. Not a big cost I say with 1000 PE cycles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my small sample size and from what I see the 840 seems to degrade slower so I suspect the 21nm TLC NAND dont degrade as fast as the 19nm NAND in the EVO but thats just speculations. Need more drives to be sure of that. My 840 only degrades to EVO speeds after 11 months instead of 3 months so. That theory would to some part explain why we only see 840 owners reporting the fault at a limited number unlike 840 EVO owners and also why 840 owners reports it now and not before to a bigger extent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI my self is no fan of TLC BUT Samsung good reputation, Sandforce 2 bad reputation, OCZ being junk the 840 and 840 EVO seemed like good enough for many people and the reviews where good to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my primary rig I run a MLC Crucial M4 SSD. Also in my HTPC i use an Intel 320. But if it was not for this degradation of the read speed on the 840 and 840 EVO I cant see what use MLC or SLC would do in a system that makes very few writes a year and hardly requires the performance of high end SSD\u0027s. SSD for me in my router and NAS is just to keep noise down, power use and save space instead of having an old HDD hosting the OS.
