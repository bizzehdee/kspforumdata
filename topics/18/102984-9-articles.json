It was weird as hell.\n\nWhen I transitioned into the dream, I was laying down on my bed the same way I was in real life, and my right hand was numb.\n\nMy bedroom looked different, though, and I was facing a door to a bathroom, so I got up and walked in. There was a mirror on the wall, and my face looked really distorted (looked like I got lynched or something, it was really messed up especially on the right side). I then looked up, and there was a switch that for some reason I thought was a lamp, and so I tried to make it glow.\n\nIt glowed blue, stopped, blue again, then red. Giving up on making it shine (I\u0027ve been having problems with changing my dreams recently, I\u0027m lucid but whatever I say seems to have no effect, even though it did before), I walked out of the bathroom (the door now lead to a hallway instead of back into my bedroom), and then it seemed like I was imploding, as in, I was bending into myself while I flew through the walls into a sky blue void.\n\nI then woke up and tried again (forgot that there are ways to force a scenery change), ended up having some short dreams, some lucid, some not.\n\nWhen I woke up from the dream above it turned out my face was on top of my right hand, restricting blood flow and making it numb. The side of my face that was on top of the hand was the same side that was busted on the dream. Amazing how input from the real world still has effect on the dream.\n\nAnother weird thing is how it feels to think when you\u0027re lucid dreaming. I once thought about it while dreaming, and somehow came up with the explanation that it felt like \u0022there was a cloth around my mind\u0022 (picture of a brain with a white towel around it showed up). But really, it feels like a part of your brain shut down or that there\u0027s something limiting your consciousness.

I remember I had a TAR-21 and was fighting insurgents, me and my squad were going house to house breaching doors and clearing them out, until we got to a helicopter.

He pulled that giant sword out of the ground with a very calculated, robotic movement. But after he found it, he and the other robots across the galaxy started moving more naturally, and very quickly became capable of love and emotion. They even transformed physically to resemble humans, becoming biological beings rather than cybernetic ones.\n\nI feel like it\u0027s a reflection on the fact that I was able to find Earth from outside the galaxy without clicking in Space Engine that day. Moreover, it is a story about machines suddenly achieving sentience and living across the galaxy long after humans are gone. The sword is like the monolith in *2001*, although rather than apes being enlightened by it it is a robot who by chance has the idea to pull this sword from the ground - he does it because he is struck by a sense of curiosity. He had spent an extremely long time (possibly millions of years) living on that tiny, barren moon without wondering about anything. His spark of curiosity changed his kind forever - it caused him to become a person."}]}
