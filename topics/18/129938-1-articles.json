Vanishlingly unlikely, but I know I would be heartbroken if it turns out some kid stumbled on our conversation here, saw smart people talking about playing with guns like it was no big thing, got the wrong idea, and somebody ended up getting hurt because nobody took the time to stress the seriousness of this.
