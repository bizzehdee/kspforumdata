First of all, I\u0027m very glad to present myself: I\u0027m a buddy italian KSP player, 40 years old, very passionate about astronomy, astro-physics, and anything space\u00A0related. I\u0027m playing KSP since september last year, and I find it soooo cool!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I just found this video on youtube, and I thought it\u0027s a great example to share with you\u00A0of how much exciting KSP could be if played on VR and with the level of details we can see in this demo. I actually think that there\u0027s a lot of mods aroud that can come pretty close to this result, but the real problem I see to really get a realistic and immersive feeling is the framerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGVxud9N2gQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOculus Rift DK2 and Apollo 11 VR\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually the Apollo 11 VR Demo which has achieved one of the Vision Summit awards this february.
