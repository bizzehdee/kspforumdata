Mainly from the bronies themselves. But I mean after a little lesson of love and tolerance and a completely separate thread for the Bronies, things really settled down nicely and everyone got along.

And that group didn\\\u0027t disappear after the RP did. And then I brought it to other forums, as if I were somehow entitled to have a war on Bronies there. I\\\u0027m not, and that\\\u0027s what I\\\u0027ve realised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscrimination comes in many forms. It probably lasted so long because I made the Bronies look like the bad guys. Its not hard to see where that idea comes from, with all the Borg refernces and images of ponies doing unusual things with \\\u0027haters gonna hate\\\u0027 written over them, and the general idea that everyone will eventually become a brony. But the point is, once I\\\u0027d made them look like the bad guys, my moral ground gets shakey. I\\\u0027d feel like I\\\u0027m on the high ground, but what I was doing doesn\\\u0027t agree with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt eventually resulted in my producing little banners for \\\u0027AMLPR\\\u0027, that group I was talking about, which said \\\u0027Alert Condition\\\u0027 and had a little description of what that meant. AC2, for instance, was \\\u0027Thread under surveillance\\\u0027. Even if these banners were intended not to cause offense, but to diffuse situations such as the posting of various pony memes, the fact is that it is still basically me telling others what to do. I\\\u0027m not a moderator here, I don\\\u0027t have that right. And on the TwoKinds forum, I posted this banner, twice. Several pages apart, but on the same thread. There was an argument that I thought had ended between myself and another user over whether the pony memes were on topic or not. Well, that was resolved when perhaps an hour later I recieved a private message from the founder of the site that the image was considered off topic spam, and that if I posted it again, I would be banned. That was realisation point. I thought about it. The site founder was himself a Brony, and to have sent me that PM he must have looked at the image. That I had offended the founder of the site without even realising it shocked me, and I thought about how the things I\\\u0027d said that were supposed to cause offense must have felt to the people reading them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I know what I\\\u0027ve done, and I know what not to do again. I won\\\u0027t say that should be enough, because similar to what I said earlier, its not my place to tell people what to do, and it certainly isn\\\u0027t my place to tell people when to forgive me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caesar15","CreatedById":11257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-13T14:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow you kinda f*cked yourself up there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\\\u0027t you make 2 countries allows equestria and another one called no bronies allowed, and we can duke It out in the RP forum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJkkkk\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-13T14:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure what to make of what you just said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakomis","CreatedById":6549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-13T16:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Caesar15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Caesar15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow you kinda f*cked yourself up there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\\\u0027t you make 2 countries allows equestria and another one called no bronies allowed, and we can duke It out in the RP forum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJkkkk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaesar if you are going to make a post do so without making it look like complete jibberish.
