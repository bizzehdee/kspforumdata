Look at your price per Gb for a bare drive. If using a SSD, a slower, green model may suit, unless you work with large files like video, in which case faster is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know what GPUs perform best with KSP, and they\\\u0027ve always had diminishing returns with cost - I\\\u0027d look at power consumption as much as frame rates as that will test your PSU requirements too. Some GPUs just seem stupidly expensive given their purpose and optimum lifespan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about building a PC - the contents of the box will come and go, but there\\\u0027s three or four things you\\\u0027ll have a lot longer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The monitor(s) - I\\\u0027d buy the best monitor I could. There are some very good monitors out there now. Learn about IPS, MVA and TN panels and select what\\\u0027s right for you - this depends what else you use your PC for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The mouse and keyboard. Think of your hands, wrists and fingers. Pick comfortable peripherals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The chair. You may be sat in it some time, so do your body a favour and get a decent one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
