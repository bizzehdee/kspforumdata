My empire is fungus materialist, focusing in economic warfare, an the ascension path that I take... Well I take megastructure-based ascension path, but for general strategy for newbie:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. In the beginning, EXPAND. Use your science ship to go to other star systems to get strategic view of the entire galaxy. If you\u0027ve researched automatic exploration, it becomes even easier. Expand your border by placing outpost and colonizing planet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. If there\u0027s a new alien contact and prompt to research it\u0027s language, don\u0027t bother. Let them be the one who did it for us, this gives you more time to expand\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Take the planet with as many times and resource nodes if possible. This will increase the space you can use to build mining camp and power plants, bolstering your economy. Sometimes colonizing a poor planet is viable if it allows you to get a strategic advantage in position\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. If you have your first contact, the alien\u0027s territory will be revealed. If possible, RUSH immediately to capture nearby star systems around it\u0027s border, colonize and/or build outpost to confine them inside your territory/edge of galaxy. This will severely limit their movement so you can expand more. If you want to really confine them, just close your border, they won\u0027t have any free movement to expand their border\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Late game, energy becomes less critical, since you will mostly spend your time building fleet, where minerals is at must. In any case, you can sustain your economy alone with power plants during late game, build many power plants and use trader enclave to trade it with minerals for cash boost since energy is dirt cheap at this point. Or if you can build one, a dyson sphere can produce over 1000 energy per months, enough to cover your expenses and focus the entire planetary infrastructure for mining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Weapon has their own advantage and disadvantage. Lasers are good against armor, but bad at damaging shield, projectiles are good against shield but bad at damaging armor, while missiles has no damage bonus against anything but has 100 percent accuracy against moving targets, but they can be shot down. Consider checking your enemy\u0027s ship status and their weapon preference before preparing fleet to face the\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. My standard fleet usually consist of battleships fitted with focused arc emitter and kinetic artillery, supported by destroyers fitted with point defenses. This has a huge resource drain, but since I\u0027ve built a dyson sphere and has a stable economy, it didn\u0027t bother me for upkeep and repairs. My fleet has a power of around 700k\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. If your standing is good with other empire (opinion 300 or higher, and you have military and technological advantage) there is usually an option (or their own request) to integrate their empire to your own (unless you\u0027re xenophobe). Doing this will integrate their species to your empire and all of their territory is transferred to yours, basically subjugating their empire without even firing a shot (I did this twice)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. Late game crisis can be very powerful. Observe any clues and prepare for them. If there\u0027s \u0022ghost signal\u0022 report, you will face The Contingency. if there\u0027s \u0022the coming storm\u0022, you will face Prethoryn Swarm. If there\u0027s \u0022ship warped in from another dimension\u0022, you will face the Unbidden. All of the has different mechanic and very powerful (I lost once against contingency but won against unbidden). 2 of those 3 crisis is triggered by something you or other empire did, Unbidden is triggered by researching jump drive, Contingency is triggered by Synth research (give them citizen rights)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope that helps \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to ask more\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T00:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168061-ars/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168061\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168061-ars/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ARS\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0yeah, my only problem\u00A0with energy mid-late game is keeping it positive with fleets.

It consist of a large fleet, an anchor and a portal. Their ship has a ton of shields but no armor and their attacks ignore armor (so don\u0027t bother equipping your ship with armor plating, they\u0027ll punch through, focus on spamming shields). Once they appear, RUSH to the portal location ASAP. Your priority target is the anchor then the portal, since portal can only be attacked after you destroy the anchor. The anchor is a beacon that calls Unbidden reinforcements every few months, so expect some heavy resistance and act fast. If you take too long, they will create another anchor in other star system and expand their territory (and reinforcement delivery rate). If your initial attack suffers more than 50 percent losses and defeat is inevitable, retreat and replenish your fleet. If you cannot repel them, then there\u0027s still hope: after a few years, the second and third faction of the unbidden will show up (with the same intention as the first) and predictably, they\u0027ll create anchor and portal too. During this time, they\u0027ll sometimes fight against each other. The key strategy for unbidden on late game is, the larger their territory, the more sparsely scattered their forces is, it also seems to delay their reinforcements. In short, once they have large enough territory, their forces is mainly on their borders while the portal and anchors deep inside their territory is unprotected or barely have any defenses. Use this opportunity to sneak a fleet to take out the portal and anchors ASAP (this will provoke main forces on the border to return to portal to defend it, but as their territory becomes large, it\u0027ll take some time before they arrived). Once all portals has been destroyed, no reinforcements will arrived anymore, leaving the rest of the unbidden is the last to deal with. The crisis ends if all unbidden fleet and their portals has been destroyed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to stop unbidden when they create their 2nd portal, when I attack it, they send all their fleet to defend it, allowing me to sneak a much larger fleet to 1st portal and destroy it before steamrolling the 2nd. Funnily enough, their portals appeared on another empire that has lower military and tech level, but constantly insulting me. Once unbidden appeared, they beg for me as a refugee, and after the crisis ends, they agreed to be integrated in my empire \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-12T01:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2018 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-14T03:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking of doing stellaris playthroughs at some point soon.

I have 3 DLC\u0027s though (Utopia, Distant stars, and Leviathans), but I\u0027d really say: get Utopia. That\u0027s kinda a given.

I think there\u0027s lots of replay value, and there\u0027s a lot of main species types. Genocidal hive minds, spiritual psionics, synthetically ascended materialists, genetically engineered xenophiles, the list goes on. Apec has a playthrough of \u0022garbage aliens\u0022 where he played with all negative traits to see how well he\u0027d do.

When you get an advanced building you have to upgrade them individually, but that doesn\u0027t take \u003Cem\u003Etoo \u003C/em\u003Elong, and you can go back to deciding how\u00A0 you want to proceed. And before wars you need to make sure your ships are retrofitted against whatever the enemy has. The 2.2 update coming out will massively improve the planetary management though, since it\u0027s a full economic and planetary update.

I have 3 DLC\u0027s though (Utopia, Distant stars, and Leviathans), but I\u0027d really say: get Utopia. That\u0027s kinda a given. Because you can build megastructures and go down the ascension paths.

I think there\u0027s lots of replay value, and there\u0027s a lot of main species types. Genocidal hive minds, spiritual psionics, synthetically ascended materialists, genetically engineered xenophiles, the list goes on. Apec has a playthrough of \u0022garbage aliens\u0022 where he played with all negative traits to see how well he\u0027d do.

And before wars you need to make sure your ships are retrofitted against whatever the enemy has. The 2.2 update coming out will massively improve the planetary management though, since it\u0027s a full economic and planetary update.
