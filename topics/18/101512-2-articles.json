Sure, deforestation is big, and it would be good to stop it. But then you get into a heap of economic and political difficulties. Oceanic pollution (like the huge volume of plastic waste floating around the Pacific) also warrants addressing. This is bad, but it is a huge thing to try to repair. Cars use some oil, and they contribute to CO2 pollution, but a bigger problem is the factories and power plants that use coal, and spew more pollution into the air. Of course, many of those have a good deal of wealth and consequently political power, which makes their dismantling difficult, especially in regions where really, it would be difficult to get support for a new, clean power plant. Meanwhile, farms in \u0027\u0027developed\u0027 states often use destructive monoculture and pesticide, which is hardly good for many things down the road (or river, as the case may be). At the same time, people can blame the Chinese, or the Indians, or throw their hands in the air and say its all pointless anyway, and there is nothing we can do about it.\n\nIt is difficult to rally behind some strategy, as a consequence. You cannot really hit all of these targets (and there are more than have I listed), in any practical way, all at once while making an impact of note. The interconnectedness of some issues are interesting. electric cars sound great, and they really could be if everyone who used a car now switched to one. But if your electric car is powered by a coal power plant, we have a problem. Other efforts at geoengineering may sound promising, and may be promising, but most practical proposals that I have seen do not really demonstrate feasibility of doing it at the required scale, and do not adequately demonstrate that they will not cause other problems; if you give me a pistol, I can cure anybody\u0027s cancer.\n\nIn defense of the idea of battling climate change, I think we can well realize that some of the changes that we are forecasting are not that great for humanity. Climate changes all the time, sure. Why can we not take the reins, just because it can run by itself? The problem is the dire forecasts (many of which are justified) which cause huge confusion and convince people that nothing can be done. In a lot of places, that is the case. We probably need to be patient, the changes we are causing are fast, but are not like Venus smashing into the Earth from a retrograde orbit (in two weeks).

In the 16th Century, there were only about 500 million humans on Earth. We are now approaching 8 billion. We couldn\u0027t feed that amount of people with 16th Century technology and resources.\n\nPersonally, I think it\u0027s probably too late to fight climate change. The feedback loops are already out of control, with warming releasing more methane than expected, glaciers melting faster than expected. Even the most pessimistic expectations have been surpassed. I don\u0027t think there is much that we can do at this point to reverse or even slow down the effect other than brace and ride it through.\n\nDoes that mean we should keep on burning stuff to make things worse ? No. If the future is going to be as bleak as it seems, then it\u0027s not going to get any easier to extract stuff to burn. We should be saving resources instead of spending them at an increasingly high rate. Even though population growth is slowly leveling, the average wealth of the global population is increasing, which increases demand for resources. 8 billion people cannot all live like Americans. If they did, the entire planet\u0027s resources would be expended in a few decades. \n\nSome people cling to the hope that technology will come up with something that will save us, but what if it doesn\u0027t? This is really a race between a logarithmic technological advancement curve against a series of exponential positive feedback curves. We are already losing that race, and as the economical situation gets worse, the investment in technology and science decreases. When you run out of resources, your economy is in the dump, your and you are at war with desperate folks who are fleeing desertification and want your stuff, that is not the best time for investing in expensive new technology.\n\nWill we be able to invent clean fusion power before we run out of oil and civilisation gets overrun by the barbarian hords who want our water.\n\nWhat we should be doing is prepare for the changes. Climatic change combined with overpopulation is cause huge demographic pressure. There will be waves of migration, because in the grand scheme of things, borders and nations are only very recent and ultimately meaningless inventions. This will cause huge demographic tension and struggles for resources and influence. I can\u0027t really think of a peaceful way for those problems to be solved. The Earth is a closed system, and the World\u0027s economy is based on growth. If you stop growth, it collapses, yet it cannot grow forever. \n\nWhat we need is to invent a new economy that replaces the reliance on perpetual growth with a reliance on sustainable resources. The problem is combining a finite pool of resources with the human drive to improve their standard of living, to innovate, to explore.\n\nIf the world\u0027s wealth is a pie, there are more and more people who want a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, there are only two solutions:\n\n***a*** - Either everyone has to eat less pie\n\n***b*** - You need to reduce the number of people who want pie\n\nNobody is going to accept ***a***, either in rich or emerging countries, because what makes us human is the drive to increase our comfort and safety, and that happens through wealth.\n\nIn my opinion, the key is ***b***, to **peacefully** solve the population issue (through education and contraception), by progressively bringing the human population down from 8 billion to say 1 billion (which is where we were in the 19th Century), we can all still strive for a larger piece of pie while reducing our reliance on growth.\n\nIf we can\u0027t do that, well, nature is going to take option ***b*** in a non-peaceful way, and it\u0027s not going to be pretty.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T10:32:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 10:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T10:17:02Z","Content":"This isn\u0027t going to be the end for humanity, the environment can only harm us so much.\n\nIf worst comes to worst, eventually we\u0027ll update our technology and that will help.\n\nOnce hybrids and electric cars become mainstream across the world, that\u0027ll help a little."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T10:25:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This isn\u0027t going to be the end for humanity, the environment can only harm us so much.\n\u003E If worst comes to worst, eventually we\u0027ll update our technology and that will help.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once hybrids and electric cars become mainstream across the world, that\u0027ll help a little.\n\n\u0022A little\u0022 won\u0027t make a dent in the positive feedback loops. \n\nImprovements in efficiency and productivity due to technology follow the laws of diminishing returns.

I can\u0027t imagine such an adjustment wouldn\u0027t inflict a huge blow to the economy, the demographics, our nation-states, and civilization as we know it. And a lot of people will be hurt.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T10:31:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 10:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T10:53:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022A little\u0022 won\u0027t make a dent in the positive feedback loops.\n\nWe are far past the point of no-return, nothing the average human can do, it\u0027s a matter of hoping that it all works out for us in the end.\n\nAnd you know what?

They are logarithmic curves (the curve flattens as they increase at a slower rate). On the other hand, climate change and resource expenditure are getting worse exponentially (the curve goes up sharper, as they increase at a higher rate). It\u0027s a dangerous to bet that technology wins the race.\n\nThere\u0027s one thing you missed in that:\n\nTechnology is handled by people, people who want to survive.\n\nMy friend once said that after 2015 (After a meeting said Ebola was going to be past the point of handling, I heard it somewhere) Ebola would be everywhere, internet and electricity would be gone, it would be anarchy in the street and a lot of people would resort to cannibalism or other uncivilized behaviors in the face of sudden anarchy.\n\nLook how far we\u0027ve come.\n\nNo more cannibals in the street than normal.\n\nNo more anarchy in the street than expected.\n\nYou\u0027d be surprised what people can do in an urgent situation.

Making love becomes a casual pastime and gender/orientation is no longer a big problem as before due to this. They reproduce technologically instead, and using AIs to control those methods.\n\nFor some reasons that sounds like a possible future now.\n\n\u003E You\u0027d be surprised what people can do in an urgent situation.
