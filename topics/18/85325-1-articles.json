Model trains are not good toys, but toy trains are. Model trains are slow, flat, and boring. The fun in model trains is the putting the model railway together (or if you like a challenge, shunting trucks). The fun in toy trains is the crashes, thrills, and spills. You can have plots of elevations, high speed chases, and your trains can be characters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKids don\u0027t care about lights and sounds and automation.

It was about 2-3 feet tall and could support a full sized train (3-6 sections, not counting the engine). I would also estimate about that it was about 2-3 feet long. It took me a long time to build, but it was awesome for the maybe 40 minutes it lasted. The bridge building parts in normal toy train tracks are absolutely infuriating to use (especially if you want to build something taller than a few inches), so why not create a modular bridge-building system?
