When they realized that they wouldn\u0027t be able to land a cosmonaut before the US did so, the politicians changed their minds to what the actual scientists and engineers had been saying all along, that is, that a manned landing was a foolish and pointless risk of human life.

Whereas the scientists and engineers tried to convince the military that unmanned spy satellites were more logical, the leaders wanted spy-space stations, and the Salyut series was complemented by the military Almaz variants. Eventually, the military realized that such space stations were outshined by the US-A (Upravlyaemy Sputnik-Aktivnyj) series of nuclear reconnaissance satellites, made for observing western ocean activity with radar, that were complimented by the two larger TOPAZ-equipped Kosmos 1818 and 1867, which allowed a longer service life at a higher altitude.

Of four launches, the first (early 1969) suffered engine failure just after liftoff and fell back onto the pad, the second (late 1969) tumbled and broke up about 30 seconds after launch, the third (early 1972) suffered another fallback crash, and the fourth (late 1972) was proceeding normally but had first stage burnout earlier than expected due to higher-than-anticipated fuel consumption--a problem it could have compensated for with the upper stages, at least for this initial Earth orbital test, but an overzealous range safety officer sent the destruct command anyway. N1 had great potential, though limitations in Soviet metallurgical technology meant that it was a plumber\u0027s nightmare (30 engines in the first stage alone!), but the heavy secrecy surrounding the Soviet program meant that they couldn\u0027t conduct \u0022all-up\u0022 static test firings (hard to hide the test stands, much less keep people from noticing such a large booster being test fired) of the stages, instead relying on test firings of individual engines. The US suffered a similar number of failures in the Saturn V program; it\u0027s just that they happened on static test stands rather than in flight, meaning A) they could make an emergency shutdown immediately upon detecting a problem and thus save the stage from blowing up, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E even if it DID blow up, it wasn\u0027t in flight. (Note that every single Saturn V stage was fired for a duration equal to that of its full operating cycle on a test stand before being cleared for flight, AFTER final assembly, to prove it was assembled correctly--this was a major factor in the booster having that unprecedented 100% mission-success rate.) \u0022All-up\u0022 static firings of the N1\u0027s first stage would have revealed any design flaws on the ground, and would have revealed individual stages\u0027 workmanship flaws before launch, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEqually, the Soviet program was handicapped--ironically--by the fact that the Soviets had three competing private space programs, whereas the US had a single centralized government program. Normally, I\u0027m all for competition and the private sector (competition improves the breed, and the private sector is invariably more efficient than the government), but when you\u0027re trying to meet a specific goal in a short timeframe on limited resources, central coordination is critical. It keeps the funding flowing to where it\u0027s needed, when it\u0027s needed, and it avoids parallel development (as much as possible) that wastes effort and funds, by assigning each contractor to a specific role and having them work pretty much exclusively on that role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Soviets, on the other hand, had three separate design bureaus all competing for space funding. One of them quickly decided to concentrate solely on military projects and thus was largely a non-issue in terms of competing for civilian projects, but the other two--including Sergei Korolev\u0027s bureau that ended up being behind just about all Soviet manned missions that actually flew--were going at it hammer and tongs for the dominant position, resulting in much wasteful parallel development, funding being split between the two that could have been better spent by concentrating it on one of them, and a general lack of overall direction to their program, resulting in progress in fits and starts towards no overall objective, instead concentrating on a series of spectacular \u0022firsts\u0022 that looked good to the political masters who controlled the funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESergei Korolev\u0027s death in 1965 did nothing to improve matters, as his successor as the head of his bureau was nowhere near as politically adept as Korolev, making him less able to keep his bureau the one that got the lion\u0027s share of the funding, exacerbating the problem of the parallel research and split funding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
