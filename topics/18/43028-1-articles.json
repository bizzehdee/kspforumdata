I don\u0027t want to use Windowed mode to record; I need DirectX screen recording software. The only two I can find are Bandicam and Fraps, but they are out of budget. I currently have \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A312 (About 18.50 USD) in my Paypal account. Does anybody know of software that is able to record full-screen KSP for this kind of budget?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cristof12","CreatedById":42036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T00:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFraps is a great program to record. Of course, you have to buy it, cause you can\u0027t have it for free. You can even test it. Go on Google and type something like Fraps full for free and there\u0027s NO way you can have it, cause its bad you see ? There\u0027s no one who cracks Fraps. Its so hard and bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iBotz","CreatedById":16498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T00:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get Dxtory for around 3600 yen, or 36USD, which off the top of my head is like 22ish pounds. this is probably the best screen recorder because it lets you play with a lot of the settings and is really high quality. That is its downside also because it be a little complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brians200","CreatedById":26572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T01:31:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMSI Afterburner is free and works just fine with ksp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CSbJlfJtbsE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T01:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by brians200\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
