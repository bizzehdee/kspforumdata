You don\\\u0027t NEED your exhaust jet to be greater than your final velocity if your mass fraction is greater than 2.72. Of course, mine will be even greater - around 10 or so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I did a little research and crunched a few numbers as sort of a reality check. I decided that, based on available materials and the scale of other investments I\\\u0027d need to get my rocket off the ground, something a little better than fiberglass would be ideal. So, with a new fiber in mind, I found the material properties, and calculated a baseline pressure figure by assuming 1000 feet of 80-lb fiber wound around a 2-liter bottle (realistically, I\\\u0027d probably use a shorter length of heavier fiber, still achieving similar figures). Based on these figures I determined I could wind a 2000-PSI body weighing about \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E100g\u003C/span\u003E 50g/liter, for about $60/liter. By comparison to the current world altitude record holder, the carbon-wrapped X-10, this is VERY favorable (then again, it includes ONLY body weight and ignores the weight of the camera, altimeter, and recovery system the X-10 carried).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EYet still, pushing these numbers further, it appears reaching the sound barrier is going to be more challenging than I initially thought\u003C/span\u003E. I took this pressure value and cut it in half to roughly account for pressure loss during expansion (realistically the average would probably be less than that, but this is only a reality-check), and then used the Bernoulli equation to estimate a conservative average water jet velocity. This came out to about 117.4 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then plugged it into Tsiolkovsky\\\u0027s trusty rocket equation to determine what kind of mass fraction I\\\u0027d need to get a minimum amount of delta-V (Realistically, I think I\\\u0027ll need AT LEAST 400 m/s to account for drag, but that remains to-be-determined). Using 500 m/s I got an impossible 70:1 mass fraction, so I of course jumped to the absolute (unrealistic) minimum - 343 m/s, or exactly mach 1. Here I found that 18.5:1 would be necessary. Given that water rockets are typically filled less than half full for optimal balance between compressed air and mass fraction, this is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Emuch higher than the ~8:1 ratio the current concept would realistically achieve. With said ratio and the previous water jet figure, my rocket would theoretically achieve 244 m/s of delta-V - impressive, but not nearly fast enough.\u003C/span\u003E Re-figuring the exhaust velocity for the full 2000 PSI and the (again, unrealistic) low-ball delta-V figure of 343 m/s, I finally achieved an ~8:1 ratio, but unless I use liquid methane to pressurize my rocket, I\\\u0027m not going to be able to maintain that kind of constant pressure throughout my boost phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, I ran some numbers for drag and determined that, using a C\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E of ~2 at mach 1 (note to self - reference this value against spitzer bullet ballistic coefficients as a reality check) and a sea-level air density, I determined approximately 250 lbs of thrust would be required to penetrate the sound barrier (ideally, you\\\u0027d want at least double that to minimize losses) with a 4-inch-wide rocket (i.e. 2-liter bottles). At 1000 PSI, this shouldn\\\u0027t be terribly difficult to achieve with larger nozzles, though using a taller, thinner rocket would still be prudent (a rocket with half the diameter, for instance, would suffer only about 1/4 the drag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m in no way about to write off the idea as impossible at this point; I don\\\u0027t really have any stronger materials to turn to, but there\\\u0027s still lots of optimization to be done - finding the ideal compromise between empty weight (mass fraction) and pressure (specific impulse), performing a more realistic estimate of gas expansion... and of course, considering the option of using multiple stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit2*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a simple error in my initial container-weight calculations (I forgot to divide the weight of my two-liter wound bottle by two to find grams-per-liter), which puts my mass fraction at a much more promising ~16:1. I\\\u0027m still not QUITE there, but it\\\u0027s darned close, and I\\\u0027m now very confident that a bit of optimization will tip the scales.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
