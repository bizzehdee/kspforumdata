However, even the free version allows unlimited video length, it\\\u0027s simple to use, and the program itself seems reliable.\n\nOf Taksi and CamStudio, Taksi is better, because it AppHooks onto KSP at the touch of a button, has simple Hotkeys, and is simple to use. It leaves no watermarks, and the video is high quality. It has unlimited video length on trial.\n\nHowever, I currently use ZDSoft, because both Camstudio and Taksi are [on my computer] currently only producing videos that my copy of Live Movie Maker says are corrupted. Hence why I have said ZDSoft is more reliable. However, Taksi *did* work then stopped, so I can\\\u0027t be certain about ZDSoft.\n\nGo for Taksi for now."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T23:01:36Z","Content":"MSI Afterburner : Doesn\\\u0027t have built in audio recording, but apart from that it uses very little system resources, is easy to use and gives really good quality (well for me it does) when on the max settings.\n\nI also agree that fraps sucks."},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T14:35:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E MSI Afterburner : Doesn\\\u0027t have built in audio recording, but apart from that it uses very little system resources, is easy to use and gives really good quality (well for me it does) when on the max settings.\n\u003E \n\u003E I also agree that fraps sucks.\n\nThanks.
