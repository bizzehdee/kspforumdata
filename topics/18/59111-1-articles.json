(freezing point of brine = 0, human body temperature = 22). Fahrenheit multiplied them by a factor of four to increase the number of graduations and calibrated the focus temperatures (frozen brine, human body temperature) at 0 and 96, respectively. He also observed that the freezing point of pure water was 32, and the boiling point was at 212. (This will be important later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelsius based his scale entirely on pure water (instead of brine). Freezing point was 100, boiling point was 0. (I don\u0027t know why.) He had some scientific reasoning (p = RT) behind the scale, which is why it works so well with physics (and is the current SI unit). To make the scale more sane, the scale ended up reversing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the formula, that\u0027s pretty easy. It was derived later when scientists had a need to convert between the two scales. You\u0027ll notice the difference between freezing and boiling points of water for the Fahrenheit scale is 180. Divide that graduation by 100 for Celsius, and you get 1.8. Or, 9/5. So, to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you multiply your Celsius number by 9/5 and add 32. You do the opposite for Fahrenheit (subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T15:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eive had both worlds.
