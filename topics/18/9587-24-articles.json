However, as the Community grows, we have to realise that some things just can\u0027t be continued, such as Fan Threads. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as posters remaining in one board when there is an entire Forum to explore, not to mention the sheer Moderation resources that megathreads like this consume. We want you to know that the closure of this thread is nothing against the MLP Community, or the posters of this thread; it is simply a decision that must be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest Regards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
