I\u0027ll go back to it, it will still probably be [a bit] fun. But their approach to pricing and just the general way the game is/is going just...kinda peeves me. Haha, KSP was a way better use of $30. Horizons, with currency, currently would cost me maybe twice as much as the base game, and who knows if buying it now is best? They\u0027ll probably do something in another few months where it\u0027s a lot cheaper, or another kind of deal. Seems how they do it, when you buy is hit and miss to how much you may end up feeling ripped. It\u0027s seems very geared toward multiplayer, and a game where using my imagination to fill in their blanks just seems naf. Maybe you could argue KSP requires the same, and I\u0027d say maybe so, but it seems less of a problem, and more fitting... Eeehh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things are pretty awesome.
