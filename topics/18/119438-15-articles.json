Through middle school and high school, I\u0027d always thought that I wanted to be an engineer of some sort; naturally, as a KSP player, I always leaned more towards the mechanical/aeronautical side of engineering. That was, until, during my junior year of high school in 2019, I took a higher-level engineering class (I had taken an introductory course the previous year and throroughly enjoyed it), and got completely whacked by the workload. This was hugely shocking to me, as I\u0027d always done pretty well in school up until that point, always receiving A\u0027s and B\u0027s, minus a couple of C\u0027s in algebra classes. There were a few projects that I did in that class that, it seemed, no matter how much time I spent working on them, I could never finish the whole thing before the deadline, which really wasn\u0027t helped by me only having one partner instead of the two I was supposed to have.\u00A0 Coupled with a few other things that were going on at that point in my life, the stress from that class gave me a pretty nasty case of depression. I don\u0027t know if I just got unlucky, but the experience really turned me away from the STEM direction for the next year or so, and I dropped the class in early December, the day before a scheduled exam on thermodynamics that I hadn\u0027t even started studying for, because I had been too busy trying to finish the latest project. Literally the day after I dropped that engineering class, my symptoms of depression practically vanished, and I went on to have one of the happiest times in my life until COVID hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout a year later, though, when I was applying to colleges, I decided I\u0027d give STEM another go, and secured a schlolarship at Seton Hall University for a 5-year program (3 years at Seton Hall as a physics major, and another 2 years of engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology). I\u0027ll just cut to the chase, though, pretty much the same exact thing happened, which, honestly I didn\u0027t really know what else I expected. My first semester there, I pulled something like a 2.1 GPA, and I decided to take different classes to sort of find out what I actually wanted to study. Except, there was a catch: I had no idea, and I wasted another year just taking generic business and core curriculum classes, although doing so did increase my GPA, with me getting a 2.7 and a 3.8 in my second and third semesters. Wanting to just get out of there, I then transferred to the University of New Hampshire, where I spent a single semester, more or less still running around like a chicken with its head cut off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, since then, I\u0027ve just been living at home working part-time (full time for a few months too). During that time, though, I got a YouTube channel going, and I finally figured out what I want to do... a career in aviation. More specifically, aviation maintenance, as, while I have a little bit of experience flying planes, I\u0027m not sure I can actually get a medical certificate to become a\u00A0 commercial pilot... and with how slow things are in the FAA, I may not know for over a year.
