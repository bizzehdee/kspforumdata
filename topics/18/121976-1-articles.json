It\u0027s a game where you manage a company and manufacture and sell product from raw materials to supply chain to factory to store. It\u0027ll probably take a bit of work to get it running if he\u0027s using Win7 and up. The Tropico series might also be a good game for him; It\u0027s essentially a game where you manage your own \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebanana republic\u003C/a\u003E, and no, I\u0027m not talking about the store. I\u0027d recommend Tropico 3-5 for the better graphics and interface but if they don\u0027t run then 2 and 1 probably will. The Civilization series would also be great, you\u0027ve probably heard about it, and at this point it needs no introduction. Civ V might be a bit too taxing on his computer, I\u0027d go with III or IV.
