Currently only spits out elliptical galaxies of various proportions, but I\u0027d like to add more complex shapes sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, it generates the general scaling of the galaxy\u0027s elliptical shape, the galaxy\u0027s age, and from there, star positions, temperatures, and radii. Star colors are calculated based off of a graph texture. The X axis of the texture represents temperature, and the Y axis represents radius. In general, the smaller a star is, the more saturated its color, and vice versa for large stars. The age of the galaxy then shifts the colors of the stars a bit, more blue stars for young galaxies, and more red stars for old galaxies. It also checks to make sure no stars are too close to one another (current buffer distance is 150 kilometers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it just spawns some low poly spheres to represent stars, but that\u0027s a considerably inefficient method and is only temporary, especially as it has to make a new material instance for each individual star\u0027s color. Later, a specific apparatus will be made to handle all stars and star colors at once. Also to be added are nebulae scattered throughout - more for younger galaxies, less for older galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T23:33:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T22:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust made a general purpose resizeable capsule-shaped fuel tank, can change in any dimension.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/575558/SotS/tank.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022tank.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up: calculation of its inner volume for fuel amounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: and done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: I have sinned...
