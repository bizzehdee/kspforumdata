Back when we had to wait for the new magazine to come to tell us if a game was about to be released? Remember how we couldn\\\u0027t bug the devs with constant \u0027is it done yet\u0027 comments unless we sent them a letter, and then they could just burn it without reading it and then get back to work. Now a days kids badger the devs complaining how they paid money and deserve the game now even though it isn\\\u0027t ready and wont\\\u0027 be ready for a while because of unforeseen set backs.\n\nWhen we wanted to contact our friends who were halfway across the globe we had to write letters, letters that could take few weeks to get a reply. Now if you don\\\u0027t reply to an email immediately you are seen as rude and uncaring. \n\nWe had to call someone if we wanted to talk in realtime. Now you just have to send a text message and not even bother listening to a person talk if you don\\\u0027t want to talk to them.\n\nIf we wanted to talk to a person in person, we had to go and see them. Now you can video chat on your computer, on your cell phone, anywhere you are you can talk to another person and see their face.\n\nThings were simpler back in the day for everyone, things happened on their own time, now it has to happen on your time. As much as the internet has improved life, it has ruined kids everywhere."},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T03:45:53Z","Content":"I feel stereotyped."},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T04:00:32Z","Content":"As a \u0027kid\u0027,\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCWdCKPtnYE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n![HY3DG.gif](http://i.imgur.com/HY3DG.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FourTee2","CreatedById":17900,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T04:14:08Z","Content":"People have always acted very entitled to things that they feel they own, but they have been quite touchy about showing this in public (for good reasons, mind you).
