You start it with, say, 60 km of slack bent out so that you don\u0027t have to build it in mid-air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you put something like a particle accelerator inside it to generate lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, if one had a ring with a mass of 100 tonnes per meter (about 4,000,000,000 tonnes overall) and used a particle beam inside that weighed 25 tonnes overall to 1/3rd the speed of light, one could generate enough force to lift the entire bridge via orbital left on the particle accelerator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe centripetal force is proportional to the velocity squared times the mass, whereas the momentum is proportional to the velocity times the mass. This means that you only need to put the beam in at a certain energy, and the less it weighs, the better. Thus, despite being able to hover in mid-air, much as though it were in orbit, the bridge would not be kicked back at orbital speed. This is because beams of absurdly fast particles have a very high specific impulse. (the bridge would recoil at just 0.625 m/s from accelerating the beam to that particular speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, we could have a world-spanning bridge just sitting around at jet-liner altitudes being held up by a particle accelerator and nothing else at no energy cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also be moved, accelerated, landed, etc under fairly minimal power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it could be set to any orbital altitude, or shape. An Elliptical bridge allowing one to walk from the ground to LEO would be completely possible without making it out of carbon nanotubes like people want for a space elevator. One could pretty-much make it out of concrete, wood, metal, or glass and it would work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiterally the entire 4 Gigatonne bridge could be sent from the ground to the same height as LEO for \u0022only\u0022 10-20 exajoules that would be stored inside it. (4.8 Gigatonnes of TNT or 1.27 Billion tonnes of H2\u002BO2, 100 kg of anti-matter and 100 of matter, 34 tonnes of Thorium, or 370 tonnes of Uranium.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, look what we can do when we don\u0027t have to obey the rocket equation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? have I made an error in my analysis? Is there something that makes this significantly more difficult than just simply making a massive particle accelerator inside something several times the length of the great wall of China built over oceans?
