We must remember that when it comes to... well... anything, we have to explain it like we\u0027re talking to children. In that vein, I suggest that NASA (and other space/science agencies) take a page from Squad and start valuing experiments and projects in terms of SCIENCE! points. \u0022Mr. President, with only $1 Billion, we can do 500 SCIENCE!\u0022 or, \u0022Mr. Prime Minister, this project would net us over 100 SCIENCE!\u0022 would probably work better than actually explaining the benefits. If we then create a list of research programs, all of which we want, which they can \u0027spend\u0027 those SCIENCE! points on, we\u0027d trap them going both ways! \u0022Your Majesty, you can see here that those missiles you want are gonna cost us about 150 SCIENCE!. If we do that Mars mission, you\u0027d easily be able to afford it AND Flying Cars!\u0022 Of course, we should take a page from THEM and tack on a few experiments to any category they seem interested in, like a rider on a bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T23:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhile that is a nice idea, I can see the nightmare that it would cause: we do not need to get science points people, we are safe here on Earth where it costs less to do even less and with no risks.... it is almost like our leaders fear learning things or changing the status quo :S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T23:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso generally when you are running the experiment you don\u0027t know what will happen, or at least you are unsure of the results.
