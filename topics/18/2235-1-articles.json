So far, Skylon is not much more than a dream - they have an engine which is being tested and developed and they have a lot of interesting ideas for a vehicle, but it will require vastly more money than has so far been put into the project. So far, the only cash made available has been to further the engine development, and much of that has ben donated by the European Space Agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually quite a canny approach. A working, pre-cooled, hypersonic engine that can switch from air-breathing to LOX oxidation is a saleable commodity, whether or not the Skylon spaceplane ever gets made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
