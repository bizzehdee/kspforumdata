Star Citizen will consist of two main elements: a persistent world massively multiplayer online game mixing elements of 1st person space combat and interstellar trade (known as Star Citizen) and a branching single-player and drop-in co-operative multiplayer campaign (known as Squadron 42).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth Star Citizen and Squadron 42 are set in a 30th-century Milky Way centered around the fictional UEE (United Empire of Earth), an analogue of the late Roman Empire. A central theme of the game is citizenship (or lack thereof) in the UEE, which must be earned through player actions (such as completing a period of military service).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T18:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not backed it, but I will!
