In a general query, I\u0027m looking for a point in the right direction. To get an an idea of where I\u0027m coming from; I have some good information on the ECU, but could someone detail to me any other main computing components in today\u0027s cars? What does the BCM and TCM handle, and where are they usually located? Is the HVAC system entirely self regulating or is is controlled by the ECU or another control unit?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone who\u0027s familiar in the ways computers interact with car mechanics, have some good links or their own information they have that could get me going? It would be much appreciated \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m trying to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIdentify the main computing\u00A0components\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThose components functions and their location in the car\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExplore technology of HUD\u0027s in cars; mainly the different driving aids that are being introduced, such as road lane displayment on the windshied on in foggy conditions\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome information on self driving cars\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat the future of computers in cars will look like\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance for any help guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
