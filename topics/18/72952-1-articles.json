When they retired, they decided to move to Holland, where they bought a cozy house with a couple of windmills on the property. The windmill business not being what it once was, they decided to convert them into a dog kennels as a way to keep busy. Business was very slow, given that they didn\u0027t have a network of friends in Holland. So they decided to use their network of friends in Germany to drum up business. Their first break came when the Bloodhound Breeder\u0027s Club of Munich came to Holland to attend a dog show, bringing dozens of dogs who needed kenneling with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first night the dogs were there, Hans and Marlene beat themselves out getting the dogs squared away in the converted windmills and collapsed into bed together, exhausted from their labors.
