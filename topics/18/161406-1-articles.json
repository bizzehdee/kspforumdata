Blenderartists.org is the forum.

I broke it up like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModeling: create a simple character, low poly, with good edge flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTexturing: use UV maps, and learn things like SSS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRigging: Face rig, arms have IK/FK switch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnimating: do some walk cycles and a lift animation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRendering: play with AO, lighting, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I went to make a short I had a vague idea of a story, but didn\u0027t really plan anything solidly, and this is one of the big reasons I never finished. Cat wrangling basically. I advise really investing in pre production, art, script, and boards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-01T22:18:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2017 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Waxing_Kibbous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
