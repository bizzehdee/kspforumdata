The technology damages portion really is ridiculous; why is Apple suing Samsung instead of Google? And even so, Apple would have to sue the contributors of the Android project, not Google itself, for breaching patents. But I guess they are not willing to download Git and trudge through 150 GB worth of source, so we instead get a billion-dollar lawsuit over things that Samsung \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t even make\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T02:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment, I am sticking with Apple, but I do not care about this whole \u0027war\u0027 that is going on.

Those who use smartphones just want something that is easy to use, doesn\u0027t suffer from a lot of errors, and something that does not drag. Nothing is worse than when the software updates for smartphone operating systems update to the extent that the smartphone\u0027s hardware does not respond well (even if the phone is only a year old).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m one that likes to squeeze every nickel out of my phone; the issue I have with both Apple and Android is the phone hardware is only compatible with the operating system software for about 18 months... meaning that before my two year contract is over, I must either fork out the cost of a new phone out of pocket OR simply use a phone that literally cannot operate efficiently with the new operating system software. I don\u0027t care if the new software is made by Fisher Price, as long as my phone lasts the entire two-year contract period - and still functions reasonably well, I\u0027d be happy. And as a note, while Google\u0027s Android system is by far the worst about this, iOS also has had similar issues in the past...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
