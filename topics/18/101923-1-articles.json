To programme\u0027s feature is on new Lunar photos of the dark side of the Moon taken by Russian satellites, and discussion of theories relating to the Lunar surface. To put this programme into perspective, this TV show episode was made in an era of space exploration that was still pre-Gagarin. While the sticky tape idea mentioned is a bit far-fetched, it\u0027s great to be reminded just how clever scientists and astronomers were back then, particularly as Patrick Moore got his prediction regarding the surface texture of the light areas spot on, despite the available data at the time.\n\n[The Sky at Night - 1960](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0142pvr/the-sky-at-night-the-moon)"},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T09:50:28Z","Content":"Great find. The Sky at Night has been one of my favourite programmes for many years. although the quality has dropped of late and I find Dr Maggie Aderin-Pococks breathless method of presentation a bit distracting.\n\nI like the opening remark on the clip. \u0022Well as you\u0027ve heard by now there\u0027s been *another* unsuccessful American moon shot\u0022 (my emphasis)"},{"CreatedByName":"Osprey","CreatedById":93933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T10:57:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Well as you\u0027ve heard by now there\u0027s been *another* unsuccessful American moon shot\u0022\n\nGoes to show just how far behind the US had to come from to catch up by the end of the 60s, though I\u0027d put that down to the death of Korolev rather than US engineering superiority. It\u0027s a testament to his brilliance that ROSCOS still launch cosmonauts using a rocket developed from his designs (Soyuz).\n\nPatrick Moore is dearly missed for Sky at Night.
