The guy you called \u0022God\u0022 isn\u0027t (SOOO ISN\u0027T), he\u0027s an omnipotent alien called Q. He enjoys messing with Starfleet officers. Bald guy is Captain Picard, second-best captain in the franchise. He has an artifical heart as a result of a bar fight.\u003Cp\u003ENow, In this episode, said heart malfunctions, and Q pulls him into a near-death hallucination thingy, and gives him a chance to see what would have happened if young Picard had avoided the bar fight. No artificial heart, but not drive for success either. Instead of captianing the Fleet\u0027s flagship, he\u0027s a Lieutenant in the Science department (not that Sciences are bad, they\u0027re just not command track.) This lesson learned, that sometimes you\u0027ve got to take risks, Q send Picard back to his body to find the repair of the artificial heart a success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this episode.
