I hate it the total lack of realism or logic in transformers or other cartoons of that time. The history and characters were also very complex, it was great.\n\n![Robotech-635x321.jpg](http://www.metro951.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Robotech-635x321.jpg)\n\nMovie news:\n\n[http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/04/29/james-wan-in-talks-to-direct-upcoming-robotech-movie/](http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/04/29/james-wan-in-talks-to-direct-upcoming-robotech-movie/)\n\nNot sure how much time until is finish, maybe 3 or 4 years at least. How else is feeling enthusiastic about this film?\n\n![robotech12-700x357.jpg?resize=700%2C357](http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/robotech12-700x357.jpg?resize=700%2C357)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:06:29Z","Content":"This ought to be fun...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe article said \u0022live action.\u0022\n\nThis might be strange, too."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:28:19Z","Content":"Thanks for the link, I hadn\u0027t read that article. Which expresses concern that Macross original creator/designer Shoji Kawamori isn\u0027t named. Since Robotech is derived from Macross, with its own story, he technically doesn\u0027t *need* to be involved, but it \u0022would be nice.\u0022\n\nI\u0027ll add it to a list of hopes abandoned through the years, of seeing a live action movie. The franchise (to include the Macross original) is a complex licensing mess; It could sit in development for years. I won\u0027t get excited until I hear production is starting."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T13:12:28Z","Content":"yeah, maybe is quite soon to cheer."}]}
