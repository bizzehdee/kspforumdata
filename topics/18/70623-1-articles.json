One, my laptop is not very good at running games, and two, my laptop\u0027s fan is barely functional. I have picked out all my parts except a GPU, and I\u0027m not really sure what to pick. RAM, CPUs, and hard drives are all listed in measurable amounts such as gigabytes and gigahertz, but GPUs seem to be almost arbitrary in cost, as video RAM can\u0027t be the ONLY determining factor in how good a card is. If you guys have any suggestions on any specific graphics cards or what to look for when buying one, that would be most appreciated. I\u0027m looking for a card in the price range of $300-$400.

E.G. an AMD FX 8350 with 8*4 Ghz is slower than an Intel i5 4670k with up to 4*3,8 Ghz, since the performance per stroke (not sure if thats the right word) of Intel CPUs is much higher than AMDs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor GPUs you are right, the RAM is not important at all since most cards are limited from their processing power before their RAM is full (the GTX 770 may be the only Card with not enough RAM).
