I look at what\u0027s available now and most of what I can find is actually an inverse of what it should be. Like it projects light everywhere EXCEPT where the stars are. And often it also has traced constellations and even displays the names of them. I haven\u0027t been able to find anything that produces the more realistic display that one would expect from visiting a full-scale planetarium. Anybody know of one?"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T17:59:48Z","Content":"I use a colander and a flashlight\n\n![rsvp-endurance-precision-pierced-colander-popup.jpg](http://lghttp.21049.nexcesscdn.net/809F1B/mage/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/287x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/s/rsvp-endurance-precision-pierced-colander-popup.jpg)\n\nNo sorry i know nothing about projectors"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T18:11:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use a colander and a flashlight\n\nit would work though..."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T21:52:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use a colander and a flashlight\n\u003E [http://lghttp.21049.nexcesscdn.net/809F1B/mage/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/287x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/s/rsvp-endurance-precision-pierced-colander-popup.jpg](http://lghttp.21049.nexcesscdn.net/809F1B/mage/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/287x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/s/rsvp-endurance-precision-pierced-colander-popup.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E No sorry i know nothing about projectors\n\nYes, just imagine you\u0027re near the center of the galaxy. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T22:13:48Z","Content":"I looked into this a few years ago.
