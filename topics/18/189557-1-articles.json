If you\u0027re just looking to get something done and don\u0027t really care about doing it right, Python is the better choice. It was practically designed to make it easy to slap stuff together. However, if you have any intention of actually learning something, don\u0027t start with Python. The language is syntactically dissimilar to most others in a way that makes it hard to switch to writing something else, but that\u0027s not the problem. The problem is that it\u0027s extremely abstracted - the contents of a Python program, as understood by the programmer who wrote it, bear little resemblance to what your computer actually ends up doing when running said program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC\u002B\u002B isn\u0027t much better here, unfortunately. The language is less abstracted, but it\u0027s also extremely complicated, syntactically and semantically, and if you\u0027re not taught it just right you\u0027ll come out more confused than you were before you started. If you\u0027re looking to really learn something, I would recommend with starting out by learning some C. C is the canonical non-abstracted (or low-level) language, having been described as being a thin veneer over the raw machine instructions it compiles to. Conveniently for us, however, it\u0027s human-readable (where machine code is not), and the language spec itself is quite simple. It\u0027s got a small standard library and a very small number of language constructs, all of which are easy to describe, and in most cases easy to understand. I don\u0027t recommend getting far enough to actually write big programs in C, since it\u0027s quite hard to do that and keep your program sane, but it\u0027s a good foundation to have for learning C\u002B\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s the strong opinion of a guy who writes C professionally, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T17:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback, but a few are missing the question.
