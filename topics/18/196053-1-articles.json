I can find all of those things in a 27 inch panel... but not in a 32.\u00A0 (The actual screen real-estate of going from a 24 to a 27 isn\u0027t that great, so I\u0027m not all that interested in paying the squeeze without getting the juice)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know why 32 is apparently not a \u0027target\u0027 size by the industry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(As an aside, and FWIW -
