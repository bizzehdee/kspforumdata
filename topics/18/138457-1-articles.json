Basically, whenever you didn\u0027t have anything to do, you cranked up your timewarp, and if your opponent also had nothing to do, the game would fast forward. If your opponent was busy doing something, you waited until they were done. When the game fast forwarded enough for your purposes, you stopped the timewarp again and did your stuff. It largely felt like singleplayer, with the exception that sometimes timewarp wouldn\u0027t happen instantly because someone else was still busy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T17:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that works, as everyone is in lockstep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T18:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222548597\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461949994\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n49 minutes ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to play a game called Star Wars: Rebellion, which had a timewarp feature and multiplayer. ...\u00A0 The timewarp problem was solved by simply setting the lowest common timewarp level among both players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew I had seen a system like that somewhere.\u00A0 Thanks for reminding me which game it was in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T20:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222548373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461944114\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only issue I see is if it is multiplayer... time warp has to be a thing, and everyone needs to do so in lockstep, at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately looks like CoaDE isn\u0027t currently planning to be multi, so the point is moot for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://childrenofadeadearth.wordpress.com/2016/04/29/misconceptions-about-space-warfare/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enew blog post \u003C/a\u003Eup that details a bit more of what the game is actually like to play - looks like more of the gameplay is actually in the orbital mechanics than combat!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T21:13:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by curiousepic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T21:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood, actually, provided the AI is halfway decent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T21:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no such thing as a project without vision.

Geometry originally meant measuring the Earth or surveying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the reason for that was that, thousands of years ago, the Egyptian priesthood developed the rudiments of geometry in order to figure out how to restore the boundaries of fields that were destroyed in the annual flooding of the Nile.

CoaDE\u0027s developer(s) have stated that lasers, kinetics, and missiles will all be useful to ships in different situations, and all combat focuses on large capital ships with a fairly even distribution of armaments of each type of weapon, plus drones. This certainly makes for a balanced and interesting game mechanic, but I\u0027m not convinced that it is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E model of space combat.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSituational assumptions. As mentioned before CoaDE assumes that it makes economic sense to build NTR thrusters en masse, and it also assumes that large heavily armed and armored capital ships make economic sense to build over any other type. It assumes that laser power generation and point-defense targeting software will not outclass kinetics and missiles. And so on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe developers recently outlined another assumption, which is that space battles will use nuclear-thermal rockets exclusively over MPDs. This hinges on the assumption that slow burn times will be absolutely undesirable in a space war, which goes back to the economic assumption that NTRs are mass-manufacturable in CoaDE\u0027s universe, and that they are cheaper, lower-maintenance, and safer than slow-burning engines. I\u0027m not saying that these assumptions are wrong, but I think the developers may be overlooking other viable possibilities in their zeal to say \u0022Our model is objective\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroadly speaking, any experiment requires a design, which requires subjective decisions. An experiment must be pruned down to a certain chosen range of test data, which will be analyzed via specific methods chosen by the researchers. The researchers must ask a question, which defines a certain range of possible answers that can be derived from the experiment. This is not objective either; it is specifically chosen according to what the researchers consider important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay we want to evaluate the viability of some space warship design; that is to say, can we build it? There are multiple ways to tackle that question, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIs it viable in a purely physical sense - is it \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E to build structures like these that function, and do so without instantly breaking down?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs it viable economically, given a certain scarcity of resources and manufacturing infrastructure, a certain economic context to the space war?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs it viable in an engineering sense - would this design be dangerous because it puts sensitive hardware right next to critical failure points, for instance, or would it be prone to failure for some other reason?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so on. And then you have to decide what you\u0027re going to simulate and how granular the simulation will be for each thing. Will you need complex models, or will spherical cows suffice? \u003Cstrong\u003ENone of these decisions are \u0022objective\u0022, they are motivated by what the testers \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E is important.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t to say that nobody can ever come closer to describing reality, of course. Obviously, no technology would work if nobody could model reality to any degree of reliability. But the relative \u0022objectivity\u0022 of science comes from repeated experiment and independent peer review, which is to say that \u0022objectivity\u0022 derives from the synthesis of many different subjective analyses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCar crash simulators are somewhat of a strawman here because \u003Cstrong\u003Ecar crash simulators build upon a vast library of existing knowledge\u003C/strong\u003E that is built up off of both decades of (subjective) theoretical work and review in physics and engineering, as well as previous experience with the operation and crashing of \u003Cstrong\u003Eactual working cars\u003C/strong\u003E and related machines.\u00A0We know how fast cars generally will travel when they impact each other, and what range of speeds it\u0027s possible for cars to achieve, and we know how massive they are, for instance - because we have built millions of cars and we have an infrastructure built around cars. Space battles have none of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this isn\u0027t to say that CoaDE is necessarily \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E in its vision - it just may be stepping over some interesting and viable possibilities. I\u0027d like to see actual simulations of large monolithic lasers, or kinetics platforms, and other alternative designs entirely, even if the ship/fleet design model put forth by CoaDE seems more viable from the developer\u0027s own analysis. And I\u0027d like to see space combat models that evolve from our present situation, where space access is expensive and very little infrastructure exists to support the kind of interplanetary economy you\u0027d need to build the kind of warships CoaDE proposes (which is another subjective assumption).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T03:13:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T14:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222557347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462240288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Accelerando said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSloped armor is still an assumption as you admit, and that is important, since the structure of a spacecraft\u0027s armor (or lack thereof) is certainly one of the defining features of a warship. \u003Cstrong\u003EYes, this means that they have a \u003Cem\u003Evision\u003C/em\u003E of how things should be.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust FYI the game itself does not restrict the shape of the armor.

And so on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003EOtherwise, CoaDE is making these assumptions, yes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this isn\u0027t to say that CoaDE is necessarily \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E in its vision - it just may be stepping over some interesting and viable possibilities. I\u0027d like to see actual simulations of large monolithic lasers, or kinetics platforms, and other alternative designs entirely, even if the ship/fleet design model put forth by CoaDE seems more viable from the developer\u0027s own analysis. And I\u0027d like to see space combat models that evolve from our present situation, where space access is expensive and very little infrastructure exists to support the kind of interplanetary economy you\u0027d need to build the kind of warships CoaDE proposes (which is another subjective assumption).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to\u00A0agree with the rest of your assertions. \u00A0CoaDE\u0027s \u0022vision\u0022 is a very specific domain. \u00A0But within that domain, the \u003Cem\u003Eassumptions \u003C/em\u003Eare few.
