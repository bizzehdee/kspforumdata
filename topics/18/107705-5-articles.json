The majority of inventory systems are complete and we are about to start on crafting systems and possibly re-introduce the player ship building system. Following that we will add all the necessary ship systems to supplement combat!\n\nWe also have a discord server which is now open to the public, right now there is not a whole lot going on there other than development discussion and progress updates, but feel free to stop in and say hello or just lurk in the shadows. It is where we will post builds from time to time to let people test.
