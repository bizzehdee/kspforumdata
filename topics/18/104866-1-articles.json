It doesn\u0027t mean that this member is saying other events are any less tragic or other sacrifices less deserving, but for some reason, threads like this often devolve into arguments about who had it worse and who did worse, and so on. Please, either add a sympathetic thought, if you are so inclined, or simply skip to the next thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T23:09:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:23:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E People, sometimes a forum member just wants to honor a certain sad event.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Gallipoli is a very significant event in the history of Australia and New Zealand. Probably as important in defining their nationhood as Vimy Ridge was for Canada. Gallipoli and Vimy Ridge were tragic first world war battles that came with the silver lining of helping these commonwealth countries to assert their independence.

My great grandpa and great great grandpa fought in North-East China during WW2. Soldiers from the CCP used guerrilla warfare. They both died in Hebei province.\n\nCountries like Australia, New Zealand, and Canada may not be the main heroes in war movies, but they had a very big impact on both wars and were very important on massive operations like D-Day and Gallipoli. This was at the cost of lives, of course. Lives that were lost, but live in our memories.
