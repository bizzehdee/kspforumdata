This also added to the pressures of national security with the fears of Soviet dominated space and the possibilities for economic growth expected from the investment in the space program. Space exploration was seen as vital to American domestic interests, its own national security, and its economy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, China, Japan, India, and Germany all have private companies that are interested in the economic potential of space, including Lunar production facilities, asteroid mining, and even tourist/commercial spaceflight. Make no mistake about it, and as Isaac Asimov said, mankind\u0027s future is in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I believe that these companies and like-minded individuals actually scare national leaders we have today. If spaceflight becomes feasible and colonization of the Moon or Mars even remotely possible, what would prevent migration, much like what happened with the discovery of North and South America, from happening again? How would these governments maintain control over such distant colonies (no possible way, in reality)? How would those nations account for such a loss of potential wealth? If the nations of the world had kept the pace that had been started in the 1950s and 1960s, we would already have cities on the moon, orbital platforms, and maybe even just years away from colonizing Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-25T19:16:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2016 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T14:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222690100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144504\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469436294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p1t1o\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a depressing evolution of the conquest of our normal lives by out-of-control capitalism?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really dislike statements like this for several reasons and will be happy to answer this question in a private message.
