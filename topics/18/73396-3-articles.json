Most directors feel the need to keep the pace quick so as not to lose the audience. Kubrick is more willing than to let the suspense and drama build over time. In the case of 2001, he went half an hour before the first word of dialogue. And there wasn\u0027t a word spoken in the last half hour. While this might seem an eternity for those with a short attention span, the story is building if you take the effort to notice. The pace is very efficient. No other film before Gravity even came close to realism of space travel depicted in 2001. I still have a hard time figuring out how they did some of the special effects in an age before computers were used in movies. You also have to marvel at how accurate the film was at predicting technology: the break up of the phone monopoly, video phones, a space shuttle, an international space station...heck, Kubrick could arguably have sued Apple for ripping off his ideas (if you look in the film, there\u0027s an Ipad, and SIRI is basically a knock-off of HAL minus the psychosis). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, all this was done only seven years after the first man in space, a year before man had set foot on the moon, and two decades before before a space probe was sent to Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the story is rather nebulous and hard to follow at times.

Most directors feel the need to keep the pace quick so as not to lose the audience. Kubrick is more willing than to let the suspense and drama build over time. In the case of 2001, he went half an hour before the first word of dialogue. And there wasn\u0027t a word spoken in the last half hour. While this might seem an eternity for those with a short attention span, the story is building if you take the effort to notice. The pace is very efficient. No other film before Gravity even came close to realism of space travel depicted in 2001. I still have a hard time figuring out how they did some of the special effects in an age before computers were used in movies. You also have to marvel at how accurate the film was at predicting technology: the break up of the phone monopoly, video phones, a space shuttle, an international space station...heck, Kubrick could arguably have sued Apple for ripping off his ideas (if you look in the film, there\u0027s an Ipad, and SIRI is basically a knock-off of HAL minus the psychosis). \u003Cp\u003ERemember, all this was done only seven years after the first man in space, a year before man had set foot on the moon, and two decades before before a space probe was sent to Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the story is rather nebulous and hard to follow at times. But the more effort and attention you put into following 2001, the more you will appreciate that it is a masterpiece.
