Lose one engine and the whole stage goes bad--notice that every launch attempt resulted in a loss of vehicle while the first stage was still firing--and two of them were for issues that should have shut down only one engine but resulted in the loss of all or nearly all thrust for the entire stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N1_rocket#Launch_history\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N1_rocket#Launch_history\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do think that if the Soviets had succeeded in a manned moon landing, US/USSR space competition would have continued and we would have seen a push for moon bases and a Mars mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T06:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t believe they thought these monsters would work so great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hachiman","CreatedById":4016,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T11:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a vid of it launching in Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FI06C_fuFSg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmos929","CreatedById":4052,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T00:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the first N1 launch (I think it was vehicle 3L) one of the first stage engines shut down for no good reason.

One program: The US was going to the MOON. It built an organization to accomplish this, then gave the organization several fire hoses filled with money, manpower, and political willpower to drown any fires that might interfere with success of the program. (There were other space projects at the time: spy satellites, Dynasoar, etc., but they were sideshows addressing the needs of specific customers, not the whole nation.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Soviets had no such central space organization. The USSR had separate engineering groups (US\u0027d call those \u0027corporations\u0027) pushing different rockets on their potential customers. The USSR\u0027s space customers were various military branches that needed some nukes and spy satellites, and a government that could stand a few PR victories. When there was a charismatic, connected engineering group leader who could win contracts, the Soviets pushed a space program. When he died on the operating table, the program went away because the customers - military, mostly - didn\u0027t give a shit about the moon. So the Soviets got big ICBMs and a series of space stations that started as manned spy satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the US won the space race, it shifted to exactly the same mode of behavior as the USSR\u0027s programs. Mars: too expensive. Power satellites and mega-stations: too expensive. To buy off aerospace corporations, the US paid for the shuttle and dinky ISS over a period of decades. Dynasoar was burned on the alter of the shuttle, MOL was rendered useless by Keyhole, which answered most military and intel needs for spy satellites, private companies got their cashcow communication satellites, and NASA survived on an IV dripline of modest scientific projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe N1 was a racehorse for a race that the USSR didn\u0027t care about. Had it worked, the N1 probably would\u0027ve been used to launch bigger Salyut stations rather than go to the moon. Maybe if the N1 had worked early enough - on its first test flight - the Soviets might\u0027ve continued to race for the moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they probably would\u0027ve dropped it after getting there ahead of the Americans, if they could put the moon lander and return system together. The N1 wasn\u0027t as capable as the Saturn V and the Rooskies\u0027 lunar stack was dicier than Apollo - the Americans still probably would\u0027ve won had the N1 worked on the first flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
