Over time, I begun to communicate better in english and have a better hold over my temper, and nowdays, a lot of my artwork tends to be KSP, because I wanted to give back to the community something, and taking KSP drawing requests seems to be a fun way of doing it, for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat have you learned from playing KSP?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGee, practically everything I now know about how spacecraft work! Before KSP, I was interested in space for sure, but I never really understood the \u0027how\u0027 of getting there. I knew we used rockets, and they went to orbit by going sideways, but other thank that, not much at all. Other than learning how rockets worked, I learned to always double check. Everything.

I\u0027ve had brilliant designs that just refused to work like I thought they should, and I\u0027ve had miserable stop gaps that ended up working far better than they had any right to. Taking something all the way from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to the surface of the Mun is a feeling like no other.

At least from my own experiences, the landing itself isn\u0027t the problem. Getting back out of a Lunar polar orbit can only be done at certain times during the Moon\u0027s orbit, while you can return from a Lunar equatorial orbit once every two hours or so.
