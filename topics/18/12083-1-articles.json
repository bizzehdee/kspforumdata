It looks like an immersive experience, with some interesting single-player ideas. I feel it may be fairly promising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Watching the second game now; Microsoft are seemingly relying heavily on FPS games. Tom Clancy\\\u0027s Splinter Cell Blacklist seems to be a stealth-based shooter - much unlike Halo 4. The game seems to be hinged around killing people being a large task; and not about shooty shooty. Kinect is something I\\\u0027ve never liked, so I\\\u0027m not excited to the idea of speech used as a lure. I assume there\\\u0027s an alternative for those who don\\\u0027t want or have Kinect. This game seems to have a large single-player focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EA Sports now. Fifa 13 first. I wouldn\\\u0027t have thought that they\\\u0027d take ANYTHING to a whole new experience with this game coming out every year, but I guess they can. Once again, Kinect is used; only for speech though. It seems to be mainly for speeding up gameplay, this I do like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Madden NFL next. Great, they\\\u0027re using a celebrity to make them seem bigger. Once again, Kinect is used to speed up the gameplay through speech. The game looks a bit sim-ish, but doesn\\\u0027t seem to bad. I still am worried about those without Kinect, they could demo it without Kinect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Microsoft studios now. Fable: The Journey seemingly living on Kinect. Wait, best games on Microsoft? Huh. Never would have thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gears of War Justice trailer is on now. I\\\u0027ve never been a fan of Gears of War, and won\\\u0027t be. It looks like the same FPS that Tom Clancy and Halo are; a mix between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Forza Horizon looks kind of like Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 3, it seems a bit more cartoon-y though. Forza seems to be becoming a annual series, though. This worries me a bit. I guess the XBox needs SOME games other than sport and FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bing Voice Search is expanding upon the non-gaming part of the Xbox. Yet more Kinect, although it\\\u0027s nice to see them support more people around the world. Xbox live Gold seems to be becoming something of a TV License. Yep, it\\\u0027s becoming a TV License. Welcome to the future of Xbox and Microsoft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Nope. It\\\u0027s not a TV License. It\\\u0027s also a digital CD. Xbox music..? I\\\u0027m not sure, it seems just further on Microsoft\\\u0027s plans to own all your media.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A Nike sports game? Will it be for Kinect as well? Oh... What a surprise. It does seem to be more of a personal trainer than anything. Notifying you by phone to tell when you are due to train? This may become highly obnoxious, although the game looks quite promising. The screen duplications do seem to lag behind a bit, though. I, luckily, don\\\u0027t feel this will affect the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Wow, way to over-glorify Smart phones and Tablets. Wait... The SmartGlass. So it\\\u0027s true. Microsoft are starting to do Tablets? Guess it makes sense, knowing their plans. Wait... It also backs up as a second screen? Didn\\\u0027t Nintendo do this last year? Uhh... Huh, seems legit. Good luck, you just entered direct competition with Nintendo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Oh, look. Some more games. Wait... This is another shooter. Ugh. Okay, I\\\u0027ve never been a big fan of Tomb Raider, and this game doesn\\\u0027t excite me. Just looks like a movie of a girl being lucky. No gameplay whatsoever. And DLC. Yay, DLC...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ascend; New Gods seems to be a bit more interesting. I need gameplay to decide, not a colossi running around with a Sabre. I guess that they will show some later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E LocoCycle. Not too much on that yet; is is a Crazy Motorcycle? If so, it\\\u0027s an interesting concept. I would have to mention the Tron-like style of it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Okay, I\\\u0027m bored. Please show me gameplay. These trailers are killing me. And it\\\u0027s ALL for Kinect. Seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ah, Gameplay. Oh. Yet ANOTHER shooter. Still stealth, but it\\\u0027s also got a bunch of mutants thrown in. Well, not stealth, but it\\\u0027s got an uncanny amount of Melee combat. And quicktime. We all hate quicktime. Resident Evil 6. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Oh... Great. Another Kinect game. And it\\\u0027s nearly as cheesy as Kinectimals. Heh. It doesn\\\u0027t look too bad, though. Shoot cannonballs at a wall; quite Kerbal. Wreckateer. Not too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Huh. Some South Park? Not a surprise, they announced it ages ago. I didn\\\u0027t see any gameplay. Yet. It sounds nice, though. No... Gameplay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dance Central 3 now. I guess this classifies as \\\u0027Sports\\\u0027, which we got plenty of earli- oh... They\\\u0027ve got a celeb dancing for their presentation? Ah. What a waste of time. FEEL THE TIME-FILLER! I admit, this is very bland. As if it wasn\\\u0027t bland enough. Uhh, it goes on forever. Finally, after 5 minutes of dancing he goes off the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He\\\u0027s finishing the conference now... I think. He\\\u0027s overhyping everything he just said in the last hour (and half). Oh. He\\\u0027s now going to Call of Duty: Black Ops II.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E BOII; no gameplay yet. It\\\u0027s also an FPS. That makes 6. Still a cutscene. This is stuff we saw in the trailer... Wait... GAMEPLAY!!! FINALLY! Oh. That was short segment. Please note, they\\\u0027re showing the singleplayer - not the selling point of CoD (as has been said by their devs) Multiplayer. So far, no shooting; just walking. Some suicide-jets. He just sniped a few people. I swear that it\\\u0027s aiming for him. Wow. Even the gameplay fails to amuse me. It\\\u0027s just an auto-aim sniper section with some sound effects. It seems like they\\\u0027re showing some more interesting and active gameplay. Still singleplayer, though. This is the same gameplay as all other CoD. No interesting twists. This is just yet another iteration of CoD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, this presentation seemed a bit time-stretched. They didn\\\u0027t have enough gameplay of individual games, and had a presentation cluttered with 6 FPS games and 4 Sports games. No \\\u0027wow\\\u0027 factor there, and way too much Kinect and filler for my liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Nooblet68\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTim","CreatedById":4138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T18:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that conference was terrible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs usual with Microsoft, too much crap about multimedia and xbox live shit.
