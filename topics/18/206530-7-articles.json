I\u0027ve been thinking about a lot of different ways that could have been done to do Scorch\u0027s cameo right. The Scorch cameo in S1 E14 \u0022War Mantle\u0022 was done well, as they added Scorch serving as a training instructor for TK Troopers, which I think was what Delta Squad was supposed to be doing in the cancelled Republic Commando sequel. I haven\u0027t played Republic Commando though, so don\u0027t quote me on that. Also, he was at least more competent than the other commandos on Mount Daro. Maybe as another easter egg, when the Imperial forces surround Hunter at the end of the episode, the unmarked clone commandos present can be replaced by Boss and Fixer, the other two members of Delta Squad left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHemlock\u0027s second in command clone command could have been replaced by any other clone commando with custom markings at that point. At the end of S3 E15 \u0022The Cavalry has Arrived\u0022 (the finale), we see Captain Bragg reporting to Tarkin the status of Tantiss Base. What would have been cool is instead of Captain Bragg (whose cameo made me and probably several people just go \u0022oh, it\u0027s that person again\u0022) there could be Delta Squad reporting to Tarkin the condition of the base, including Scorch. A nice touch for Expanded Universe fans without having to integrate relatively unknown characters as somewhat large members of a story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroWolfie","CreatedById":223932,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-20T06:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224390839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715988846\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228871\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TwoCalories\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/17/2024 at 4:34 PM, TwoCalories said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 14 of coping over Scorch\u0027s death\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221f480.svg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022128\u0022 width=\u0022128\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.emojiterra.com/google/noto-emoji/unicode-15.1/color/svg/1f480.svg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
