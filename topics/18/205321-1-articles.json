With most communicable respiratory diseases, you begin to be contagious when your symptoms first emerge, and you remain at the same level of contagiousness until your primary symptoms start to wane. But with COVID-19, you are extraordinarily contagious 2-3 days before you show any symptoms, and by the time you realize you are infected, you are less than half as contagious as when you started. The primary mode of transmission for COVID-19 is superspreader events by presymptomatic carriers who find out later that they are infected (or whose symptoms are mild enough that they never even realize it was more than a head cold).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal of masking is not to protect the wearer, but to protect everyone else in case the wearer is presymptomatic and doesn\u0027t know it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-21T13:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224045385\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221634786572\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211250\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Doodling Astronaut\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, The Doodling Astronaut said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a booster is debatable, but since I am of the younger generation, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be getting the booster unless it\u0027s very recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a booster prematurely won\u0027t hurt you, but it may reduce the immune response you would receive if you waited and got a booster later.

Your antibodies are like riot police; they stop intruders before they even get in. Your T cells and B cells, on the other hand, are like club bouncers; they throw out any intruders who are able to make it past the riot police. The vaccines (particularly the mRNA ones) are effective at preventing infection because they cause your antibody counts to go through the roof.
