At around 7:40, I saw the sun clearly beginning to poke out of some clouds, but it was behind trees. Since the sun wouldn\\\u0027t set until 8:30 or so, I got my Dad to drive me out to anywhere with a low horizon, first a random parking lot of some building presumably for offices, then a Wegman\\\u0027s parking lot across the street. The first one was no good because there were a few trees just in the way in the distance and the Sun had gone behind another cloud, but at the Wegman\\\u0027s parking lot, I managed to get the solar telescope on it JUST as the sun poked out from the newer cloud. I only had a few seconds before it went behind another though, I couldn\\\u0027t even see the whole sun. But I managed to see Venus. I couldn\\\u0027t get any pictures, and it wasn\\\u0027t what you would call crisp since I didn\\\u0027t have time to focus it (plus I was a bit hyper trying to just aim the thing, so I was really just too fast to effectively get it done), but I saw it.
