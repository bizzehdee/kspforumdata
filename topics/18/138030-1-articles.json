When I tried to replace the heatsink I figured that the person who assembled it forgot to peel off the plastic foil that protects the thermal pad of the heatsink from dust before mounting, so that there was a pretty good thermal insulation between CPU and heatsink...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut back on topic: Modern mobile CPUs and GPUs have a so called thermal budget they will not exceed. Instead they will reduce clock rate in such a case. On the other hand the laptop manufacturers should design the cooling system of the laptop in such a way, that it can accommodate the thermal budget of the CPU/GPU. This means, that if your laptop isn\u0027t broken by design it shouldn\u0027t be possible to damage it by overheating as long as you don\u0027t block the ventilation slots and there is no dust inside. Even in such a case your CPU/GPU should still be save, as they have thermal sensors included that should also cause them to reduce clock rate in case dangerous temperatures are being detected. Again, this doesn\u0027t help on broken by design laptops, where instead of the CPU/GPU parts the mainboard, or even the laptop case might be damaged. A friend of me had a [brand censored] laptop once, where the back cover was literally melting when playing games - so he had to get an external cooling stand to make the \u0022gaming\u0022 laptop usable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T15:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n70\u0027s nothing...
