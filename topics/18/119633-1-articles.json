Having more than 2 people feels like an accomplishment, especially if they are being active in chat. I\u0027ve had to cancel some streams due to not getting enough viewers (mainly Rocket League ones). Recently I\u0027ve been trying to attract more viewers by having my streambadge on my sig, and then posting in a bunch of threads just before I start the stream. It\u0027s a bit devious, but it seems to be working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
