I can not think of anything that I am guaranteed to like the rest of my life, so I will not get a tattoo. I have quite some friends that do though, and I am fine with that. Two of them asked me to design a tattoo for them, which I think is a great honour. Some friends have to be a bit careful where they get them - one is a teacher for instance - but I guess that is how it works in society.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom an aesthetics point of view I often feel they are just like stickers, randomly stuck to a person. If they are really designed to complement the body and add to it, rather than being a decal which seems to have no connection with the body it is on, I often like them much more. I am very much a graphics kind of guy and some designs are really excellent. A lot are pretty mundane, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T02:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey can be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every\u003C/span\u003E nice, even ****, but most of the time they\u0027re disgusting, stupid and tacky, and lots of people who want them are immature or their reasons are based on various complexes and wish to induce fear because they can\u0027t establish respect by having a fair, correct attitude and actually doing good stuff that would show others they are worth of something.
