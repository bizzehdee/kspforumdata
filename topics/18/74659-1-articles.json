I liked Far Cry 3 a lot (I never got it, I just played at a friend\u0027s house).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Battlefield series is REALLY going down the drain, though. Turning Battlefield into an annual series is a big no-no. They should just turn Battlefield: Hardline into its own series. Medal of Honor never really got a real replacement so this could be it if they renamed it into a new series (Titanfall doesn\u0027t really fit the niche).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I paid 110 dollars combined for BF premium and the base game, BF4. I was expecting that to last me two years, like BF3 did. BF3 was released in 2011 and the sequel was released in 2013, two years later. That\u0027s a lot more fair since it actually gives you time to enjoy the game you paid so much money to get access to. Now, BF4 will become *obsolete* after just a mere one year. Pretty sad, huh? If they turned Hardline into a new series I wouldn\u0027t mind since:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Battlefield 4 would still be considered the \u0022current\u0022 Battlefield game and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: since Medal of Honor needs a replacement now, anyways\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pluto100","CreatedById":26442,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T23:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really loved watching Nintendo today, that was fun.
