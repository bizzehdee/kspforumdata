He taught many winners of national and international writing competitions. No matter how good our writing was, he\u0027d tell it to us time after time.

For example, I can say that nature is an incredibly dangerous thing that has claimed countless lives and for that reason it shouldn\u0027t be trifled with. But, I can also say that nature is a beautiful and glorious thing that has inspired many writers and artists to create some of the most fabulous works in the history of man and for that reason it should be celebrated and explored. Now add \u0022humanity\u0022 or \u0022society\u0022 in place of \u0022nature\u0022 in the above statements and read them. If you are looking for the negative, you will find the negative, and if you\u0027re looking for the positive, you\u0027ll find the positive. Take, for example, the US of America, my country. I can say that the government sucks and that the economy\u0027s bad and that the culture is abhorrent and filled with sexualised music and tasteless design. But, I can also say that it\u0027s got one of the best education systems in the world and that most of the world\u0027s colleges are here, that we\u0027re one of the most prosperous nations in the world, and that our culture is filled with such giants as Leonard Bernstein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Edison, and Frank Lloyd Wright. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd pride doesn\u0027t mean the approval of everything your country does or makes. For example, I don\u0027t approve of much of the music that is recorded in my country today, and I don\u0027t approve of many things that the government does. But, I\u0027m still proud to be an American, because we\u0027ve given the world things that are so much greater than what we give today, and I want to see it change. I want to see my country in a much better state than she\u0027s in right now, I think that\u0027s the dream of everybody for their respective countries, but to wait for her to get better to start being proud of her is a disservice and a disgrace. Pride means many things to many people, but one thing that unites their definitions is a love of country. If you love your country, you want to see it get better, just like you\u0027d want a loved one to get better if they weren\u0027t feeling too well. And to me, pride means supporting the people that help make your country better. Pride means helping to make her better. And I think that if you wait until everything in your country is \u0022just so\u0022 until you start taking pride in it, then you\u0027re unfairly riding on the backs of the people that made it better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
