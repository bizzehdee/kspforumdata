Snap to edges of the frame, or to edges of other windows. I work daily with applications that have a design like this. You don\u0027t have to look further than any typical Microsoft business tool for that. Visual studio has used this type of UI design for many years, as does a variety of MS server applications (like their various server managers). So do many programmer environments from other companies, as well as coding-aimed text editors (UltraEdit, Notepad\u002B\u002B etc). I would say it\u0027s fairly common for productivity environments to allow the user to snap things like property windows or result windows to any edge of the screen or to the edge of another window, or even just snap them loose completely and place them anywhere on the screen as a loose floating window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s less common in game design though, gaming companies tend to go for a specific look or design, artists are involved and we all know how those artsy types feel about messing up their carefully crafted ideas \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I believe the viewers used for SecondLife have a flexible UI design like this, arguably not a real \u0027game\u0027 but close enough. One of the first MMORPGs I played, Anarchy Online (think Everquest but in a sci-fi setting instead of a Tolkienesque setting) allowed you to snap various windows like inventory, nano-programs (i.e. spells), chat, equipment window etc to whatever edge you wanted in whatever order you wanted, and that was some 20 years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes it is accomplished by modders, I have seen several UI mods for Cyberpunk 2077 that allow you to move UI elements to whatever position you want them - the flexibility is there in the engine, it just wasn\u0027t implemented as such by the gaming company itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s all perfectly possible, just less common in game design than in productivity applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-21T17:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the code for\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156232-error_sophius/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156232\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156232-error_sophius/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Error_Sophius\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s mod to do that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/andrew-vant/dragctrl/blob/master/src/DraggableControls.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/andrew-vant/dragctrl/blob/master/src/DraggableControls.cs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s pretty short and simple, all things considered.
