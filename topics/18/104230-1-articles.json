It might have been blown by the wind (5 bft from the waves) after touchdown and during final approach; windspeed and direction change drastically in the layer above the ground due to friction with the sirface. But i\u0027m shure they know what dynamic forces (wind, movement of the barge from the waves, still some impulse from the engines or whatever) applied in the situation.\n\nIf the barge could move steadily downwind and along the waves that\u0027ll could make things easier during and after touchdown, but probably more complicated for the final approach, but they know all that.

But then that is better than doing the suicide burn too late. Holes in the recovery barge an all...\n\nNope, look at the video. The rocket is coming down fairly fast and actually throttles up shortly before touchdown. That\u0027s likely on purpose, too - they do an early landing burn at minimum throttle which is intentionally a little bit too weak to slow the vehicle down in time, and then start the real \u0022suicide burn\u0022 only a few meters above the ground by throttling up when the margin of error is minimized. Gives them extra time too if the engine fails to start to try and ignite some of the other engines in an emergency landing abort.\n\nVertical velocity was not an issue in this landing, horizontal velocity was - potentially due to oversteering with laggy controls.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T12:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T12:20:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Where\u0027s this middle-of-nowhere-on-solid-ground that you speak of?\n\u003E Visualize in your head the flight trajectory of the rocket and the geographic location of the launch site, and then think about your question again... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nOkay, fine.
