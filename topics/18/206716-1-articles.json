I am beyond frustrated by the game right now. I play on Elmscreek and my farm has expanded to the point where I absolutely need AI helpers running some of my machinery to make my farm viable. Problem is, as of yesterday I several of my fields trigger a bad issue. I hit the key to trigger the AI to take my machine and continue on but the AI screams at me saying: Helper A stopped unexpectedly, field not found.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a problem. If my AI wont work, I cannot run my fields or my farm. I have done my share of google searching but, all the help I can find there is not helping. I have gotten out of my equipment and gotten back in. I have saved, quit and restarted. I have done everything short of nuking my save out, but, I have been running this farm since FS22 launched back in November, and its a multimillion dollar farm at this point. If you play this game on PC from steam have you seen this issue and have you been able to solve it? I cannot play this save or (assuming this goes across to ALL saves) any other if I cannot get the AI to run my machines while I tend to other must be done farm critical tasks. Anyone know anything on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand yeah, i know, this is an odd place to ask it, but, i dont have an account with giants, and frankly i dont even know where on steam to go to try to find help. I know yall are a great bunch of folks and I am hoping someone here may be able to sort this out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n192002012022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-02T01:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy son and I tried a previous version... and found it buggy.\u00A0 Can\u0027t help with your specific issue; but I certainly sympathize.\u00A0 (We had the Field Not Found issue between saves)...

BUT, I think I found my issue. If you watch the lets play\u0027s by Chainsaw100 on youtube for the Elmscreek map and you see the map flash by, try to pause it to get a look at it. I started out on the same plot of land as he did, and I own fields: 36 through 57, and in those fields 41, 44, 49 and 51 are converted into various yards. 41 fwiw is a massive dairy barn and related pits for slurry/manure and feed storage. 51 is my primary equipment yard with garages and a liquid fertilizer tank. 49 is a former silage storage yard \u0026lt;moved that to 41\u00A0 with the cows. The rest is tillable fields. the tiny one by the primary silos near the house by fields 45/46 is sheep and chicken and of course silos for grain. I am proud of my farm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANYWAY, I think I may have found my glitch. Given I am working 18 fields, some of which are HUGE, its no wonder I am losing track of what i am doing in these fields. I tried to run my cultivator for surface refinement and it said no field. Same with my roller. Turns out, I think I have done both those tasks \u0026lt;or in the case of field 37 which caused this thread, and was purchased yesterday realtime that the farmer for 37/36\u0026gt; have already been done. I grabbed by 81m wide liquid fertilizer sprayer truck and wouldnt you know it, the AI found themselves the field. SO, either I am a derp or the AI is smarter than I am in that ya know, its digital and not prone the glitches that a human brain has. SO, I think for now crisis averted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n195202012022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-02T07:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I think I can say with about 95% certainty that the AI is refusing to do work where that exact task has been done before. I am currently planting barley in 16 of my 18 fields and burning through seed like its going out of style. Anyway, I was using my JCB telehandler to bring seed \u0026lt;can boom out and up over my planters, and with 2000 liter seed bags, its a must lol\u0026gt; to my largest seeder and once I had it full of seed after the AI saying it was out, I backed my telehandler away hopped into my tractor with the seeder and backed it up to cover some spots it had missed when it rolled forward w/out seeds as it was stopping, I got the same field not found message when I tried to get the AI going again. SO, I lowered the seeder into working position, spun the tractor up into working position by diverting some of the engines power into the PTO going into my seeder and began to seed again. Once I was at the edge of where the AI had finished as it ran out of seeds I engaged the AI into action and off the tractor went seeding its mechanical heart out. So, I guess that the AI wont redo work on a spot in the same workday or month... Who knew?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n020302022022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
