At first I thought it was pretty cool but not too complex, but after a while you find that the gameplay is incredibly deep and has many, many layers. And yes, there is a focus on roads and traffic, but to be fair, traffic is actually one of the main challenges in any big real life city.\n\nCities XL was good, but lacked in finishing. There were just too many things left unpolished to play the game in a pleasant manner, some really game breaking. Big cities are barely or not at all playable due to performance issues. Cities Skylines does not seem to have problems of that magnitude and is even still improving too. I really wanted to like Cities XL, but Monte Cristo went bankrupt just a bit too early.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is the Digital Deluxe version of Cities Skyline needed to play the base game i found the standard version on G2A for a good deal?So dos it has a high self life of gameplay like the Roller coaster tycoon and Zoo tycoon games?\n\nThe standard version would be fine, though I bought the deluxe edition to support the developers.

It doesn\u0027t have to be a stealth game, but it\u0027s probably one of the most engaging approaches. This game is also a shining example of how to let a player make meaningful choices, and how to tell a story. The player impact on the game, the story telling, the morality system (sort of), and the gameplay are all brilliant. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Rather than a proper morality system with nicely labeled options like Mass Effect, you are presented with approaches you can take, and it\u0027s up to you to decide how people will react, and what reaction you even want. You\u0027ll often need to change things up during an interaction. Also, things like mission order impact the game. For example, you will be buying your weapons on the black market, and if you carry out a mission to take out a major cache of weapons and smugglers in the area, that\u0027s going to impact what is available to you for purchase. Other choices impact how the story develops and so on. This makes gathering and understanding intelligence in the game important if you want to be able to anticipate the consequences of your actions on how the game is going to play out. As stated in game, \u0022there are no good or bad choices, just results\u0022.\n\nYou might also like **DCS World**. It\u0027s a combat flight simulator, and it is a free game that comes with the Su-25t (and a mustang trainer. Other planes are paid DLC). The planes are detailed to various levels. The Su-25t is on the lighter end. You can start it up with a key keyboard commands, though if you really want to get the most out of it, your probably looking at a few hours on youtube (Robert Sogomonian has a fantastic set of videos for it, which serve as a good look at what you can expect from the game as well). You also have planes like the A-10C which have much more involved computer systems than something like the 25t. The flight as well is fantastic.\n\nAnd one final thought. You might like the Myst games. They\u0027re essentially point and click puzzle games. The first game was recently redone (for the second time) and is truly spectacular. You can also walk around the world, a feature not found in the original games until the fourth one (I think. Might have just been the last game, number five that has that). Riven is also available on steam, though it may not work. At the very least, the map viewer, one of the last puzzles, may not function correctly and require you to look up the answer. The second and third games are the best if you ask me, with Riven (#2) taking the cake and Exile (#3) being the close second. Both games a entirely point and click, with point to point movement. Exile has better graphics, and 360 degree camera movement. Do note that both these games are pre-rendered (they predate personal computers that could have rendered such graphics in real time), so there is nothing you can really do to improve them graphically."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:00:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Counter-Strike Global Offensive, if you like competitive games and first-person shooters.

If you knock out the main supports with demolition charges (or a sledgehammer) it will collapse fairly realistically. Stealing tanks and driving through buildings is great fun as well. It also has multiplayer (including a hotseat turn based destruction mode and more traditional deathmatches) which can be pretty entertaining when the entire map is leveled at the end of a match.\n\nThe main story isn\u0027t all that bad either, it\u0027s nothing special compared to the likes of mass effect, but it\u0027s not bad for what it is.\n\nIt\u0027s a little older game now (which means you can run it on pretty much anything), but it\u0027s actively being updated again after a change in IP ownership (THQ went bankrupt and Nordic games got the Red Faction franchise)."}]}
