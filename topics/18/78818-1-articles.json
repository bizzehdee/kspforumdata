Simple minor swear words like \u0022hell\u0022 or \u0022crap\u0022 or \u0022ass\u0022 are considered normal swear words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u0022LOL\u0022 is considered spam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. ROBLOX is easy to portal TO, but once you\u0027re inside, it\u0027s hard to send someone back through the portal. The reason?
