So I decided to fire up my Win8.1 box and see about this Win-Ten-Ten thing. \n\nRegistered to reserve my copy. No tricks, no force update. \n\nTen minutes later it had downloaded and was ready. \n\nTwenty minutes later it was up and running. Only issue was when my Razer Chroma keyboard tried to install its drivers to the Win10 install session... which freaked the keyboard out but didn\u0027t affect Win10. Thankfully it rebooted again before I needed to type anything. \n\nNo video driver issues, though I updated right before Win10 (I\u0027m using a GTX-770 if that helps anybody). \n\nKSP runs great. KSP RSS/RO using opengl mode runs great. It probably still crashes every two hours as KSP is wont to do, but it ran well for the fifteen sleepy minutes I tried each install. \n\nThis is probably the most responsive Windows OS I\u0027ve used since Win95\u002BPlus, and it\u0027s still got all the good bits of Win7. Not enough to bring me back from UNIXland (where it\u0027s always sunny and the command prompt smiles err\u0027day), but it feels like a nice OS. No Cortana for me though, since I opted out of all the data harvesting stuff - this is just a gaming system. \n\nOh, one last thing: Solitaire has an online multiplayer mode that (apparently) costs $9.99/year or is ad supported. No, that\u0027s not an April Fool\u0027s Day joke. Multiplayer Solitaire. O.o The offline game didn\u0027t hurl any full-screen video ads at me, so no pitchfork just yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:14:53Z","Content":"Has anyone figured out how to make the search bar use google as its default search engine?

I then re-installed Windows 10. It finally accepted my driver and did not shut down my card, however I lost my second monitor. I then tried running KSP and it crashed on loading. Then Windows crashed on a restart. Then it went right back to the same old problem of not accepting my driver which, in turn, shuts down my graphics card.
