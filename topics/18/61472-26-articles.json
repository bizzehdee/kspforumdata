Not just any deep space, but really small deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Capsule was equipped with a low-gain antenna, but the UTC was not a Undeniably Telephonic Contraption, so there was not yet any direct communications. At this time, Dr. Pistachio was not terribly worried about communications with the MEA complex, he was more worried about how to keep his lunch down after what felt like being thrown off a cliff into space. After successfully keeping his eggs and bacon inside a doggy-bag, he locked his helmet on to begin his work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDr. Tony Pistachio was the head of the Multiversal Exploration Agency for quite some time. After previous attempts to explore the new Microverse using contraptions ranging from mile-long tethers that a robotic submarine was hung out of to a clockwork-controlled soil sampler, it was time to face the fact that they were going to have to use active telecommunications or else use far more complicated control. No one yet knew if telecommunications was possible through the Microverse, so the control issue was planned to be resolved by the use of highly-trained astronauts. The MEA could not afford astronauts. To make matters worse, the nerds that worked at the MEA were all far to scared to go to space. Someone had to be found that was willing to take the risk. Dr. Pistachio himself had to be that man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was regretting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe figured he had about six minutes to deploy the communications beacon and configure it before the deadly plunge into the \u0022Starlike Gravitational Core\u0022 killed him in a murderously deadly way of death and not-life. Not exactly the best way of staying focused. The Space Capsule had about 200 m/s delta-v, enough to probably-almost-certainly correct the course if he was able to control the ship. But he was not here to explore. Not today. Today, he had to get the beacon up and running. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDr. Pistachio opened the Space Capsule\u0027s hatch. The communication beacon was hanging off the end of the service module package. Standing up in the capsule, he suddenly took in the beauty of the whole place. He saw a shimmering box of warped space behind him where the Untranslatable Tractor Carrier was holding idle, slowly receding. He looked forwards, and had to avert his eyes from the bright sun. He saw a dull brown cloudy sphere, a lumpy blue and green rock, and a peanut-shaped potato. \u0022Wow.\u0022 He heard himself saying, the closed communications loop echoing his voice several times before fading off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETony climbed over the capsule and opened the service module hatch, revealing a control panel to release the beacon. His arm reached out to grab on to the beacon as he pressed the red button to let it go from the capsule. The beacon was really just a glorified radio transmitter/transceiver. If all went right, the guys at MEA Mission Control were playing a tuning signal. Tony twisted the various knobs all over until he could start to hear a warbled musical song. \u0022Haha. Magic Carpet Ride.\u0022 He tuned the radio further until he could hear the music fully. He then turned to calibrate the some other thing to compensate for the Universal Train Coach\u0027s unreliable name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm. That\u0027s odd.\u0022 Tony Pistachio thought. His feet were getting warm. He looked down. \u0022AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETony was no pilot, but he was almost certain that he was just flung past the sun on a collision course with the blue-green planet. He strapped the probe in, and tried to get back in the capsule. \u0022You\u0027re kidding me.\u0022 Dr. Pistachio\u0027s keychain was floating several meters away. He jumped at it, holding onto a loose wire as a tether. \u0022Just a few more inches!\u0022 Impact was imminent. Tony pulled a doggy bag out of his pocket. \u0022Of course!\u0022 He held the bag out barely catching the key on edge enough for it to slow down. The Blue-Green planet was looking awfully large. He pulled himself (and the key!) back to the ship unlocked the door, and coupled the piloting to manual control. No response.
