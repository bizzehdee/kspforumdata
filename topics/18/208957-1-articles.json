Well, I\u0027m back to see if anyone has tried this before. If they have, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me where to get the game! I really want an interactive laboratory game where I can perform experiments, use microscopes etc. And a game where I can build my own laboratory would be even better!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want any shoot-em-up\u0027s, puzzle games or Doctor Frankenstein wannabes. I just want straightforward \u0022Here\u0027s a laboratory, here\u0027s some scientists, go bananas!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone here know anything that could help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-13T15:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this might be what you\u2019re looking for\u2026.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://powdertoy.co.uk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://powdertoy.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixophir","CreatedById":221686,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-13T16:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there may be a misunderstanding about what \u0022science\u0022 is, and such things as engineering or exploration, which strictly spoken are different things though they work hand in hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re actually serious about this and you\u0027re feeling at a very early state of learning things, then I would suggest to search \u0022gamification\u0022, there was a time when even serious people thought a game like approach would help.
