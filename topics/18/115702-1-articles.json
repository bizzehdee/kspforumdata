Citing the \u0027near-perfect design and shape\u0027, they argue the \u0027pyramid\u0027 is evidence that an ancient civilization once lived on the red planet.\n\n![BFd4ZjP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BFd4ZjP.jpg)\n\nIt appears that the Nasa operators of Curiosity deliberately chose not to take another photo or zoom in on the pyramid. If they however did so, none of these subsequent photos were released to the general public.\u0027\n\nParanormalCrucible goes further, claiming the \u0027near perfect design and shape\u0027 means the pyramid is: \u0027the result of intelligent design and certainly not a trick of light and shadow\u0027.\n\n==============================================================\n\nI am unconvinced. I think I\u0027ll await a human inspection. Given that there are only small rocks on Mars, that thing might have been built by super intelligent ants."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:51:01Z","Content":"Illumi-justhappenstobearandomepyramidshapedrock confirmed!"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:38:40Z","Content":"This is the original photo: [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00978/mcam/0978MR0043250040502821E01_DXXX.jpg](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00978/mcam/0978MR0043250040502821E01_DXXX.jpg)\n\nHere\u0027s a second photo of a wider shot: [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00978/mcam/0978ML0043200040404228E01_DXXX.jpg](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00978/mcam/0978ML0043200040404228E01_DXXX.jpg)\n\nThe \u0022pyramid\u0022 is actually on a 30 degree slope slope and it has a pointy shape, the shadow only makes it look like a pyramid."},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:43:04Z","Content":"My god, it\u0027s just a rock.
