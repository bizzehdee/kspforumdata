But it sure is sexy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on my way home from school I decided to stop and check it out real quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pulled up alongside of it and noticed it had rust along the wheel wells (I live in WNY, winters \u002B salted roads destroy cars up here) and overall it just looked dirty. Maybe not damaged, but dirty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I said to myself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Self, this car\u0027s condition would make any owner ashamed to own it.

You know, reduce, re-use, recycle... But I\u0027d be very cautious about buying something with a lot of rust on it.

I sold it to some university students a couple of years ago for $500 (it wouldn\u0027t go into 2nd gear anymore). They took it on a 15000 km road trip and didn\u0027t have any trouble with it.
