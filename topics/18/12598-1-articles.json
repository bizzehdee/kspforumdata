If you went for the moon by reaching earth escape and hoping you meet the moon along the way, then yeah... you\\\u0027d just orbit the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you went for the moon by raising your apo to moon orbit altitude, then you\\\u0027d just end up orbiting earth in a highly elliptical orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think raising apo to moon orbit altitude is a more likely approach, since it presumably requires less delta v, and it\\\u0027s easier to make it back if something does go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T00:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was actually thinking of Apollo.
