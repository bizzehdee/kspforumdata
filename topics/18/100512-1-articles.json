I actually never went to some big LAN parties because i never had that much time. LAN parties lasted sometimes for days and i wouldn\u0027t go there with all my equip only for a few hours."},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T16:26:57Z","Content":"I do remember the golden days of LAN parties. Sometimes in a big hall with a lot of nerds with their own gaming systems and game controllers. Some vey beautiful case-mods (some less so). I used to own each and everyone in Unreal. Good old times.\n\nI am currently working in a music venue. I am looking into the possibility of hosting a LAN party there. Maybe get a local ISP to sponsor a good connection and some servers to host games on. Maybe host some tournaments of new and older games."},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:45:08Z","Content":"Ah, LAN Parties. We had a group of XBox 360 gamers at work and had a LAN Party probably once every other month. It was a pretty good deal, a dozen or so folks and all-day (sometimes 2-days), we even had a dedicated cook. Then everybody [else] had children, some of the core folks moved on to other firms, and \u0022Always Online\u0022 games like GTA Online happened. Ever have ten\u002B people try to play high-bandwidth online-only multiplayer games over the same residential internet pipe? Sucks. \n\nWe might have one of them a year now. Just not the same. \n\nIt\u0027s been (nearly) two decades since I was into the PC LAN-Party scene. (Mainly because it\u0027s been two decades since I\u0027ve owned a Windows PC that wasn\u0027t a glorified netbook.) We did have some epic LAN Parties back in college though. C\u0026C Red Alert, US Navy Fighters (97), Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, and of course Quake. Good times.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T17:47:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T02:45:56Z","Content":"My school has a Minecraft Club, and despite being quite bored of that game I do attend every Thursday session and play with my best friend.
