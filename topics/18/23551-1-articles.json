I shall update these stats fairly regularly with more complete logs for short term stats and find someone with a complete log file going back as far as the channel was created for long term stats.

There will be many of you that have been quite active in the channel that will have not been featured much on the stats pages. This is due to the fact that the person that was logging the room was not necessarily online all the time, so missed quite a lot of chat, and also at generally specific times of the day. So there will be many people and chat activity that ought to be reflected that are not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I myself have started logging the channel so for the next updates (at least short term stats \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 building up to long-term) the stats will be more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to take this opportunity to ask anyone at all that has been in the chat room for a significant amount of time to give me logs from that period. It doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t matter if you where not online for all of it, but in a nut shell an ideal log(s) would be from a user that is there all the time, and idles when not chatting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could help me out with that it would be fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big tanks to Ted for the general help, Smite for the help with setting up the nick configurations and KSP for the anim gifs and still for logo.. and last but not least everybody in #KSPOfficial for all the chat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy all \u0026amp; keep chatting \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etma\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
