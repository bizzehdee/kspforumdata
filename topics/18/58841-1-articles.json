Since they were expected to be able to fight effectively in an atmosphere, where they used aerodynamic lift, that meant that the pilots would have to learn to fight while flying them like the jet fighters we see in our universe. Now, air combat is a VERY stressful thing. You\u0027re in a tight cockpit, pulling many Gs, under information overload as you try to keep track of where you are, where the enemy is, where the ground is, and how each is moving relative to the others, plus watch for unexpected threats (like, say, a surface-to-air missile being fired at you), all while your heart is racing, you\u0027ve almost got more adrenaline than blood in your veins, and the other guy is trying VERY hard to kill you. In that sort of situation, the way you control your fighter has to be completely instinctive. You can\u0027t be thinking about *how* you perform the maneuver, you need to just think the maneuver and have your hands and feet automatically make the moves to carry it out. (You get something similar with driving a car in poor conditions... or even walking. If you try to manually command every single move that needs to be done, you\u0027ll end up failing completely, which is why it takes babies and spinal injury victims months to learn how to walk.) What\u0027s more, with the far higher relative velocities possible in space combat, that happens even *faster* and you can\u0027t take the time to think about how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of having two separate sets of controls and/or control logic, the designers set up a control logic for these early exoatmospheric fighters (they were primarily atmospheric fighters with a basic space combat capability) that would allow the use of a single set of controls, and have the vehicle fly in exactly the same way in space as it does in the atmosphere, for human factors engineering. There is a manual override that allows the pilot to make (at least) uninhibited three-axis rotational maneuvers (possibly translation, too, though that\u0027s never been clarified), but by default, it remains in \u0022aerodynamic flight emulation\u0022 mode simply to help the pilot not have to think about how he\u0027s going to maneuver. As later starfighters came along, including repulsorlift craft that didn\u0027t use aerodynamic lift at all, the deliberate decision was made to retain that same control logic to avoid having to completely retrain all existing starfighter pilots to a different set of control laws. (This is the same reason that, for example, helicopters are generally flown from the RIGHT-hand seat--the earliest helicopter pilots learned to fly from the left seat, but when they started training new pilots, they stayed in the left seat to retain the familiar viewpoint. As a result, pilots after them all learned to fly in the right-hand seat, and thus a standard was set that sticks to this day.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, the starfighters *can* maneuver like real spacecraft, but the designers set them up not to do so by default, initially to simplify the pilot\u0027s combat workload, but later, due to the same sheer inertia that results in MIL-STDs living forever. (Cue the likely-apochryphal story about the standard railroad gauge being derived from a Roman military standard for chariot axles...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T03:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat explanation doesn\u0027t hold together.
