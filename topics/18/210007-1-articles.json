Any non-linearity can easily be linearised in firmware. The problem is the rest of the hardware and how it is effected by wear and tear. A good Hall joystick can become a turd after six months if the hardware is weak, and a good Pot joystick can remain good for years if the hardware is strong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo substitute for a proper review when choosing peripherals.
