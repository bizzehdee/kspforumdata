According to Gunter\u0027s Space Page, it\u0027s most likely based on a Lockheed A2100 which is designed as a telecom satellite. It\u0027ll also be in a Geosynchronous orbit, and theres a military-spec compliant version of the A2100. There was also a mission of the same sort called PAN which was based on the A2100 sat and which is geosynchronous but moves to various locations over the middle east. With the recent rise in tension in the middle east with ISIL the US Military may want to have more sats avaliable just in case action against ISIL is pursued. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also prompt US action and they may be putting it in Geosync orbit over that area. It might also be a training satellite which will be placed over a US military base and used for \u0022field exercises\u0022. Of course, this is all speculation, it might be a 24/7 satellite hotline to the nearest Dominos or Pizza Hut for all I know.\n\n[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/clio.htm](http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/clio.htm)\n\n[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/lockheed_a2100.htm](http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/lockheed_a2100.htm)\n\n[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pan.htm](http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pan.htm)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T05:42:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 05:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lime","CreatedById":137978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:47:39Z","Content":"Acording to calculated burn times it\u0027s orbit is elliptical.
