It was in the same summer in which I started modding KSP. Now I am on route to modding other games. I am going to start modding Unturned and make a full mod for Minecraft. It is called Elemental Rockets. It is like Galacticraft but simpler. If I get enough support, I will add KSP planets to the mod or make a KSP mod!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T11:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool!
