There are some good products out there, but you are going to need a somewhat beefy pc to run them smoothly with ksp. Fraps is probably the least demanding, but it\u0027s not free. Open Broadcast Software is another good option, but you are going to need a supported graphics processor and 4gb\u002B ram, preferably more. If the goal is just to share video with friends and quality isn\u0027t so important, a camcorder is an option. These are the least cpu intensive as they are separate entities. There are some pretty decent video cameras out there that are not expensive. Maybe even a webcam could get the job done, some of those are real cheap.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T03:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Otis**"}]}
