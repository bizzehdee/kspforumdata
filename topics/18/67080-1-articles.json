While both parties are generally supportive of NASA, particularly most members of this subcommittee, it quickly became apparent yesterday just from the opening statements of the Space subcommittee chairman, Republican Steven Palazzo, and a rather unusual appearance (he isn\u0027t on the subcommittee and it is unusual for the full committee chair to appear at a subcommittee hearing) by the full Science and Technology committee chairman, Republican Lamar Smith, that Republicans are going after the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Both of them made clear statements questioning the need for the ARM and its applicability to space exploration. Apparently the ARM has been chosen by certain members of Congress as a target for budget cutting, so that they can redirect (pun intended) money to areas where they can benefit more, such as NASA-corporate partnerships. I am concerned that this mission might lose its funding, since the Republicans control the House of Reps and the House of Reps controls the budget. I recommend that everyone here who is a citizen of the USA take a moment to write an email to their US Representative, no matter the party, expressing support for NASA and especially for the Asteroid Redirect Mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T22:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the criticisms are valid, though.

If SLS funding is cut as Charles Bolden proposed, we have no hope for missions beyond LEO unless we borrow rockets from China (possibly not Russia because of tensions in Crimea, they might cut of access to the ISS). So our only hope is from private industry like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Inspiration Mars, and dare I say it, Mars One. There is also no specific plan for NASA to follow by, once SLS is built what will we do with it? Its too expensive for LEO operations/trips to ISS(SpaceX can do it). I\u0027m not saying it can\u0027t get to the planets, but there is just no specific plan, and NASA hasn\u0027t even figured out how they will get to the asteroid, how they will get it into Earth/moon orbit, and where the funding will come from.
