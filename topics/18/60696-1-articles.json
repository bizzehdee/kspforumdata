It contains a lot of cats from memes and putting them in the position of average daily people. Such as Dave, the Business Cat. Kitkat, the little kitten sister of Dave, and Grumpy, their neighbor who never is happy and is always a grumpy cat (hint hint). I\u0027m already signed up on it. I just want to discuss it here because noone has seen it much other than 300 other people, but only 3 of them (including me) have made an account on it. It would be nice (unlike grumpy) if you join, but it is also interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kcomikcatzz.webs.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekcomikcatzz.webs.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(still a WIP, domain will change soon to be professional)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
