Games that made an impression and that I still remember fondly. To me this is more or less similar to\u00A0playing that old record of yours, the one with that one song you used to love so much - and you still\u00A0like to hear every now and then. Don\u0027t get me wrong,\u00A0this is not something I do out of a sentimental mood. It\u0027s like you have this one song from the past in your head and you hum it all day until you finally play it, then you play\u00A0it louder and then you\u0027re jumping around and playing air guitar in your living room. Something like this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this time it\u0027s \u0022Mercenary\u0022 by Novagen.\u00A0Released in 1985 this game was ported to 8-bit and 16-bit computers of the time (most notably the Atari 800 and Commodore 64\u00A0 as well as the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga). It was the first game (along with Elite, which was released a year earlier in 1984) that offered me, the player, the freedom to explore and act independently in an almost endless world. A virtual world. Of course, there were no hi-res textures, shaders and all the very cool and fantastic technology that today\u0027s\u00A0space related games of make use of. It was simple, transparent wireframe graphics and almost no sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what was it all about then? In the game you were stranded on the planet \u0022Targ\u0022 after your ship crashed on the planet\u0027s surface due to a malfunction of\u00A0your engines (we all know how it is...). Since you lack the money to buy a new ship right away, you\u0027ll have to earn some money. Lucky for you but less so for the\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPalyars (the species that lives on Targ), the planet has recently been invaded by an alien race called the \u0022Mechanoids\u0022 and so you find yourself in the middle of a civil-war. In order to earn money, you\u0027ll have to perform various tasks for either the Palyars or Mechanoids. As soon as you have earned 999.999 credits, you may buy a new ship and leave Targ. While there are a lot of interesting buildings in \u0022Central City\u0022, the only settlement on the planet\u0027s surface, a lot of the action takes place in the underground complexes that both sides have established. There you will find long corridors, storage rooms and a briefing room where jobs are offered to you. There are locked doors that will require a certain key and teleporters that beam you to a different location. There even is a colony craft in orbit that you can\u00A0visit. There is almost no sound in the game except engine noise, weapon shots and the occasional beep when a message for you arrives. I\u0027ve never been successful at finishing the game, but it doesn\u0027t matter because when I play it I still feel\u00A0excitement and couriosity. Just wandering around, exploring and maybe shooting the\u00A0Atari sign\u00A0is as much fun as finsihing the game would be.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those of you, who don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about I have found a video (not made by me)\u00A0on youtube that shows the game in action:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFI8YEQgHWc?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#222222\u0022\u003EDo any of you also remember \u0022Mercenary\u0022 and if so, have you played it in later years?
