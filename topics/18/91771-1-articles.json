(free), although I just installed BitDefender (free) on my reinstalled machine. Avast! was starting to cheese me off by poking its nose into my SSL connections - sorry, but it\u0027s closed source, and there\u0027s no way I\u0027m letting any software become a man-in-the-middle when I\u0027m doing banking and suchlike. The SSL snooping is on by default, but you can turn it off. Nevertheless BitDefender ranked slightly higher in the detection stakes and in the system impact so I thought I\u0027d give it a try.
