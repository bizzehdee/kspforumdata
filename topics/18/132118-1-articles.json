Their statement followed Dolezal\u0027s reports to police and local news media that she had been the victim of nine hate crimes. Dolezal\u0027s critics contend that she has committed cultural appropriation and fraud; Dolezal contends her racial identity is genuine while not based on biology or ancestry. In a November 2015 television interview, Dolezal publicly stated for the first time since the controversy began that she was born white\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDolezal\u0027s arguments are very similar to the arguments of trans people, who wish to be treated as a gender other than their biological gender. Given the boundaries between races are much more blurry and the differences much smaller... if it works (in society) for gender, why not race?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, we have people that are biologically part of a race, but they are not treated as such, and often don\u0027t apper to identify as such. For example.. take just about any person born to a \u0022black\u0022 parent and a white parent. They are pretty much always considered to be black, not white. Its like this even if they are 1/4 black, 3/4 white...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy great grandfather was mixed race and fairly light skinned. Nonetheless, he was considered black and was forbidden from marrying my great grandmother by my great grandmother\u0027s father - who apparently recanted on his deathbed- at least as the story goes in the family at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy uncle recently took a genetic test, and it said he was approxiamtely 6% of African descent. That would be compatible with the family story if my great-grandfather was 1/4 black (25%). Thus my grandfather is 12.5% black (1/8th), my mother and uncles are 6.25% black, and I am 3.125% black...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at myself or my mom and her brothers... you\u0027d never guess we were of anything other than European descent.... at 93.75% white for my mom and her brothers, and 96.875% for myself. I don\u0027t \u0022feel black\u0022, I don\u0027t encounter any problems with racial discrimination or anything of that sort that often affects african americans... but the genetics/ancestry is there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is... do I check \u0022African american\u0022 to try and improve my chances with an employer that practices affirmative action... given outwardly I white as heck, by percentages I\u0027m 30x more \u0022white\u0022 than \u0022black\u0022, and I don\u0027t identify with stereotypicaly \u0022black\u0022 culture?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 \u0026gt; 0 after all...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T23:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am just of the opinion that we should ignore race all together, and every one ignores race.
