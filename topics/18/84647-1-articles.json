You don\u0027t know what your group will be like until you\u0027ve played with them. The level of role-playing, out-of-game chatter, silly jokes, or whatelse can vary greatly. It can even vary between different games a particular set of players is engaged in. If you\u0027re joining an experienced group, it may take you a bit of time to figure out exactly what is tolerated/expected. If you know what character you\u0027re playing beforehand, try and learn the rules that are appropriate to you before you get there, and ask questions if you need to. If you have a chance, sit down and build your character with the DM, or at least an experienced group member before the game, so you have time to understand what you\u0027re doing, and what it will mean in play (and how it fits in with the rest of the party). Some players will get extremely annoyed if you don\u0027t know what they think you should. (Of course, any group that doesn\u0027t tolerate and try to help a new player is probably not the best group to start with.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only constant I\u0027ve found is not to touch anyone\u0027s dice without permission.

She could even borrow metaphors about \u0022baptism by fire\u0022 to justify to herself that she\u0027s purifying the faith, saving them from eternal flames, or what-have-you.

During a lull in the action, she watches the place for a couple of weeks, making sure she understands the traffic patterns in and out, before lighting the place up -- as usual, when no one is around. What she had failed to understand, however, was that when this temple was reduced to ash and rubble, a local pharmaceutical company decided that they didn\u0027t have to be quite as careful about where they disposed of their biological waste.
