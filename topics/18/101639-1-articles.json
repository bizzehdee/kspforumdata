I\u0027m Souper, a SpaceEngine player, and i\u0027m here to start a little project that will record my adventures in SpaceEngine. Never heard of it? \n\n***Get. It.

The zombies died out eventually, though, and he was officially alone in the cosmos. He also took a lifer extension pill which would keep him alive for another 5 billion years as he resigned to exploration and cartography of the cosmos, storing his data in a vault on his home planet Earth, spreading that information to any extraterrestrial species he came across.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T22:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Souper**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T02:04:37Z","Content":"Nice!

My name is Elron Verrin, and i am the last man alive. Though no other of my kind will read of my discoveries, perhaps some other species will come across my findings?\n\nAnyhow, this is pretty much my life from hereon after. Figured i\u0027d start with an unknown binary star cluster i\u0027ve named the \u0022Erodia-Tritia\u0022 stellar system.\n\nCoords: RS 0409-253-5-24482-41\n\n![jaz82SI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jaz82SI.jpg)\n\n /\\/\\/\\ The afformentioned star system. Erodia is the blue one, Tritia is the red dwarf one.\n\nI decided to explore the first of Erodia\u0027s planets, which was an infernal thick-atmosphered blue venus with an almost pure nitrogen atmosphere, tainted by extremely thick carbon dioxide cloud covering. Its name: Galthor.\n\n![fPlccP0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fPlccP0.jpg)\n\nGalthor, as seen from orbit.\n\nGravity: 1.5 G\u0027s\n\nAtmospheric pressure: 4.3 ATM\n\nAtmospheric constituents: 99.98\u0026 nitrogen, 00.02% carbon dioxide\n\nI landed on a mountain range at the terminator, engaging in various surface activities such as material analysis. The surface was strikingly similar to Venus\u0027s, however, was extremely mountainous. The flat rocks seemed to conform to the terrain, they were even round!\n\n![1qoi2wD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1qoi2wD.jpg)\n\n![vm4kssz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vm4kssz.jpg)\n\n![DKCQ3w4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DKCQ3w4.jpg)\n\n/\\/\\/\\My photos of the surface, about 200 meters from my surface shuttle.\n\nAfter my first surface walk, i decided to relocate and explore some stepped hills a few hundred kilometers away. \n\nI gotta say, Erodia looked bright, especially on the surface of the very first planet. My time had to be short, my suit was in need of repairs from pressure damage from the hostile environment.\n\nAnyway, i decided to test out my new surface jetpack to explore the surounding environment in detail.\n\nI landed on a nearby cliff that had an insanely good veiw.\n\n![A7uTVB8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/A7uTVB8.jpg)\n\n![N4ezt2l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N4ezt2l.jpg)\n\nSo, after my little jaunt, i decided to return to my lander and explore all the other planets.\n\nI looked into the other planets. My next stop was near a blue gas giant 13.8 times the mass of jupiter, one of it\u0027s moon was extremely interesting. The gas giant\u0027s name: Elron, after my first name.\n\n![2TNUrEV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2TNUrEV.jpg)\n\nThis is the gas giant. /\\/\\/\\\n\nOn of elron\u0027s moons,(the first one) though, was particularly interesting; it had the strangest atmosphere i could think of!\n\n ![1PRhov6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1PRhov6.jpg)\n\nName: Aradia\n\nGravity: 0.6 G\u0027s\n\nAtmospheric pressure: Sub-martian\n\nTemperature: 56 F\n\nAtmospheric constituents: 99.9999994% oxygen, 00.000000006% trace gasses which were so few in quanity so as to be unidentafiable.\n\n![noWoK6q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/noWoK6q.jpg)\n\nI walked around on it\u0027s surface for a little bit, then.\n\nI would almost be able to take my suit off if it weren\u0027t for the extremely low pressures.........\n\nAyway, after gettign back to my ship, i noticed a bizzare formation on he surface as i flew off.\n\n![hHgZ4NY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hHgZ4NY.jpg)\n\nA heart-shaped formation with a bulge in its center. my ship\u0027s scanners said it was hollow, but because my suit and lander were currently in for repairs and reffitting, i did not get the chance to investigate. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a reason to dwel upon the implications of this.......structure...\n\nI felt....unwelcome...as i left Elron\u0027s system of moons.\n\nI moved over to a dwarf planet, the most distant celestial body of Erodia. It had an asteroid moon which looked funny, almost cartoonish. it was very smooth, but because my camera was acting up recently it refused to take a capture of it.\n\nWell, that\u0027s it, i\u0027m tired, and thus also need to sleep for 8 hours before i will head out to Trinita and it\u0027s planets.\n\n**Note to self: i think i should just do an imgur album for these things...**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T14:59:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Souper**"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:04:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m excited to see where this is going!"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T21:35:17Z","Content":"Here you are!\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/eEEas/new](http://imgur.com/gallery/eEEas/new)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:22:29Z","Content":"So, you\u0027re kspguy123?\n\nSeems interesting..."},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:27:51Z","Content":"[http://imgur.com/gallery/Y4pRM/new](http://imgur.com/gallery/Y4pRM/new)\n\nThere.
