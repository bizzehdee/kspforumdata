Despite KSP being a fairly ideal environment with almost no noise and other complicating factors, the latter can be very, very time consuming to develop. If it works it is beatiful though, hover scripts that function perfectly and accurately, even when instantly switching planet or gravity through Hyperedit. It just works. I had a great time coming up with a solution that would work not only under any condition, but also under any aerodynamics and fuel model without resorting to making specific exceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPID controllers are a little easier to get to work in my experience, but when the variables change it results can be less than ideal indeed. I first noticed this when I tried picking up a relevant amount of cargo with my PID hover script controlled craft. The unloaded craft stabilized quickly, the one with more weight tended to lithostabilize, eventually. Admittedly my tuning approach is fairly crude, but what makes PID controllers effective - their lack of process knowlegde, also makes them inherently unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny pointers to where I can find good info about the real thing?
