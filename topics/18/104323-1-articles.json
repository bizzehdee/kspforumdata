It feels very polished already even though it\u0027s still in alpha. Sure, like PenguinsMeep said, it needs more gameplay elements (and more content, of course - at the moment it only has one map, two crews and three ships which have a few variations for different roles) but I\u0027m sure all these problems will be addressed in the not-so-distant future. I have no doubt that this will turn out to be a brilliant game when it\u0027s finished. Definitely worth keeping an eye on.\n\nIt\u0027s DotA in space. With capital ships. Get it.

For example, the combat right now is monotonous and boring, it\u0027s just \u0022who has more ships wins\u0022. Also capturing bases gives you nothing apart from getting closer to victory.\n\nCombat is actually quite tactical though, as long as you are not like, 1 against 5. Team combat and positioning can do wonders. For example, I was a flagship that specialized in tanking going with a corvette repair ship against 3 others, 1 long range sniper, 1 mid range artillery destroyer and another flagship.\n\nI had to duck behind asteroids and rocks to approach the sniper out of her view, then blast her from the side - the sniper only has a huge front rail gun and is horrible when being attacked anywhere else than the front, but she is watched by the artillery destroyer. So I have to soak up the damage and kill her, before rushing to the destroyer with afterburner, while the corvette heal me from behind. The covette then disable the destroyer\u0027s ability, so she can\u0027t deploy bombers and missiles to wreck me from afar. I then position myself behind the destroyer where only 1 of the cannon can point at me, and release my barrage of flak cannon. The enemy flagship noticed me killing her teammates and return, but she was unable to stun me with flagship ability since the covette disable her again, while I stun the flagship instead, and fly right under her belly. The flagship has heavy armor almost everywhere, except for an area near the engine where coolants and radiators are exposed - in flagship vs flagship combat, whoever is lower win, since the top one can only hit the reinforced armor, while the one below can hit the exposed spot. So I flak that area away, dealing extra damage and hamper her engine\u0027s performance, and cause her to go boom. 2v3 wins!"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T20:54:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, a moba needs SOME depth.

Right now the only thing you can do in combat in fractured space is move relative to your enemy, fly behind things and mash weapon buttons.
