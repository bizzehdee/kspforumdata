A truly great comedian, actor, philanthropist, and overall amazing person. I can\u0027t imagine that Robin Williams isn\u0027t somehow indelibly linked to all of our childhoods and it is truly a sad day. Feel free to post crazy, funny, or even truly impressive rockets, stations, and any creations named in honor of Robin Williams. Also of course use this page as a repository for clips, pictures, and quotes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T00:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my God, no.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T00:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esp1989: I merged your previous post into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90314-R-I-P-Robin-Williams\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe outstanding remembrance thread for Robin Williams\u003C/a\u003E.
