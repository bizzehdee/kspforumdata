I do not know why this is, does anyone have any ideas, before it was not like this!

(KSP is RAM-hungry AFAIK, maybe the other games busted the rest)\n\nOr tell us the other games it goes with, also your computer\u0027s specification. The state of your ksp save might helps a bit (saves with more craft and parts tend to be heavier)."},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T10:44:37Z","Content":"Perhaps there are some background programs running updates?\n\nDownloads you started yourself?\n\nDid you recently install a program that is running in the background?

So my scans scheduled for Tuesday early AM were pushed back until the weekend when I finally used the computer. I guess my KSP playstyle includes just enough idle time to make the AV think it\u0027s in \u0022light\u0022 use. Check and see if it\u0027s something like that going on.\n\nI fixed mine by scheduling a task to auto-wake the computer for the duration of the scheduled scan."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T10:52:01Z","Content":"I will check for any scans running, thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T11:16:41Z","Content":"get Spyware Hunter and malware Bytes anti malware... you probably have what I had a while back... these spies or malware REALLY eat up system resources...."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:51:37Z","Content":"I found out the problem, I cleaned the cooling vents and I also switched the battery mode!
