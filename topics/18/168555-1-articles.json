The current one I am using is an ancient Saitek P2500 and while it\u0027s still going strong, the d-pad and buttons stick\u00A0sometimes; I need something better for Dead Cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe layout is basically Playstation, dual sticks with the d-pad on top, six buttons, two triggers. It\u0027s a bit unconventional so I would be willing to use a quad trigger, four button layout, but the Playstation-style sticks and d-pad layout, along with the basic controller shape, are crucial, I can\u0027t stand the X-Box style, having grown up with an NES and the d-pad dominant layout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I could, of\u00A0course, just browse Newegg but they have way too many selections and I didn\u0027t see any way to filter out X-Box style gamepads. I don\u0027t mind paying for quality (that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking) but I\u0027m also not some pr0-gamer here willing to pony up for Razer products that don\u0027t appear to offer any competitive advantage to me over a solid Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical (I actually ordered an old one back-stock from China because they fit my hand just right), especially considering I play single-player games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTIA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"invision","CreatedById":178900,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T06:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can use a ps4 controller thats what i use\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T18:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni havent been shopping for controllers since i bought my ch hotas 10 years ago. things just dont die.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T18:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223245218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168555\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513363157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni havent been shopping for controllers since i bought my ch hotas 10 years ago. things just dont die.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still have a CH Flightstick, one of those two-button things, what I bought\u00A0to play X-Wing with.
