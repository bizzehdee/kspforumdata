It was kicked off by KSP, so that\u0027s why it\u0027s here. (I just needed to vent a little...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was playing KSP about two months ago. 1.2 was proving fun once the majority of the mods I use updated. KSP being more cooperative now (compared to 1.0.5; I skipped 1.1.x), I decided to actually build a true space station. A modular one, so I needed to assemble it in orbit. (I can\u0027t do the monstrosity launchers some players build and use...) I design it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. The lag hurts. In fact, KSP crashes several times due to Out of Memory conditions. This on a system with 16GB of physical RAM. (I do have my virtual RAM limited because of that, but still... KSP memory leaks/hogging strikes once more.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get fed up and decide to bump it up to 32GB. I noticed Windows 7\u0027s memory caching feature is pretty nice, so it would help with loading other stuff I deal with often (other games I play, file transfers, etc.) Should be a worthwhile investment. I buy, receive, and install. No problems. Ironically, I wasn\u0027t playing KSP as much, but it was more solid when I was and would go longer per session. I was mucking with the Space Station in orbit. I had to dock with it and retrieve Jeb and Val. (They\u00A0manned the two command modules for the station during those launches as I wasn\u0027t willing to add probe cores to the station modules when they had command pods\u00A0already.) The lag from the part could was tolerable, but kinda annoying. This is on a i7-4771. I weigh getting a CPU upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo last week, I bite the bullet: let\u0027s get a used i7-4790K! I got it today and spent the last 2 hours installing it and figuring out why POST wasn\u0027t QUITE working. A trip to Intel\u0027s site\u00A0after I got my system in a working config and looking at BIOS updates tells the story: Intel\u0027s own DZ87KLT-75K MB does NOT support the 4790K! CRAP! Well, it SORTA does, or else I wouldn\u0027t be writing this at this time. (Would\u0027ve been later with the 4771 re-installed.) It seems support is half-assed since it\u0027s just a refresh of the 4770K, I just can\u0027t access the BIOS. So I need to run my system is stupid-proof mode. (BIOS is locked out from user\u00A0access/changes and I assume is\u00A0using stock defaults.) So the entire reason I have this processor - to overclock the sucker - is render moot currently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO! A lesson to others: Know your hardware! And its quirks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I love Intel as a tech company, but I sometimes hate them as a business. The latter aspect is in full force right now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I now have a spare CPU and 16GB or RAM laying about. I can either re-install my 4771 and try to offload the 4790K (I lucked out and got it for under typical prices on eBay, so I might at least break even) or invest more money into an obsolete platform. I would need a Z97 MB, which\u00A0are out of production. Still buyable new at retail; the selection just sucks. Looking at 100-150 more... Or I can get a \u0022server-grade\u0022 Z97 MB from SuperMicro for about 225. I used to buy Intel boards for the stability. (They\u0027re quirky at times, but damned if I ever had hardware issues them. 24/7 rock-solid operation.) SuperMicro is known for their server equipment... I just don\u0027t know if I should bother for that price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I could just save up and just build a new system, but that\u0027s another MB anyway along with a completely new CPU and newer DDR4 RAM (I\u0027m currently a DDR3 home due to the old tech here...) The performance advantage of the latest systems aren\u0027t really much better than that of several year ago. (Efficiency has been the main advance, not raw performance.) Not really worth the extra re-investment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of this, I don\u0027t feel like migrating my current OS install to essentially new hardware. (MB swaps aren\u0027t to be taken lightly...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDilemmas, dilemmas... And I feel so stupid about the compatibility part. *sigh*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other computer stories out there\u00A0originated by KSP?
