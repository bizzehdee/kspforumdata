This may not sound like much, but I wonder if the ISP\u0027s that supply both cable tv and internet are seeing a drop in cable tv subscriptions? With the rise of services like Netflix, who really needs cable TV service anyway? So , if I was an enterprising cable tv provider and I wanted to make more money, it would be highly tempting for me to try and booster my subscription rate by taking away my customers ability to use the internet, thereby creating more demand for cable tv.
