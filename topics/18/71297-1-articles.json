This actually has something to do with ksp since it did it when I downloaded the habitat pack. I clicked on the wrong download button and downloaded something called Ilivid. AVG then got rid of it and I downloaded the right thing. After extracting it onto my desktop I clicked to open it and... BLUE SCREEN... Funny thing is is that I had checked the file and found all the right ksp parts? Any suggestions as what to do? I have already got AVG to do a complete scan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jagger","CreatedById":95284,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T09:26:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might have been a nasty coincidence... Maybe Ilivid was involved, but i don\u0027t think so.
