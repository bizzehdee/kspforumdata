Anybody else play it? Kind of a high learning curve.

Sometimes many players just don\u0027t understand what they have to do. And I don\u0027t mean they are stupid. I mean sometimes the game tells you what you have to do but does not do a good job on explaining HOW to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while it has a nice, long complex story line (four hours plus) and can be replayed a couple of times many of the endings are just different versions of the same ending. You mess up and get arrested. You get a passport or more than one passport and escape by yourself or with some members of your family. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the problem with watching the Let\u0027s Plays on Youtube to decide if you like it or not is that nobody warns you that you will see many of the events. In other words, spoilers. Still, for 9.99 it is a good deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you get to make decisions based on your own point of world view and ethics, which I like. Sometimes you can let somebody in because you feel they SHOULD be allowed in. You will get into trouble, of course, but it can be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the Youtubes I\u0027ve watched it looks exceptionally tedious and dull.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T01:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty fun, although it took me an hour to figure the system out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
