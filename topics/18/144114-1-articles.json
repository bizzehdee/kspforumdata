I\u0027m stumped with names: I\u0027ve used names for Greek and Roman deities, important French figures, art objects, minerals, elements, Russian names. You name it, I\u0027ve done it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the list of bodies\u00A0that I need help naming:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntesti: A rainbow-colored gas giant that has a geosynchronous ring system and rotates on a near-90 degree angle. It is the 7th planet in the Sena System, so basically an Uranus analogue. Also, it sounds like a body part, like Uranus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpes: A large blue moon orbiting close to Entesti, even closer in than its geosynchronous ring system. It is mostly blue with some large yellow spots. It is most likely volcanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTascumnu: A boring gray-black bodied moon that appears to have had extremely large deltas and a large canyon which is possibly a crater. It may be a past moon.\u00A0Tascumnu is a normal-looking moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHorsa: A very colorful blue and yellow planet that relatively looks like moldy Papa John\u0027s pizza. It\u0027s a quite large moon and also has a sub-satellite named Icarnax.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIcarnax: Looks like its orbital parent, looks like slightly molded Papa John\u0027s pizza. It may be a result of an asteroid impacting the surface and taking a large amount of dust and orbiting Horsa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd last, and actually least: Romanus, the smallest body and moon in the solar system. This cute and lonely asteroid somehow got intercepted by Entesti, while orbiting at an extremely far distance. So far, that you probably couldn\u0027t even see Entesti from the surface of Romanus. Legend has it that if you spot Romanus with a telescope as a small child, you will spot it in the exact same position as a fully grown adult 19.4 years later. It orbits at an absurd 27 million kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T11:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like you\u0027ve already got it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
