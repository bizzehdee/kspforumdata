If you have never had a cuban sandwich you don\u0027t know what your missing out upon, Besides the cuban sandwich, Lost Cuban also does among other things Empanadas (It\u0027s like a turnover), Arroz con Pollo (Chicken with Rice and Vegetables), Fried Plantains, Rice and Black beans, not to mention they make this insanely addicting Mango-Habanero sauce which really isn\u0027t that spicy but is the perfect addition to any dish they serve there. Best of all it\u0027s the only Cuban Restaurant in all of Iowa. I highly recommend it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for actual subs I personally like this duo of deli restaurants in Rock Falls and Dixon, Illinois called Arthur\u0027s Garden Deli. Both of them are off of Interstate 88 on the way to Chicago. The location in Dixon has a larger menu selection and is farther away from I-88, whereas the one in Rock Falls has a limited menu but is closer to I-88. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T19:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, my favorite Subway sandvich is the Firehouse New York Steamer.
