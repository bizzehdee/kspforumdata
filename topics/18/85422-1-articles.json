There are 2 drivers available ( opensource and Closed sourceAMD ), you should always try the opensource one first. The commercial driver is known to have (in some cases) better performances in 3d but is very buggy when it comes to 2d. Meaning that if the opensource drivers are not enough you might have to use 2 drivers depending if you are gaming or desktop use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others say, install a 64 bit kernel and play KSP in 64bit.
