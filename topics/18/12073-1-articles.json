It is similar to KSP, yet no so. As this game is free it may be liked by the people. You can find the main forum by just typing in Orbiter on google, and thusly get the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first question is, what spacecraft do you fly primarily and why?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T10:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really should get into Orbiter, I know HavesteR loves the game, maybe he\\\u0027ll tell us about his favourite flight? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHint: We want to hear from you Harv \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralCheese","CreatedById":27644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T10:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to play Orbiter extensively. I really feel that KSP is the spiritual successor to it. It already has nearly the same functionality (besides docking). However, at the moment it is still really fun. The historical missions are really cool, like Gemini, and Apollo. Theres nothing better than recreating Apollo 11, or 13 if that\\\u0027s your fancy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Wasteland","CreatedById":14093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T10:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have done a Skylab-continuity.
