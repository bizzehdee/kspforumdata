Near the end of the Hunger Games, I ended up in a classroom in my school, where the other people competing (my classmates) would be there. Then I left school to go home, and some other weird stuff happened, involving evil clowns and Darth Vader. Then I woke up. The thing is, my dream felt so real.

It was very dark, and couldn\u0027t see anything. I fell over and had to get help. After going back home, I ended up on a school field trip in a fake SCP (it was called SCP-893, I think), which was a building with some weird little boy ghost in it. Somehow, I killed the SCP, and a bunch of lights in one row started going out in slo-mo. A giant wall of darkness appeared, and one of my friends was engulfed in it. Me and some other guy ran down a hallway, running from the darkness. We came across three doors, one said \u0022Nowhere,\u0022 one said \u0022Somewhere\u0022 and the other I can\u0027t remember.
