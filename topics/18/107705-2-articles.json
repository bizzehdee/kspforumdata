I don\u0027t want big ugly numbers just sitting next to each tank, I was thinking maybe a little green bar next to each tank or something? \n\nThe issue of dud rockets is another big thing on my list... I was thinking of maybe going the comical route, where if you go to space center and there is a rocket on the pad it just violently pushes it to the side. You can clear it right now if you just place a capsule and the click launch it will delete anything on the pad that is not your current rocket.\n\nNew version sadly did not get uploaded last night as I got distracted making docking ports, and I am happy to say they are nearly fully functional!

I want proper hose/cable/rope simulations and it is taking more time to work out than I was hoping it would. I think it would be interesting to be able to get your rocket tangled in your own harpoon line and silly stuff like that. Also fuel flow between tanks will get some more tweaks as well, I am not sure I am satisfied with the current logic. Currently fuel flows \u0022down\u0022 the connected tanks. For instance you place a center tank and place two side tanks on it, and the side tanks have engines. The fuel will flow from the center tank to the sides, but if you have an engine on the center tank it will only draw fuel from the center and not from the sides.\n\nIn short tanks suck fuel from the tank they are attached to, but do not suck fuel from a tank that was attached to them. And fuel only flows through tanks, RCS block included.\n\nAs far as finding bugs go... FIND ALL THE BUGS! Haha you certainly do not have to apologize, the more bugs you find the more you help me out a great deal.

I agree 100%!\n\nI have been working on changing some of the impact logic, currently it is just velocity based. So a small piece of debris travelling 200 m/s does as much damage as a large fuel tank traveling 200 m/s, don\u0027t worry this is changing. Another thing that is being worked on is heat, currently parts radiate energy when they explode, and when a part takes excessive heat damage it explodes as well. This is being changed so parts only radiate heat based on what they have inside them, IE how much fuel and such.\n\nEven with the current system I have softened some of the the effects, and it actually possible to launch a rocket with explosions ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Orion project incoming?..."},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:49:36Z","Content":"Happy Asteroid Day!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But that has happened with this game.\n\nThe original concept of protecting humanity from destruction by asteroids has been cast aside. I felt it was too limiting and the game had a lot more potential with all the features I was adding in.\n\nSo Asteroid Initiative is no longer the name, I am currently thinking of some new ideas, but that is not especially important at the moment.\n\nThe game as expanded to being about surviving as a ship captain, you build and upgrade your ship, gather resources from asteroids and planets, use these resources for trading or directly improving your ship. \n\nCombat has been added, defending from active threats(pirates) and passive threats(asteroids on collision course) is a thing now.\n\nTravel between planets is currently in real time (or accelerated 5x time), and I am currently trying to decide if travel between star systems should be real time or add a method for FTL travel.\n\nAs it stands there is currently only the starting star system, which is hand made. Other star systems will be a thing once I have finished the procedural generation system for planets, but this is not a priority as the starting system is quite large anyways.\n\nAnyways, I have been quiet for quite some time so I figured I should say something!\n\nI have also been busy essentially rewriting all of my code, because it was for 3D methods and everything is now switched to 2d methods. While I did not NEED to rewrite everything to make the switch, I felt more comfortable rewrite everything, and it is rare that code is not improved by being remade.\n\nOn the art side, all graphics are being switched to vector art, so no matter how far zoomed in our out you are they still look nice and crisp, along with that the art is getting a pass with new assets being made and old ones being thrown out to better suit the games new direction.\n\n![cnozyhX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cnozyhX.jpg)\n\n![rF97kh2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rF97kh2.jpg)\n\nThe ship here is made with just 6 different part types.\n\n-Cockpit (this is currently half the scale it will be once a new smaller cockpit is completed)\n\n-1x(1/3) Grid\n\n-(1/3)x(1/3) Grid\n\n-1x1 Fuel tank\n\n-Size 1 Space utility thruster.\n\n-Size (1/3) mini thruster."}]}
