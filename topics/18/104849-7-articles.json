(sorry if it came off that way) I\u0027m super excited for it, and it looks really good from what I\u0027ve seen so far. I\u0027m just interested in seeing what it\u0027s going to be like and what I can predict is going to happen.\n\nI think that its a trailer and we need to see what happens. I edit video and mix sound for a living and I can tell you right off the bat you can hear many abrupt sound cutouts and splices to tell a story in a trailer that is compelling for the audience. There is an abrupt cut at 1:53 that seems to be causing everyone to go crazy. They mixed Jessica Chastain and Kate Maras lines together to make it sound like one person was saying it. Then they combined it with a message popping up on a screen and then showed mara and chastain looking at a screen. We don\u0027t know what screen they are looking at and we don\u0027t know what screen the message popped up on. Its all cut together to make it look like they are receiving a message from Watney. I know in my bones that they are going to stick to the original plot and not tell the crew. Because then why even have Rich Purnell? Why have someone like Sean Bean play a character like Mitch if you aren\u0027t gonna setup for some emotional moments that need to be delivered by an amazing actor. Those characters are vital to that plot. I know this thread is for discussion that is why I made it. Please carry on and you absolutely don\u0027t have to agree with me or each other. But remember its just a trailer to wet your palate and to make people who haven\u0027t read the book want to see the movie."},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:38:34Z","Content":"Amazing read!

So it\u0027s done in under a day. I imagine something like an \n\u003E \n\u003E Orion mission or maybe even commercial LEO delivery through something \n\u003E \n\u003E like SpaceX.\n\u003E \n\u003E The rovers aren\u0027t based on any existing real-world design. Though \n\u003E \n\u003E they\u0027re very similar to the current NASA prototype. However, the ones in \n\u003E \n\u003E the book are larger. They don\u0027t have a built-in toilet. Instead the \n\u003E \n\u003E astronauts are expected to use waste bags.\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t define what the boosters were nor their total delta-v. Though \n\u003E \n\u003E the ULA booster that carried the (failed) Iris probe was originally the \n\u003E \n\u003E booster intended for a Saturn probe. So whatever delta-V is needed for a \n\u003E \n\u003E Saturn transfer and orbital insertion. As for the Chinese booster, it \n\u003E \n\u003E was designed to put a very heavy payload into solar orbit between \n\u003E \n\u003E Mercury and Venus. That means the orbital velocity would be very high, \n\u003E \n\u003E and with a very heavy payload that means lots of power."},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:34:03Z","Content":"This is an incredibly epic picture!!
