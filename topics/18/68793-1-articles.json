I will be straight here. I dont read all that much (i read alot of non fiction) and the fictoin I do read tends to be based on something i have either watched or played. So far my list of books read only really constists of Dune (only the original one when i was quite a bit younger) A bunch of warhammer 40k books. All the Halo novels and as of last night. Metro 2033.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith metro being by far my favourite and none of the later metro books having a solid translation into english I\u0027m looking to pick up something new that isnt based off of a game or film (or has inspired such). Something that I have no idea about. In the past I havnt bothered to pick up books because I had no idea if I would even like them because I had no prior knowledge of that books \u0022universe\u0022 but after reading metro and seing just how completley different it is from the game, it makes me want to broaden my horizons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m quite fussy I think. I dont want it to be really \u0022hard\u0022 sci fi. I\u0027m quite happy for there to be innacuracies but what I dont want is a whole chapter explaining how any sort of FTL drive works but I am intruiged by varous races and sci fi culture. Think mass effect but in book form. Also It doesnt have to all be war and conflict and massive space battles (a little bit of conflict never hurts though *pun*) but I dont want full out space politics. I\u0027m quite happy to read about some poor chap thrust into a quest to save the world (see:metro 2033) I did try to pick up some work by Ian Banks but just didnt get on with them (maybe thats because I was about a decade younger).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBH...I\u0027m not really sure what I\u0027m looking for. Maybe thats why I always pick up stuff based on/in the universe of games or film.
