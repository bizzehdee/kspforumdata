I am sure we are all interested in the difference between each one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also include the location of your school and anything related to it, just keep it in one post. I\u0027ll start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELittle about me and the surrounding environment:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently in high school. This is now my 4th school since my very first one (International school) which was in Kiev, Ukraine. It is where I learned English as my second language at the age of 7. Now I am in the top school in my country, Latvia. I passed the maths-oriented entrance exam in spring with a score of 81/85 and also managed to get into the prestigious International Baccalaureate class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one in the whole school, and there are only 2 other schools which have IB(one is a gymnasium just like this one and the other is an international school too). I forgot to mention, my school is Riga 1st Gymnasium(1st for a reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now I\u0027ve been here for 5 months, and I have to say I enjoy it a lot more than I did my previous one. Note my native language is Russian, and in Latvia there are schools for Russian-speakers and native-speaking Latvians. In most cases Russian speakers stay in their respective schools. My Latvian knowledge is sufficient, but of course not on par with native speakers, so it was a bit hard for me in the beginning, but my classmates were understanding and always help me if I forget a word(which is rare, but still) or get my grammar wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout the school:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELessons start at 8:20. Each student goes down into the vast underground section which includes the lockers for a thousand students(only 1 in 30 schools have lockers). each lesson is 40 min, with 10 min breaks in between. The bell is speaker-based(plays Big Ben melody).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of classes have interactive boards(a touch-screen whiteboard with a projector, combined produces touchscreen). The library is very efficient. Each library book has a bar-code, so getting and handing in a book is a very fast process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach student receives a login to the school network. We can access the school server using SFTP or a local terminal(such as the computer center). Additionally, we get a free e-mail and access to the \u0022skapis\u0022, meaning you can check which books you took from the library since all the data is stored on the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 11:30, for grades 10-11 it is lunchtime which is 35 min. We can go to the school cafeteria, the school buffet(snacks, drinks, and big tables for doing work/chatting/playing poker) or go outside. There is a number of cafe\u0027s, a McDonald\u0027s, a Subway and a few other all in a 200m range. Sometimes, if we can get out early, we order a pizza at a pizza parlor and walk there for 10min and each get a huge slice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 15:15 lessons usually end(after the 8th lesson) and we are free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELocation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe school is in the center of the city, 10 min on foot from my apartment. In front there is a nice park with a stream which freezes in the winter, but has boats on it when it is warm. In the spring/fall I go and sit by the water. If there is the unlikely event that I forgot something at home, I can easily walk there and grab it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy class:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe class is full of incredibly smart kids, all unique and ages 15-17. Apparently, Latvians are quite friendly and more sociable than my former classmates. I\u0027ve already been to a few parties(never been to a real one in the past 6 years), and the atmosphere is always very relaxed and friendly. One girl has a huge, 5-story house with a pool and a sauna, so we often meet there. They never make you drink or smoke(those who do), they\u0027ll ask if you want to but they\u0027ll never force you. We all speak in different languages all the time. One moment I might be speaking with one of the Russians in my class, the next thing I know we are speaking lLatvian then a few others join and we start speaking in English. Then someone from the german group starts joking around in German, so I have to switch to German...oh boy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur class also has a talisman(a plush Alpaca).
