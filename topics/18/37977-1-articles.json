A day later, I got the results and a certificate in. It said that I scored a perfect and exact 154 on all 12 tests. EXACT?! Why and how the heck in Kerbal/Human history can I achieve this perfection? The 12 tests were all different, or atleast seems different. I have a small problem of a bit shorter than average memory. I did remember 1 or 2 questions from it, but never appeared in any of the other tests except the test it was itself in. Is this a coincidence or a destiny for me to achieve my dream of becoming a world-famed astronaut/astrophysicist? I love physics, astronomy, and computers. I also am in work of making a micronation, going well though! I do want to know if this is normal to average perfection like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phawks","CreatedById":18165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T20:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you test one-on-one with a counselor/proctor? I was administered the WISC in elementary since my test scores were unusually high for my age and it served as an entrance exam for the gifted program. I scored a 175 on it, while the minimum for acceptance was 135. Any test that isn\u0027t administered, monitored, and evaluated by a trained professional is useless. I\u0027ve taken individual/unmonitored exams both online and in person and have varied from 98 to 276.

If it was in fact a series of twelve different tests (not individual subtests on specific areas), then I definitely call bogus because it\u0027s not possible to score the exact same numbers on every test out there; every test is adjusted and scored differently, resulting in scores as close as five points or less at times or scores more than twenty points in discrepancy at other times.

Scans of the papers uploaded to imgur would be especially informative. IQ testing is up there with Nigerian princes in sheer amounts of fraud, and it\u0027s something that should be taken very seriously. People should have accurate results, not something churned out by a flawed automatic system. I\u0027ve seen so many arguments between people about their 192s and 215s online and their disappointment of getting a 106 on a legitimate test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely neglected to comment on the rest of your post. The shorter than average memory is a common symptom among intelligences outside of one or two standard deviations (less than 85 and more than 115), although it isn\u0027t indicative of such intelligence. I personally have a similar issue with memory, although it\u0027s hardly noticeable. I do find myself forgetful at times, especially when in flow or tired. It\u0027s possible for me to go for hours and then have no memory of any of it immediately afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, IQ tests are worthless in judging your \u0022fate\u0022. If your brain is a sponge and knowledge is water, IQ is the sponge material. Lower IQs are less porous, resulting in lower absorption and a lower rate of absorption. Higher IQs are more porous, resulting in better absorption and overall carrying capacity for knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat determines your fate is your work ethic and your natural talents. Assuming both of our IQs (my 175 and your 154) are entirely accurate, that makes us geniuses. Are we therefore destined to become astrophysicists? No. I know plenty of men and women with high intelligence that are doing vastly different things. Clary made the gifted cut at 137. She\u0027s starting her second year at Harvard this fall. Colby had a 149. He had a 2.1 GPA, worked at McDonald\u0027s for two weeks before quitting, then killed himself a month before graduating high school. Jonathan wasn\u0027t in the program, but was tested and actually had a 93 and was diagnosed with dyslexia (or lysdexia, as he jokingly calls it at times). He did six months in an Oklahoma technical school and now welds motorcycles for Honda and makes close to $75K a year working a nine-to-five Monday through Friday. I myself am getting my Master\u0027s in Architecture, a program that takes five years at my university. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a correlation between intelligence and annual salary? Hell yes there is. Research has shown that lower IQs generally make less than higher IQs. It\u0027s not a causal relationship though. You have to 1) work hard at whatever you decide to do, 2) have a natural affinity for it, and 3) enjoy doing it. I took calculus my senior year of high school in preparation for college as an electrical engineer. It was challenging, yes, but the ultimate reason why it was the only D I ever made in high school was because I hated it. I can do math. I can do logic. The problem is that it ultimately bores the hell out of me. It literally gets into my head and pains me. When I discovered this halfway through my senior year, my wife suggested I check out architecture because creative video games (The Sims, Minecraft, KSP) were all that I played and she saw that I enjoyed making things. I\u0027m about to start my second year of school now. Yes, it can be difficult. It\u0027s no easy task to intelligently design a building while weighing factors ranging from structural stability to cultural impact and juggling the whole thing at once. But I ultimately love it. It\u0027s one of the few things that induces flow in me. Without getting into life views (I\u0027m a Christian), I believe that my place in the world is being creative and using my natural talent (and love) for creativity to help people and improve their lives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that all in mind, you\u0027re only destined to be who you discover yourself to be. You sound young, and you have a lot of life to live before you can really figure out what class you\u0027re playing. Some people start tracking from birth. Others die after ninety years on this planet never having figured out what they wanted or were good at. It\u0027s as variable a thing as individuals are themselves.
