I knew something would go haywire with it sooner or later, but this was the last thing I expected to happen. Suddenly windows was booting up 50x slower than yesterday. Then I noticed using the C drive for ANYTHING was much slower, including just copying files. I disconnected all my other drives and it didn\u0027t improve. I swapped out the cables connected to my SSD (Drive C) and it also didn\u0027t improve. I plugged it into port 1 instead of 0, and it ran smoothly again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m debating whether or not to take the MB in to see if it can be refurbished, but I\u0027m wondering now... the MB is much older than the SSD. Is it possible that the speed of the SSD was over-stressing the port and that\u0027s what killed it? I would assume not, since that port has always hosted the C drive, but I wanted to make sure before I start spending.

It could be the motherboard, that\u0027s what it sounds like from you post, but it could just be a bad port, dust or bad pin or something. Do you have any other pc\u0027s to test on? My dad\u0027s pc does crazy stuff like this. Some ports will not recognize my external drive, some will. His drive works on all of them. I bring my drive home, it works fine. I\u0027d probably want to test the drive some more on another pc just to make double sure it\u0027s ok. Is the port really needed? Is buying another motherboard gonna break the bank? Or even maybe a refurbished pc? Yeah, this kind of stuff drives me nuts. Also, I really don\u0027t have a clue. I didn\u0027t even sleep at a Holiday Inn Express.

The SSD will work at lower speeds if the supported protocol is a bit older, but it will not fry you SATA port if that was working fine otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to investigate more before you can draw any useful conclusion. Swap the SSD back to the first port? Does the behaviour return? What happens if you use that port with other drives? Check the SMART values to see if anything is showing up there. Sluggish behaviours often means lots of errors under the hood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome problems can be rather elusive and confusing. I have heard stories about cable breaks that caused a disk to work fine at times and seemingly randomly throw errors at others. It really is a pain to figure out it is not the replugging or changing parts that is the difference, but the position of a specific cable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222628409\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141687\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465777525\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267603\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, vger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the cost, refurb might be the better option.
