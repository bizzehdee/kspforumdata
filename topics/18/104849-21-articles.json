The movie makes this worse since they landed near nasty hazards (hills), and minus direct LOS, the rovers would *necessarily* communicate with each other and the hab via satellite link.\n\nIt really is hard to come up with a mechanism that is realistic that strands him, AND eliminates communications, even briefly. The transfer vehicle would likely stay on orbit until the planned transfer anyway, because ti would be well planned. The crew could do other science on orbit (remove rovers?), and such contingencies would presumably have been considered (because NASA). The whole not telling the crew subplot would have to go away, and he\u0027d be less alone. It\u0027s an interesting, but different story."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T08:49:45Z","Content":"If they couldn\u0027t communicate with the orbital ship, how did they rendez-vous and dock?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-24T08:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2016 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T12:24:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If they couldn\u0027t communicate with the orbital ship, how did they rendez-vous and dock?\n\u003E \n\nThe MAV had comms.
