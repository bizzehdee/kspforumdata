The system in the game, Lylat, provides some very interesting planets with their orbits largely a mystery. The biggest mystery, however, is this: What the heck is Solar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe generally accepted explanation is that Solar is a red dwarf acting as Lylat\u0027s binary companion, but many fans argue that it is, in fact, a superheated planet due to the rocks and other solid materials on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have my own theory that Solar is a cool white dwarf, and sectors X, Y, and Z are its planetary nebula. The sectors\u0027 names come from the same nebula appearing as different letters from different angles. Maybe it\u0027s called \u0022Solar\u0022 because its our own sun that died, leaving humans extinct and the various animals to rule the system... somehow... Yeah, it never really explains that, does it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve actually been working on my own new theories of the Lylat System now that StarFox Zero has been released, introducing some new canon. Since Solar doesn\u0027t appear in SF Zero, I\u0027ve taken a bit of creative freedom with it. I\u0027ve renamed it \u0022Solran\u0022 in my Universe Sandbox recreation of the Lylat System that I\u0027m working on to make it sound more like an actual name as opposed to an adjective, and it\u0027s a good-sized red dwarf. I\u0027m going as far as making Lylat a triple star system with planets like Sauria and Cerinia orbiting the third star, a yellow main-sequence star called \u0022Mysteria.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo keep my white dwarf theory, I even came up with a separate system altogether: the \u0022Solaris\u0022 System. It consists of Solaris, the white dwarf, Venomia, the original planet Venom before it was reimagined as a large space station, Ryolen, a lot like Eladard from the unreleased StarFox 2 (I\u0027ve reimagined\u00A0Eladard as a habitable planet orbiting Solran), and the Hypermass, a planetary-mass black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sort of went wild with this. StarFox is my childhood nostalgia. I\u0027m even going as far as reimagining the entire StarFox universe to make it more \u0022feasible\u0022 in an odd fan-fiction type thing.\u00A0It involves changing the characters into more believable species instead of corny anthropomorphic animals. I\u0027m just that nerdy... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-21T19:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2016 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JMBuilder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
