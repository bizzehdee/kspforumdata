Every single time, the malware has been easier to remove than AVG. AVG is the absolute worst in my opinion. I don\u0027t have anything against Avast, but do a simple search through this forum and you can find numerous cases of Avast interfering with KSP. Once again, it comes down to research. You should educate yourself as to why Facebook snookers so many people with work at home scams, \u0022free\u0022 offers, etc. This is where bad things come from. Facebook in of itself is not bad, but some people who use it are. This is just one example. Just because you choose to install a resource bleeding antivirus doesn\u0027t mean you are protected. Also, I am not recommending absolutely no maintenance at all. I am recommending that you do it yourself, by manually running a tool such as malwarebytes on a regular basis.
