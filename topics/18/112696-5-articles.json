Free; Doesn\u0027t provide near the same quality graphics but more access to data and numbers (And, IMO, a better \u0026 cleaner design interface). No budget restriction either but can be lots of fun (If you\u0027re obsessive like me) to see how low you can get tension\u002Bcompression\u002Bcost numbers down or how well you can balance tension/compression force\u002Bcost. And be careful to read through the screens that pop up when you click \u0022new\u0022, they provide options for setting up the simulation and situation. Can be very difficult at first but provides great feedback as to what breaks, what bends, what is too long, etc. And be sure to use lots of triangles; it won\u0027t allow you to run the simulation if it thinks your design is unstable; There\u0027s a window that\u0027ll pop up explaining what it defines as unstable elements if it does.\n\n[http://www.cesdb.com/west-point-bridge-designer.html](https://www.cesdb.com/west-point-bridge-designer.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T18:39:17Z","Content":"If Steam would let me log in, I\u0027d be downloading Massive Chalice right now."},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T19:20:11Z","Content":"And so it ends, for another few months.\n\n28.21 Railroad Tycoon II: Platinum, Tomb Raider ROW, Homeworld Remastered Collection, Mount \u0026 Blade: Warband - Viking Conquest\n\n6.79 Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition\n\n37.49 Elite: Dangerous\n\n4.39 Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition\n\n6.24 Call of Juarez Gunslinger \u002B Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon\n\n7.99 Road Redemption\n\n3.19 Chivalry Medieval Warfare with Chivalry Deadliest Warrior\n\n1.49 Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal\n\n7.98 Magicka, Legend of Grimrock 2\n\n4.99 Valkyria Chronicles\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC108.76 for 15 games: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC7.25 per game, Not the best sale ever offers-wise, but not too shabby either."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T20:01:27Z","Content":"I made it out with \u0022only\u0022 Cities: Skylines, Lego Indiana Jones, Grim Fandango, and Lego Worlds.
