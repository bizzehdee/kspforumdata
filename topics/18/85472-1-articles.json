Corrupted filesystem issue with bootable USB","CreatedByName":"SleepyWeasel","CreatedById":121169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T21:56:17Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"SleepyWeasel","CreatedById":121169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T21:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there all, As the title says... I was hoping to get some advice from someone more computer savvy than myself. I\u0027m trying to make a LinuxMint 17 bootable USB stick with a persistence of more than 4gb. I\u0027ve found a couple articles on the Google machine which describe how to do this and one seemed to work, see:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-larger-than-4gb-casper-partition/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-larger-than-4gb-casper-partition/\u003C/a\u003E. My issue is that before I found this article there was a long series of failed attempts to figure it out on my own which included several re-formats and several different attempts to partition the USB stick using Windows 8.1, IOS, and LinuxMint booted from a smaller live USB. Now, after I found this article I wiped and reformatted the intended USB stick(a PNY 16gb low-profile model) one last time using Windows, Installed LinuxMint as a live boot thingy, and performed the steps in the above article using LinuxMint booted live on a different USB stick. All went well and seemed to be fine so I rebooted the computer with just the new, larger partitioned Linux live USB. It got about halfway through the boot sequence, and right after it displayed the LinuxMint logo it flashed to a black screen with a box made of strange variations of the letter U and overlayed was the following message:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: no such device\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight below the message I can enter normal Linux Terminal commands but the boot sequence won\u0027t work. After encountering this I booted back into my other Linux USB and wiped the broken one and formatted it again. Then I installed Linux on it as before only without the partitioning steps and extra stuff just to see if it would work in the default live bootable setup and when I tried to boot with it I got the same message. Now no matter how I format it or wipe it or partition it, that particular USB stick always returns the same message at the same point in the boot sequence if I try to make it a bootable Linux drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first ever experience with Linux of any kind and I have had some help from a developer friend but he is at a loss with this one so I thought I\u0027d bring it here. Is there any way to repair the corruption on this USB stick or is it just hosed? I\u0027ve tried a few \u0022how to repair a corrupted USB stick\u0022 things I found on google, but no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or insight from the many computer-savvy folks on here would be immensely appreciated as I\u0027d like to try and salvage the USB stick, and/or avoid ruining the new one I ordered when I try to do this again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-26T21:58:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2014 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SleepyWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T00:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you describe makes me suspect a corrupted CD or iso file.

I booted 2 different computers into linux with it and even played KSP on them through it. Then I decided it was a waste to have a 16gb drive with only 4gb of space to actually use(and I had filled it up in no time). I have confirmed that the device is the problem though because I used the same ISO and writer to make 3 other bootable drives while testing theories tonight and they all work fine. During my searching for a solution I have come up with a lot of people saying bad things about PNY devices so maybe they\u0027re just hyper-sensitive to excess formatting/partitioning.

The first time I had ever used this stick was when I first found out about the idea of a bootable drive and the reason I picked Linux(which I know absolutely nothing about) is because a friend of mine is a developer and suggested that it was the easiest way due to its simplicity and small memory footprint. I downloaded a Linux mint ISO and UUI for windows and just followed the on screen instructions then when it was done I booted it on my laptop and it worked perfectly but could only have 4gb usable space which was quickly used up by Steam and KSP. That\u0027s when I started down this path of things that are far beyond my skill level and here I am :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T08:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SleepyWeasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SleepyWeasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECantab: I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E the stick was a special one as it was just an $8 cheaply deal I found at the local electronics store.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is probably you problem right there. Cheap sticks use cheap memory. I can advise you that if you ever want to do something intensive with a stick, like running an OS from it, you buy a \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E USB stick. Emphasis on good, which is generally revealed by properly fast read and write times, not necessarily price. These sticks use way more robust types of memory that can not only handle more abuse, but also will be a lot faster. All the things you want and need when using a stick as a hard drive. Some memory sticks are even equipped with proper SSD controllers, making them ideal for throwing around lots of data, rather than storing a Word file once a month. The sticks are of course somewhat more expensive, but if you pick the right one you do not have to go too crazy and it will save you a lot of trouble down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-28T08:47:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2014 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T09:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EOn the chance that you might appreciate an alternate method of doing it, you could try using \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eunetbootin\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E.
