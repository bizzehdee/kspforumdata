It was my first time going and being around any adults remotely interested in UFOs outside of my family.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a number of speaker events. I and my mother attended one with Ryan Graves, Lieutenant USN (ret), and one with Garrett M. Graff, journalist. I chose these two over the others specifically because they are outsiders to the usual Roswell crowd, and represent a neutral ground between denialists and true believers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraves\u0027 presentation was yesterday, and it was interesting. He runs a non-profit dedicated to gathering UFO/UAP data called Americans For Safe Aerospace. He encountered UAP himself and claims they were commonly seen in the military at least a few years before the 2017 video release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shared some interesting data, mainly in that none of the UFOs/UAPs appear to have pilots, only coming in the form of geometric shapes or points of light, sometimes surrounded by what looks like a plasma field, much to the disappointment of some in the audience. The number of military reports his organization collects is actually low due to new reporting procedures, with the next biggest categories being commercial and general aviation. Some are corroborated with ground reports. The details behind some of the sightings are weird, to say the least. His experience with it started during his time with VFA-11 during training off Virginia Beach. They were testing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/APG-79 AESA radar upgrade for the F/A-18F and would pick up swarms of odd objects. They thought it was a bug in the system, but continually found targets that weren\u0027t supposed to be in the restricted airspace. When they would go to look at them the AIM-9s would detect an IR signature and get a lock, but nothing would appear to be there. Eventually a visual sighting did occur in which a black sphere surrounded by glass buzzed two F-18s within 500 feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdk if anyone remembers, but there have been \u0022UAP\u0022 sightings underwater. I always thought that a little silly, and Graves shared what that was, because the incident was registered in his data. Basically a submarine was in the Atlantic and picked up what appeared to be a torpedo moving at 100 knots and tracking them. The captain ordered it to dive, and the target followed them down. The captain actually took it below the safe depth, and the target then approached within 100 yards of the sub before diving further. Graves says he doesn\u0027t know whether such incidents are common or not because the submarine community is tight lipped for obvious reasons, and also, he shared that there are operational considerations in why most of the UAP videos come from Navy aircraft rather than Air Force: the Air Force is often actually doing stuff during its missions over the US, while the Navy is simply training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraff\u0027s presentation was interesting too, but mainly talked about broad concepts of why the UAP is being taken seriously yet again. The gist of it is that after a certain event in 2001, the US became more interested in what was happening in its skies regardless of its affiliation, whereas as the military shrugged once it was obvious the craft weren\u0027t Soviet recon vehicles back in the 60s. The other reason he states is that the idea of there being life out there is taken a little more seriously now that we know exoplanets exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither of these speakers claimed to have definitive answers for what they are, and believed there is not a single answer but many.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraves simply said he did not have the credentials to ascertain what they are; his mission is to collect data and deal with the stigma around reporting. He did address how Starlink can cause sightings, and described how many \u0022point of light\u0022 sightings defy the behavior of a satellite. When asked if the famous video was of a bird (a hypothesis proposed by the members of this forum too), he said he didn\u0027t know, but he thought it unlikely due to pilots seeing birds everyday and being unlikely to mistake one for a UAP. He also mentioned that in that specific video the target appeared to come from the east, from the direction of the middle of the Atlantic, while in his experience birds mostly stay around the carrier or near land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraff categorized the explanations into four possible categories: Starlink/Venus, experimental drones from the usual suspects*, unknown atmospheric phenomena, and then the \u0022really weird\u0022 aliens/interdimensional/time travel whatever. I listed the categories in order of most common to very rare if at all (according to him).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*He cites an alleged incident in which a UAP emerged from the water and then went airborne, which helped the US intelligence community to identify a new Chinese drone. It\u0027s another reason why the government is interested again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the speakers I listened to were pleasant, the rest of the people were... meh. Between the people soliciting festival attendees for off-topic propaganda purposes or the man who got up to ask Graff a question, only to question him about the \u0022relevancy\u0022 of David Icke when it comes to the 2001 event (completely off topic in regard to the presentation, but Graff is an author of an oral history of that event), it\u0027s not a crowd I\u0027d like to hang around. Oh, and unfortunately much of the audience (including my mother) were and remain convinced the government is hiding something, despite Graff\u0027s attempts to explain at how bad the US government is at keeping secrets (he\u0027s been reporting on national security matters for 20 years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was fun though. I got a lot of UFO goodies, had some good food and a UFO themed coffee, and attended a parade involving a number of local organizations dressing up as aliens or scifi characters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a person\u0027s opinion about UFOs exists on a spectrum. On one end there is Carl Sagan, in the middle there is Jacques Vallee, and at the other end there is Eric Von Daniken (of course outliers in further directions beyond the ends exist too). I like to think I\u0027m firmly in the middle, in that something is happening but it doesn\u0027t necessarily fall under the domain of science to investigate. It\u0027s more of a psychological and religious phenomena with philosophical implications, IMO. That\u0027s why I posted this here and don\u0027t plan to mention anything in the Tic-Tac UFO thread in the S\u0026amp;S section. I just don\u0027t find it worth discussing in a scientific context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I got lucky in having two normal speakers to choose this time around. The other three were Roswell fanatics. It was a fun event, and I find the topic really interesting, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027d attend again unless someone from the outside presents. The work of people like Graves is purported by himself and Graff to be encouraging a more nuanced view of the topic though, so perhaps more like them will be available to visit some day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I\u0027m sure some of you are giggling at me, a UFO believer, considering Roswell dudes to be the \u0022insiders\u0022 corrupting the topic, and a former USN pilot and a journalist who contributes to big media to be the \u0022outsiders\u0022 who can save it with wisdom.
