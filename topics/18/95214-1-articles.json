If you\u0027re flying in the city you have to stay within certain routes/paths and you can\u0027t deviate too much from them for safety purposes, but out in the country where there aren\u0027t as many tall buildings, people can just fly directly from one spot to another, making sure that they don\u0027t hit anybody. A metaphor I can think of is traffic lights vs. stop signs. You can only go when the traffic light says you can and everything is coordinated and synchronized, but with stop signs you can go whenever you want if it\u0027s safe and you won\u0027t hit anybody or pose a safety risk.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for safety training \u0026amp; licensure, I think that there could be a separate class of license for flying cars vs. normal cars, like how here in America there\u0027s usually a standard license that\u0027s easy to get and that you can operate most vehicles with, but to drive semi trucks and other such vehicles you have to get a CDL (Commercial Driver\u0027s License) that\u0027s harder to get and ivolves more comprehensive and in-depth testing. To drive \u0022ground cars\u0022 you can get a \u0022ground license\u0022, but if you want to drive a flying car and get to places faster you can get a \u0022flying license\u0022. I realize this sounds a lot like a Driving License vs. Pilot\u0027s License-type situation, but if flying cars were to be invented they\u0027d probably have to be far less complex than a plane to operate so that the public would buy them, a computer would take care of most of the complex tasks, but a Pilot flying an aeroplane would have to learn how to do these complex things themselves. If such a licensing system was in place there would also probably be some restrictions on where you could go and what you could do with a Flying License, possibly multiple grades and types would be invented for what you could see yourself doing (no need for a license that allows you to go from one country to another if you just stay in town all the time, as an example), but a Pilot\u0027s License would have far less restrictions. I could ramble on for much more than this about a licensing system, but it would probably activate some sort of forum \u0022character limit\u0022 or something to that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*I realize this may be a bit of an oversimplification/hyperbolization and that it may be far from the truth, but I\u0027m using it as an illustrative example\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T01:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T01:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe seeming majority of people on the roads these days can\u0027t drive as it is... and you want them to fly?
