It was not a great experience, but I learned from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, why I\u0027m here... I\u0027m really confused to this one girl\u0027s level of interest in me. She asked me to ask her to prom (she\u0027s a sophomore so she can\u0027t ask me directly) via a note, but since then not much has happened. We hung out once (with other people, completely ran into her by chance) and we\u0027ve talked lots, and once someone asked if we were together and she said no (which could either mean nothing has happened yet or the whole thing is a friendship, it\u0027s decently common to go to prom as friends here) and proceeded to either\u00A0kiss or fake-kiss (couldn\u0027t tell from my angle) the person who asked that on the cheek as a joke (he\u0027s very gay and also her friend). Since then we have continued to talk and we compared our semester 2 schedules and we were both glad that we share some classes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s been long enough to determine, and I don\u0027t know if I can determine this any other way then just plain up asking her, but I\u0027m confused as to whether she likes me likes me, or just as a friend.

From the things you\u0027ve described it doesn\u0027t quite scream that she likes you or whatever since the things described seem like general friend things to do. If she was making special preference to go out of her way to talk or something maybe I\u0027d set your chances higher? I don\u0027t think it would be too horrible to ask to just clear it up before it goes too long. Could ask soon or could just ask in a little while (like....2 weeks maybe?) to kinda ensure that this isn\u0027t just a short term friendship or something.
