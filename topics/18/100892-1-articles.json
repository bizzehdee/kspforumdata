One of my most common ones is being in a city I live near, but everything in industrialized and there are factories everywhere. The pollution is horrible, and the infrastructure is in bad shape.

It may vary for others, just my personal experience. I also may have posted most of this before when the question was asked.\n\nMany mention waking up from shock or realisation that they are dreaming. They may realise and be able to effect things, or realise and not be able to effect things. I find this very interesting, as my experience is similar, but with one major difference. Quite a few times when I was young I would wake up instantly from a dream, but other times I would get the opposite, and be *unable* to wake up. I\u0027d be \u0022stuck\u0022 in what could only be a dream, as the situation was nonsensical or impossible. Often it was scary, but other times, as said, just strange. After being stuck in what seems like an endless loop so many nights, I just got really good at telling when I was dreaming.\n\nI guess the emotion or vividness of the dreams made them stand out. As others say they find it difficult to remember, I remember far too many dreams. Some going back decades. Which is a worry, I\u0027d have harder times keeping real memories! No need to ever have a dream diary for me. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) (I even have reoccurring dreams where I\u0027ll remember what I did the previous [dream] day... in the dream!)\n\nAs far as I can tell, I slept well when younger, but not so good as I grew up. So to help cope with the constant dreams, I decided to try and do something when in them. I was already trying most of the time anyway as a natural response to the situations. Eventually it became so common, I decided to have some fun, and set things to do on occasion in a dream. I don\u0027t have lucid dreams every night, or even dreams. Plus I cannot really control much in the dream very often, as it needs so much concentration (which you do not get when asleep!)... but when I do, it can be really interesting.\n\nPart of the trigger for dreams, or part of the sleep rhythm I get stuck in is when I can feel, see, taste etc while asleep and dreaming. Which can be extremely confusing. So if I dream \u0022my hand is on fire\u0022 I know not to panic, I\u0027ve just leant on my hand and have pins and needles. I need to wait out the dream, or hope I wake up and move my arm to a better position. I suppose it\u0027s similar to dreaming your thirsty, because in real life you are! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAs a bit of a warning, mainly for me, it\u0027s a coping mechanism as I just want to get away from \u0022nightmares\u0022 (scary not because I\u0027m scared, but because it\u0027s a dream and I\u0027m stuck in it) and partly because my body/brain seems stuck most nights. I do say this with a really really heavy dose of a warning to anyone *wanting* to lucid dream, perhaps they are better off not dreaming!\n\nBut with that warning out of the way, it is cool to imagine a situation, say from a film, and it happen in the dream with a good realm of reality. It is perhaps like if you were wearing VR goggle sets. Not quite 100% \u0022Real\u0022 but convincing enough. Times like eating all the cakes in a cake shop or calling down my personal flying car from it\u0027s orbital delivery station, are a couple of my favourite dreams.

I don\u0027t keep a log so I don\u0027t know how often my lucid dreams occur, but I remember my dreams almost every night. They run the gamut from scary and/or disturbing to pleasant or downright joyful. For me, it seems that one of two things happens when I lucid dream. Either my dream is a \u0022rerun,\u0022 like Technical Ben mentioned, and I can remember that it\u0027s a rerun and that alerts me that I\u0027m dreaming, or something about the situation is too out of place, and again, I realize that I have to be dreaming. (But sometimes I dream really oddball stuff and only realize it was a dream after I wake up.)\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve done on more than one occasion when I realize I\u0027m dreaming is to make my dream-self start flying, just because I know I can. Sometimes I drift along slowly like an astronaut in zero-g, and other times I\u0027ve been able to really get moving. In one dream I think I went supersonic, as I watched my home town, then the farm fields below me, flash by in an instant.

Having a \u0022reset\u0022 option is really helpful for being stuck in a dream or a nightmare. Options include (but are not limited to), flying (as mentioned above), waking through walls (do not attempt in real life!), flying out windows (again, not advisable in real life!), time travel (good luck attempting that in real life!) or turning into Ironman.\n\nIt tends to have to be something you can imagine and/or have experienced in real life. So if I\u0027ve never flown in an aircraft, imagining the tops of houses and the distant landscapes is a bit too hard to do.
