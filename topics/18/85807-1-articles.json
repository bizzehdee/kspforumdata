The images are taken through special filters. For example UV, green, orange, and then a computer on Earth processes it to look as close as it would be to what a human eye sees in those conditions. Almost none of the space photos you ever saw, being planetary bodies or nebulas, were made using classical approach. A lot of them aren\u0027t even processed to appear naturally. For example, Venus is a featureless blob of bright and bit creamy color, Enceladus doesn\u0027t have blue stripes, Mercury isn\u0027t perfectly gray, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that doesn\u0027t matter what kind of cameras they use.
