I appear at the dining room in my Grandma\u0027s house, seeing everything in black and white, and then the floor opened up and I woke up.\n\nI also had a recurring nightmare where I was standing in a mountain and some people wearing mineral clothes riding black storches battling elves in flying leaf carpets over a stone dam in a thunderstorm, breaking the dam in the process. Then I go into a mine with some of the mineral dressed people (kids of my age), but we fall into a pit. Then the pit begins to flood and when I run out of breath I wake up.

To make it even more confusing, you also dream that very same dream over again. Then you wake up and have an *absolute* *mammoth* of an existential crisis.\n\nAlso, this makes me think: at some point during your life, your dreams are longer than your actual life.
