Personally I think they offer great opportunities for both publishers \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E players. Yes, I\u0027d rather pay \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E but in the end developers want to make a living too and bills need to get paid. A system where you pay \u0022up front\u0022 and hope for the best can, in general, not possibly deliver as much value as a system where I only pay when I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E the game. We\u0027re now in a phase though were CEO\u0027s just get dollar signs in their eyes and think that \u0022micropayment\u0022 means \u0022boatloads of money\u0022 while ignoring the \u0022you really have to earn it unlike the #### titles you\u0027ve been selling for years\u0022 factor. They\u0027ll figure that out, eventually. A few things to note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMicropayments are... microscopic.

Forcing players to pay to advance limits the audience, and as a subsequence, limits the participation of \u0022whales\u0022 where the money comes from. To me this seems good news: yes, to be at the top of a game you probably have to spend money, but the vendor will have to work really hard to make sure \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s worth it\u003C/em\u003E for everyone, including those who do not pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fun to fantasize how KSP could have been implemented as a fremium game. Would you have to pay to unlock certain planets or components? Or maybe charge for time accelleration (up to 100x - free; 1 gold coin for one day at 1000x speed, 2 gold for 2000x speed, etc)? It would not necessarily be a bad thing--Squad would get a steady stream of money from a relative small group of players while having an incentive to keep the game interesting and fun to play for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T21:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI learned to cope with micropayments right away...
