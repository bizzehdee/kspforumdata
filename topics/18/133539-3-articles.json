It does 45 MPG, not the 20 to 25 that Tesla uses to advertise how much fuel you could theoretically save. I pay just \u20AC24 per year in taxes, and just \u20AC90 per month in gasoline (on average... right now it\u0027s actually less than that). Insurance is dirt cheap as well (though I don\u0027t have a comparison on what my insurance company would charge me for a \u20AC40,000 car compared to what I have now), and regular service is a few hundred every two years. So far, the only thing that broke in the past 5 years is the windshield due to object impacts while driving, as mentioned earlier in this thread, and once, the AC heat exchanger - ironically, \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E by object impact while driving.

He likes the X a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor normal people, a range-extending gasoline generator\u00A0is the way to go, because we cannot afford to have a warehouse full of cars for different uses. And I don\u0027t think of this need as temporary, but for the long foreseeable future. The reason I didn\u0027t consider a Tesla was simply range. Most of the time it would be fine, but it cannot be used on any even slightly long trip, ever. If they had charging stations... I\u0027m not stopping every 100-something miles and waiting 45 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it had a tiny generator, so that I\u0027d never have to worry about being stuck, I\u0027d trade my Rover in on an X (need room for the dog, etc) in a heartbeat, I think. Unless the range can be such that the car can go a full, long day of driving with a guaranteed charge where I decide to stop driving, I think it\u0027s a car only useful for regular commutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 3 claims a 215 mile range. Raw, without AC/warm temps, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe range calculator on the S shows the real problem with the no-gas design. The top speed available is 70 mph. That\u0027s cute. Highway speed limit\u00A0is 75, and traffic move at 80--85. Speed seems to drop range by at least 20 miles per 5 mph increment, so on a warm day (much of the year here in NM would hit fairly warm temps) with the AC on (not even remotely optional 100% of the time between May and September here), the S has a 215 mile range at 70 mph, AC on. on a highway int he real world then, not cloud-cookoo land, the range would drop from 215 to 195 if you drove like a 90 year old woman. At the bare speed of traffic, the range drops to 155-175. Charge stations give you half a charge in 45 minutes. That means stopping every hour for nearly an hour. That trip where we leave in the morning, and arrive at our friends\u0027 place in Colorado by lunch? \u00A02\u002B hours to Wagon Mound,\u00A0then stop for an hour. Then a little over an hour to Trinidad, then stop for 45 min.\u002B *(we\u0027d likely have to stop in Raton and top off, because Trinidad is really too far). We\u0027d nor nearly be in Colorado Springs in a real car, but we\u0027re barely in CO. Again, it\u0027s a stretch to use the last charge to get to Pueblo, but assume we can by being uncomfortable and turning off the AC. Thats another 2 hours travel/charge. Now we can get to Colorado Springs in another 45 minutes, and arrive. We\u0027ve spent almost 8 hours on a 5.5 hour trip. If we tried to visit friends in Ft. Collins... it\u0027s a 2 day trip instead of 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the model 3, the range is going to be far worse, it is only good for very local driving.
