And, I have a story along those lines. That said, there\u0027s an important exception where concussions are involved. I\u0027ve had a couple, and though there isn\u0027t a ton of formal research about it, those things take a long time to fully heal on the inside. I\u0027ve had a couple doctors I trust tell me that two concussions in a year can cause long term damage. So, it\u0027s quite critical to avoid certain risks while healing.\u00A0 As for how to do this, it comes down to personal choice. My case wound up pretty well though so I\u0027ll mention it! I wound up in a situation like the one you described- I got t-boned by someone who ran a red while I was commuting extremely fast on my bicycle (~30mph). Through inspiration and dumb luck I managed a series of rolls that kept me out of the neighboring lane, but wound up concussed in the process. I was alive though! Thanks helmet. From there I decided I should figure out how to do it consistently without risking injury, and came across soft style martial arts. Specifically, it was Aiki Bujutsu. It was rather intense, but the perfect place to learn awareness, relaxation during crisis, and how to roll out of dang near anything (and break fall or rag doll those you can\u0027t). Interestingly, all of this can be done at very low risk of injury with the right master/instructor who is aware of your condition. It wound up working too! I\u0027ve had unfortunate opportunities to test the awareness and rolling skills in the field (one time with with high stakes), and wound up coming out intact in all cases so far. So, my conversational recommendation is to gain that confidence and skill through soft style martial arts in cases where concussion may be an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
