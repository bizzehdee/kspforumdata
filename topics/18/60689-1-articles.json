Not only that, It\u0027s been polluting the surrounding waters with the old nuclear rocket engines leeching radioactive substances into the ecosystem. So far, it\u0027s only bad news for us. While the one reason to keep it up is that it is (ironically) a wildlife sanctuary for birds, The birds nesting here are invasive. The community voted 53% in favor of its destruction, so, Well I guess we will have to destroy it. What would the best way of destroying it be? (No Nukes or Missiles, this IS a wildlife sanctuary.) Bombs are restricted to only military use, and the demolition company is privately owned.

Some strategic cutting with a blowtorch or detachment of bolts or rivets may be necessary, and should be done so that the structures could still be pulled, but it is still reasonably safe inside. If there are any radioactive parts inside, they should be removed separately if reasonably transportable or protected from the main collapse and shielded so that any radioactivity can dissipate. As for any airstrips or runways, they should be cleaned of any and all contaminants and given to the KSP as another runway to take off from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T06:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDig out an area underneath the structures.
