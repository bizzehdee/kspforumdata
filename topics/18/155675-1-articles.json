After i enrolled in a law college, math kind grew on me. Well, at least the abstract approach to it (ie wikipedia articles like\u00A0this\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski\u0027s_undefinability_theorem\u003C/a\u003E),\u00A0in which i like reading it, but barely grasp 2,5% of what it actually means). So to say the least, this relationship issue remained somewhat unaltered, but with a plot twist. I now loved math, but she totally did not love me back, still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen i met Jebediah, Bill, Bob and Valentina, and it changed my life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that i\u0027m older, wiser and more patient. I think its time to put the multiplication table out of the cabinet and teach myself orbital mechanics.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherein lies the will to change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to do it? Any tips from the smart\u00A0people around here on this issue? Any\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003Cu\u003Egood books\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E on how to get things done? \u00A0Any online free courses that you know of? I want to be able to actually understand the problems, being able to solve it the hard and easy ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0it doesn\u0027t hurts to ask, are there any life hacks or cheats available?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo further enlight the spectrum of\u00A0my math skills, they are that of a 12 years old (6 years old by japanese standards). The goal is to have somewhat a a grasp of college level calculus, at least into the introduction of it. By then i\u0027ll be realized as a human being already, and maybe i\u0027ll finally figure out how to to dock directly after ascent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!!!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T16:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out braeunig.us\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T16:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplication tables and orbital mechanics are totally different. You do not need to know the one to learn the other. The tables are rote memorization that - frankly - I didn\u0027t commit perfectly to memory either. I do know all of them up to 10x10 but the more esoteric ones I have to think about a bit. And it didn\u0027t slow down my learning of orbital mechanics one little bit thanks to computers that do the menial \u0022actual math\u0022 part of math for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t suggest a way to learn either, though. Rote memorization of ANYTHING is beyond most of my capabilities, and I learned the basic Keplerian orbital mechanics stuff over half a lifetime ago (the 80s and 90s if you must know) but I can\u0027t help but think that Wikipedia \u002B KSP is a great way to self-teach a lot of this stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T05:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Astronomy-Calculator-Peter-Duffett-Smith/dp/0521356997\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.amazon.com/Practical-Astronomy-Calculator-Peter-Duffett-Smith/dp/0521356997\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
