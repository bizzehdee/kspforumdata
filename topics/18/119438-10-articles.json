What I noticed is the disdain that a lot of people have for those who work in what\u0027s referred to in America as \u0022blue collar jobs.\u0022 As I continued into the Ph.D. program, this dislike of what I consider the \u0022common man\u0022 became even more evident. While I do not want to get into the politics of this, and cannot out of fear of a Forum Rule 2.2 violation, I will tell you that I have a great deal of respect for anyone that works hard regardless if their occupation is in the academics or traditional vocational field. It is one of the reasons that on this page, I hold those who complete vocational training, on-the-job training, or even self-taught to the same level of accomplishment as I do those who have earned degrees from a university or college. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000ff;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOne of the keys to happiness and longevity is to find a career path where you get paid to play.

But those should be the rare days. If you find yourself dreading work, then it isn\u0027t too late to find something else that interests you and make a change. In our world, the days of 20 years and then retire are over with.

I intend to go straight into a masters program at either SJSU or Stanford (SJSU\u0027s AE department has all Stanford-educated professors - extremely tough profs), and mid-professional career complete a doctorate at Stanford.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 2nd and 3rd years of college have gone extremely well; however, my first year didn\u0027t. My forum name, Riven, provides a hint. I trapped myself into a 10-12 hour routine of playing League of Legends (sometimes 16 if I felt like I was on a hot win streak) that first year, and eventually I lost track of what I was truly passionate about. At the end of the academic year I forced myself to quit because my grades were in the dumpster. Almost two years have passed after stopping, but there\u0027s one thing I won\u0027t let go from LoL: the lore. I love good lore, and the reason behind my forum name is because my favorite champion\u003Cem\u003E in lore\u003C/em\u003E is Riven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have recently started playing KSP again - the last time I played was on 0.24. KSP is a game that I can quit/pause when I need to quit/pause it, unlike League where you\u0027re heavily penalized for quitting mid-game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways... about my real interests. I can\u0027t quite decide between several specific fields in aeroastro, and I\u0027m intensely interested an all of them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; Turbomachinery: Jet engines, liquid rocket fuel pumps. There are many aspects of jet engines that can be improved - reduction of noise (NASA\u0027s innovation on the GEnx turbofan used on the 747-8 and 787-x has dramatically reduced noise (the chevrons on the exhaust)), improving fuel efficiency through higher amounts of compression and hotter combustion (in turn requires better materials engineering), improving airfoils used in the fan and turbine stage to also increase efficiency, and even scrapping the turbofan and creating propfans that have even higher bypass ratios (but require hotter combustion temperatures and single-crystal superalloys that can withstand those higher combustion temperatures). Perhaps high-bypass engines can be made smaller as well because high-bypass turbofans such as the GE90-115B1 are nothing short of \u003Cem\u003Eenormous\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; Aerodynamics: the real meat of aerospace and the aspect that requires a lot of math. Take an airliner, for example. Wingtip vortices need to be reduced in the long run because as more and more people travel via air, landing separation needs to be reduced and wingtip vortices play a large part in determining minimum aircraft separation. If an aircraft is following too close behind another, the vortices from the leading aircraft might be severe enough to crash a plane; and if aircraft are too far apart, delays at airports would get longer and longer as airlines attempt to schedule more flights a day. Also, there is substantial room for improvement in fuselages: making them oval. Fuselages already act as lifting bodies (you\u0027ve probably discovered that in KSP especially if you\u0027ve used the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E mod), so by widening the fuselage into an oval cross section, an aircraft can carry more passengers in a shorter plane, have shorter wings, and therefore reduce induced/parasitic drag (not sure which is which but I\u0027m sure that those both types increase as speed increases) thereby increasing fuel efficiency. Wings and their airfoils are another point of improvement. Continuously varying the type of airfoil over the span of the wing and optimizing it for the unique conditions on each small section of the wing requires intense study and intense CFD (computational fluid dynamics). Therefore, improved computing power can further make aircraft more efficient for a certain regime of flight (usually cruising ;p).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; Long-duration space travel and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E: In-situ resource utilization (again, RoverDude\u0027s mods, Majiir\u0027s Kethane mod from \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E ago, and some other new ones I\u0027ve still yet to familiarize myself with) is paramount to sustaining a population off-planet. While the great big habitats from \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u003C/em\u003E (2014) and \u003Cem\u003EElysium\u003C/em\u003E (2013) aren\u0027t on the surface of another celestial body and have the potential to be 100% closed loop (i.e. they can sustain themselves without any supplies from the outside), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E technology would still be necessary to construct these habitats. Raw asteroid or lunar material for example would need to be processed into useful materials like iron, nickel, hydrogen, oxygen, and more. Ideally, you\u0027d want 100% of that material to be used in constructing habitats or bases. Unfortunately (in my opinion), the infant private space industry isn\u0027t focused on accomplishing these goals first - they\u0027re more concerned about providing methods of getting to other planets or celestial bodies and sustaining these colonies is so far a secondary objective (I\u0027m looking at you, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos). But I will definitely say that fantastic progress has been made in the private space industry in getting larger and larger payloads farther out there as well as making them reusable. True, my opinion might initially seem narrow-sighted, but I would think that if humans were to make a real effort in living in space, more R\u0026amp;D funding and efforts would be appropriated towards \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; High speed interplanetary communication: In order to support the growing number of probes and missions out there, more dedicated communication modules or even spacecraft should be deployed. Not only that, but newer methods of communicating between endpoints should be developed, such as laser-based communication (was a brief experiment with the Messenger probe). Within a couple decades, I want someone to send a probe with a live (~20min delay) 4K/24fps video feed from the surface of Mars.
