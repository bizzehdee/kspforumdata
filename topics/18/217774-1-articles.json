The sub is owned by OceanGate Expeditions which conducts yearly visits to the wreck to study the remains as it decay\u0027s. It also brings along tourists to help fund their efforts. The Titan carries 2 main crew members and 3 others, usually high paying tourists. One of these was rumored to be Blue Origin customer Hamish Harding who flew to space last year. The dive takes around 8 hours, 2 hours down, 4 hours at the wreck, and 2 hours up. The Titan dived down sometime Sunday. The sub last pinged around the 1 hour 45 minute mark after which it hasn\u0027t been heard from since. The US and Canadian coast guards are searching for the sub on the surface but it has yet to be found.

They experienced a catastrophic loss of electrical power. In this case, the sub is designed to fail safe and bob to the surface. This is why the Coast Guard is doing a surface search with air and sea assets, they\u0027re looking for the sub bobbing around on the surface dead in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. They got tangled in the wreckage and were unable to surface. This is unlikely, because they would probably still have power and be pinging and communicating. But it\u0027s possible they got trapped somewhere that is blocking their communications. If this is the case, the only folks that can realistically get to them is another deep diving submersible. Ocean Gate only operates the one. There aren\u0027t that many other ones. And you can\u0027t airlift one to the Titanic site, you have to drive it there on a boat. They only have a couple days of air left at this point. So this scenario will almost assuredly end unhappily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. They had a catastrophic flooding accident. If that happened, this isn\u0027t a rescue op, this is a recovery op.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, to get to the point, there isn\u0027t anything that the USN can do for any of those three scenarios that isn\u0027t already being handled by the Coast Guard. The USN doesn\u0027t have anything that dives that deep.
