In general the conflict and types of fighting are different, and you cannot apply what will work today with what will work in that universe.

Millett, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. While personally leading his company in an attack against a strongly held position he noted that the 1st Platoon was pinned down by small-arms, automatic, and antitank fire. Capt. Millett ordered the 3d Platoon forward, placed himself at the head of the 2 platoons, and, with fixed bayonet, led the assault up the fire-swept hill. In the fierce charge Capt. Millett bayoneted 2 enemy soldiers and boldly continued on, throwing grenades, clubbing and bayoneting the enemy, while urging his men forward by shouting encouragement. Despite vicious opposing fire, the whirlwind hand-to-hand assault carried to the crest of the hill. His dauntless leadership and personal courage so inspired his men that they stormed into the hostile position and used their bayonets with such lethal effect that the enemy fled in wild disorder. During this fierce onslaught Capt. Millett was wounded by grenade fragments but refused evacuation until the objective was taken and firmly secured. The superb leadership, conspicuous courage, and consummate devotion to duty demonstrated by Capt. Millett were directly responsible for the successful accomplishment of a hazardous mission and reflect the highest credit on himself and the heroic traditions of the military service\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T00:19:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by air805ronin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T11:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022air805ronin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022air805ronin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou cannot apply what will work today with what will work in that universe.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly my point. 40K is a bizarre made-up kind of fighting that doesn\u0027t actually have any intersection with any historical period or style.

Seriously though, somebody with a knife can be dangerous at short range. The police teach their officers that anybody within about 8m could get to them before they\u0027ve drawn and aimed their weapon. Historically the bayonet existed because rifles were slow to reload between shots and it prevented the soldier from being defenceless in the meantime. These days that\u0027s not such an issue.
