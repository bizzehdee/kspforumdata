NASA\u0027s Kennedy and Johnson space centers appear, as does JAXA\u0027s H-II rocket and NASA\u0027s Orion.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres also a few cameos from real Japanese astronauts. One scene.. which sadly I cannot find on its own has one of the BEST metaphors for why we should go into space ive ever heard. And theres a few other scenes that really hit home. You don\u0027t even have to be an anime fan to enjoy this. ( though it may seem a bit queer in areas to those who don\u0027t. For instance.. the Japanese depiction of Americans is.. off to say the least. But that\u0027s besides the point. ) Its also not the most accurate show.. ( I cringed on the SSTO rocket launch, but..oh well ) They choose to leave out details for more time with the characters which is what the show is all about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighly recommended. Here is the first EP on Crunchyrol. The first episodes for all anime are always in HQ on this site, then afterwards are standard. Now I use adblock to kill all the ads and if you don\u0027t have it already.. well.. go get it lol. Works great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-1-01-little-brother-hibito-and-big-brother-mutta-594787\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-1-01-little-brother-hibito-and-big-brother-mutta-594787\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres also a little gem called Planetes I liked, but turned out to be more of a love story.
