There has been a fair bit of flame, in both directions. Since those of us that are VERY excited about docking do not really have a voice in the other forums, I decided we needed on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This is NOT a rant thread. Docking will be implemented when Squad is ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No Trolling. We all know that docking is not here, is partially implemented by modders and that not everyone wants docking as bad as many of us want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you can talk about anything docking.

There is no current implementation of docking, unless you are using the mods. What he did was just rendezvous in orbit and then he EVA\u0027d the crew between ships. It\u0027s fairly common, I myself have done it several times in munar orbit pre .17 to practice for interplanetary missions. He had to fly both ships all the way there, as opposed to docking together and flying 1 ship there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You linked to the thread, where I read the first post and dismissed the whole thing. I read further and I saw your mission, and yes, that\u0027s pretty cool. I have yet to play with the docking mods, mostly because everyone says they cause issues with timewarping.
