It rates 0-10A 0A is best sibling you could have, 10, is the worst, you get it. My smaller sibling, named Brendon, he rates 10A, if you steal his iPhone, he will blow your eardrums out with his screaming, and if you so much as touch him, he will kick your stomach out, and possibly in your nuts. I barely sratched then surface, I could describe 1000 reasons. My sister, Sharon, rates 2.5A.
