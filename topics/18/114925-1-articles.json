Like... 4 maybe. I think maybe Gingerbread? I\u0027m pretty sure I had one in FroYo.\n\nTask killers can actually hurt your battery, because Android is constantly restarting the apps that you\u0027re killing. Better to actually stop them from running. That page Albert linked to has lots of good info on it."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T09:23:23Z","Content":"There is one battery app I swear by....\n\nBut it got deleted when I reset the phone to factory default. I couldn\u0027t answer the phone anymore before I had so many apps hogging my RAM ....\n\nSo, now, I don\u0027t use it. What REALLY kills your phone are those apps that demand access to things they don\u0027t need to...\n\nSome of the apps I had demanded access to my camera, video and SMS messages.... and what it was was a silly compass so you knew where North was.\n\nWhen installing apps, keep an eye on what they want access to... most of these are spyware type apps, and they hog your battery.... \n\nKill those, and your battery will last a week between charges like mine does now. (a Galaxy GT-S5570)\n\nIn your settings, you should have an option to tell you about your phone and what has been using the power."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T22:22:35Z","Content":"You can try Greenify, it freezes apps of your choice ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"jmiki8","CreatedById":94688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T22:36:31Z","Content":"I keep 3G/4G network connection, mobile data and wifi turned off (if I don\u0027t need them).
