I\u0027m talking about a sudden pressure, like someone poking you with a blunt iron rod wherever you got shot at.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve thought of this vest before, and each time it comes down to the same basic thing: A vest that can tell you where you got hit at, and the sensation of feeling your new stab/bullet wound could potentially distract you in a fight, just as it would in real life. Of course, such a device would probably face a lot of controversy for obvious reasons, and I could even imagine a SAW trap with this thing. Yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, I\u0027d imagine it would function as follows, aided by a visual guide:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.backcountry.com/images/items/large/POC/POC0019/BK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jacket, which completely covers one\u0027s torso and arms, would be made of a material which can artificially flex and harden, something similar to non-newtonian body armor (that is in development right now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E), but the difference is that the vest would be a \u003Cem\u003Esmart\u003C/em\u003E non-newtonian-ish liquid, so that electric current would harden the clothing where the current is applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is now a three- or even four-layered garment now: A protective cover on the outside, a layer of small and lightweight circuitry, the non-newtonian layer, and finally a non-conducting protective layer on the inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, final leg of the text here: All\u0027s you gotta do to make the vest simulate a sword slash or shotgun blast would be to have the suit disperse sudden and short-lasting current to wherever the computer believe you got hit. Of course, the drawback is that you wouldn\u0027t have a 3rd-law reaction big enough to knock you backwards, but at least you\u0027d feel that hardening and flexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my crazy idea #002!

Big flaw - smart material technology is a verrrry long way from hitting the high street.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could prototype the idea using compressed air, a number of computer-controlled valves and a few nozzles aimed at the inner layer. When you open a valve, a short pulse of compressed air at the inner layer makes it pulse against the body. You couldn\u0027t have more than a few active areas - because this is HARDWARE we are talking about and the cost rises in more than proportion with the number of valves - but it would give you a testbed for the code side of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T14:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks like it could be a lot of fun, niche market though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T15:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d end up with severe muscular damage after playing KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T20:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your idea #001?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordlundar","CreatedById":81040,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T22:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really a new concept.
