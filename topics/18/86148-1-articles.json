My current workhorse is Google Docs. But it has some shortcomings, and I\u0027d prefer an offline editor. LibreOffice Writer is as awful as MS Word. Once I used Adobe Indesign, but for my case this is heavy: need to run a virtual Windows machine, and there\u0027s no chance of collaborative editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I have to note that LibreOffice team did a great work repeating everything in MS Office, including all the bad things, and making exactly zero improvements.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I want:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* easy styling and clonetitles (Writer has this, but Google Docs improved it by a notch putting this part of UI on a diet. The simpler interface made it easy to use. InDesign complicated this part, which is too much for me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* perfect images snapping, like in Google Docs. They did it very well! Nothing starts moving madly like in Writer (Word).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* image cropping (Again, Google Docs is a great example. I could not find this in LibreOffice, \u0027cause it had to be exactle the same as outdated MS Office.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also use SublimeText quite a lot and value its features like line moving (shift\u002Bctrl\u002Bup/down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem with Google Docs is that I often need to work in transport, and 3G works not so well. Another difficulty is keyboard shortcuts that are shared with browser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone suggest editors capable of doing such tasks?

What makes you say that everything starts moving wildly? I\u0027ve not had this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just crop in Paint or GIMP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T18:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, when you add images, it tries to make text flow around it. When you add just one image, it\u0027s ok. If you have 1-2 images per page, things start being tricky: images try to flow around also, and since the new image is anchored to some place in text, the anchor moves to another page, Writer re-flows text, and puts the image in some weird place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use GIMP but when you need 50-100 images in one document, this is too much. Switching back and forth between editors is hard. gThumb easies things a bit (crop is easier), but you still have some difficulties: you need to save image as new file (because you can\u0027t save in place to prevent errors, and if you suggest Git/Mercurial, I do use them too, but this is too much for doing in an editor.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geneborg","CreatedById":124360,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T18:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm, could it be you want something more like \u0022MS Publisher\u0022....Magazine layout software?

MS Word and office suites are good for writing letters or short reports, but to write a book you need the proper tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a technical writer myself, I strongly recommend Frame for what you want to do. It\u0027s book-oriented, meaning that you typically work with chapter files. Images and illustrations can be externalized (you use links instead of embedding them into your files). It is strongly style-oriented, which means that you might spend a lot of time setting up the styles and formatting at the beginning, and then you only concentrate on the content. Frame is very powerful once you understand how it works, but it takes some getting used to, especially if you bring in some bad habits from Word. I strongly suggest following some courses if you go that route.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T09:16:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T08:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, will check both Publisher and FrameMaker.
