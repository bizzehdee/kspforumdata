Then I subscribes to him. After that, several days later, he releases a new video about his new Pixie the ultralight SSTO. Then I clicked on the video and it says that the video is blocked in this country by SACEM, UMPI and EMI of copyright grounds. I think that its kinda normal, as my country (Indonesia) love to pirate everything from windows xp to Microsoft SQLite Server, Autocad 2013 and even Xilinx FPGA ISE (!?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen several days later Cupcake posted a link to the original movie music , which is this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo4u4JJAPGk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo4u4JJAPGk\u003C/a\u003E Then after I scrolled down a bit I found this comment: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E AliasUndercover 1 week ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Say, emimusic, one quick question.

But the video from emimusic isn\u0027t blocked! And because that above comment was present I think this doesn\u0027t just happened in my own country\u003Cp\u003EThen after I googled, I found that EMI stands for British multinational music recording. Which is weird, because when I tried to use free cloud VPN UK that original music video is blocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what do you think about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T14:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the same problem as we (in germany) have with GEMA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGEMA wanted to get money from YouTube for the music of any artist that is represented by them, Youtube denied to pay the price that was demanded and an agreement couldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be reached (despite the fact that Youtube had reached agreements with national music syndicators from other countries ...
