Us Americans only get shallow, dull reality shows and 24/7 news channels that resemble yellow journalism.

We have BBC America but it\u0027s mainly repeats of Top Gear, Dr. Who, and some other sci-fi programme whose name alludes me. You\u0027ll get Dr. Who premiers, Top Gear premieres, and the occasional film but that\u0027s about it, you won\u0027t get anything that I\u0027ve seen on the regular BBC TV schedule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T00:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nice to see the whole \u0022Slow TV\u0022 thing catching on - you don\u0027t NEED constant dramatic things happening to make a program interesting.
