Hence I ended up with the Intel graphics. The i5 will have a bigger impact than a high performance graphics card. My previous laptop had a very decent geforce card but an AMD processor and the processor ran extremely hot when running KSP (to the point where I needed ice packs to cool it; I suspect that KSP actually fried the computer).
