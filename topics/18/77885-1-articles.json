GOOD videos. Youtube is loaded with Satun V launch footage, but most of it is compilations with often times music or other audio dubbed over it. Im looking for RAW, high quality launch footage. Now.. there was one posted awhile back. It was a clever edit of several Saturn V launches made to look like one. It was beautiful. Raw, powerful sound and great quality. Does anyone know the wearaboust of this vid? Or any other great vids? Even gifs would be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T23:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to check out archive.org.
