I thought this was kind of far-fetched, but as I researched the idea, it seemed more and more plausible, so we\u0027re going to give it a go! \u003Cu\u003EIf\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0we can get it working, it could honestly be a bit of a game-changer; basically nobody else is doing it, and it could save so much time and accelerate development dramatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to document the process so that we can write about it in our essays and stuff, and also so that we can maybe make a tutorial, so I\u0027ll be posting whatever stuff I found here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I\u0027ve decided that I want to use a reinforcement learning model because they use agents in environments, which is easily adapted to a robot in a playing field. I\u0027m not sure Q-learning would work because from what I gather, it fills out a table of all possible states and decides the best thing to do based on that table, and we\u0027d have around 2^140 states. Therefore, I think I\u0027ll use deep learning. Since I need to use Java for FTC, I think it\u0027s time to start learning deeplearning4j!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LHACK4142","CreatedById":208897,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-20T05:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeeplearning4J\u0027s reinforcement learning model sucks.
