The Body has beautiful mechanisms built into the circulatory system that allow it to deal with changes in pressure from hard vacuum (no pressure at all) to several atmospheres (this is why you don\\\u0027t immediately die when you go down more than 8ft under water, which would be more than enough pressure to collapse your lungs if your body was in the same state it was at when you were standing at the edge of the pool).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, its not possible to leave the sphere of influence of a gravitational body while still in a galaxy. What do you think is holding the Sun in its orbit (its not just sitting there, its orbiting at very high speed the centre of our galaxy)? Our galaxy, and I assume all the others, have a core of super sized stars and at least one terrifyingly strong black hole, which capture every single other object in the galaxy and hold them in orbit. Their gravitational pull (along with the combined gravitational pull from everything else in the galaxy) is so tremendous that large galaxies will even pull in other (often a smaller) galaxy and consume it, making the galaxy even more massive so it can pull in more glaxies.
