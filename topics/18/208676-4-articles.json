I think all by itself that could be okay depending on how colonies operate, but it is a bit unlike other parts in KSP. For instance unless you\u0027re doing something weird you\u0027re probably not spamming fuel tanks around to make your vessel look cool, you\u0027re using the number of tanks you need to fulfill a specific task. To me its certainly okay if crew tubes and other vessel components don\u0027t carry any kind of game buff,\u00A0 but I would expect the majority of \u0022habitation modules\u0022 to have some purpose within the game and not just be decoration.

Although I wasn\u0027t a developer (I was a part of the infrastructure guys and gals to provide the developers with the tools to actually be able to do their job) I got some insights how software development projects might have problems (and they have always problems). For example the developers struggled a lot to get the software stable (you don\u0027t want a crash in your navigation system during a long journey) thus they coudn\u0027t\u00A0 focus on the cool new features which were also planned. So it was decided by the management of our company and the customers management that not necessary features woudn\u0027t be included but be implemented in later Updates.\u00A0 This was done after several project delays and still with that we struggled to finish without further delays and implement at least some of the planned new features.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo: What do we know about KSP2 development? Not a lot since (like every company Intercept and TakeTwo keep their mouth shut about their problems)\u00A0 but the project was delayed several times. So based on my experiences I would except that they also decided to just implement the thinks which are considered as essential for the project. A full blown weather simulation propably isn\u0027t part even if it was considered at the beginning of the project. If it wasn\u0027t considered before it\u0027s unlikely that they will develop it in the remaining time to the release next year.\u00A0 Most likely they will focus on bug fixing/testing/other quality assurance and finishing the essential game.\u00A0 Everything else woudn\u0027t be in the interest of the investors (aka TakeTwo) since they want to get their return of investment. More delays means a later and (with bad luck less due do the current economic situation) cashflow. Thus: Don\u0027t expect that any shiny ideas which were not planned right from the beginning or suggested before the first delays will be present in the games stock version.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I can imagine: Depending on the sales some of these non-essential things (e.G. Weather simulation) might be part of a DLC if they think there is an audience for it. Since the community here is quite devided on this idea I\u0027m not even sure that this will be happening (again due to economic reasons not because people hate weather simulations). But it\u0027s more likely than your ideal weather simulation as part of KSP2s stock.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry for playing cassandra, this is NOT mean\u0027t as a personal insult or something like this. I\u0027m just sceptical and doubt that the team will be able to implement your ideas in the remaining time till release.

First: It uses precalculated data (depending on the used data for one or ten years).

KWP provides a framework for understanding what the weather on a planet with Kerbin\u0027s geography and orbital characteristics might look like. The results of the MPAS simulations (detailed on the mod webpage) could provide inspiration for fellow modders to create more realistic cloud cover and visual effects for Kerbin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nKWP does not include orographic circulations or other small-scale circulations (e.g. thunderstorm cells). This is a limitation of the coarse resolution MPAS simulations from which KWP was derived. In KWP vertical wind speeds are typically very small (\u0026lt; 1 m/s) so unfortunately, aspiring glider pilots will not be able to stay aloft indefinitely by riding the wind.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A03.

Both the original statement and the paraphrased version. To start with the incorrectness, as I have shown above, KSP is already \u201Cgraphically competitive\u201D without rain and snow, and there are tons of games without weather systems that are complete. If you really want to go down that route, KSP 2 will never ever be complete because there will always be aspects of space exploration that are \u201Cmissing\u201D from the game. I\u2019ll personally say that the game is terrible and incomplete if it does not include a power washing system to get dust off of suits. Those kind of arguments are silly, you see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd for the toxic thinking, I really thought that you were posting these really good looking screenshots because you were just excited about KSP 2 and you weren\u2019t expecting things to be implemented. Just like the information releases, where the best mentality to take is to anticipate them but not expect them, so that you are not disappointed when they do not come. Setting a high goal for the game is fine; sometimes it helps to just imagine what KSP 2 could be in an impossible perfect world. But making those lofty visions into your expectations is not okay and will result in disappointment down the line. It is toxic; setting impossibly high expectations for a game to even be \u201Ccomplete\u201D didn\u2019t come from the devs or anyone else, and that line of thinking that you have put yourself into is just going to generate frustration.

The game you are wanting is not what KSP 2 is trying to be, and making constant comparisons to other games that have more time to focus on the things you have spent your time on the forums wishing for is gonna lead to disappointment. If you want my advice, you should just stop lamenting about what KSP 2 will not have and start talking about what KSP 2 already has. No more \u0022KSP 2 needs weather because other games with much bigger teams have it\u0022, no more \u0022How does Starfield compare?\u0022, try instead saying \u0022The new parts for KSP 2 have been modelled very well and I look forward to using them myself\u0022, or maybe asking \u0022What will the colony parts be used for and how does the player interact with them?\u0022. Just anything that actually focuses on what KSP 2 can have or will have, instead of setting yourself up to create backlash when KSP 2 doesn\u0027t launch with such luxuries as weather, intricate vessel interior exploration and power washing suits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-30T15:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2022 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Bej Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-30T15:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224150159\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656602412\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe comparison is silly.
