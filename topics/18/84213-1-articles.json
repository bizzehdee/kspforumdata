As of recently, I\u0027ve been working on a school space program and have placed a satellite as our first prority. Due to a massively limited budget from what we have by contributions from myself and the club members. We\u0027re aiming for a tiny satellite, like a sprite satellite from KickSAT but only larger (and more expensive with a unit cost of 400$ instead of 25$).
