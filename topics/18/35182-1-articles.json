And then you beat the area just before the final mission... and it just all starts falling apart. The main reason I hated the ending was that it made all of your choices completely irrelevant. If you got a high enough war readiness, you unlocked a third choice, but otherwise none of it had any effect whatsoever on the ending. Which I thought was a stupid way to end a series in which the main attraction is making difficult choices that affect the universe around you and then living with the consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re fine with playing through the game already knowing the ending, it\u0027s worth it.
