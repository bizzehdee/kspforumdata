This doesn\u0027t have to do anything with the particular people in this forum, and of course there are many rude people who don\u0027t fit in these categories.\n\n- People whom English is not their first language. Perhaps they don\u0027t know how to formulate their requests for info more politely, or the nature of their first language is more brusque than English.\n- People who are too proud. These kinds of people tick me off, because they do not understand that their project is a community effort. I see these people increasingly frequently; they often stubbornly reject important suggestions for features in widely used projects.\n- People who have trouble working with others. \u0022Sounds like another noob to me, please read docs bye.\u0022\n- People who misunderstood your last message. UTF-8 does not by default embed any sort of emotion into messages, so you could take a remark either literally or sarcastically.\n\nWhen I ask my friends how to deal with these kinds of people, they just instruct me to act inferior, say sorry.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022If you stop retaliating in an argument then you\u0027re literally handing your --- over to the guy.\u0022\n\nBeing inferior is worse than being polite because you are essentially conceding to everyone that you are an idiot who knows too little for anyone to even listen to. (Which you\u0027re not, if you took the IQ test.)\n\nI am a very pacific person, so I tend to swerve out of arguments. What\u0027s worse, I have a poor defense, and usually these people have a higher \u0022reputation\u0022 than me. I try saying nice things, they simply use it as a ground for affirming whatever position they have against me.\n\nHow do I deal with rude people?"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T03:26:52Z","Content":"We\u0027re all human and our emotions/passions get the better of us sometimes. Sometimes you just have to cut people some slack. Especially people for whom English isn\u0027t their first language because, as you point out, emotion isn\u0027t easy to communicate in written language.\n\nAnd if someone really is a [diminutive of Richard], it is usually pretty obvious to everyone else too. We\u0027ll inevitability see things your way if you stay polite and refuse to stoop to their level.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T03:30:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage**"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T04:05:07Z","Content":"to interact with any being i just stick to this pict .... metaphorically i mean ...\n\n![TAAm5Ty.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TAAm5Ty.jpg)\n\n; )"}]}
