It was about sleeping patterns and basically about what we kall sleeping. There are 5 patterns- Siesta, Everyman (2,3,4 naps), and Uberman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently adapting Siesta, since it is the only one fitting my schedule. Uberman involves taking a 20 min nap every 4 hours, completely removing the need for \u0022sleeping time\u0022, thus giving you 22 hours a day to do something useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LawnDartLeo","CreatedById":61230,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T20:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EiDan in 3 weeks.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_y5Wj7kZR1mQ/SpeHVSvLj1I/AAAAAAAABCE/1JUC166vVcw/s320/marty.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022marty.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T20:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit might be something you can do for short periods of time, but i have a feeling extended periods of sleep deprivation will eventually degrade the performance of your day to day activities. i use microsleeps to extend my waking hours a little, but after awhile it just doesnt work anymore and you need to crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
