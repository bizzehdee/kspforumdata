Everything seems to boil down to the fact that we are driven by instincts that are no longer beneficial to the race as a whole. When we were hunting mammoths, only 1 out of 5 kids survived, everything was trying to eat us, etc. All the fighting, mating, hoarding; it all made sense. It doesn\u0027t make sense now, but it still wants to control everything.

Republics such as are popular today seek to balance the ideas of vesting power in a few individuals as the \u0027dictators\u0027, and the wider population, as well as the elite, through democratic election of representative bodies and high officials. This ideally balances to make a government that is perhaps slower than an ideal dictatorship, but quicker than an anarchic pure democracy (in which all choices are made by all people. In the best of circumstances this is very slow), and balances the possibility of poorly selected officials with the needs to get past the representatives.\n\nAs for the website:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture\n\nThis line jumped out at me, as well, since when has redesigning culture been straightforward? Generally such developments take ages to develop, and attempts to hasten change are generally termed genocide from what I can see. There are some aspects of the ideas here which are, from what I can tell viable, but in general, it seems like a fun exercise of \u0027what if?\u0027."}]}
