Yesterday the publisher Paradox and the developers of the Tropico game announced a new city building/management game called surviving mars. Not too many details right now but it is in the same vain of planet base builders and city skylines, and I have seen a couple of those threads here, so I thought you guys might be interested.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame link:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.survivingmars.com/dashboard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.survivingmars.com\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonal link:\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#fbebaa;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.survivingmars.com/invites/yTzew4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.survivingmars.com/invites/yTzew4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ece9da;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Yes there is a personal link, its basically takes you to a sign up page for the email alerts of the game.
