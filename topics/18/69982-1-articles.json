I\u0027m pretty new here at Kerbal Space Program Forum (actually, this is my first post), so I hope I\u0027ll have fun here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to create this thread because yesterday I saw an app in the AppStore called \u0022ISS Spotter\u0022 and I got intrigued with the fact that I was possible to see the International Space Station without any tools. You just need to know when it is visible in your zone and where to look... and this app tells you exactly when the ISS is visible to you, the peak of visibility and when it starts to disappear. It will also tell you where to look in the sky and give you reminders when it\u0027s about to happens. Just google it \u0022ISS Spotter\u0022 there\u0027s an Android and iOS version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to give it a try today and as soon as I saw a little white-orange rapidly passing through the sky I called my family and we all had 2 magic minutes (my sister was so scared).
