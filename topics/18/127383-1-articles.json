I\u0027d like to suggest that we expand upon that base. Whether you\u0027re sick, know somebody who\u0027s dying, struggle with a mental illness, whatever, everybody needs support from time to time and not everybody has somebody they can talk to. Hell, in many cases, it\u0027s way easier to talk to a stranger that you\u0027ll never meet in person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t claim credit for this idea, however. I used to play a fair amount of Eve Online, and helped out in an outfit called \u0022Eve University\u0022. They developed a chat channel called \u0022Broadcast for Reps\u0022 (an ingame equivalent of calling for help), and it\u0027s full of people who are therapists, or who\u0027ve been there, or just those who\u0027ve volunteered to provide an ear. You won\u0027t get any therapy there, but you\u0027ll always find support and somebody to listen. I\u0027ve used that channel before, on both sides of the conversation, and I think it would be great to import the idea here.\u00A0I believe KSP can host such a community and would like to start collecting volunteers. If you\u0027re interested, post your stories and let people know you\u0027re available. At the end of the day, every username is an actual person, not just pixels on a screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I suffer from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder complicated by high anxiety and bouts of intense agoraphobia. In the past, I\u0027ve gone 6 months without leaving the house, \u0027cause I couldn\u0027t make it past the front door. The few times I did, I was so loaded down with meds that I might as well have been asleep or unconscious. And yes, I have and occasionally still do, actively contemplate suicide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m doing better these days, though. I\u0027ve got new meds, a great shrink and therapist and a wonderful, supportive wife. I have friends I see every week (even if it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only through Skype for our weekly Shadowrun game). I\u0027m not well, not yet. But I\u0027m better than I was, and it wouldn\u0027t have happened if I\u0027d taken the other way out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, I\u0027m not a therapist and I\u0027ve had no training, but I\u0027ve been there. If you need somebody to talk to, hit me up on the forums. I\u0027ll reply as quick as I can, whenever I log on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T17:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222315131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449680628\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152732\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thalamask\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, Thalamask said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m doing better these days, though.
