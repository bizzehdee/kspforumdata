If you use standard Estes rocket engines, they come with ignitors that work perfectly, and with their new (to me) plastic plugs that they didn\u0027t have years ago, I haven\u0027t had a motor fail to light in the 20-odd launches since I picked up the hobby again (kids, perfect excuse to exercise my inner kerbal). If the ignitor isn\u0027t hot enough, you probably need new batteries. And rechargeables probably don\u0027t push enough voltage.\u003Cp\u003EEver connect an ignitor to house current?
