It\u0027s always good to know multiple languages. It shields you better from automatically picking one solution, so consider that as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your interest is purely academic there\u0027s no better language than C. Nothing will teach you better how computers are programmed and how they work. The downside is that it\u0027s impossible to program in C without it getting very technical, you\u0027re constantly dealing with memory, pointer arithmetic and what not. If you like tinkering, that\u0027s a fun challenge. If you only want results, it can be frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your interest is \u0022I have a couple of real world problems that I want to fix myself\u0022 or \u0022I\u0027m looking to automate small parts of my job,\u0022 Python should probably be your first choice (disclosure: I am a Python programmer. But I\u0027m also trying to be unbiased here...). Python is very easy to learn and remarkably productive; if your goal is \u0022\u003Cem\u003EI receive a text file every day and need to turn it into a formatted Excel file\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 Python is your friend as you\u0027ll have that coded in a matter of hours. It\u0027s also great as a first language as you can focus on programming concepts like branching and looping without having to struggle to make that work on a \u003Cem\u003Emachine\u003C/em\u003E. Personally I think that learning Python first will pay off learning C because you\u0027ll pick up things a lot quicker in C after that. Finally, don\u0027t underestimate Python\u0027s performance; 3/4 of the internet runs on Python these days (Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Dropbox, to name but a few). For job searchng though, keep in mind that \u0022Python\u0022 itself is pretty useless; you need to demonstrate skills in a certain field like web development (Django), data science (numpy and Pandas), and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC# is a great language but I\u0027d only pick it if you\u0027re interested in a specific domain that C# is suitable for - generic applications in Windows, KSP mods (of course), etc. From a job market perspective you\u0027re probably better off with Java, that despite all the bashing is still the 800-pound gorilla in the job market. The two languages have a lot of shared concepts and switching between the two shouldn\u0027t be too hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/10883-nuke/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002210883\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/10883-nuke/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nuke\u003C/a\u003E pointed out, learning multiple languages is very useful. It gives you a better perspective, and helps to think outside the box when confronted with a problem. Many books on general programming use examples written in C, Java or C\u002B\u002B so it doesn\u0027t hurt to at least be able to \u003Cem\u003Eread\u003C/em\u003E those (and reading code is usually harder than writing it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal advice: start with Python, you\u0027ll get quick results. Even if you stick with Python, at least work your way through Kernighan \u0026amp; Ritchie\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EThe C Programming Language\u003C/em\u003E; it\u0027s a classic, and it will give you a much better feel for how computers operate which is never a waste. From a job market perspective, learn Java, or specialize in some kind of Python framework like Django or Pandas. In all cases, showcase your work through projects on Github; it\u0027s easier to convince prospective employers of your skill with actual projects you finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally if you\u0027re in an office job right now and want \u0022just some programming skills to improve my position,\u0022 seriously consider \u003Cem\u003EVisual Basic for Applications \u003C/em\u003Eif you\u0027re in a Microsoft Office environment. Don\u0027t start with it (I still recommend the Python/C trajectory for that). It\u0027s outdated and ugly, and I feel like I need to wash my hand every time I\u0027ve touched code in it. But it tends to work in the most restrictive environments, runs on a platform that is nearly always available (at least in corporate office environments) and it can catapult your position from a mere desk-jock to a nearly untouchable status (I work in an industry that has laid off or off-shored 75% of its workforce, and through half a dozen reorganizations I\u0027ve never felt insecure about my job position). It doesn\u0027t get a lot of respect inside the programming world, and the ROI is low (VB is easy to learn, but mastering the object models of the various platforms like Excel and Access takes effort and is key to your skill set) if you pursue a job as a coder, but high if you\u0027re a business analyst who wants to advance their skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-01T19:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer C, and have used it quite often for personal projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I find that more often I now turn to Python.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78303-kerbart/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002278303\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78303-kerbart/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerbart\u003C/a\u003E above covered it pretty well.\u00A0 It really depends on what you want out of the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-01T21:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull disclosure, I\u0027m not a programmer.

Most large projects use this approach because it provides good tools for organizing code and breaking down big complex tasks into smaller ones. (E.g., KSP, (nearly) all KSP mods, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E are written in C# and are organized into lots of classes.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPython and Lua are a bit easier.
