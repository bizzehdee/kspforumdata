I dont have a \u0022grand unified\u0022 picture of the story, only some parts do I think I have the \u0022correct\u0022 impression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, the last sequence, specifically the moment when they stand up to perform the movements, had me burst into tears, much to my *own* surprise, but I digress...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the metaphysical aspects of the story are real. I do not think that the story has been made up by her in response to trauma. Through some kind of interaction, this group of people have been exposed to a set of techniques for manipulating reality in a heretofore unexpected manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe techniques are not \u0022artsy-fartsy\u0022, they are not healing with \u0022the power of love\u0022 or any hippy mumbo-jumbo. The movements are movements of matter through space. Some physical law dictates that certain complex movements of matter through space/time have a specific impact on underlying reality. The \u0022perfect feeling\u0022, the different emotions that the performers display in concert with the motions are similarly, movements of matter through space/time, but on a much more subtle level. It is a physical effect, similar to how me making a pencil move in a certain manner through space/time can convert a plain piece of paper into a story, or a work of art - the emotional content of the 5 moves are not equivalent to my emotional makeup if I was, say, using the aforementioned pencil to write an emotional story, they are (just like the grosser physical movements)\u00A0equivalent to the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epencil\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking that sometimes in stories, some characters/superheroes are given powers limited only by their imagination. And how these powers are so often squandered in the most base of ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 1 - In one of the Green Lantern movies, the green lantern, using his essentially unlimited powers, uses giant fists to beat up a bunch of people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 2 - In the movie \u0022Lucy\u0022, Lucy is granted essentially unlimited power and defeats a hallways of assailants not by brute force or firepower, but merely by removing their threat, and placing them physically out of her way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always thought that my first instinct if intervening in a violent conflict with unlimited\u00A0power would be to cease all atomic motion within a volume of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen these 5 come along in the last sequence of the OA, ostensibly angels granted a great-if-not-unlimited power, in confronting a violent attacked, deal with him in a wholly unexpected manner - by changing, or attempting to change (the way I see it they were interrupted) the very reality underlying the situation. Whether they meant to \u0022cure\u0022 his violent urges by using their movements in a healing manner like the other times, or whether they meant to change reality in another way (say, by forking the timeline by force to a track where the violence was much less - perhaps the cook who tackled the shooter was not an interruption but was exactly this). Perhaps they didnt know what they would do, but they knew to do the movements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the nature of their intervention was an extremely inspired piece\u00A0of cinema, if you ask me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoments before the cafeteria sequence, BBA is exiting the school due to the alert. She turns back and re-enters the school. This may have just been a natural protective instinct to her pupils, but this doesn\u0027t quite scan (the environment is one similar to a fire drill, maximum safety is if everyone leaves the buildings ASAP. She even gets in the way of quite a few people trying to exit on her way back in). It seems more like she felt she was needed and she knew where. She was not told to go there by the OA, she received no instruction. Yet all necessary actors were on-scene at the prescribed time. This lends weight to the idea that this is not the OA\u0027s fantasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, these kids in the cafeteria did not just learn a funny dance and decide to try their luck against a live shooter with it on the off-chance they distract him long enough to end the situation without being shot down immediately. They had conviction in the real power of the movements, more than that, they were able to perform flawlessly (or so we persume...) in the face of extreme danger. This says to me that the \u0022gift\u0022 almost has a will of its own, acting through these people, they are influenced in some way to take these actions. Or were at least assured of their validity. The way it happened they all acted almost on instinct. A newly learned sequence of mere movements does not become this sort of instinct very easily and they had only known them for a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething brought them together at the right place and time that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewasn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E the OA telling them to by making up a story. Random chance seems implausible, unless by the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Emanipulation\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E of random chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the nature of the \u0022other dimensions\u0022 and their NDE travels:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe OA states that the \u0022future is dark\u0022, not dark-evil, dark-dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems to be relating to the starry, \u0022space-field\u0022 environment where the characters go during a NDE and where they meet Khatun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis realm can be returned from if one makes the choice to, apparently represented by the act of consuming a living creature within the realm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReferences are made to the \u0022many worlds\u0022 interpretation - that a \u0022new\u0022 universe/dimension/layer is split off any time a choice is made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReference is made to many of these realities being \u0022layered\u0022 together, much in the way we would traditionally imagine parallel universes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do not require their bodies to visit Khatun, whereas it can be inferred that if travelling to one of the \u0022alternate layers\u0022, it would be physically similar to our own universe, thus you would require a body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is stated that one may lose ones memory if one travels between \u0022dimensions\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I am concerned, the \u0022correct\u0022 interpretation of this is still pending further information, we can still only make guesses to tie the above together. At the moment all I have are questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the starry realm where Khatun resides a \u0022layer\u0022/\u0022dimension\u0022? Or is it an in-between place?\u00A0One does not seem to require a body to go there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the starry-realm out-of-time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy are the entities there concerned with human acts of \u0022great evil\u0022 (and why this specific act)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes inter-dimensional travel require someone\u0027s death? Does the travel actually resemble dying? Is \u0022normal\u0022 death an interdimensional transit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave they or the OA already traveled and forgotten?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre any of the \u0022present-day\u0022 main characters actually persons from Hap\u0027s lab in new bodies? New bodies seems out-of-scope for me, mainly because it would either require the hi-jacking of someone elses body/life or the creation of an entirely new life from scratch (so who lives that bodies childhood and when?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, bring time travel/manipulation into the equation and the bets are really off - is the timeline on one layer even matched up \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E with any other? Or with the starry realm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhatun makes reference to \u0022averting a great evil\u0022, which appears to be the shooter at the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems a fairly trivial matter to be referred to as a \u0022great evil\u0022 by an entity that exists out of time and can bring about decades-long plans to bring extremely implausible possibilities to bear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially when, say, The OA\u0027s own bus-crash (implied as a similarly terroristic/human-violence event) as a little girl\u00A0is fairly comparable to this \u0022great evil\u0022 (the tragic deaths of a busload of young girls vs the tragic deaths of several magazines-worth of schoolkids).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTragic and messed-up as school shootings are, why was *this* event singled out as a \u0022great evil\u0022 requiring the (sometimes tragic in its own right)\u00A0manipulation of many people\u0027s lives over many decades and the unleashing of reality-bending powers to avert?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis inspires the question - was the shooter in fact the \u0022great evil\u0022, or is it still to come? Seems less likely since a 2nd season is not for sure, they have only said that they would love to do one. Would be weird to leave out the \u0022great evil\u0022 for season 2 not even knowing if there would be one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeh, so, an incomplete picture to be sure. Its not just a \u0022its up to your own interpretation\u0022 thing, there does not seem to be enough information to resolve many important questions. The creators themselves do say that there is\u00A0a \u0022correct\u0022 interpretation (in that they know how they would continue the story should a 2nd season go ahead) and they have stated that here are many clues within the show, many I am certain to have missed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoved it though and even if it ends here, a very fine piece of work indeed, IMHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-04T15:11:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2017 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
