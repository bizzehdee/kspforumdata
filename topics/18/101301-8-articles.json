All was going great. Then I reached the level to get a dam. Immediately dammed up a local river where I was getting water and pumping in sewage. Well then the bad things happened. The water level downstream dropped to the point were the river was severed in half causing the current to stop. The water level fluctuated making water sporadically stop flowing. Then the sewage backed into the water pump. This basically caused a plague. This is when I saw a problem was occurring. People were dying in droves as well as leaving the city. I destroyed my new dam but my city fell deeply into debt from the lack of people. Entire districts were abandoned. The tidal wave of water flushed away the sewage and now my city is bouncing back from that catastrophe."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T18:55:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!!

Elthy is right, that budget is so slim that saving up would be the wise thing to do. If you really must, try to find a good second hand system. That will give you the most bang for your buck. I am afraid that pretty much any \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3300 system would be (partially) outdated as soon as you get it. It is just not a cost effective approach.\n\nBut indeed, like Pink Plushy Point-hat says, this is best continued in the appropriate thread.

Dams probably are the easiest thing in the game to mess up. You do need to be aware they can temporarily dry the river up downstream from them. If there\u0027s only one river on your map be extra careful.\n\nStill, you can usually claw your way back. Slash services, even demolish or downgrade roads if need be, anything to get back into the black."},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T20:42:37Z","Content":"I never used them ... how extreme are the floodings in the region above the dam?"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T21:09:56Z","Content":"Opps.\n\n![87LZQK8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/87LZQK8.jpg)\n\nLost 20,000 people."},{"CreatedByName":"Outback_Zach","CreatedById":57252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T22:19:39Z","Content":"(@cantab) Yeah I just dropped taxes and cut services and added some new developments.

That will be the water level in the reservoir. Make sure the river bank upstream is higher!\n\nOnce the water level reaches that, the dam will let water flow from the convex side to the concave side, whether or not you have the electricity generation on. It will not let water flow the other way unless it\u0027s overtopped.\n\nSo RocketPilot, I believe what you need to do is contrive to put a dam in the river that faces the other way. To do that you need to reverse the river\u0027s flow, which you can do with the aid of water pumps and sewage outlets."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T18:02:14Z","Content":"How do I make land flat to build an airport?"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:05:13Z","Content":"I think you just have to find it.
