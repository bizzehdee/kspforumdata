I\u0027ve used this menu to disable the autoswitch based on opening my 2-in-1\u0027s screen too far and accidentally going into tablet mode. The manual switch is in the swipe-from-the-right quick actions, but I haven\u0027t found any other option for doing it with keyboard \u0026 mouse (such as a notification area option).\n\nWhere I\u0027m missing some customizability is in the display settings. When my 2-in-1 is in tablet mode, the auto-screen-rotation is great, but in desktop mode I\u0027d like it to always orient to the \u0022normal\u0022 direction. Only way to make this happen is manually, using the orientation lock in the aforementioned quick actions.\n\nAnother shortcoming of the display settings is the \u0022size of the display items\u0022 option like the taskbar, icons, and text. I can scale all these together to 125%, or it says the advanced display options can scale the text independently (but I haven\u0027t been able to get that to work). What I really want is to scale the taskbar only (for my thumbs), but keep the icons and text the smaller size. My screen size is small enough as is, dammit!"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:09:52Z","Content":"I hit the install this morning.

So it could potentially be changed?\n\nYes. There are a few different keys that affect the lock and the logon screen, though they\u0027re not very well documented. The results on Google can explain it better than me, but most of the customization settings are in HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Personalization or HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System. Example: You can completely disable the image background of the logon screen by setting HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\\DisableLogonBackgroundImage to a non-zero value, which forces it to a flat color. That color can be changed by setting another key in the same place that I forget the exact name of. The programs that allow you to customize the lock screen background are really just changing registry values.\n\n[edit: There\u0027s no space between win and dows in the key name.... I don\u0027t know what\u0027s up with the forum software wanting to break it there.]\n\nI\u0027ve noticed my PC sometime refuses to stay shut down when I shut it down from the Start menu. A third of the time it will stay turned off for a few seconds and then boot up again.
