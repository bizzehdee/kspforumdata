Learning a language is never a waste of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Do not forget to apply your knowledge. If going to countries where they speak this language is not an option, watching tv in that tongue or participating on internet forums is a good second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider the usability of the language you are trying to learn. For instance, I really like Italian, but its usefulness is very slim. Spanish is spoken the world over (both Americas and you will be understood in a lot of southern Europe), and French is pretty useful in some places too (Canada and a lot of Africa). If you already speak English, two of those languages will help you in a huge part of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess some oriental language might be useful too, but a big problem is that they are all very fragmented. There is no such thing as Chinese or Indian, which deminishes its usefulness. It is intesting from a cultural perspective though, and one can imagine that speaking such a language really makes you interesting for certain jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
