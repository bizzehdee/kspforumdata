RC Airplanes are actually one of my hobbies, so I try to keep up with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, and I know you\u0027re mostly asking for a smaller one to play around with, but you say you\u0027re getting a larger RC airplane for Christmas. Do you have any flight experience with RC airplanes? If not, I recommend you get a trainer that\u0027s easy enough to fly for beginners, but still adaptable enough to do basic acrobatics once you\u0027re more comfortable. Definitely don\u0027t pick up a warbird or a large scale 3D plane. Also, the exact choice will vary depending on if you\u0027re looking into electric or glow/gas powered, of which there are advantages and downsides to each. There have been a few recent advances in RC airplane trainer tech that makes this an excellent time to get into the hobby. It all depends on what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on the subject at hand, for a smaller relatively cheap, and durable RC plane you can fly in most fields/parks or even back yards I\u0027d suggest you look at HorizonHobby\u0027s ParkZone Ultramicro line. They\u0027re small foamies, which means they can generally be repaired with a bit of foam-safe glue in just a couple of minutes if something does happen to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I\u0027d suggest the ultra micro T-28 Trojan. It\u0027s a 4 channel micro trainer plane that has pretty gentle flight characteristics despite it\u0027s low wing design. It also weighs next to nothing, so if you crash there\u0027s rarely enough inertia to cause damage, especially if you\u0027re flying over a grass field (highly recommended!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=PKZU1580\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=PKZU1580\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for something a little more sporty, you could also look at their P-51. I\u0027ve not personally flown that one, but it shouldn\u0027t be a lot less stable than the T-28. Another plus is that, unlike the T-28, it\u0027s got a 3 axis gyro-stabilizer to help counteract wind. On my UMX Spitifire, UMX Mig, and UMX Habu which all have gyro\u0027s it helps a lot, and they can fly in wind that would ground most ultra-micro RC planes. Especially the ducted fans like the Mig and the Habu, though I wouldn\u0027t recommend either of those for a beginner due to their speed and agility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=PKZU2480\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=PKZU2480\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on if you\u0027re buying the RTF (includes basic controller) or the BNF (bind and fly - add your own controller) you might need to pick up a controller. Depending on if this is going to be a long lasting hobby or not, I\u0027d really recommend you buy a BNF and pick up a decent Spectrum computer controller to go with it, like the DX6i. It supports 6 channels (aileron, elevator, rudder, throttle, gear, flaps) and uses frequency hopping so you don\u0027t have to worry about someone shooting you down by taking your frequency (the bad old days of RC). Also, it has multiple model memory, so you can use it for several different RC aircraft and/or helicopters. For example, depending on the big RC plane you get ( I have some recommendations on that, if you\u0027re interested!), you could use this controller with it. Link to the product page is below, but you can probably find it cheaper elsewhere. Buying a dedicated controller will save you money in the long run, and give you better flexibility in the short term. Remember though, not all radios are compatible with all receivers. However, all the Horizon Hobby stuff I linked will be compatible with Spektrum radios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=SPMR6610\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.parkzone.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=SPMR6610\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit - Ah. Just noticed that you already bought something. Oh well. Anyway, the Cub is a pretty good choice. Very gentle flying characteristics. Though it lacks ailerons, which makes it of limited use for learning to fly 4 channel stuff. Flying 4 channel birds is quite a bit different from 3 channel aircraft, since all turning is done with the rudder. Still, most people do start out with 3 channel, so it\u0027s not bad. If you do decide to get an even smaller plane for flying around local parks though, my recommendations above stand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T21:49:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T22:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firov\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firov\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have any flight experience with RC airplanes?
