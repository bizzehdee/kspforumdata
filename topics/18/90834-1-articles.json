Quite a clever universe he\u0027s built in that one, and quite impressive to do it in one book. I recently read... \u003Cem\u003ETransition\u003C/em\u003E, which was weird as heck and \u003Cem\u003EAgainst a Dark Background\u003C/em\u003E, another standalone, which also has a really interesting conceptual background.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T03:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t, but I keep hearing good things about Banks in general and the Culture books in particular.
