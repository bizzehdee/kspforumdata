We\u0027ve moved from iPhone 4\u0027s to iPhone 5\u0027s, and it\u0027s very likely we\u0027ll/I\u0027ll continue that trend with the 6 unless I hear a very convincing argument otherwise.\n\nI\u0027m asking to see if any of you have any very convincing arguments otherwise - I don\u0027t want to dismiss a good opportunity to switch just because.\n\nSo again: I have an iPhone 5, my wife does as well, and our little boys are using our old phones as toys, pretty much. Having the same platform that we\u0027re all comfortable with is a definite plus. Also, the size of the iPhone 6 is not that much larger than the 5, which is a good thing for me who keeps the phone in the pocket. All the Android models we saw earlier this year were more like small tablets. And I understand the cameras are *very* good for phones, especially with all the shooting modes available.\n\nSome things I am interested in about Androids, however:\n\n- Battery life. I\u0027ve been having issues, to put it bluntly.\n\n- Flexibility. I understand that the Android platform can be customized much more than the iOS one; does anyone really do that and why?\n\n- Two bullets is a really short list, but I\u0027m sure you users can better identify \u0022these things work better/worse on X\u0022, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m interested it. And which models are good?\n\nOne last time: I\u0027m most likely to stick with the Apple option here, but I want to hear from you about this because I don\u0027t want to rule out switching completely. Plus, somebody else who\u0027s more on the fence might appreciate the discussion too.\n\nThanks much, folks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:46:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - Flexibility. I understand that the Android platform can be customized much more than the iOS one; does anyone really do that and why?\n\nI do. I run custom software and modify Android quite a bit too. The ROM itself (the OS), a custom launcher (\u0027desktop\u0027, so to say), keyboard and browser, to name a couple of things. Stock Android is pretty good, especially when brands do not add their own skins and such. However, I am fairly aware of what is possible, and when a detail is not quite how I like it or annoys me, I can change it. I like the fine grained adaptability to make the experience \\*exactly\\* the one I want.\n\n- Custom ROM: much more options while leaving the junk behind. Some also allow advanced tweaking of system parameters to increase things like performance or battery life\n\n- Launcher: this governs the desktop and app drawer. Make those look and feel exactly how you like it\n\n- Keyboard: as I have a rather large phone, I want a keyboard that can split in two and has swyping capabilities\n\n- Browser: added some privacy enhancing features\n\nThose are just a few of the things that are possible and useful. That being said, not everyone needs or wants this. Some people just want to use a phone as is.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T08:55:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T10:23:56Z","Content":"pincushionman,\n\n Since you\u0027re already using Apple, you\u0027re probably best served to stick with it.

If you merely want something that serves as a phone/ text interface then really a smartphone is overkill and it doesn\u0027t matter a whole lot which way you go.\n\n In my case, I wanted to use a smartphone to simplify my life rather than complicating it. That means that it needed to replace every other electronic device I had used previously. Camera, MP3 player, GPS, portable DVD viewer, AV remotes, guitar tuner, e-reader, portable gaming system, calculator, watch, etc.\n\n Most smart phones are capable of tackling most (if not all) of the jobs that other devices do, but attempting to use them in that role would quickly lead to battery life and memory capacity issues.\n\n In this role, Apple is at a distinct disadvantage (if you\u0027re not already in their ecosystem) because the files aren\u0027t in the apple proprietary format. *But more importantly...*\n\n Most smart phones (regardless of OS) are incapable of accepting expansion battery and memory capacity.\n\n I\u0027ve been using Samsungs for this very reason, and so long as they keep the removable back/ battery/ and micro SD, I\u0027m going to stick with them.\n\n There are some other manufacturers that share this advantage, but sadly Apple isn\u0027t on the list.\n\n I don\u0027t consider \u0022intuitive\u0022 to be much of an issue.

Once you\u0027re in their ecosystem, there is no point getting out, especially if you bought apps from the App Store or anything else.\n\nSomething I know about Androids from high tech friends:\n\nGoogle often releases bad updates which can actually decrease your phone\u0027s performance drastically, or, like in the case of my friend who has a Nexus 5 and recently updated to the newest Android version, got his phone stuck in a reboot loop and could only fix it by re-installing an update with a PC. Such a mess never happened with iOS.\n\nYes, Android gives you more customization options, but has a steep learning curve and isn\u0027t very intuitive.\n\nI like to modify things, but when it comes to a phone, I don\u0027t want a PC with a tiny screen. I just want an easy to use and fast smartphone like the iphone 5s.\n\nOnce again, Apple has Touch ID, and very few Android devices have fingerprint scanners (Samsung phones only)."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T11:46:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Google often releases bad updates which can actually decrease your phone\u0027s performance drastically, or, like in the case of my friend who has a Nexus 5 and recently updated to the newest Android version, got his phone stuck in a reboot loop and could only fix it by re-installing an update with a PC. Such a mess never happened with iOS.\n\nGoogle does not often release *bad updates*, and your friends phone getting stuck in a loop is an unfortunate incident. The same thing happens occasionally with iOS. Everyone is free to pick a favourite ecosystem and I do indeed think OP is best served by sticking to iOS, but these kinds of half truths help no one.\n\nTo elaborate: Google did not put out a bad update, as you call it. Google released an update that included a new implementation of encryption. When turned on, it can indeed slow down the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6, as Google decided not to use the hardware that can accelerate this. How much of an impact it has depends on who you ask (and ranges from *none* to *a lot*) and, more importantly, it is both an optional update *and* feature. If you do not care about encryption, you can run your phone perfectly without. It is expected that other phones have less of a performance impact, as those should be able to use hardware acceleration. It is pretty much why ARMv8 was developed in the first place, along with 64 bits capabilities.\n\nRegarding the boot loop: phones, from whatever brand, are pieces of technology, which means things go awry from time to time. In my personal experience (and numbers say the same) it does not matter which OS, brand or hardware you use, if you mess up or run out of luck any phone or computer will lock up, freeze or do other things that ruin your day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T11:57:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:10:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, Android gives you more customization options, but has a steep learning curve and isn\u0027t very intuitive.\n\nMy very non-technical mother could not and would not learn how to use a computer, but when we got her an Android phone she jumped right in.
