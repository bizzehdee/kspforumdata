They\u0027re about as simple to use as you can get, and between them (one for each DLC) they fix hundreds, if not thousands of bugs. If nothing else, use those mods. I think you have to get them from the Nexus as well because they got too big.*\n\nSteam workshop is the easiest, but can be problematic on a couple fronts. The first is that if the author updates the mod, that update will be pushed to you automatically and without notice, which can break mod compatibility. The other drawback is selection. Mods on the workshop can only be so big, which means many mods are either not available on the workshop at all, or only as stripped down versions.\n\nOnce you are setup to use the nexus, it\u0027s really not any harder to use than the workshop, but you get a better selection of mods and no automatic updating.\n\nThere is also a difficulty curve to the graphical mods. Your simplest mods are the ones like Clear Waters that are a single esm/esp file. Put it in the load order, activate it, and away you go.\n\nMods like Climates of Tamriel have options and compatibility patches, and are a little more complicated because you are dealing with multiple mod files for a single mod. Still, manageable.\n\nENB\u0027s are your top end graphical mods, and don\u0027t use esm/esp files at all. Instead, they exist in your main Skyrim directory. They require the ENB master file to be downloaded separately (very simple) unless they have distribution rights, and often have a list of other mods you need to be using for the ENB to look as advertised. Edits to the Skyrim ini files (located in documents/my games/skyrim if memory serves) are also common, or the ENB may not work at all. There are videos to help you deal with these guys. They can be worth it though, if your system can handle them.\n\nThere are also texture mods which can be strait additions to the Skyrim directory, or file overwrites. Make backups as needed. Nexus Mod Manager will do this for you.\n\nI\u0027d recommend Gopher\u0027s channel on youtube for videos covering a whole bunch of mods, including some great ones on graphical mods. He also covers mod installation, including for ENB\u0027s he has covered. Watch his installation stuff all the way through before you start, then follow along. ENB\u0027s require SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender, watch Gophers video on it).\n\nThe program LOOT helps you load mods in the correct order. I find that NMM prevents it from ordering my mods, so I run the program and then do it manually. Probably just the way I have things setup though.\n\nSome of the mods I use (some of these are more immersive than graphical):\n\nClimates of Tamriel (weather, outdoor lighting)\n\nConsistent Older People (fixes some elderly people not having old people bodies)\n\nEnhanced Blood Textures (fairly self explanatory. Note special uninstall instructions)\n\nEnhanced Distant Terrain (better low res terrain textures)\n\nLush Trees and Grass (fuller foliage)\n\nPrince and the Pauper (better clothing for children matching their station)\n\nPure Waters (one of many mods that beautify water)\n\nRealistic Lighting Overhaul (I no longer use this. Deals with interior lighting)\n\nEnhanced Lighting FX (I use this instead of Realistic Lighting. Same type of mod, however ELFX removes most/all ambient light from interiors and dungeons)\n\nSupreme Storms (bigger and better storms)\n\nWaburgs 3D Paper Map (this map has no clouds, and shows all the paths. I use texture 2)\n\nWearable Lanterns (my game is super dark. This allows me to wield a shield in dungeons instead of a torch)\n\nWet and Cold (I think this is the one that makes you drip when wet)\n\nI also run Realvision ENB and SkyUI (better user interface), both of which require SKSE.\n\nI can\u0027t embed steam pictures, but my game looks like this at it\u0027s best:\n\nForest Glade - [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386008302](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386008302)\n\nSun in Clouds at Dawn - [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242736269](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242736269)\n\nWhiterun at Night (RLO) - [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242271941](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242271941)\n\nWhiterun at Night (ELFX) - [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405267696](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405267696)\n\nAnd no, I don\u0027t travel at night.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T18:11:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:19:25Z","Content":"I really need to buy this game..but may need to delete others first to make room (don\u0027t worry, KSP is staying)"}]}
