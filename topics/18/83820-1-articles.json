It is easy to get into the game in those first few months where anything you want to do is only going to take a few days to reach, but after that it will start taking weeks to months to fly a new ship or increase your stats and a lot of people lose interest at that point.

It\u0027s a mental failing of being sheltered that I need to get rid of. Not only that, but it stunts my psychological growth. I\u0027m smart for people of my age, but if I don\u0027t push myself to my limit because of laziness or fear of being wrong, I could pull a mental tortoise and the hare and be off even worse than failing. Even if you have all of the knowledge, experience, and ships that one could know about in EVE, one still will never be in absolute control of any situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://25.media.tumblr.com/acf3f65dc1ca040896fbc97987787246/tumblr_n1h5banOQE1rn4ocio1_250.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_n1h5banOQE1rn4ocio1_250.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will die in EVE, probably a lot. I have quite a bit of common sense, and glad for that as my ordeal might not be as severe as others, but I want to put my money where my mouth is and prove myself wrong, as I can\u0027t foresee every trap, gank, and scam.
