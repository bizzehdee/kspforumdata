In the game, I started inside a sort of cave, like the Bat Cave. There was a front entrance, that was very near the starting point, and a back door that was a little farther away with some windy twists in between. I was there in the main chamber. This is something I\u0027ve never seen in a video game: there was an avatar of me. It looked quite a bit like the rl me. Strewn about the main chamber of the cave were various work stations. In one of them was an off-line robot. A ten-foot tall hulk who could only talk at the start of the game, and even that only when I turned on his work station. Think Cyborg from Teen Titans, only slower and much more relaxed. And kinda stoopid, but really friendly and charming. He helped guide me along.\n\nAs I\u0027m figuring out how the different work stations worked, enemy units started arriving. I don\u0027t remember anything about the enemy except in one match they were identical to my units and in another match, they were different. Fortunately I got my robot working in time for him to take out the few small enemy units probing my base. The robot had the biggest damage spike in the game, very good armor, and quite decent dps, but he is slow and you only get one. If he dies, he cannot be replaced, but can recover if only wounded. My avatar on the other hand, had decent armor, mediocre hp and dps, but was fast. If this unit dies, Game Over.\n\nThe other workstations around the cave created other units of various types, or had support functions. I remember quick little flying drones and some medium sized units. Maybe 5-8 different unit types in all, and maybe 3 or 4 support stations. One of the units was a turn-on-and-forget flying unit whose sole job was to follow and protect me, physically blocking the enemy\u0027s attacks and also firing back. One of the units looked like a quick little flying version of the basic solar panel from KSP. If you could get two or more of these things flying, they would generate a field of sparks between them (shaped like a tennis net), and any enemy that touched the field took heavy damage. And I remember I kept losing cuz I was always playing defense, never leaving my cave. There was no mining or harvesting of resources. It was like everything was powered from free electricity, but you only got a fixed (but upgradeable) amount of electricity per second to use to create your team. So you couldn\u0027t do everything at once - you had to choose a path. And the work stations took time to create or upgrade something. The goal was to either destroy the enemy base or kill the enemy\u0027s solitary human avatar. There was a lot of coordination possible between the various units -- various synergies available depending on if you could get the various units online and upgraded appropriately. But not too complex, there was only 1 upgrade available for each unit -- except the robot who had 2. His lumbering, friendly personality was the coolest part of the game. With each upgrade, he became more invulnerable but slightly slower.\n\nAnyway, it was a really fun dream, and I thought some of you might enjoy reading about it, and one or two of you might even be inspired to think about building such a game. Well, maybe in my dreams :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T15:00:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T14:42:40Z","Content":"It could be a dream of the future when you make that game."}]}
