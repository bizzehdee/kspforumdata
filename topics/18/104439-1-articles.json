Sorry. \n\nAnyway, I found [this](http://www.howopensource.com/2012/10/install-nvidia-geforce-driver-in-ubuntu-12-10-12-04-using-ppa/) page which may have what you are asking for. It is a rather longer and more complicated than most of what we have been suggesting, so I shall not try to translate the process here. It appears that it will enable you to ge more up to date drivers using PPA. It also, however, appears to have some potential problems affecting the entire computer\u0027s usablilty, so probably you should take that into consideration if you try to follow it."}]}
