Historically speaking, it was a name given to a planet that was inferred to exist between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun. Naturally no such world exists, but that fact combined with the provenance of the Roman God always left me with an impression of a place made inhospitable by heat and violent geological upheaval. Needless to say such things do not apply in anyway to the deep freeze that is the Kuiper Belt. All I can figure is people really love Star Trek and they must have thought this was their chance to undo what had been done in the 2009 feature film. Whatever the motivation, I can\u0027t bring myself to agree; incidentally my personal choices were Acheron and Lethe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T00:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even know Pluto \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E any moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T00:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SuperWeegee4000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SuperWeegee4000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t even know Pluto \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E any moons.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has quite a few IIRC, it\u0027s even considered a binary system by some with it\u0027s biggest moon Charon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T13:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Charon is really big compared to Pluto.
