I had to report a player for griefing and harassment on a different game a few days ago. The response i got back from game officials floored me. I need to know if my thoughts are correct and that THEY are factually wrong or something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirstly lets establish a definition, one that in my experience seems (until now) universally applied.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGriefing:\u00A0Griefing within the context of online gaming refers to the manifestation of antisocial conduct exhibited by gamers towards their counterparts on the same gaming platform, with the primary objective of deriving personal gratification.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, this is just a broad definition but it works. So, in the game (i mentioned it here a few posts back) there are a few mechanics that kick in at the death of your character/dinosaur.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. A portion of your growth (experience points) are deducted (typically 1/4 to 1/2 bar) which at adult will rescind your adult status back to sub-adult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. 1/4 of your marks (skill points required to purchase abilities or cosmetic changes) at time of death are deducted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Any rested growth bonus is rescinded. (Bonus of 2x growth rewarded)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. With the exception of your first two quests (locate a home cave and find a waystone ((used to teleport fellow players to you at a waystone)) and if carnivore your hunt x critter/herbivore) all quests are forcibly failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. You are randomly forced to a new location on the map. This can be fatal to your dinosaur all on its own. Some dinosaurs run out of stamina fast and regenerate it slowly. Some metabolisms will starve faster than others. Those 2 combined if rng places you in a bad spot you WILL starve before you locate food. Also spawning in a pvp hotspot can be lethal as well, especially to juvenile and adolescents.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. a kill of a fellow player rewards a trophy only if the dinosaur that died was an ADULT. Juvenile, Adolescent and sub-adult dinosaurs reward their opponent 0 growth, 0 marks and 0 trophies. Adults reward 0 growth, 0 marks and again only a SINGULAR trophy that any player may grab (fastest player to react to the kill gets the trophy if they grab for it, its rewarded in full upon entry to homecave and claiming it from a menu).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll players know points 1-6 very well. Griefers use this knowledge to harass and grief juvenile/adolescent dinosaurs for personal enjoyment and to try to provoke an explosive response in chat. When such a player is confronted they deny this aspect and say you know you will get killed so shut up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reasons a player would target a juvenile/adolescent is for griefing and harassing purposes. Lack of skill or fear of attacking fully functional sub adults/adults as well, but that plays into harassing and disruptive griefing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow given this rather long explanation lets get to my report. I was growing(leveling) a sauropod dinosaur called Amargasaurus. I was in the juvenile stage when I went and failed to see a ledge. I fell and died. Given I have 0 agency to choose my respawn location I was at the mercy of rng. I spawn in and to my horror a \u00A0full adult Pycnonemosaurus was near me. A juvenile (or any age tbh) Amargasaurus is slow. The Pycnonemosaurus decided to target me. Why? Because an ADULT Amargasaurus is a major heavyweight and will do extreme damage, but a juvenile is helpless. So, taking points 1\u0026amp;2 into account the player chose to impede and disrupt my ability to play. I was able to identify the player and reported them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to what the OFFICIAL response was:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfficial servers have no gameplay rules, but must follow our Terms of Service you can find here (link redacted by me).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, here we are at what Id like opinions on:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Official servers (typically, generally, normally) are where the game studio hosting the online multiplayer experience would have rules players are expected to follow. Yes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Terms of Service or the End User License Agreement are a legal set of rules players/users must adhere to to use a given games online service correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. This is taken from THEIR OWN Terms of Service, its bullet point 7 under License Limitations:\u00A0attempt to, or harass, abuse, or harm, or advocate or incite harassment, abuse, or harm of another person, group, including (redacted by me) employees or (redacted by me) \u00A0customer service representatives;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(note i am only redacting the company name)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt clearly indicates in this bullet point abuse/harass or incite or attempt to incite the same. Griefing a player IS harassment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave I suffered a stroke or brain damage? How do they say we players must obey the TOS but yet there are no rules?? Their own TOS forbids harassment and griefing yet taking actions designed to impede and disrupt a players play knowing the cost their deliberate disruption will have is somehow not griefing and harassing when other games would and DO treat that kind of action as griefing/harassing?

If no one has ever admitted to doing this (you say when asked if this is the case these players deny it), it\u2019s hard to believe that is the case. It could simply be that they enjoy killing juveniles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, that doesn\u2019t mean it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be okay, I\u2019m just saying that unfortunately such behavior seems completely legal under the game\u2019s TOS. You would need to prove they are doing so to provoke an emotional response from players but you said they don\u2019t admit to doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo a lot of players believe that is the case whenever a juvenile is killed? Even if that may be so, the circumstances make it hard to prove.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, I suppose the nature of the situation may work as circumstantial evidence. For example, in War Thunder combined arms battles, it is common that when you destroy someone\u2019s tank, they respawn in an aircraft and bomb you. There is no direct evidence this was done for revenge- the most opportune target might have been coincidentally the same person they got killed by- but at the same time, it\u2019s generally agreed that when that happens it is for revenge by the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you go at it from an angle like that when you reported them? If you simply said \u201Ckilling juveniles is griefing\u201D, if the reporting system is very limited (maybe all you can do is select a type of offense and send it, IDK), perhaps this is why they rejected it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut on the other other hand, I can see how such an argument would be hard to sell. If part of the fun aspect of the game isn\u2019t just leveling up your dinosaur, but playing as it (which in the case of a carnivore or omnivore would involve hunting), killing is just a part of the game people are supposed to enjoy, and that would include targeting juveniles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat game kind of sounds \u201Cgrindy\u201D. Players can be vicious in such games.
