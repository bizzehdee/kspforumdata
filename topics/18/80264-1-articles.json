I am a happy camper if I get a good hours with of game play and have to restart the game due to memory or mod useage; but the real kicker is the number of parts existing in the game no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I am opting now for not having exuberant space stations everywhere and bases on planets and moons; for all I know it could have been a screen resolution issue; I didnt try HDMI mode in normal mode without Open Glide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost gamers should not have to go thru what I have gone thru to get this game working on a good note; but I am still here cause I like these lil Kerby critters and I am still looking for kuargs and sctuff like that; it is the MODS that make this game what it is; an awesome Alpha Modded Space SIM (not a game but a SIM OR simulation; I like SIMS but I dont play the SIMS lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am opting for less parts in space, quicker missions ie get the Science and come home; maybe small outposts but not elaborate bases; I have yet to try MKS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this new version v24 AND/OR my screen resolution will work I dunno; I have no idea now where my KSP game crash point is, and I got a Kerbal in space still waiting to be rescued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize for some rough language in my streams of late and I am deleting them; sometimes I just lose it; more times it seems than any other game; but I still come back; why (?); cause I like SIMULATIONS; games like FSX and Falcon 4; where accomplishments mean something and creativity is diverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to keep reminding myself of other aspects of this game exist besides the simulation it stands for; I have seen this in other streamers\u0027 games; and sometimes it gets a laff or 2; sometimes it doesnt; and sometimes you want to chime in and help.
