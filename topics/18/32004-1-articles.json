These are scary, entertaining and you must think what to do next. Like amnesia. The game makes you really feel scared, then confortable, and than again scared. Not like short horror story\u0027s. For example slender, one time WTF:huh: and than it is just slender. That gets bored I think. Penumbra is different in that, it is always something else, and you don\u0027t get too scared so you don\u0027t play it anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are lots of indie horror games, sometimes you will find a good one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not someone who really knows horror games.

There was a horror game I\u0027m vaguely recalling in which your avatar was a young girl on a steampunk-y airship. It was haunted, but the only way you could see the ghosts coming after you was with a camera you were carrying around. Ghosts would show up in the photographs; finding out they were places you didn\u0027t expect, or hoped they wouldn\u0027t be, was much more terrifying than so much of the \u0022make you jump\u0022 horror stuff I see out there now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warscribe","CreatedById":58388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T21:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmnesia : The Dark Descent had enough immersion to be seriously terrifying both in the action parts and the non-action parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFEAR had also a good amount of great scares (except for 3, which was garbage).
