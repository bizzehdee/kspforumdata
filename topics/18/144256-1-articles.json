Basically, I\u0027m part of an organisation in which we need a way of chatting (text) in a group, but the nature of it means it would be nice for the chat to be moderated, with only certain people having the ability to add and remove people. Ideally, it would be able to run on iOS, Android and Windows phones, and be free. I\u0027m fairly sure I\u0027ve seen one around, but I just can\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions welcome\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T18:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIRC with a channel that\u0027s invite only?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T22:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscord works great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-23T18:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal Space Program was using skype group chats while I was still with it. \u00A0I don\u0027t know whether it was moderated or not, but it was free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-24T03:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222688320\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469299422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139256\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mad Rocket Scientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Mad Rocket Scientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal Space Program was using skype group chats while I was still with it. \u00A0I don\u0027t know whether it was moderated or not, but it was free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey still use it but have mainly switched to Discord because it is better in absolutely every single way in the universe\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkype isn\u0027t moderated but Discord is, it has permissions and different text snd voice channels and lots of other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
