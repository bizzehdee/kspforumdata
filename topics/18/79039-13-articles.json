I managed to get some momentum going at first by accepting missions from here. You want missions that are within your capacity to complete with your Sidewinder and reward anywhere between 10,000 to 30,000 credits (just not the Mercenary tasks). Take on a couple of less rewarding contracts to keep you going, too, it all helps. I recommend the courier missions, or those that ask you to go and recover something like a black box or rebel transmissions from a nearby system. Just be careful not to get caught by any police ship scanners or you\u0027ll likely get fined if you\u0027re caught carrying illegal/stolen cargo. Once you\u0027ve got enough money behind you, say... 150,000cr, you should look at buying a new ship that\u0027s more suited to what you want to do. The Hauler and the Eagle will be prime candidates here as they\u0027re almost dirt cheap. The Adder may also be a good choice, though I\u0027ve never owned one. Buy either the Eagle or the Hauler and you should still have some money left over to kit them out a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow come the career paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBounty Hunting:\u003C/strong\u003E My profession in the game. Master combat rank. I\u0027m a multi-millionaire with a fully kitted-out Cobra MkIII because of what I do (~10,500,000cr in assets with ~2,700,000 in the bank). The Eagle is the ship you want to start with here, preferably armed with pulse or burst lasers (fixed are generally more powerful than gimballed but do require a good aim); multi-cannons, while pretty powerful, will start racking up a bit of a cost in ammunition and limit the time you can spend out and about taking down criminal scum. Your primary hunting sites will be Resource Extraction Sites (RES\u0027s), though Unidentified Signal Sources (USS\u0027s) and Nav Beacons will also produce wanted targets, just not in as great a quantity as RES\u0027s. Typically, bounties will be on Sidewinders and Cobras, and will be 1000-5000cr and 8000-25000cr respectively. Occasionally you\u0027ll encounter heftier targets that you\u0027ll need a better ship and equipment for before you should even consider opening fire, although that goes without saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep going at an RES for a while and you can rack up some impressive claims. I can get around 100,000cr in half an hour, plus more in other jurisdictions thanks to the Kill Warrant Scanner (a piece of equipment that you \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E want to acquire at some point should you opt to join the ranks of the hunter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA word of warning; most Anacondas have a Plasma Accelerator mounted on their bow, so watch out for incandescent purple-white bolts. They\u0027re very dangerous weapons. Pythons (they look a bit like Anaconda-Cobra hybrids) will also often carry the weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETrading:\u003C/strong\u003E A lot of people swear by this. I\u0027ve not had much success with this myself but that\u0027s only because I haven\u0027t found any good trade routes. You\u0027ll want the Hauler here, equipped with as much cargo space as possible and stripped down in other places where you don\u0027t think you need stuff (this\u0027ll save on fuel costs and increase your jump range). You will need to find a good route, so study the pretty multi-coloured trade routes in the Galaxy Map, flicking through the different commodities listed to see which system exports/imports what. Then take a test run to see if it works out and if it does, how profitable it is. If it\u0027s good, keep going. If not, keep looking, taking on some Bulletin Board missions just in case you need the money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also trade routes along which you can transport rare items. I can\u0027t think of any such systems, though somewhere earlier in this thread, someone posted an example route, so I\u0027d highly recommend looking it up. Rare commodities will fetch you a pretty penny the further from their origin they are sold off, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also include smuggling here as you will, every now and then, come across some stray, owner-less items just sitting there, usually at USS\u0027s (though RES\u0027s will often have cargo dumped by fleeing pirate ships). Scoop \u0027em up and don\u0027t get sniffed out by the police, then sell them on the black market. It\u0027s pretty easy, actually. Just watch out as not every station has a black market. Always a profit unless you get caught.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExploration\u003C/strong\u003E: Whilst technically I\u0027ve not explored new territory, I\u0027m at the Scout rank in this field simply because I\u0027ve travelled through quite a few systems that no-one has bothered charting. There is a decent profit to be made here, but you need a ship capable of jumping far and efficiently, plus you will need a fuel scoop for missions of extended duration. The Asp is the quintessential exploration ship of the game, though it\u0027s expensive, usually at ~6,600,000cr. I believe the Adder is a starter exploration ship, though I\u0027m not certain of that. Strip your ship down as much as possible except for the Frameshift Drive, which should ideally be top notch. You will want the best Discovery Scanner you can get your hands on (you start with the Basic already), plus the Detailed Surface Scanner. Given that you\u0027ll be outside inhabited space for the most part, you may decide to sell your weapons off to further decrease your mass and improve your jump range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cobra is a good choice of ship in this role, actually. My fully kitted-out one can manage a ~19LY jump unladen, and it\u0027s built up for combat. Strip down the modules other than the FSD and it\u0027ll likely manage much further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel scoop is where things get risky. You need to get close enough to a star to automatically activate the scooping process, but obviously you have to watch the heat levels carefully. Get the hang of it, though, and you have access to free, unlimited fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be time-consuming to explore every facet of a star system, but well worth it in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously you\u0027re not tied down to any one profession once you start something, and I\u0027ve not covered everything there is in the game. You could be a pirate, a miner, or even enlist with the Federation or the Empire. Do something that you know you can get money in, then give something else a try to add some variety. I\u0027m going to get myself an Asp once I\u0027ve got around 25,000,000cr in the bank and head off to explore somewhere.
