There was this little restaurant in Palau, St. Michel\u0027s. The owner was actually a retired American sailor. He had been stationed on the Orion, fell in love with the area, retired, moved there, married an Italian girl, and opened a restaurant. Best seafood I ever had. We would get off of the liberty barge on the pier in Palau, and there would be this line of fishermen on the pier. If you waited long enough, you could follow one of them up the street to one of the restaurants and watch him sell his catch to the cook at the back door. You would order a plate of steamed mussels and clams, and they\u0027d be a big as your thumbnail. You\u0027d go to jail for serving those in the United States. But, tender, like butter. Just amazing. Fresh calamari, caught fifteen minutes before they served it, right off the pier. Never had anything like that anywhere else in the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently tomorrow is chicken marsala.
