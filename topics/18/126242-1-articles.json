Really nice to see a closer to hard scifi tv series. Sure there where a few inaccuracies. but all in all a very promising series.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T13:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just watched it as well, and while it didn\u0027t follow the book exactly it was good to see some hard sci fi on TV. I think they missed a good scene with the protomolecule, it was really hard to see and not very scary. I am adjusting expectations on the characters and what they look like, and the pacing seems a bit off, but I think these are all fixable things or will lessen over exposure. Not sure why they needed the Indian UN lady to be so hard assed, maybe they are speeding up the story line on discovery of the protomolecue, it doesn\u0027t really gel with the image of her in the book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
