Like Achilles, he will be remembered as long as men and women walk this earth, and perhaps beyond. And, in the true style of heroes, when his life came to an end seven years later, he died the death of Icarus, in the cockpit with the stick in his hand. Which certainly beats dying in an old folks home with a tube up your nose, wrinkled, forgotten and smelling of urine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-11T21:24:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2016 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWatch the language, please.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T16:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s stunning how far we have come since that day!
