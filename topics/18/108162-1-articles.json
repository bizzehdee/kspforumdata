PC Gamer magazine put it on their 10 most relaxing games list and said this about it...\n\n\u0022Take On MarsThis slow-paced simulator sees you exploring the surface of the red planet with a variety of rovers and landers. The missions don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get any more exciting than \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153probe some soil\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, but the feeling of being alone on a distant, lonely world is palpable. The howl of the Martian wind as you trundle through the dust creates an evocative atmosphere, and the sedate pace of the rovers makes for a strangely hypnotic experience.\u0022\n\nDon\u0027t expect a game that you can just pick up and play for a few minutes at a time though, driving rovers around Mars is WAY slower than it is in Kerbal. It\u0027s a very unusual game (well, more of a simulation than a game) but makes a nice change of pace every now and then. I\u0027ve not tried the latest multiplayer updates but there\u0027s that aspect to it also."},{"CreatedByName":"Ledenko","CreatedById":57833,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T08:51:59Z","Content":"They\u0027re working on manned scenarios now, there are survival aspects and I don\u0027t honestly know how fleshed out it is beacuse it\u0027s pretty janky (daily dev build).
