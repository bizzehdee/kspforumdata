He\u0027s supposed to track and relay all information accurately, yet he is also supposed to lie to the astronauts about the real mission. What would a human do in this case? Probably just pick the 1 they prefer. Hal comes up with a solution that fits both, kill the astronauts and there is no need to lie to them anymore and he can go about his programming routine as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I always thought the way it read was meant to convey the fact that any normal human would probably go crazy being isolated for that long. The fact that Dave see\u0027s this too, yet still manages to come through, points to how strong his character is. Making him a shining example of our species, and thus, deserving of his transformation.
