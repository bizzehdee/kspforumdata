I like your picture of the moon! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess it\u0027s one of those 650-1300 mm f/8-f/16 sold under brands like Wallimex or Opteka here in Germany. If you look for a good and cheap lens for astro stuff, I guess this is not the way to go. Astrophotography seems to be unforgiving and demanding. A quick google search seems to show a lot of complaints about colourfull fringes and lack of sharpness for this lens. Astrophotography has hard contrasts and those problems will show up a lot. Sadly, you get what you pay for when it comes to lenses for (D)SLRs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the aperture (f/8-f/16, depending on the focal length) is just horrific. In general, a smaller number (= larger aperture opening) collects more light in the same time, so you will be able to get more light on the sensor before the time gets too long and the earth\u0027s rotation blurs your image. For \u0022normal\u0022 photography with such a lens, your exposure times will be very long, and you will very likely be unable to take pictures without a tripod even in bright daylight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get somthing \u0022tele\u0022 to use in astrophotography and want to go cheap, I would rather buy an old, used 135 mm f/2.8 (larger aperture, smaller aperture number) off ebay, with an M42 adapter to screw it on your camera and experiment a little. Those go for 30-50\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC. Much longer focal lengths won\u0027t get you more stars on your pictures if you don\u0027t have a mounting that can correct for the earth\u0027s rotation, and a 135 mm lens is still quite usefull for everyday pictures in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally use the cheapest lens Canon offers, the EF 50/1.8, for my pictures. It\u0027s \u0022only\u0022 about 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC, and it\u0027s got some problems near the edges as you can see in my photos. But it\u0027s a real winner for the price, very sharp in the center of the frame. I also find a lot of use for it for nice portraits in low light, where you can use it without the flash unlike the default 18-55 3.5-5.6 because it lets more light in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: It thought about my advice for a 135 mm for astrophotos, and I now think that\u0027s neither here nor there -- it won\u0027t be able to get you any \u0022interesting\u0022 pics of the moon or the planets (I tried on Jupiter and you can see the moons, but no details on the planet), and it\u0027s about the longest focal length I would try without any kind of guidance, I think. So if you want to go and get something cheap for your camera, I would try and stick with star field photography with 80 mm or less, that should be rewarding and might teach you a lot.
