Is it ludicrous too. How many deaths due to terrorism has the western world seen in the past 10 years? A couple of hundred, a few thousand maybe? Just in the US alone, well over 400.000 people lost their lives in traffic in the same period. We are not even talking about Europe. Yet we do not even think twice about getting in a car. But when it comes to a scare that is way, way less likely to hurt you, everyone goes to DEFCON 1 when \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/08/government-knocking-doors-because-google-searches/67864/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomeone Googles two terms\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe really need to calm down and get our act together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T03:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T03:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone here is suggesting that this sort of injustice is a good thing, but you\u0027ve got to admit that there is a pretty good silver lining in this young man\u0027s cloud. And to suggest that the response is only a circus is overly cynical, IMHO. People are very likely reaching out because they can empathize with him.
