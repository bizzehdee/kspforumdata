I found it made little difference in how well the game looks (as in - it still looks good with the graphics turned way down), and the only thing I can\u0027t get at all is the re-entry flames, just the ship heating effect. The gameplay is, of course unaffected by the graphics quality. I do use several mods in my games, too.
