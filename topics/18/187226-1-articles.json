Admittedly this will be a rough job as I am \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an educator but I have taken several classes (previously a pilot ground school course and am currently taking a class to become an Aircraft Mechanic). So this is going to be a bit imperfect but I am excited to give this my best shot and teach anyone who wants to know more about flight mechanics and real world aviation. Outside input from those who do fly or work with aircraft is always welcomed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m simply posting here so those on this forum interested in joining these classes. I\u0027ve got a poll going on decided how I will be presenting these lessons, so if you want to vote on how- you can join the discord and the link to the Strawpoll poll is in the #announcements channel. And I\u0027ll post any announcements and decisions about it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-19T17:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those interested- the classes will begin on October 1st.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
