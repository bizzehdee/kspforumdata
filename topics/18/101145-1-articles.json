I\u0027m curious if anyone has ever done the same?\n\nFor example my head series of Enterprise starts on The Enterprise E in the present day the day before the anniversary of first contact. The characters would be sitting there thinking about the Events of star trek first contact and reading the historical account of what happened, there would be things in there about how great Cochran was a visionary and so forth, then the characters would say something about how history views things through rose colored glasses they would make references to how he was really motivated by greed and was a drunk most of the time. Completely opposite to federation values, they would wonder things like did the history books ever record him as he really was and if they did when did it change and why.\n\nThat would inspire Riker and Data to start digging through history to find the answers to the questions. Doing so would lead them to the historical accounts of NX-01 which is where the series starts in Ernest.\n\nBasically the entire series would be saying this is what the history books said happened, but this here what you are seeing is what really happened in all it\u0027s gritty detail.\n\nFor Voyager what I would change is instead of the journey home it would be a character journey, Janeway would be a by the book captain who finds the notion of doing things Picards or Kirks way inconceivable (I\u0027m using it correctly right?) and personally thinks they should have been kicked out of starfleet for the actions. She shares a similar view of the maquis Over the course of the series she would learn that not everything is covered by a regulation and that kirks method of command is necessary she would also learn that the maquis had good reason to do what they did as she sees results of federation decision making in other places with the worst case scenario happening again and again.\n\nThe series would also focus on New guy harry kim, fresh out the academy and filled with federation ideals. If they wouldn\u0027t have gotten trapped in the delta quadrant He would have eventually joined the maquis. Essentially over of the course of the series we end with a Harry who has the motivation and courage to force things to change in the federation.\n\nWith Kes the idea is that she\u0027s a visual representation of Janeway\u0027s decision. Over the series things would eventually come to light is that the ocampa were the victims of severe genetic tampering, due to reasons obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of biology and math. Eventually they would hear news as to what happened to the ocampa a few weeks after the array was destroyed the Kazon managed to dig down to them and kes is the only known survivor. (The Kazon have energy weapons shooting at the ground from orbit is a simple matter.)\n\nThat brings us to the next point The Kazon They would be remade into tragic villains they would have shared a star system with the trabe and eventually developed warp drive first, the trabe on the other hand developed powerful weapons and shields first, along with bio weapons and so forth. Through subterfuge a bio weapon would have been deployed on the kazon homeworld and they would have been made slaves, save for the single warp capable ship they built before it happened. Their rise to power again would happen 100 years later the descendants of the crew of the first ship finally have the tech to free their people. The slave kazon on the other hand would only have the stories of what they were. Due to tampering from the trabe chemical suppressants and such.\n\nThe revolt would end with the free kazon sacrificing themselves to free the others and the others stealing the tech and becoming what they are now. Their story arc would eventually uncover the tampering the trabe caused to make them slaves. Their actions are caused by chemicals and such, eventually voyager would find a way to reverse that and they would go on to become the best allies voyager has.\n\nI could never decided what to do with Neelix but best I can come up with is that the maquis would hold him responsible for being the one who trapped them in the delta quadrant, he was the guy who started shooting at a peaceful negotiation and at the time voyager had no reason to not trust the kazon the remaining events of caretaker were caused by his actions. The only reason why he would be allowed to remain on voyager is because kes requested he stay. Over the course of her story she would see his true colors and break it off with them. Neelix stories would involve him trying to weasel himself into positions where he had power while members of the voyager crew are trying to stop him.\n\nChakotay and paris stories would eventually make them come to realize they\u0027re not that different and they would reconcile. Tuvok would start to wonder if stopping the maquis really is the logical thing, The doctor would remain largely the same no point in fixing what\u0027s not broken. Torres would eventually rein in her temper.\n\nSeven of nine stories would be a better journey, for one the catsuit would be gone once the medical reason for needing it is gone (there was a medical reason.) and she would wear a proper uniform.\n\nThe final season would be building up to endgame, all the things they had in Endgame would be spread over a season and a few would change. Instead of changing history just cause she\u0027s have a real reason, during the 23 years it took to get home paris and torres child would have been assimilated during a borg encounter. The attempts to retrieve her would have lead to the deaths of Chakotay, Seven, and a dozen other crew members.\n\nThat\u0027s all I can think of for huge changes, other small things I would change is that crew deaths would be a rarity so that when it happens it hits hard.\n\nThoughts? Or post what you would change."},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T13:06:59Z","Content":"You seem to have watched pretty much of it despite you calling it bad Star Trek series.

Personally I liked Enterprise the most because of how much more gritty it was, they didn\u0027t have the all powerful Galaxy Class starship of TNG, or the incredibly advanced ship of Voyager (though I did like the character development of Janeway and the ragtagness of the series). It was more down to Earth and felt more relateable. We got to see Star Fleet from its infancy and see the Vulcans in a new light. To me it really felt like they were boldly going.\n\nOne of my main gripes with the series as a whole was how much its budget showed. Especially the CG.

If the voyager writers would have taken the time to think about things before they decided to write them the show would have been allot better. Like the whole Holodecks have an incompatible power source from the rest of the ship. Seriously? Of all all the excuses you could have used to allow holodeck stories that\u0027s the one you choose? Why not have it that the power source can supplement the ship but Janeway is pragmatic enough to realize that taken the holodecks offline is going to be bad for crew moral, this way your holodeck stories can still happen and it\u0027s something that doesn\u0027t spit in the face of NASA engineers. Who at their peak took a square peg and made it fit in a round hole using only what supplies Apollo 13 had in the capsule.\n\nThen there\u0027s the whole Neelix cooking thing.

They **started out** as technological scavengers who only cared about acquiring advanced tech; in \u0022Q Who?\u0022, where they were introduced, there was no hint of assimilation, for example. Babies were grown in vats. It was clear that they didn\u0027t care about the Federation or its inhabitants; they only wanted the *Enterprise*.\n\nAssimilation was mentioned for the first time in \u0022Best of Both Worlds\u0022, where it made one of the best two-part episodes of the entire franchise. But they only assimilated one (influential) person. By *First Contact*, it was decided that entire races would fall before the Borg juggernaut -- to the point of becoming an end in itself, where technological \u0022prizes\u0022 weren\u0027t as valuable as assimilating. (They stopped the technological development of the human race **for the express purpose** of assimilating them, erasing the very technology that drew their interest in the series!) It was no longer \u0022to service us\u0022; it was \u0022to be part of us\u0022. They went from being something that didn\u0027t care about humans to something that cared about humans (if only as prey). It turned something thought-provoking into a zombie movie. By the time you got to *Voyager*, the Borg didn\u0027t even have the ability to analyze or think independently; if they couldn\u0027t assimilate, they were powerless (e.g., Species 8472). They were neither a threat nor a source for fascination; they were a farce. And that\u0027s because \u0022too many cooks\u0022 had their own rules for how the Borg work.\n\nIt\u0027s worth noting that once they moved some of Roddenberry\u0027s big obstacles out of the way (e.g., \u0022No conflict among crew members\u0022), there was room to create interesting stories. I\u0027m arguing that this \u0022too many cooks\u0022 problem is something that could be solved with a clean-up and reboot, much as Roddenberry\u0027s big obstacles were.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T18:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nikolai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:26:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This makes no sense.

It\u0027s those that we\u0027re discussing, not the realism of the fiction."},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:44:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But the Borg are an excellent example of the \u0022too many cooks\u0022 problem I\u0027m talking about! They **started out** as technological scavengers who only cared about acquiring advanced tech; in \u0022Q Who?\u0022, where they were introduced, there was no hint of assimilation, for example. Babies were grown in vats. It was clear that they didn\u0027t care about the Federation or its inhabitants; they only wanted the *Enterprise*.\n\u003E Assimilation was mentioned for the first time in \u0022Best of Both Worlds\u0022, where it made one of the best two-part episodes of the entire franchise. But they only assimilated one (influential) person. By *First Contact*, it was decided that entire races would fall before the Borg juggernaut -- to the point of becoming an end in itself, where technological \u0022prizes\u0022 weren\u0027t as valuable as assimilating. (They stopped the technological development of the human race **for the express purpose** of assimilating them, erasing the very technology that drew their interest in the series!) It was no longer \u0022to service us\u0022; it was \u0022to be part of us\u0022. They went from being something that didn\u0027t care about humans to something that cared about humans (if only as prey). It turned something thought-provoking into a zombie movie. By the time you got to *Voyager*, the Borg didn\u0027t even have the ability to analyze or think independently; if they couldn\u0027t assimilate, they were powerless (e.g., Species 8472). They were neither a threat nor a source for fascination; they were a farce. And that\u0027s because \u0022too many cooks\u0022 had their own rules for how the Borg work.\n\u003E \n\u003E By contrast, once they moved some of Roddenberry\u0027s big obstacles out of the way (e.g., \u0022No conflict among crew members\u0022), there was room to create interesting stories. I\u0027m arguing that this \u0022too many cooks\u0022 problem is something that could be solved with a clean-up and reboot, much as Roddenberry\u0027s big obstacles were.\n\nI\u0027m going to agree with you on that. The Borg could have been an impressive villain for voyager if they would have though things through, the ironic thing is most of these points could have been avoided if they would have taken the time to write an essay on the universe."},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:59:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going to agree with you on that.

Thank you for pointing out that this isn\u0027t just a Treknobabble problem -- it\u0027s a problem that tends to reduce complex, thought-provoking, and multi-dimensional alien races into one-note stereotypes.
