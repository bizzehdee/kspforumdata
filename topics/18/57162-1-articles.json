That means no stealing or killing innocents. If I accidentally do something that ruins my reputation, I go back to a previous save and try to avoid it. However, some of the plotlines in Skyrim force you to do bad things, and naturally I had some resistance to playing the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves\u0027 Guild questlines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a friend convinced me to give them a go, and I\u0027m glad I did. Those two plots were my favorites in the game, and you can still play them fairly honorably, because the people you\u0027re robbing/assassinating generally deserve it. And you meet some of the most fascinating characters the game has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my first go through Skyrim I played a stealth archer, with no magic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/9169964197_3452fb3594_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229169964197_3452fb3594_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was fun.
