Yes, 25k dollar is a lot of money, but if you actually have to pay salaries, that evaporates very quickly. Most people do not realize that what gets put into their bank account as employee is, in a lot of countries, only a portion of what the employer actually pays in insurances and other governmental fees. I know that around here, the factor is a little under 2 (about 1,6-1,7). So if you earn 2000 dollar a month, you costs your employer 3400 dollar. Your income tax still gets deducted from that 2000 dollar. That is without any housing or operational costs, so giving you an office, electricity and a computer to work with will add another fair sum of costs to the equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have applied some corrections.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much all (modern) games are expensive to make.
