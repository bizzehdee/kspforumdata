But, in the last year, I\u0027ve forced myself (through the lack of more stories in the listed categories) to explore the other available franchises and stories. And the one thing I\u0027ve discovered is that I have an \u003Cem\u003Eextreme\u003C/em\u003E weakness for this particular plot (In Sci-Fi terms):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA human character of the present day, recent past, or near future is whisked away to a distant and strange part of the universe where they befriend a weird and alien group of people (usually aliens or extraterrestrial humans) and eventually find their place in this strange new world, over time becoming a hero and ultimately accepting this alien land as their home.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stories that have caused me to become aware of this obsession are, to my knowledge: \u003Cem\u003EEmpyrion\u003C/em\u003E, by Stephen Lawhead, and the TV series, \u003Cem\u003EFarscape\u003C/em\u003E (please no spoilers, I\u0027m only partway through Season 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis weakness has been a part of me for a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E time, but I\u0027ve only recently become aware of it. I believe it\u0027s because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m a lover of the romantic. Not exactly, \u0027romance\u0027 romantic, though my loneliness does make fictional romance a guilty-pleasure of mine. The mentioned stories are epic in proportion (at least to me, anyway).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMy aforementioned loneliness and dissatisfaction with the lifestyle I currently have (not yet an adult, and so many miles away from civilization that I never had a chance of being able to socialize) leads me to desire the protagonists\u0027 situation in a way that allows me to relate far more with the protagonist than with any other show.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, in all my years of watching \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EBattlestar Galactica\u003C/em\u003E, I\u0027ve never really connected with the characters. Sure, I had my favourites, but I never really felt like I could put myself in their shoes. Whereas the character of John Crichton has sucked me in so heavily that I find myself subconsciously mimicking some of his mannerisms every time I finish watching an episode -- it\u0027s like I\u0027m a little kid again, it\u0027s amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFarscape\u003C/em\u003E has really brightened my life up, I now look forward to watching an episode or two or three every day. My only regret is there\u0027s only four seasons! Of course, I haven\u0027t finished Season 2 yet, much less the series, so I don\u0027t know if the ending is \u0022All Good Things/What You Leave Behind\u0022-level satisfying and tear-jerking, or comparable to \u0022These Are The Voyages\u0022 -- but please don\u0027t tell me, I want to enjoy these moments myself before I start reading reviews and see all the episodes I loved being picked apart to the nano-level and condemned for a slight that I didn\u0027t notice originally but can\u0027t unsee afterwards. Personally, the Season 1 wrap-up arc was awesome enough, and this show doesn\u0027t shy away from doing weird and awesome things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFarscape\u003C/em\u003E and similar stories are a major weakness of mine, one that brings me lots of joy, and I\u0027ve only just discovered it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
