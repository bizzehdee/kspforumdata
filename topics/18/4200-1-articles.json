The stages delivered to the moon later have their own navigation systems, allowing them to be docked to the station without an EVA being performed. The initial one has a very basic system, only enough to deorbit itself after being jettisoned. This might seem like a lot of effort to replace the module, but it won\\\u0027t be needed very often as the amount of delta-v needed for stationkeeping is minimal, provided you are in a good orbit.

Still, I believe the project can stand, at least for Kerbal standards. Four RS-68 would give a comfortable 1.56 TWR at launch: they might be even overkill, actually, considering the late stages of the launch (strongly G limited...) Three units would be quite feeble at the start, and both solutions probably approach a zero payload to orbit: but moderate boosting with SRBs should recover it. In the end, three LFE and a ring of strap-ons would probably fly, with the payload fraction required for man-rating provisions (airlocks, Whipple shields etcetera)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
