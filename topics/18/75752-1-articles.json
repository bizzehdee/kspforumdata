He said 3 stage: the boosters, orbiter, and ET. I said 2 stage, boosters an orbiter. I normally don\u0027t count boosters as a stage, but since the space shuttle is different I do count them. I don\u0027t found the ET because it doesn\u0027t do anything, it is more a part of the \u0022second\u0022 stage (orbiter) to me. But it got me thinking: What do you count as a stage? Do you count boosters and dropped tanks, or just the main stack?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, wat is your definition I a stage?
