Gemini has always been a favorite of mine, because that\u0027s when we really learned how to fly in space. The astronauts didn\u0027t like being treated as essentially payload in Mercury, so the Gemini capsule was built to be to be flown by a pilot and the interior is arranged like an aircraft cockpit. In some ways it was more advanced than Apollo, which had begun development earlier. If I had to pick one mission as the coolest it would be Gemini 6/7.\n\nFor unmanned missions, for me the coolest is Curiosity. Using a rocket-propelled skycrane to land an SUV-sized rover on Mars was an amazing technical achievement."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T23:39:31Z","Content":"I\u0027ll put a vote in for Apollo 15.
