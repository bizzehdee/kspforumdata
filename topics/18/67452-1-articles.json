However, we have no FTL engines and no FTL communications. Everything happens at light speed or slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the early game while you are in the solar system, most things happen relatively quickly because it is all close by, orders only take \u0027hours\u0027 instead of \u0027years\u0027 to get anywhere. As you begin to colonize outside the solar system though, the main point of the game comes to the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ships will be traveling from Earth to some other star, as they get further and further away communications lag gets longer and longer. Eventually the ship in question may actually leave your ability to communicate with, in which case it will proceed on its mission to the best of its abilities without your input. Maybe it succesfully reaches the target star and colonizes, in which case several hundred years later it may have developed a society advanced enough to build a large enough communications system to re-establish contact with Earth. Or conversely, they could slam right into the planet and die, leaving you to forever wonder what happened to the poor citizens of the USS Roanoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is more to the game, but Brewer does a pretty good job of talking about it in his videos and is quite responsive to questions asked to him via the messaging system at Kickstarter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo check it out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMazon Del\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T22:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am definitely going to be following this!
