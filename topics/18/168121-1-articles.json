Let me give you some advice...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFind an outdoor hobby\u003C/strong\u003E - I chose hiking. Every Saturday, from 8 until 1, I went hiking in one of the area\u0027s numerous state parks. If I did the trail under the time I set aside, then I went and had lunch at a favorite restaurant before heading back to my graduate housing apartment. I did this through my Bachelors, Masters, and Ph.D.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFind a place to escape that\u0027s accessible\u003C/strong\u003E - This is the place you retreat to when you need a couple of hours away. Again, for me it was off campus and I either went to the IHop or even to a mom-and-pop ran bookstore and coffee shop. This helps to fight the brain fatigue when you\u0027ve been studying or working on a research project for days (or hours) on end.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFind a hobby that\u0027s put-downable\u003C/strong\u003E - This is for those moments when you need thirty minutes to an hour to get your brain untied. This was a suggestion I didn\u0027t know about until I was working on my Ph.D. and it was recommended by a Japanese student who lived next door. She did origami for her quick hobby. I decided to explore drawing. In fact, I still draw, especially during this time of the semester.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAm here if you need encouragement or to vent... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
