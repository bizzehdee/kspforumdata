I don\u0027t remember the model, but the specs I do. It has an Intel HD Graphics card, Dual-Core P6100 processors at ~2.4GHz each, 4GB of RAM, and 64MB dedicated memory. IL-2 1946 runs smoothly most of the time. Realflight G5.5 normally is at 20FPS\u002B, and that is about as low as it goes. FSX, at 1024x768 screen res runs okay, with lowered ground detail/ground traffic. KSP, I play at 1024x768 screen res, using Mr_Orion\u0027s settings file. Aside from SM3 generation and the new part shaders on, everything is off.
