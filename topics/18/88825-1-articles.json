I wanted to pick some people\u0027s advice on this subject who have done college and/or have a career now. So I am 24 years old, I\u0027ve been in the website development/computer programming industry for almost 10 years now since high school! My work is picking up more (including getting hired by a nice company remotely this year!) and more but I always wanted to finish college and get my bachelors degree to be \u0022official\u0022 and have some job security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m am around junior year at Penn State (I\u0027m a transfer student I\u0027ve gone to two other colleges in the past including community) for an information systems technology bachelors. Here is the problem I wanted to ask people\u0027s advice about. I am, I hate to say it, bad at math. I am straight A student, made the deans list multiple times, and I have almost 100% in everything this year except for math. I just suck at it, or maybe it\u0027s a mental block. I am struggling in algebra alone and the bachelor of science for IST requires me to take math up to calculus. However, Penn State has a new program now for a \u0022bachelor of art\u0022 in information systems technology. It is basically the same exact, four year degree with almost the same exact classes except they cut out all of the math courses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know anything about a bachelor of art vs. science, specifically for information systems technology? I\u0027ve been doing my homework on it already. For one, I really just want to finish college, and I don\u0027t know if I care if I have a science vs. art degree. On the other hand, I heard the science degrees are a little more serious and prestigious than a bachelor of art, and even pay a little more. I would still be qualified for most if not all jobs with the degree, just I will lack the \u0022science\u0022 aspect. But I kind of want to be a \u0022scientist\u0022 and I think I would like that merit that comes with the science major.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have some sound advice for me? This thinking started after my math midterm I had yesterday. I thought I was going to bomb it but I actually passed! I\u0027ve passed two math courses already (not including an economics which I also passed). Now I kind of feel like pushing through and going for the bachelor of science. Something about an \u0022art\u0022 degree just doesn\u0027t sound serious, but I don\u0027t know. Any advice/opinions is appreciated towards my academic endeavors. Of course, it\u0027s a bit decision and I\u0027m not just taking advice from anyone, but I would like to hear some outsider point of views.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregA","CreatedById":126788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T06:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would say...

In fact, of the seven guys who work in my department, only two of them are under 30. So, not sure where you guys are working, but my experience has been very different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the degree goes, what I have observed is that the bachelor\u0027s degree has become the new high school diploma. Employers don\u0027t care where you got it from, or what your GPA was, or many times even what your major was. They just want to know that you went to college for four years and received a degree. If you\u0027re serious about moving up in a specialized field, what you really need to worry about is your master\u0027s degree. So if you want to go places in IT, start looking around for good master\u0027s programs that match your desired career path, and make sure that your bachelor\u0027s degree program meets their requirements for admission. Then plan on spending at least another two years and tens of thousands of dollars on school after you finish your bachelor\u0027s. It sucks, but that\u0027s the reality today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpending a ton of money on a bachelor\u0027s degree from a private, high-profile university is a total waste of money, there are hundreds of thousands of un/underemployed college graduates who are living proof of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T20:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheSaint\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.Joseph Kerbertson","CreatedById":57354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T21:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBachelors in Science... unless you want to work at a university or plan on becoming a teacher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T23:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EColbert has a [honorary] doctorate in fine art so it can\u0027t be all bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, it depends on what you want to do and what science you are interested in. From my [limited] experience in chemistry, much of it seems to be understanding the concepts and plugging in numbers. Once you figure out what stoichiometry actually means in reality, you might be able to logic out what variable goes where, then plug in the numbers. Same with gravimetric analysis, etc. Otherwise it appears that formulas can suffice for the rest of the math, and so long as you get a good understanding of concepts you might be fine. This is coming from one with only 25% of AP Chem done as of now, so take this advice with a grain of salt. I don\u0027t know what else Chemistry will entail, perhaps somebody else can inform us if it is significantly different than the basics I mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: If you have decent logic, memory and critical thinking skills, Chemistry shouldn\u0027t be too hard.

I think he\u0027s talking about switching programs from a Bachelor\u0027s of Science in Information Technology to a Bachelor\u0027s of Arts in Information Technology. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s talking about switching majors, just from a B.S. to a B.A. I don\u0027t think that a hiring manager is really going to care about whether you have a B.S. or a B.A., unless you\u0027re applying for some highly competitive employer like Google or Microsoft. But depending on what you are doing in IT the math may come in handy. If you want to go into infrastructure you won\u0027t need the math as much, but if you\u0027re going to be a programmer you will need good math skills.

And then, quite suddenly, you discover you can put those rules together and your Kerbals are standing on the Mun!
