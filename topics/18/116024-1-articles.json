Tough to say exactly how it was put together, but ultimately it was recorded to video and published that way.\n\nI was into .midis way back in the \u002790\u0027s, but with everybody having high-speed internet and huge hard drives, as well as good audio compression (.mp3, .aac, .ogg, etc.), the chief advantages of the format (uber-small file size) are largely unimportant anymore for consumers.\n\nStill very important for musicians transferring work amongst themselves, though.

Most people think they sound terrible, but that\u0027s because of the crappy FM synthesizer chip computers generally come with. My computer back then had a soundcard with wavetable samples, and MIDI\u0027s sounded fairly realistic (though I remember it never could do a really convincing guitar). I would load them up in Winamp (remember that?) and leave them playing in the background.\n\nIn the mid-90\u0027s I had my own personal web page, and I had a section on there where I posted up the best MIDI\u0027s I had, maybe around a hundred of them. Then one day I got an email from the Harry Fox Agency demanding that either the MIDI\u0027s be taken down, or I pay a mechanical reproduction fee that was something ridiculous - IIRC, something like $36 *per download*. So, that was the end of that. Kids these days, with the iTunes and the Pandoras and the Blueteeth, may not realize that at one time the music industry actively fought to keep music off the internet."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T03:43:02Z","Content":"remind me that old hdd sector boot wiped with over 10 000 mp3 ; ) rip my old hdd never mind now we have you tube, ru tube, daily motion etc ...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T04:15:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0027\u0027**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T06:27:37Z","Content":"Wow!
