For reference, modern model locomotives can be purchased with DCC controllers, allowing digital commands to be sent through the rails to command individual locomotives, rather than the old way, where you divided your track into electrically isolated \u0022blocks\u0022, and just powered different blocks to power whatever locomotives were on that block, in a completely analog fashion. Sound refers to a DCC controller with a speaker and flash memory to store sound samples of the real locomotive the model is based on. The digital controller simulates the sounds of starting and stopping the engine, idling, revving up, applying brakes, blowing the horn or whistle, or ringing the bell, and so on... Some DCC sound controllers are so detailed, that they simulate little things like the air compressors that charge the air supply for the \u00A0air brake sand such, or simulate radio chatter.\u00A0It\u0027s actually pretty amazing they can pack all that inside a model with a frame as little as 8-12mm wide!\u00A0Modern technology is an incredible thing, but that level of tech is expensive...

In this thread, someone posted \u003Cem\u003E\u0022A BL-2 with sound\u0022\u003C/em\u003E. For reference, modern model locomotives can be purchased with DCC controllers, allowing digital commands to be sent through the rails to command individual locomotives, rather than the old way, where you divided your track into electrically isolated \u0022blocks\u0022, and just powered different blocks to power whatever locomotives were on that block, in a completely analog fashion. Sound refers to a DCC controller with a speaker and flash memory to store sound samples of the real locomotive the model is based on. The digital controller simulates the sounds of starting and stopping the engine, idling, revving up, applying brakes, blowing the horn or whistle, or ringing the bell, and so on... Some DCC sound controllers are so detailed, that they simulate little things like the air compressors that charge the air supply for the \u00A0air brake sand such, or simulate radio chatter.\u00A0It\u0027s actually pretty amazing they can pack all that inside a model with a frame as little as 8-12mm wide!\u00A0Modern technology is an incredible thing, but that level of tech is expensive... Not cause it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E expensive, but because it\u0027s a captive market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy complaint... The flash memory is a \u0026lt;$1 part, and the microcontroller is \u0026lt;$5, even in single quantities...\u00A0I bet the whole board costs under $15-20 to make, but costs $85 to me. Really hoping the open source community steps up! They\u0027ve already got the control station and track power, plus accessory decoders figured out... Just need locomotive scale decoders now, both with and without sound functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m off on a tangent. Back to the BL-2.

The one that I tend to rant about is a job at a testing lab. We test food, water, cosmetics, soil, and other goods and materials for all manner of contamination and characteristics... microbes, heavy metals, caloric content, etc I work in the microbiology department. My job includes preparing sterile media and sterilizing and disposing of tested samples. Basically, we prepare the sample containers by lining them, filling them with measured amounts of water, and adding the growth media to the containers. Those get loaded into an autoclave, which is basically a giant pressure cooker with a cart that roll into the chamber on rails. The media is sterilized to a temp of 122\u00B0C @ 17 PSI and then we store it. Other sections of the department\u00A0add samples to the sterile containers and incubate them. after an incubation period, they take samples out of the containers and swab them on petri dishes for\u00A0further incubation to do visual colony counts and microscopic examination,\u00A0or they load them into specialized machines that can detect the presence of bacteria by detecting specific DNA markers directly. After testing, samples are returned to my department for sterilization and disposal. They are fed back into the autoclaves, which kills anything growing in them, and then they are disposed of. Food liquids and soft solids go into an in sink disposal, and solids go into the trash. We also clean the reusable glassware in my area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe positives are that the job is very flexible in my hours, and there is a nearly nonexistent level of discipline or consequence over things like arrival time... As long as the work gets done, it\u0027s all good. I have NEVER in all my life seen anything like their level of flexibility... People have tried to quit (five times is one dude\u0027s personal record), and been retained with \u003Cem\u003Enear pleading\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0In my five and half years there, I\u0027ve only ever witnessed two firings... One over theft, and one over directly getting into an argument with an upper manager. As long as I come in sometime within the first half hour of when I\u0027m expected to be there, all\u0027s good. If I somehow sleep through my seven alarms (yes... I\u0027m not a morning person), or something comes up and I don\u0027t call in, I\u0027ll generally get a call asking if I\u0027m coming in or if I\u0027m feeling well.\u00A0The department manager has always been flexible with start times, cause as long as things get done by the end of the day, it\u0027s all good. If it takes me an extra 5 minutes to scrape the ice off my car, I never sweat it. If I need to run to the bank before work, I just do it. If I wake up groggy and just can\u0027t get moving... And I take an extra 10 minutes to get ready... Oh well. They often times have let other people shift their usual start time by 40-50 minutes, just to let them work around taking kids to school, and such. They\u0027ve always been so flexible!\u00A0Theres also the issue of overall job security. When there are only ever 2-3 people in your area, and you have the most knowledge and experience, and the job itself is not manufacturing, but service, and much of it testing for government standards... You can be assured that save for a tornado or flood leveling the place... There will be work the next morning. The company is growing, though they are doing so at the expense of things like... Oh, employee raises and edging more work out of the same workforce without adding new people. They rely heavily on the seasonal interns that come out of the college in town, or migrating the soil lab workers into other areas during the frozen season. The issues seem to stem from new people at the top level. I won\u0027t discuss the details of internal things like that here (nor will I ever discuss customers or goods tested). The past year has been incredibly trying... I\u0027ve definitely been burned out, and the work and hours have been crazy lately... but that confidence in knowing my job is secure is very overpowering.\u00A0That\u0027s why I put up with it. If I didn\u0027t vent, I\u0027d probably go crazy.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second job is actually much older, and carries over as a direct successor of my \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal\u003C/em\u003E career. After I graduated college, I started working for an electric motor manufacturer called Motion Control Group (MCG, formerly QMC - Quality Motion Controls). I specifically worked for their Tachtronic Instruments division (TACHtronic, not to be confused with TEKtronix), which specialized in DOD/Aerospace motors and synchros. In 2006, the TA division was brought back into the main MGG building. In 2007, a company called AMETEK bought MCG and by 2008, announced they would close our plant and move the products they wanted to keep out to North Carolina and Pennsylvania. My last day there was at the end of September of 2009, right as the worst of the economic recession was happening. I got a job at Gamestop two days later, and worked there for peanuts and video games till that store closed in January of 2015. Seriously though... I was there for the discount! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0One of my supervisors at MCG had seen the writing on the wall and had built his own machine shop a couple miles out of town, on his country property. The shop was basically a miniature version of MCG. Much of what they did, he could do, just at a smaller scale. He acquired a few products from AMETEK that they didn\u0027t care for taking, and he hired me once he started operation in January of 2010. That job is GREAT! Much of the work, I am able to do from home, in my own workshop. I get paid $20 an hour to solder stuff. If it were full time, or even part time with more consistent hours, It\u0027d be a dream job, and the only one I\u0027d need, but while business is booming right now, work isn\u0027t always consistent. It\u0027s entirely dependent on customers actually ordering product. I\u0027ve gone as much as 4 MONTHS with no work from there at all. Granted, it\u0027s been a long time since that happened, but whether the customer will order more product after an existing order is fulfilled is always a gamble. I can\u0027t base my livelihood on it. I CAN make it into a GREAT supplemental income though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, is that when things ARE booming, and I can put 20\u002B hours into that job in a week, I have to consider that I\u0027m already pushing 35-50 hours a week at the lab, and over the past year, a department that typically had 3-4 employees was being run by me and one newbie. That\u0027s it. It was grueling. I\u0027d often put in 9-10 hour days, Monday through Saturday. They screwed up the schedule as well. Microbes don\u0027t take Sundays off, and we used to have a rotating schedule where you got alternating weekends and Mondays off, and at least one three day weekend each month. They ditched that because there were no longer enough employees in the department to distribute around that schedule anymore, so they just canned Sundays, and now we do two days of work on Mondays. \u00A0Cause, you know...

I\u0027m on a good health insurance program right now. Problem is, I only qualify to buy into it because I don\u0027t qualify for any employer provided insurance. If I went full-time, I\u0027d qualify for employer provided insurance, and no longer qualify for this decent insurance. It\u0027s worth it to me to give up other full time benefits, for good insurance. Problem is, it feels like the company almost goes out of it\u0027s way to take advantage of my part time status. They push more and more hours out of me, ask me to come in earlier and leave later... But I don\u0027t get PTO or any benefits matching. I don\u0027t get holiday pay. None of that. Even my bonus his year... I\u0027ve put in more hours than i\u0027ve ever worked before in my life. I\u0027ve bent over backwards for them... But my bonus was less than 1/3 of what others got, what full timers got. Was all my efforts not good enough!? I put in the same amount of labor. I\u0027m just disgusted by it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, it snowed, then rained, then snowed again... True to form, I did some off the clock testing. Turns out gravity still accelerates my backside toward the Earth at a rate of\u00A09.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, and the coefficient of friction is reduced when interface material is sub 0\u00B0C crystaline H\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003EO, and the other material is my shoes. I broke my fall with my right knuckles and a bag of \u003Cs\u003E\u00A0 chips \u00A0\u003C/s\u003E crumbs. Aside from trying to keep the \u00A0centimeter long wound on my knuckles from getting infected, the left front side of my abdomen, and my neck both feel like I pulled something...
