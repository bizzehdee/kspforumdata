The hoppers freeze their motion and turn off their AI if you go too far away, and then turn it back on when you return. You must have flown away from it after it jumped up, and then flown back to find it still up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be plenty of creatures capable of handling at least a bit of space. For instance, trees which grow a seed pod high up into the planet\u0027s gravity well before letting it burst, scattering seeds far and wide across the planet, as well as off into deep space, allowing it to spread all across the galaxy wherever those seeds may take root.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Probably some basic ullage simulation in that you won\u0027t be able to fire the engines while upside down in enough of a gravity field, but beyond that everything is pressure-fed, so it\u0027s not as much of an issue. Most fuels will be hypergolic and not need ignition sources, and simple electric sparkers can suffice for non-hypergolics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T23:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill there be any sort of armor options for spacecraft to protect from Hoppers/three-legged-dinosaurs/acidic-space-trees/starbuilding-alien-civilizations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill there be any sort of story?
