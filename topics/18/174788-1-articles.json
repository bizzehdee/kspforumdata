I have not registered with amazon and don\u0027t really want to. I got the wifi set up and went to VRV and crunchyroll etc to watch some anime... I noticed you can\u0027t watch it despite the webbrowser. Are they supposed to be able to block video sights if you are not registered with Amazon..? Anyone else deal with these? Does this do this to everyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Ok apparently crunchroll is working(besides a lack of flash player) but VRV isn\u0027t. Have they had problems with credentials or do some sites get blocked by kindles?! I can access it last I tested with my desktop but not the kindle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is it a problem with flash... It\u0027s a shame you have to register with amazon to even use the store.. It needs a free repository like in normal linux for basic stuff. Then make the store seperate for payed items. I would think they would sell more kindles and possibly software if they were nicer to the customer and didn\u0027t try to force things. Unless the software is that bad.
