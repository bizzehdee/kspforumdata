I think I got quite a few good rolls because I didn\u0027t have any catastrophic loses. What I tried to do was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Do all possible missions with Mercury. That is, Suborbital, Orbital, EVA, and Duration B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Gemini, do all duration missions FIRST. This would mean I only needed to have one Launch Pad for the first few launches until I unlocked the Moon probes. When Practicing docking, I only used the Agena test vehicle because it could be launched on an Atlas and because it is cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: When I got to Apollo I kinda just rushed to the end with the minimum amount of missions needed so I can\u0027t really think, of anything special I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I tried my best to do was make sure my pilots had 4 in whatever skill they were assigned to.

Too many.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few of the things I thought were strange were the high reliabilitty of rockets and the low reliability of spacecraft when historically it was the other way around. Also, the fact that one only ever gets a 1% increase in reliability for a launch all but eliminates unmanned flights as practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 80% reliability for Mercury it\u0027s honestly almost suicide to do anything but a suborbital and then orbital flight. The Soviets are almost always going to be the firsts to get a man in space so one must weigh the options of doing the extended and EVA missions on Mercury or wait for Gemini.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best tip I can give is to get the most possible from your Gemini Program. Try to run a Pioneer/Ranger program concurrently with your Gemini endurance missions. Assuming you don\u0027t do endurance with Mercury, you can get endurance B-E taken care of while simultaneously launching Pioneer Missions. Then do some docking and EVA missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile running your Endurance missions, get a 4 astronauts minimum and train them in docking. Having high capsule skill is a plus, but not nessesary. The key is to have those astronauts doing your docking missions when you start them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said previously, I think the key to winning lies in project Gemini. If you can get good at docking and Evas while advancing in the Apollo/Saturn vehicles, you can afford to take a hit with Mercury/Explorer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T21:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmpsterMan, you don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve unleashed.
