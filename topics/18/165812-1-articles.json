It\u0027s a multiplayer game where players pilot mechs of wide varieties and complete objectives against other players on the opposing team.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been a fan of MechWarrior for quite some time, from the second game and beyond. As such, I\u0027ve dabbled somewhat in MechWarrior: Online. I have a few issues with it, most of which are geared to the lack of singleplayer/instant action modes, but I\u0027m hoping that they might rectify that with MechWarrior 5, if it gets released. I admit I\u0027m a bit excited, it\u0027s been so long since MechWarrior 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently in MechWarrior: Online I have just two mechs, a Blackjack and a Warhammer. I had to really grind for that Warhammer. At this point I\u0027m debating whether or not I should try to improve it. I could upgrade it in various ways, but they\u0027re very costly, and that would involve more grinding. Maybe I should stick to MechWarrior 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo does anyone else play MechWarrior: Online, or any MechWarrior game, for that matter? If so, which games/mech designs are your favorites? I\u0027m particularly partial to the Warhammer and the Timberwolf/Mad Cat. I don\u0027t know why, exactly, they\u0027re just cool looking to my eye. And as for my favorite game, it\u0027d probably be MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries with the MekTek Mechpacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, if you\u0027ve got any screenshots or stories to tell, please do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-25T02:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried it a couple times. I very much like the concept of Mechs, along with cool looking armour, but I\u0027ve never really gotten into the game. I did have Mech Assault for Xbox. I\u0027ve found the online game to be rather difficult to get used to. The gameplay is a bit fast, the UI a bit confusing, and the combat a bit disorienting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that I don\u0027t think I could get used to it if I really tried, but I\u0027m already a big World of Tanks player, and not hot on the idea of putting in the time and energy to learn another game like that. Basically, I\u0027ve put in my time and worked through the grind of one game already, and I don\u0027t really want to \u0027start over\u0027 in another game anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as designs go, I\u0027d have to say the Summoner is easily one of my favourites from playing Mech Assault.
