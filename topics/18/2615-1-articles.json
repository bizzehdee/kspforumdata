This is a full game, with an extensive single player campaign and fully integrated multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen playing this for 10\u002B years now, never gets old. It was one of the first 3D RTS games of its time, and has a very unique style of gameplay. Rather than have a limited number of pre-configured units and support structures. Warzone instead starts the player out with next to nothing, and the only way to advance is through research of technology. The game puts a lot of emphasis on artillery, air support, and unit design. Design your tanks and aircraft as you see fit in real time, choose the weapons, armour, and propulsion to fight your way to victory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbiter Space Flight Simulator\u003C/a\u003E, a space flight simulator.

While KSP takes a more relaxed and arcade like approach to space flight, Orbiter does the opposite.
