If instead you measure mass in pounds, distances in miles and time in hours, then your result is going to be in pounds miles/hours2 The value is going to be different because the measurements are different but the real result is the same. You can convert those values just fine. Just keep in mind that the standard says that Newtons is kg m/s2 so if you want to present the result in standard form but you do the measurements using a non standard form, you have to make the conversions after you get the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that was clear and I didnt say anything stupid (I am not a scientist =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T15:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use different units as long as you change the other units to have the equation balanced. In F=ma, normally, F is in Newtons (N), m in kg, and a in m/s/s. If you want F to be in kN (1000*N), you would have to either make m in tonnes (1000*kg) or a km/s/s (1000*m/s/s), but not both. Either way, you are multiplying both parts of the equation by 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epic DaVinci","CreatedById":58581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T16:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankyou Everyone, your replies helped a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
