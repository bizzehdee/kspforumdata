I grew up in the country, so when I moved into the city it took a while to adjust to the noise that never really stops (though it\u0027s actually not to bad). At some point in University though, I found that when I was having trouble sleeping if something was on my mind that putting something familiar on the TV (like Family Guy) helped me sleep. That eventually morphed into a set of headphones built into a headband that I can sleep with, and I have my phone play tv for me while I sleep. I\u0027ve been doing it enough that I have a really hard time sleeping without it anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for fans, I can\u0027t stand the sound of a rotary fan like that. I do have a tower fan though (transverse) which I use in the summer a lot. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s quieter, but I find the noise more pleasent. It\u0027s also logistically easier since the tower fan can blow from the foot of my bed where there is nothing to put a desk fan on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T04:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edepends, when I had room mates, I had a fairly loud but steady tone fan that was pretty much always on. I get distracted by little things I can almost hear, so it makes it near impossible for me to fall asleep if I can almost make out conversation, or if I can fully hear it as then I get distracted by following the chat. I can\u0027t sleep through a tv. Even if im tired enough I pass out unwillingly due to trying to see the end of a movie while tired, i\u0027ll be awake again inside 30 minutes as soon as the noise changes significantly. Sudden gunfire, or the end of, or the credits roll, commercials, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe steady drone of the fan eliminates the random noise and replaces it with a steady white noise, and that I can sleep to easily. Fans that are twisting/alternating/rotating will drive me bonkers, I can hear the little motor alternating back and forth, and if it clicks at the end of each rotation..... I loathe analog clocks at night, I can hear the damned things form a surprising distance, and can\u0027t sleep through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif I have to put up with such a clock, a fan is a godsend, assuming it can be made to make only a steady drone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T04:04:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T04:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there\u0027s almost always some sort of noise in our surroundings, so it makes sense we become accustomed to it and percieve it as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I could fall asleep with it on regularly...neither our house nor the dorm I\u0027m in have air conditioning, so any humming is usually coming from a broken appliance.
