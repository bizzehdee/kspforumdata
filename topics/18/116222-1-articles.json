Goddard was his name,\n\nbut his was surpassed by others of fame.\n\nThe rocket operated in the atmosphere at first,\n\nbut it has been shown that that wasn\u0027t it\u0027s worst.\n\nMercury, Apollo, Nike, and Zeus,\n\nwith gravity Man had signed another truce.\n\nAll of the horizons on Earth were on chart,\n\nSo the new horizons of space were the place to start.\n\nThe rocket came to Orbit first,\n\nbut it persisted and persisted like an ancient tomb\u0027s curse.\n\nTrans-Lunar Injection was the next step of the game,\n\nand Landers soon brought 3 men great fame.\n\nLanders would bring great fame again and again,\n\njust as long as pumps would pump and liquid engines ran.\n\nLanders have been sent to the Moon and to Mars,\n\nSatellites dance and waltz with the stars.\n\nSpace junk and old hardware abounds and abounds,\n\nbut there is no janitor to make the rounds.\n\nLanders soon brought an old, trusted friend,\n\nA new car called a Rover was the means to an end.\n\nThe end was new Scientific discovery and innovation,\n\nNew things to help peoples of all nations.\n\nRovers were sent to the moon and mars,\n\nThe men who drive them are the unknown stars.\n\nBut now, something new, something difficult is here,\n\nThe story travels from ear to ear.\n\nA satellite has been sent, not to Mars or the Moon,\n\nIt had to get to a further place, and it would get there soon. \n\nNew Horizons is her name, and it really does fit,\n\nWith the ships and the vehicles that came before it.\n\nIt started with Sputnik, but more have come,\n\nAnd now New Horizons is on it\u0027s run.\n\nIt has gone to Pluto, and will go places more,\n\nIt may be like Voyager and have much more in store.\n\nMany beautiful images have also been sent,\n\nAnd from it to us via radio they\u0027ve went.\n\nNew things, new science, new goods, new lands,\n\nThese have all been discovered and powered by Human hands.\n\nInnovation and Technology was there from the start,\n\nOf all human invention it is the heart.\n\nAnd as long as Humanity explores the Universe day by day,\n\nScience and Technology may it never betray.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T06:06:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T07:10:17Z","Content":"A copy of KSP"},{"CreatedByName":"livefree75","CreatedById":111756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:15:13Z","Content":"Maybe this image:\n\n![pluto-new-horizons.jpg?1321915587](http://i.space.com/images/i/000/013/482/i02/pluto-new-horizons.jpg?1321915587)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T17:21:09Z","Content":"I agree, 5 years is rather short.
