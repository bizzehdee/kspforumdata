Abrams is a blundering monster who strangles puppies for fun, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could refute these point by point (as others have done), but that would be a massive waste of time. Instead, I will simply say this: I\u0027ve been a life-long trek fan, and it is clear to me, as it must be to any reasonable observer, that the J.J. Abrams reboot has been the best thing to happen to Star Trek in nearly 20 years. Remember that back in 2005, when Star Trek: Enterprise was canceled, it wasn\u0027t just that particular show that was ending; the entire franchise had just about run out of steam. So many spin-offs had been made already, there didn\u0027t seem to be any way to move forward and preserve the essence of what Star Trek was while attracting enough viewership to make the whole thing worthwhile. Star Trek was \u003Cem\u003Edead\u003C/em\u003E. Then in 2009 the reboot came out and suddenly Star Trek was back, and it was good, and popular, and most importantly it had an exciting future ahead of it again. And it really was \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E, from the first moments of the film, I remember feeling like I was back in a very familiar place, even though there were strange new aliens and gratuitous lens flares and spaceships with almost TARDIS-like mismatches of interior space vs. exterior extent. I disagree with some commenters in that I really feel that this new Star Trek has heart, it really is about likable characters and human stories, and it preserves the optimism of the original show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027m not saying there aren\u0027t flaws, there are. From wonky sets (it doesn\u0027t matter how hard you try J.J, a brewery is still a brewery!), to wonky science (how the hell does a black hole absorb all the radiation released by a supernova that has \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E happened?), to the fact that every planet is somehow just a few minutes of warp flight away, there are certainly issues that should be pointed out and things that could have been done better. But I hope anyone who decides to tear apart these new films will take the same critical view of the older films and series, because the honest truth is they had faults too, some of which were quite serious. I mean, why do we need a Lt. Barclay appearance in Star Trek: First Contact, can\u0027t that guy just go away, like forever? And in the original show the Enterprise encounters another god-like alien entity every week, which is implausible, and the first episode of The Next Generation, \u0022Encounter at Farpoint\u0022, is weird, and in Generations the whole Nexus-caused time-loop thing doesn\u0027t make sense, and Kirk just gets killed by a collapsing bridge after a total of maybe 30 minutes on screen. Not to mention Star Trek The Motion Picture and Star Trek: Insurrection are boring. Don\u0027t get me wrong, they\u0027re interesting, but you have to admit, you really don\u0027t want to watch those if you\u0027re sleepy. And what\u0027s this silly rule about not showing the ships upside down? I\u0027m very glad J.J. Abrams broke that one in the first film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI very much liked 2009\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E, and I just saw \u003Cem\u003EStar Trek Into Darkness\u003C/em\u003E today and thought it was a terrific Trek film, well worth the 4 year wait. But if you didn\u0027t like them please remember that the rest of the franchise is still there, and thanks to these new movies a lot more people will be watching it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I\u0027ve heard many people call it \u0022nuTrek\u0022, is that the popularly accepted term?

That really grinds my gears, if you get the reference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T18:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nutt007\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nutt007\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI liked it.
