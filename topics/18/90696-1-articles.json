Stand up to your bullies. Fight them. It will make them realize you aren\u0027t worth it, and make them realize you aren\u0027t weak and won\u0027t just stand there. We cannot rely completely on society to deal with bullying as we cannot rely on the police to deal with crime.

Confrontation doesn\u0027t always work, but sometimes it does. Calling them out on their bull mess can cause more friction, but it can also show their own insecurities and often times rally people to your cause. The more people the bully bullies, the more folks will step forward when someone has the intestinal fortitude to stand up to them. Standing up doesn\u0027t always involve fist to cuffs, but be prepared (it\u0027s only a temporary pain, and you\u0027ll feel so much better that you stood up for yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Involve authority figures. You have parents for a reason, they are there to stand up for you when you can\u0027t.

The principle has a boss, they answer to someone and all campuses have adopted zero tolerance policies in regards to bullying.

You find common ground. Adults tend to communicate as opposed to chest thumping. If I have a problem with someone or something they did, I let them know. I don\u0027t go behind their back.
