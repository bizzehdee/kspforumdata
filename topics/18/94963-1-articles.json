I\u0027m looking for an RPG to get into but after a half a dozen games, I have yet to find one that gets me. I figured the large gamer community we have here can point me towards some things I haven\u0027t found yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got into Firefall and I still play that on and off. The big selling point there is the gameplay is very much about player skill over accumulated in-game skills. Anyone know of anything else out there like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to get into TERA, which is somewhat like that, but I just couldn\u0027t get into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any suggestions, I\u0027d love to hear them. I\u0027m rather open on theme. My price point is $30 or less (no subscriptions, F2P is good). I prefer things that don\u0027t have auto-targeting (manual aiming). I personally value player skill\u0026gt;in-game skills, but I know thats hard to find, so far from mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T05:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of RPG are you looking for?
