I\u0027ve already gotten as fast as possible with one account and an autoclicker, and firing the cannons any faster would require friends consenting to do it or some Windows 10 BS. I\u0027ve chosen the Windows 10 BS route. Is there any way to, say, type \u0022Hello World\u0022 in one notepad window and have it appear in the second window in real time? I\u0027m experimenting with alt accounts and I don\u0027t feel like running the game on a bunch of seperate PCs so I\u0027ve decided to run several instances of the game on one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-09T20:03:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2020 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Kernel Kraken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T09:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout double checking, it sound like job for Autohotkey, your friendly neighbour automation tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-11T03:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223800376\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591782738\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout double checking, it sound like job for Autohotkey, your friendly neighbour automation tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m actually using autohotkey for the autoclicker, believe it or not.

And said program gets to decide whether or not to \u0022trap\u0022 the key or allow it to have it\u0027s default behavior (if any) - Once the active window traps a key, the buck effectively stops there.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows might quite possibly detect any means of interception as a possible (even if false) attempt at data theft. Microsoft is rather poophole about security, with perhaps good reasons, (most of the time) so they make it intentionally difficult to have various programs stealing inputs from each other.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the only way to achieve \u003Cem\u003Etrue\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0multiple-focus typing would be to write software that does so at a driver level. Unlike regular (so called \u0022user mode\u0022) programs, drivers can do pretty much all they want with your computer (though there are still various restrictions even then), which is why Windows makes such a bit fuss about whether or not you really, really, no really, I swear I won\u0027t break it, mom! trust your software provider when you install a driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasier perhaps would be to have a script that rapidly alternates between windows and retypes what you just wrote. Though this would make for some awkward flickering if it ran on each key, I expect.\u00A0 It\u0027d also have to be able to receive inputs even while on the background, which might be troublesome if any programs you\u0027re using makes a point to capture and trap all inputs (games usually do this, especially when running in full screen)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this would work perhaps only some of the time, depending on what particular combination of programs you\u0027re trying to multi-type into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are ways to do it - but I don\u0027t think any are anything you could call \u0022trivial\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, mind that if the goal is being able to input more keystrokes at one time, it might not be possible to get any faster than the game is able to accept your inputs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless the program queues up key press\u00A0events, you\u0027ll most likely be limited by it\u0027s update cycle rate.
