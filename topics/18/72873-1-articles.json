That is, I like my meat tender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to side dishes, I like any form of potatoes, but my favourite is Croquettes - basically small pieces of puree put into a pill made out of bread (like the crust of a schnitzel) that are up to 5 centimetres long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop Tip: I once read that cooking your meat with rosemary would destroy any cancer causing substances. Good meat from happy animals on farms who have lots of space and get to graze every day probably doesn\u0027t have them, but you should still do it because it may add an additional flavour note to the meat as the juice from the herb is soaked into the muscle tissue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-20T15:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2014 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MedwedianPresident\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T15:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you and I have a different definition of beverages....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think this is the most un-KSP related thread ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T15:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I always mistake beverages for side dishes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T15:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI eat it well done and can\u0027t understand the desire for eating raw meat.

I also like pork chops. I coat them in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic, let them steep overnight, then grill them to medium/medium-well. (And before anyone brings it up, the only sanitary reason to cook pork to well done is to kill Trichinella spiralis, the parasite that causes trichinosis. However, swine herds in the United States are tested and treated to prevent Trichinella infections, and it is against USDA regulations to bring Trichinella-infected hogs to market. So the odds of contracting trichinosis from undercooked commercial pork in this country are incredibly small. You stand a better chance of winning the lottery.) Grilling is a favorite pastime of mine, always charcoal. I also smoke a lot of meats: ribs, pork shoulder, chicken, even whole turkeys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESides vary. My favorites are green beans sauteed with bacon and sliced new potatoes pan-fried in butter.
