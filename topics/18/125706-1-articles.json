I believe Claw told me It doesn\u0026#39;t like overclocked GPU\u0026#39;s and that could be a reason why the game crashes for me every 2-3 hours when changing buildings/scenes (though I still get them occasionally even when I clock it back to standard)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEver since the 1.05 update, my frame rates have dropped dramatically even for craft with a low part count (less then 100 parts) and I have\u003Cbr\u003E\n-a i5 4690k watercooled and OC to 4.25\u003Cbr\u003E\n-an HD 6950 2gb video ram\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 8gb of ram\u003Cbr\u003E\n-only 3 mods installed; KIS/KAS, kerbal alarm clock. Waiting for Atmosphere trajectories and Engineer to be updated\u003Cbr\u003E\n-win 7 pro\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have always run the game on 100% settings and I do not want to compromise that. In previous versions i was not getting bad fps unless my craft had more then 300-400 parts, and even then it only became unplayable after about 600 parts. Since the update, im getting 12 fps on average and 4 fps at the worst. Its really annoying when I believe I have a great CPU and decent GPU.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill this second GPU help me out with this issue? Is my set up really suddenly inadequate now??\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T09:43:53Z","Content":"\nWow, tough question, I wouldn\u0026#39;t know to be honest, but more graphics power [I]can[/I] help if the gpu was bottle necking your system, for example I upgraded from the AMD Radeon built into my cpu to a separate Nvidia card and there was a big improvement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs to whether KSP will like SLI will depend on Unity, it should work, though I hear that SLI is dying off as newer cards don\u0026#39;t benefit from it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yeah overclocking will crash KSP, it really can\u0026#39;t take much overclocking at all.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T09:54:01Z","Content":"\nI doubt a second 6950 will help your performance much, even with an overclocked i5 you will hit the CPU limit quite fast.
