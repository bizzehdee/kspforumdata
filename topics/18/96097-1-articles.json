My parents come from a country where insulting Islam is punishable by flogging, and leaving it is punishable by death. Though always a skeptic at heart, questioning Islam in my country of origin meant facing persecution at best, and the death penalty at worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen beheadings, floggings and beatings in the name of protecting the sanctity of Islam. They\u0027re not impressive in the least, and you don\u0027t want any of them to transpire a few feet away from you at an impressionable young age. I\u0027ve seen the effects of Islamic fundamentalism first hand, and how extremely effective it is at stifling an entire civilization from developing into a society that favors reason, rationality and the basic, axiomatic right to express your thoughts and ideas freely, even if they are perceived to be disrespectful, offensive or tasteless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough a series of unfortunate events that included loss and bereavement, I\u0027ve come to terms with calling myself an atheist. I have an Islamic first name, yet I\u0027m as godless as a bagful of decapitated puppies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why it\u0027s frustratingly hard to come out as an atheist and share my identity with the world is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf word goes out and reaches my country of origin that I\u0027m an atheist, I would place my family in harm\u0027s way. The reason for this is that even though I\u0027m no longer physically located in the country in question, the government of said country will employ an Italian-mob like strategy wherein they would harass and even harm my family in an attempt to goad me into going back to face the music.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, I\u0027m not even as vocal a critic of Islam as I used to be, because doing so meant adopting a toxic, neurotic mindset wherein I\u0027m constantly looking for things to complain about my former religion, however trivial they may be. I\u0027ve found this to be a decidedly substandard approach to living, and that it is far more conducive to my well-being to light my past with a torch and move on with my life, rigorously pursuing my own educational and professional aspirations, Islam-free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the wake of what happened in France, however, I\u0027ll make an exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to emphasize the following crucial point that is the reason why I\u0027m making this post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo attack are trying to do is not just stifle freedom of speech, or force an entire continent into a state of terror and trepidation. What they are truly aiming for is far more sinister and diabolical:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey want to make it infinitely, ineffably and irrevocably harder for both Muslims and ex-Muslims to go about their lives peacefully in the countries that they have immigrated to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey aim to foster an environment that has its foundations firmly rooted in fear and confusion. They hope that such an environment will make for fertile ground for prejudice, bigotry and intolerance to manifest and fester.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuslims of all walks of life, be they Middle-Eastern, South-East Asian or otherwise, are deathly afraid of the blowback that they might experience through no fault of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI implore you to not give in to the mindset that these fundamentalist thugs want you to succumb to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you see a girl wearing a hijab, instead of going \u0022What the hell is she doing in my country? Why won\u0027t she go back?\u0022, buy her a cup of coffee. Perhaps a slice of cake. Watch what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not be surprised if the girl bursts into tears, because your out-of-left-field act of compassion and kindness will be an overwhelming reassurance that she is not subject to misplaced prejudice and unfair bigotry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the two schmucks who attacked the Charlie Hebdo HQ were subjected to the sonic barrage of a Ramones tune at an early age, I\u0027d wager that many lives will have been spared, and that we would all go back to extolling the virtues of Pastafarianism instead. Obviously, it\u0027s much too late for that.
