A questionable retired Marine Corps Major made claims about one or two satellites orbiting the earth in 1954. Six years later there was some confusion about a mysterious sattelite in a polar orbit, which probably was part of the Discoverer V a corona satellite launched a few months earlier. And there was the sighting of this black object from STS-088 in 1998.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the three events conspiration theroists talk about if they asked about the back knight sattelite.

I can understand how people are fascinated by the thought of an ancient alien satellite in earth orbit, but to be honest it\u0027s highly unlikely and all the \u0022evidence\u0022 can be linked to simple non-linked events of human spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T17:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spaceman1999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spaceman1999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I heard that at the time when it was discovered polar orbit was impossible, and it orbits in a polar orbit...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EHow was it discovered then?
