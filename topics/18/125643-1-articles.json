So, you read on it to be sure you know the basics and what changes to expect. I my case, that was Microsoft Windows 10 November 14 update. The information on the internet was pointing mostly at minor fixes: visual tweaks, blah blah blah... The usual Microsoft way of \u0022upgrading\u0022 something. But deep inside. In my \u0022guts\u0022. I could feel that they probably secretly changed a lot of other things too...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what is the link between Windows 10 update and losing a Kerbal?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou see, I am a tweak freak. I tweak things. Well, I tweak software mostly. I mod, I customize, I set, I define macros... Probably like a lot of other \u0022power user\u0022. So, as you might have guessed, I play KSP with a lot of mods. Last time I checked I had more than 90 installed with a lot of them tweaked in one way or another. Among those mods, there is one called \u0022Advanced Fly By Wire\u0022. Basically, an advance controller configuration utility. The Xbox One for Windows controller I use had all of it\u0026#39;s button assigned to very specific KSP function. One of these function was the \u0022Abort\u0022 action... and the specific button assigned to it was the big \u0022Xbox Jewel\u0022 button.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo here I am. Flying that \u0022Albatross Vee\u0022 aircraft. An easy one to fly. I explore Kerbin with it and, when I need to land, say, to perform an experiment on the surface, I use the \u0022Abort\u0022 action: I defined it so that it stops both engines and deploy the COM centered chute. When timed correctly with a forced stall, you can land very close to any target provided it is on level ground. I had done that several times. As usual my best Kerbal pilot was in the cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLittle did I knew that \u0022under the hood\u0022 Microsoft had secretly decided to ruin my day! I can picture the scene: Several senior programmers, in a small room, talking about the next changes they are going to include in Windows 10. One of them, in a desperate attempt to get credibility among it\u0026#39;s peers and in a bright flash of pure inspiration says: \u0022Let\u0026#39;s disable the Xbox controller jewel button! They don\u0026#39;t need it and, let\u0026#39;s be honest, nobody use it anyway. Beside, this could help tremendously in increasing the whole system performance and responsiveness...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so they did. No more \u0022guide\u0022 button for the masses to use. In a tyrannical and bold move, Microsoft prove, once again, they are committed to secretly ruin your experience. So much for improvements... and this is only the tip of the iceberg.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S: As some reader probably noticed, this text, while being based on actual events, contain a fair amount of sarcasms.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:47:52Z","Content":"\nYup. This is precisely why I\u0026#39;m staying on Windows 7 for my virtual machines. I\u0026#39;ve also disabled automatic updates, as I\u0026#39;ve had it screw hardware drivers really hard. I have a proprietary motorcycle diagnostics box, SCSI-based scanner, an old Printronix printer and other things to support. These are devices that are expensive and important, but no new drivers are available.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that Microsoft has put out at least 3 updates to Windows 7 to try to automatically download Windows 10, and marked these as recommended and important so they would be installed when set to automatic updates.
