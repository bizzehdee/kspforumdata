However now I\u0027m going into it with a little bit more determination and commitment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/LsAUc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/LsAUc\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a preview pic of what I\u0027ve come up with after a few hours. I already have a basic idea of what the games final goal and progression will be like. Essentially this game will take place in around the 1600\u0027s or early 1700\u0027s and essentially this is your starting tutorial island if you will. Once completing the tutorial and screwing off on the island, you board the boat located at the dock (note: There is no boat yet) and it will load up the next location. After you reach the next location I do have some ideas in mind but I\u0027ll keep those to myself till the tutorial island is finished haha.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is does anyone have some experience in coding in C# in unity that could lend me a hand as this coding stuff even with tutorials is still confusing as crap to me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
