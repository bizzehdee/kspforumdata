In Quest For Fire, they show dogs hanging around the human encampment, probably scavenging the leftovers. I\u0027ve always imagined that dogs were domesticated that way: as a side effect of their hanging around us. They certainly have an instinctive propensity for mooching...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd on a somewhat related note, there was an episode of Quirks and Quarks (a weekly science magazine program on CBC Radio) about two years ago where the researchers that they interviewed presented a hypothesis that modern humans may have actually wiped out our hominid competitors by out competing them for food after our ancestors domesticated dogs. While the researchers admitted that it would be very difficult to prove, they speculated that our eyes may even have had something to do with it. We are the only great apes that have visible eye whites; other hominids may not have had visible eye whites like we do. Our visible eye whites present an advantage in hunting because they allow dogs and other human hunters to see what their human partners are looking at without making any noise. The combination of human hunters working together with domesticated dogs who were adept at reading human faces (as modern domesticated dogs are) may have been formidable enough that all the other hominids starved off into extinction. It sounds plausible anyway...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-22T05:55:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2018 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T21:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDomestication of wolves/dogs probably started independently in a few places (my conjecture). It may well be that it started with friending a injured animal, and once it was proven it could be done, they started trying to friend the camp followers ( probably not tried before as they wouldn\u2019t want to encourage vicious animals to hang around). Another likely method would be finding a litter of pups after having to kill the dam, or wiping out the pack. That may have been how they were first domesticated, and most likely the main method of friending more animals once they got the hang of it and wanted to friend more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer to use \u2018friend\u2019 instead of \u2018tame\u2019 because IMO, historically, animals are tamed by force and fear, and will turn on\u00A0you if given a chance.
