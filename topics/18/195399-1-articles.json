They are weak in Industries with low membership, but even there they provide a quite good law insurance If you ever need to go to court because of an action of your boss (e.g. fireing you, cheat in your payment etc). The law department of its umbrella organisation\u00A0 even has a quite comprehensive website about Germans working and social law: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dgbrechtsschutz.de/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dgbrechtsschutz.de/ \u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending of the sector they have other goodies (E.G: The union of teacher and kindergarten staff has a key insurance for their members, since losing a key to a school is not only a pain in the ass for everyone involved but also quite expensive (for the girl/guy loosing the key) , others have deals with insurance companys for an accident insurance\u00A0 (including accidents in your leisure time ) etc).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd in sectors with big memberships, they actually do excellent work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo years ago automotive supplier Neue Hallberger Guss had a big fight with their most important customer (VW), where managment of NHG decided to close one of their factorys. Since about 90% of the company was organized in IG Metall, they started to strike. In the end, owners of NHG sold the factory to new owners. Although they still layed staff of: 50% of people losing the job is better than 100% lost jobs. And they mostly layed people of, who are young, had no family etc, so have a better chance to get a new job\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA east german noodle factory (Teigwaren Riesa )\u00A0 did a successful strike for getting a higher pay two years ago, too, but they also had 75% of the staff member of the NGG (union of gastronomy and food industry).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe same union did a great campain (called Deliverunion ) for organizing the poor guys, who devliver pizzas to people with long Kerbal sessions like me .\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo yes an union membership is actually a quite good idea, especially If it\u0027s not so great at the moment: $24 if they are performing ok or good, is not a big deal for the benifts. I pay 1% of my income at the moment, because of Germans system they can\u0027t control it. If I ever would need their law support, they might ask for a confirmation of my income. That\u0027s just fair imho, their lawyers and staff need to eat too).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you think they can do better: 24$ is also not a big deal, to get the right to vote and run for a position, to better things.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might want to read Jane McAlevys \u0022No shortcuts\u0022.
