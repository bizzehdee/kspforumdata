I don\u0027t know about you, but I am loving the beta release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo getting to the point, I desperately need some work advice. I am not sure if it is ok to make a thread like this one, but I didn\u0027t see any rules against it. If I am violating and rules or codes of conduct, please let me know and/or ignore this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to my story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been working since I was 14. I was able to work so early because it was part of a work ethics training. I have had a job every year since then, and not gone without a job for more than 6 months (happened once or twice). I am now 28, I married my wife in 2009, we had our first child in 2010, and the second this may.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I was able to do so well (I think) was because of the job I got 8 years ago. It is the closest place of employment (the others being over 30 min away), was a really fun place to work, and I am payed pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell recently my company has gone through some rough times. Our general manager (my mentor and close friend) quit due to stress reasons. The company was in turmoil, nobody knew what to do, or who should decide what to do. I am the senior employee at this point, and I have over 5000 work hours logged. I also spent the last 2 years \u0022shadowing\u0022 our old GM, so I knew what needed to happen. So I decided to propose to be the general manager. The owner didn\u0027t want to approve anything that the remaining management team hadn\u0027t agreed on. This is where my actual problems began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe management team (which I am on, and the only employee there longer than 2 years) voted one of their own as general manager, because the guy has a college degree for business management. This sounded good to me, I would be able to contribute, but would not be the one responsible for making everything work. Since then I have seriously regretted not fighting tooth and nail to make sure he didn\u0027t get the job. Almost everyone has quit, and I am starting to have serious stress issues associated with his management. My problem has nothing to do with him having the job instead of me, it is because he has the authority to get things done and he does absolutely nothing. I have earned the responsibility to be general manager, and I know what to do. But this guy weaseled his way into a position of power, so that he could make his resume better, and is killing the business. This wouldn\u0027t necessarily be a problem, if I didn\u0027t care about the business. But I do. It has been good to me, and I want to reciprocate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have confronted him, and the other management team members about the problem. We have given him several \u0022chances\u0022 (even though I didn\u0027t get mine), but they are so inexperienced that they have no idea what to do, and they can\u0027t come together to figure it out. Now it is almost time for the heavy season to begin, and we have nothing worked out. I am being forced to \u0022be patient\u0022 and see how he does, although I already see him following patterns that predict that he will fail, and make our situation much worse. Like I said earlier, everybody is either quitting, or making plans to leave within the year. Our business usually employs about 6 people for the off season, and around 20 for the heavy season. At this moment, if nothing changes, the only people who will be left when the heavy season hits will be him and I. Him doing nothing but seeing if I\u0027m working, and me training an entire new work force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I don\u0027t see any option but to wait it out, hoping that I will get a chance to fix the business before it completely fails. Either that, or I am proved completely wrong, and this guy pulls through and saves the day. Neither one seems very likely, and the stress of seeing the business that has treated me so well crumble is starting to effect my daily life. I space out: went to go use the golf cart to bring in a load of wood and got in my car and drove to work instead. Insomnia: usually my kids are the only thing that wake me up, but recently I have been waking up every couple of hours for no reason. Depression: I usually use my family to help me forget about work stresses, but I find myself recycling worries, and forgetting to spend time with them. Lots of other stuff, that\u0027s just what I can think of on the spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else been through a similar situation? Is anybody in some sort of proffesion that they could give me advice on work ethics while dealing with strife at work? Does anybody know a good website for free or cheap counseling/therapy? I don\u0027t know what to do, I just know something has to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure I am leaving details out, just ask and I will provide more.

I am either going to make this work, or I am staying home to raise my children while my wife makes the dough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is funny that you mentioned the sinking ship analogy. Like I mentioned, the old general manager is a good friend of mine. And that is almost exactly what he keeps telling me. He says there is no reason to try and save a sinking ship that the captain, cook, and engineer have abandoned. I tell him that he forgot to mention the Jew on shore (thats me) who saw a free boat and paddled his ass out there to bucket water out like mad. I keep thinking, \u0022If I can stop all the leaks, I will have my own ship!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, now for the update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ended up being extremely coincidental that I created this post last night. Because the situation might have just been resolved this morning. Let me explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only 3 members left on the management team. Me, the weasel, and Matt. Matt is a good guy, who happens to be both of our friends. Since it is just us left, all any of us need is for two of us to vote on an issue, and it has majority. So for the last few weeks I have been working on Matt, to try and convince him that the weasel is ruining the business and causing all of us undue stress, and that I can do better and run the business the way it is supposed to be run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell a few days ago I called Matt up to talk about my frustrations (he had invited me to call him whenever I needed to talk about it), but he didn\u0027t have time to talk. So I asked him to call me back when he had time. He never did call me back. Instead, this morning he confronted me about my frustration with the weasel. I blew up. I mean really blew up. He started the conversation in a stance of authority, and by the time I was done, he was curling in on himself sitting in the corner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apolagized to him for jumping down his throat, it just set me off because it was already in line with a lot of stress that I had already been dealing with. I told him that I couldn\u0027t continue talking about it at the moment due to stress, and that I had to get to work in order to calm down. Well it turns out that he called the weasel down to work to tell him a few things. He told the weasel that it had become evident to him that the weasel didn\u0027t care about the business, and that he wasn\u0027t being progressive, or doing anything productive. He said that it had become extremely apparent that I really do care about the business, and that I have a ton that I bring to the table. He told the weasel that he should accept one of the job proposals that the weasel had received, and leave general management to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am kinda in shock right now. I had resolved to spending the next year in a state of constant stress, not being able to make any headway. And now it seems that my requests have been granted. I think that since the only other member of the management has expressed his opinion that I be general manager, that all that stands in my way right now is a technicality. Once the vote is made next Monday, I believe I will be granted general manager.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T09:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave fun, boss. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope it does not create another form of negative stress for you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T11:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like good news, Zipmafia, glad to hear it.
