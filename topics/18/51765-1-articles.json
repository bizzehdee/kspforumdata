Good thing it\u0027s Battlefield and I expect nothing from the SP (BF3 SP was pretty good though). You can\u0027t even call it story holes, it was more like story dots. Weak characters, excellent voicework. Some locations were pretty great and the character detail is very good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMP is as amazing as expected and I seem to be pretty lucky (ocassional crashes after some hours). On the new patched (R6) servers and with the fixed join queue I have close to zero problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest AMD beta driver is a bit of a diva with some flickering problems on the desktop w/ multi monitoring).
