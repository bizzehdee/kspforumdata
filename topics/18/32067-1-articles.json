During the obligatory suit-up sequence in the giant robots there was a computer voice. I could swear it was GlaDOS! Same voice actor same filter. I\u0027m not a fan of type casting but this seems pretty cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I should probably take the ten seconds of googling it would take to find out her name but I\u0027m to busy saving kerbals from the danger I put them in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprotip: If you need to pad your resume\u0027 just say you were the voice of Chel.

Apparently, it is the same VA (Ellen McLain) and filter as GLaDOS, and was put in as a direct shout-out to the game. I thought it was a little odd. But still, GLaDOS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also believe it was said the filter will be toned down to sound less Portal for the actual movie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T01:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich one, never ever seen the commerical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also just noticed my avatar, and this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
