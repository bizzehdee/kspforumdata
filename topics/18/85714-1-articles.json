Every airplane gets assigned a registration number (or tail number), and in the US we call them N-numbers or, because they all start with N and are followed by 3 to 5 alphanumeric characters. It\u0027s interesting to do a Google search on one\u0027s N-number, because once in a while someone snaps a photo of your plane you weren\u0027t aware of, or something in its history might show up that didn\u0027t previously, or any other number of things may pop up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So not too long after getting my airplane, I decide to Google the N-number, and I see reports of some guy flying *MY* airplane on the East Coast. Well, I live in the Midwest, and there\u0027s no way that someone was flying my plane. I click on the link and find out that the guy flying my plane is posting about his MS Flight Simulator adventures. I shoot him an email and we have a chuckle about it and he explains why he chose his tail number, which by coincidence is the same as my actual aircraft\u0027s number. A little while into the future I Google again, and he shows up again, this time mentioning our email conversation on his website. For some reason unbeknownst to me, I happen to remember useless information that\u0027s easily recalled when triggered - this guy\u0027s domain was one of those bits of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast forward to today, and I\u0027m looking at the KSP forums, and I go to click on a link to a members personal site where he had a download link, and I\u0027m thinking, \u0022wait a second that domain looks familiar.\u0022 Yep, same guy, five years later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: You never know who you may run into in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T08:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good story!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
