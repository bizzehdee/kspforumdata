I found an equation. This equation told me how to calculate the diagonal of a square. But there wasn\u0027t anything about how to find the diagonal (line connecting two furthest points) of a cube. So I decided to figure it out myself, and this is what I got:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ediagonal = side * sqrt 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter comparing the result with the equation for a square (d = side * sqrt 2). I noticed a similiarity. If you think about it, the equation could be written as followed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ediagonal = side * sqrt dimension of shape\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also is true for dimensions 0 and 1 (in 0 dimension the answer is always 0 and in dimension 1 the diagonal = length of the side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, my question is, does this work in the higher dimensions? I\u0027m too lazy to think that much (at least for now) and I\u0027ll just hope someone else figures it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, has this been discovered already?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T20:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.
