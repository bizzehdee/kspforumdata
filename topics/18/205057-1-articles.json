I wound up with a NIB 5500XT 8GB for about $400. That was back in April. But as a backup I put my name on the EVGA waiting list. That popped up in August, and I wound up buying a 3060 12G direct from them for MSRP, about $400, which is a total steal at current market rates. I just had to wait almost five months for it. I haven\u0027t decided what to do with the 5500XT yet. I\u0027m either going to sell it on EBay used or hold on to it until we have some cash again and build another gaming PC for my kids.
