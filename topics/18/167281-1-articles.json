Boy, I haven\u0027t been on this forum for some time now, but I have been busy with a lot of things and not enough KSP. But honestly, guys. This forum rocks. You\u0027re all fun to talk to and you are great people. Too bad a majority of the gaming community fails badly. I play (or I \u003Cem\u003Eplayed\u003C/em\u003E) a lot of World of Tanks here and there, and while I understand that it is a competitive video game, so many people act like sore losers and bad sports. It\u0027s not even funny. It\u0027s a video game. You have people who say some really mean and questionable things that I do not believe I need mention (but I suppose just as a small sample, you have people who call you obscenely rude names\u00A0a lot). Communities like this put me off and it just makes the game a whole lot less enjoyable. Although I was not banned from that game, I did get a forum strike in that community, simply for calling somebody out for being stupid and overly aggressive toward me. While I was sloppy and shouldn\u0027t have done that, I made sure to fix my mistake in my thread and removed names and everything (the rule is called \u0022Naming and Shaming\u0022 which is something you cannot do). Even so,\u00A0a lot of people were just jerks about it and immediately mistook my casual conversation starter as me whining, being butthurt, etc. Even though I was genuinely looking for critique in one of the battles which I had an issue with the person in question. I didn\u0027t even make that big of a deal out of it, but since so many people just for some reason don\u0027t like it when I point out the social aspects of the community,\u00A0 it seemed the administration there favoured them and gave me a strike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I was not banned, but that really put me off from so much as playing the game and I just outright left the forum. I can\u0027t even start a casual conversation without flamewars and huge excrementsstorms popping out of nowhere in my threads. It\u0027s sickening. World of Tanks is a fun time waster, but it\u0027s not an amazing game. But I think the biggest issues are not the game itself, but rather the administration behind it and also the hostile community in general. I get that it is a competitive game, but it seems like many people use this as an excuse to act like complete asses about it because they think it makes them look like a hardcore cool person or something. I do not know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, here, I feel I can talk about anything because people seem more openminded and peaceful. Then again, KSP is not an action game... although I suppose you could\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/CwiUbsq2q58\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eturn it into one.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0It is not competitive, at least not unless you get challenges involved but even then people are very chill and fantastic in that section. What I don\u0027t get is why it is that people\u0027s mental nature seems to change drastically the moment they touch a game where you can shoot stuff. I just don\u0027t understand this behaviour at all. But that could just be me. I appreciate this community, and it\u0027s great how chill you all are. Sorry for the vent, but I needed to get this off of my chest. A lot of gaming communities just tick me off, and it\u0027s primarily due to the bahaviour towards others of the people playing the game in question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-07T06:35:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2017 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-07T01:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, Welcome back to the KSP forum, where everyone in here isn\u0027t an ordinary gamers who only care about pwning or bragging to others. KSP isn\u0027t a game which can be played by anyone, you can\u0027t play this game by simply having \u0022fast reflex so I shoot first\u0022, but also an understanding about physics, aerodynamics, astronomy, orbital mechanics and a lot more. Most of us here is either rocket/ aircraft enthusiast, scientists, etc. (Basically, we solve problem with calm and coolheaded attitude, not starting flamewar). Perhaps what you experienced in the contrasting difference between 2 games is caused by several factors, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- most of the shooter game, especially MMO values pwning the most in a game between 2 sides, so it\u0027s natural for someone to have \u0022I\u0027m the greatest\u0022 mentality when they got most kill and ridicule the other by calling them noob. While yes, the shooter game have tactical sense, most of the time, it\u0027s about who can click faster to pop someone\u0027s head. KSP \u00A0(the combat type at least) isn\u0027t that type of the game since it isn\u0027t about a skill of who can click faster, but who can build better. Furthermore, most battle in KSP is handled by AI anyway, so it also about who can configure the AI better. While this might not important, losing in a shooter game full of pro gamers always induce hate, losing in KSP is more likely to induce motivation to get better\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the KSP community is full of people who solve the problem calmly and methodically, a claim isn\u0027t a claim when it isn\u0027t proven scientifically. Most of other shooter game out there is full of pro-style gamer who can be agitated by even a slightest provocation (which usually resulted in flamewar where both sides trashing at each other). For an example of how we, KSP community handle a problem in our community, just look for \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159036-matt-lowne/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159036\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159036-matt-lowne/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Matt Lowne\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/115844-hazard-ish/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022115844\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/115844-hazard-ish/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@hazard-ish\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Tiltwing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E (just look at Matt\u0027s video on YouTube channel or the forum about it). Yes it does cause a flamewar in the forum but it doesn\u0027t go as far as profanity-laden posts and even then, the conflict is finished in just 2 days, after that, everything goes normal in the forum. Compare to most conflict that happen on most shooter MMO forum where the flamewar could lasts for months or even years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- one of the thing that unusual for most gamers is the ability for KSP players to \u0022improvise\u0022. In almost EVERY shooter game, whenever there\u0027s an update that either buff or nerf something, there\u0027s ALWAYS a complain in the forum, as if they can\u0027t live without it. This isn\u0027t a case in KSP. Whenever there\u0027s a nerf or buff, the community simply \u0022improvise\u0022 it to circumnavigate the nerf limitation or make better use of buff advantage (one rule in KSP is, the more absurd the improvisation, the better)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- repetitiveness, name me one shooting MMO that has something other than \u0022pwn someone\u0027s head in a match, rinse and repeat until you unlock next tank, weapon, parts, rank, etc.\u0022. Yes most will say \u0022it\u0027s a shooter game, so of course it\u0027s about shooting\u0022. But one must remember, repetitiveness is one of the thing that plagues most games today. It makes a game boring real fast. Remember, we play for fun not for work. In your example above, yes, I\u0027m a former WoT player, but I\u0027ve stopped playing it long time ago simply because it\u0027s more like a chore than play. Sure it\u0027s fun at first, but then as I progress, the exp needed gets absurd and the game simply becomes more like a chore that I don\u0027t care about it anymore. Grinding is not a good aspect in a game, it leads to a monotonous task with no new experience in gameplay. In KSP, we always have one thing that we love: mods. Mods adds a whole new gameplay and brand new experience by offering more challenge, more parts, more places to visit and many more. If a vanilla game isn\u0027t enough, a mod can give new experience. Overall (as a former WoT player) why you just drive a tank when you can build your own tank and experience the sensation of driving an ultramassive land battleship with weapon system that you can put as you like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my opinion though, but yes, I do agree with you that most other gaming community is simply too hostile for any talk\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I think the KSP is one of the greatest game in my life, with such a helpful and good community (well, KSP helps me jacking up my academic grades and my thesis), I think it\u0027s safe to say this game is about who can be more creative, have more absurd idea, more crazy mission, etc. It\u0027s not for bragging, it\u0027s for entertainment for others\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, once again, welcome back! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-07T01:17:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2017 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-07T22:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223212739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510008907\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134627\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Der Anfang\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Der Anfang said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just have to say that you all are wonderful people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t call myself wonderful, but okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223212739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510008907\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134627\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Der Anfang\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Der Anfang said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, here, I feel I can talk about anything because people seem more openminded and peaceful.
