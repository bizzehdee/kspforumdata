Mainly the \u0022shadow time\u0022 itself because there have been so many times I wish I could back up just a few seconds and hit record to get those unplanned awesome (or horrible) moments! But also because it\u0027s much less catastrophic on my framerate than FRAPS and provides smaller file sizes. My question isn\u0027t necessarily Shadowplay specific and I already expect that it\u0027s going to be a no, but what\u0027s the harm in asking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lately I\u0027ve been watching Netflix some on my secondary monitor while I play because I\u0027m apparently just not content doing only one thing at a time, and obviously it captures the audio in the background. Sometimes I like to upload to YouTube -- #1 I\u0027m not sure how YouTube would feel about \u0027copyrighted audio\u0027 being in the background of my vids, and #2 I really don\u0027t want it there in the first place. I could mute the entire vid since KSP really only has some spacey music and engine noises anyway, but that isn\u0027t really the case with other games. I was wondering if there\u0027s another option. Is there a third party program or a reasonable method I can use to \u0022hide\u0022 the audio from Netflix (or anything really) to keep it out of my recordings but still listen to it all at once? I feel like it wouldn\u0027t be incredibly difficult to do this on Windows 7 since the volume mixer already has separate channels for each application running and I\u0027ve had to set up a virtual loopback device before, but I\u0027m not making the connection here. It seems like there should be a way to make Shadowplay or FRAPS only record audio from one of those sources instead of everything that flows out of my audio jack. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
