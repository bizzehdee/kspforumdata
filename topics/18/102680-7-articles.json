It\u0027s also important to understand why someone believes what they do. As said, with my friend who does not believe in the luna landings or dinosaurs, I could blame religion. That would be stupid of me, their religion did not tell them those two things. But they saw lies else where, in politics and business (really, those places will state up is down, and bankruptcy is profit ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ), and extrapolated too far from there into history and other things. I know in time they will understand where it\u0027s right to draw the line.\n\nI was (and usually still am) the one asking stupid questions. Though I don\u0027t ask \u0022Why do you not sell energy efficient kettles\u0022 (asked at work, tried hart to explain, they did not believe me), but instead \u0022why do we assume that, why do we still do that, did anyone actually check?\u0022\n\nAsking in not a problem.

It slides the two OLB to one side of the defense, and brings the SS up to the vacated LB position leaving just 2 CBs and a FS to defend against the deep pass. However, it puts serious pressure on the OL and the QB.
