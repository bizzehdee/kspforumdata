Download - install - reboot - no network. All devices are there, but no interfaces. Rollback.\n\n2. Found out that\u0027s because Cisco VPN client was installed. Uninstall, repeat #1.\n\n3. At least now there was network connection. Trying to install Cisco VPN - BZZZZ. Error. Tried installing DNE software, tried Dell client - nothing. At some point instead of error in the middle of install it has begun to drop the \u0022Cisco VPN client is not compatible with this OS version\u0022 message without even starting the installer. Very informative.\n\n4. Tracking. Tracking everywhere. Even when you disable tracking, your system will send data. Adding insult to injury, updates are automatic. My system will decide when it wants to reboot? More importantly, if some update breaks the OS completely, you won\u0027t be able to prevent it from installing.\n\n5. Store apps. Undeletable vendorware. Like XBOX app. Why would I want this crap on my PC? It\u0027s ridiculous.\n\n6. Then I saw a certain screenshot of someone talking to russian MS techsupport, asking if he will be able to reinstall Win10 a year later for free. The answer: you will have to buy a key in a year, even if you have used your right for a \u0022free\u0022 update. It will be free only until you need to reinstall. MS Win10 FAQ states kinda otherwise, but it doesn\u0027t mention the time period. Looks like a classic bait and switch.\n\n7. To hell with it. Rollback? BZZZZ. It seemes that at some point recovery partition was overwritten, even if it wasn\u0027t supposed to for at least a month. Now it\u0027s Win10 or nothing. Great.\n\n8. Spent a couple of hours downloading different Win8/8.1 distributions with WUDT until one of them accepted the BIOS product key.\n\n9. Back to Win8.1 on notebook, now dualboot with Debian, where I actually spend more time than in Windows. I don\u0027t think I will even try to update my main Win7 desktop at all.

It works perfectly. For me, for my VP at work, and for three other people I know that are using it. \n\nThe only thing I\u0027ve found that doesn\u0027t work is the config screen to change the background image of the lock screen. And that\u0027s a big \u0022who cares\u0022 for me since I only see that screen once in the two seconds between boot-up and when I log in. If you like to waste electricity and leave your PC on all the time you may have a problem with that. (Boot times for Win10 are in the 2-3 second range for me, and most of that is in the EFI startup.)\n\nOffline single-player Solitaire is still free, and doesn\u0027t have ads (none that I\u0027ve seen, though I only played five or six games). What has ads is the online multiplayer Solitaire, and you can get rid of the ads for $10/yr. Personally I think my XBox Live subscription should cover that, but as I don\u0027t see the point in *Online Multiplayer SOLITAIRE* I\u0027m not really going to complain. \n\nThat said, I\u0027m lucky my Nvidia card uses a slightly older chipset, as it seems the newer chipsets had some problems on release day. Those issues appear to have since been fixed. MultiDisplay support was also strangely broken for one person I know, but Windows Update downloaded a new driver that fixed it shortly after reboot. YMMV."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:23:23Z","Content":"Played with it on a couple of VM\u0027s. Really dislike the interface, but then again, a lot of OS/App updates are going the same way (flat shaded, few/no borders between GUI elements, kindergarten colours (or, even worse, just greyscale), etc etc). There was a reason we went from flat stuff to faux-3d. Seems all the new graphic designers have forgotten that and want to stamp their own style on the current gen of GUIs. Meh, at least give users the option to skin the interface back to something sane. Or at least ensure there\u0027s a huge boost to performance.\n\nApart from that I\u0027m somewhat wary about the amount of tracking; I\u0027ve turned it all (or as much as is possible via the standard interfaces) off, but packet scanning still shows lots of traffic going to Redmond. Also wary about forced updates, I hack all of my Win7 boxes to NEVER update unless I tell it to (involves various hacks otherwise even Win7 keeps turning stuff on, gah!, worst thing when you come into the office the next day to find your boxes have rebooted and you\u0027ve lost work).\n\nCore-OS functionality-wise, it seems to be ok, but I\u0027ll wait and see how the rest of the world gets on first. So I don\u0027t see myself performing the \u0022upgrades\u0022 from Windows 7 on my actual machines anytime soon. Not that I use Windows much at home - 99% of my time is in Linux anyway.
