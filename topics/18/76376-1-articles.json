Once warp, the [AN]/[PN] will shift to a distance (a few 0.x degree). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some thought. I believe, the centre for Axies, are not the same. In normal KSP, the Axies centre at the Kerbol (Sun), once you get your [AN]/[PN] to a 0 degree, it will stay there, except your move your ships to other direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn RSS, once you-warp at Kerbol (Sun) orbit, the craft is going with a 0 degree movement (Calculation), hence the angle will change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BDDifference reference point from the craft (reference to ksp Kerbal), and the planets that orbiting the Kerbol (sun) \u00C3\u00A3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion:- How to solve this shifting angle?
