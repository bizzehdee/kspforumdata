It\u0027s a game for ios and android and to put it simply it is pretty much 2d ksp with quite a lot of features held back. It is a very nice game with lots of challenges but there is only about 20 parts to build ships with but i will recommend it. The good thing though is that at the bottom of the menu it actually \u003Cstrong\u003Eadvertise\u003C/strong\u003E ksp saying if you like this game you will love ksp.
