The immersion is great and the graphics are stunning, especially in some of the newly added areas. Of course, being early access there are a few bugs, much-needed optimization (the graphics made my old computer/toaster bring my FPS down to 2), and some of the survival aspects could be tweaked, but overall it\u0027s a great example of an early access game done right. The developers are extremely open too, having several Trello\u00A0boards with roadmaps and upcoming features, and keep a continuously updated experimental mode with two updates every day. Plus they actually interact with the forums significantly, and respond to a lot of questions and things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had 47 hours in the game so far according to steam, and have definitely gotten my money\u0027s worth.
