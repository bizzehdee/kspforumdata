I decided to draw the view on a notecard and take my chances. I watched the Moon until it was dark enough to see my reference star, Hydor, then pointed my telescope there and consulted my notecard. After some searching I found the arrangement I was looking for, with several magnitude 9 stars around slightly brighter and slightly bluish Neptune. Now, the weather is a little iffy for tomorrow, but I took a second notecard to draw what I could see and I will try to look again the next night I can to look for motion to confirm that the object is indeed Neptune."},{"CreatedByName":"munlander1","CreatedById":168560,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T01:45:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, cubinator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I will try to look again the next night I can to look for motion to confirm that the object is indeed Neptune.\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t think it would be distinguishable very much"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T01:52:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, munlander1 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think it would be distinguishable very much\n\u003E \n\nShh, I have to discover that myself.

Two of them were in polar orbits fairly close together at slightly different longitudes, perhaps ten degrees apart. One of those two, the first I noticed, reflected a bright flare of sunlight in my direction. The third was visible later,on a southwesterly path. All three were clearly in very high orbits due to their slow speed, even though the first two were close to directly overhead.
