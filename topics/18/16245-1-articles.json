The popular internet video website. You should try it sometime - they have videos there. But the thing is, and this is what the thing is: any video I watch there seems to have its audio track delayed by a half a second or so. This is incredibly frustrating - more so because it didn\u0027t used to happen. I\u0027m using an almost new laptop of moderate to poor specification, but this time last week everything was synced beautifully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried checking (and un-checking) the \u0027enable hardware acceleration\u0027 box in the Flash options.

Apparently, due to laptops having an onboard power supply as well as the ability to be directly connected, there are two different modes for being plugged in and not. Occasionally, with some programs, these settings will change a little. Fiddle around with the \u0022plugged in\u0022 options first, to test if this fixes it, then apply them to the battery power settings.

And I believe that many of the popular plugins that help narrow some of the more extreme privacy breaches work on most any browser now, so using IE needn\u0027t constitute an engraved invitation to malware/pesky-ware/adware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest having a backup browser installed for testing purposes at least though.

I have my Firefox browser stuffed with plugins and in the tightest usable lockdown mode I can devise; when it crashes or otherwise barfs on a webpage or page element, I start trying some of the others.
