If it were only that easy in real life. Yesterday night I watched this amazing documentary about the last space shuttle, the Atlantis. It\u0027s extremely impressive to see how many people are involved in the whole process towards the launch; from engineers to transport: this documentary gives you a great insight in how it\u0027s done. So next time you press space to launch, think about what you saw today... and be grateful all we have to do is pull up a dialog-box to load our craft in the blink of an eye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww7dDSM3ZjA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww7dDSM3ZjA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
