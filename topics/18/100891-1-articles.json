I\u0027ll have to go ask dad about the exact setup we had at that time, but I remember we had some new digital equipment that could tune in the neighbors wireless telephone handsets. Some of the conversations we eavesdropped on were interesting to say the least. Anyway, we had what I think was a teletype machine and commodore 64 connected to the ham radio equipment.

Sure was a whole lot easier than the Morse code. It wasn\u0027t long after that that my neighbor subscribed to Prodigy. I would consider our setup on the ham radio closer to today\u0027s internet than what Prodigy was. Prodigy was similar in that it used a computer, a modem, and a telephone, but wasn\u0027t really for communicating with the world. It was pretty much just a fancy newspaper. \n\nMy first encounter with what I would consider today\u0027s internet was actually at a rest area/truck stop in southern Minnesota on I-35 in 1999. The rest area had public internet access. I had no clue how e-mail actually worked.

In early 1983, that friend gave me a VIP account on his system so I could access them.\n\nAt work I used a 300-baud TI Silent 700...\n\n![texassilent700.gif](https://nnlm.gov/pnr/images/dragonfly/texassilent700.gif)\n\n...but soon had a 1200-baud connection from my 8-bit home computer. I\u0027d look up a pic, but can\u0027t remember which computer I had that year.\n\nI only recall a couple of details from those early days:\n\n1) I remember the changeover from \u0022bang path addressing\u0022 to domain-name addressing. My original email address went !something!something!ucbvax!ukma!myaccount. Then changed to the much more sensible [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81a4b6c3eef1f5e8eeefa4b6c5).\n\n2) I remember spending many hours getting Usenet adult pics to download overnight. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) A pic was usually in several parts which you had to download, assemble, then run uudecode on it to change it back from ASCII to binary. I automated that process so I could look over the Usenet headers, mark pics I wanted to check out, then macros in my terminal program did all the rest while I slept.\n\nedit: Just noticed the desk phone in that pic has the numbers going the wrong way! Anybody know what country that phone was from?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T13:45:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beowolf**"}]}
