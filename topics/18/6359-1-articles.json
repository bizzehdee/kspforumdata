This freezing could be for a number of reasons: hibernation, suspended animation, or natural cryopreservation. This \\\u0027natural cryopreservation,\\\u0027 in layman\\\u0027s terms, is to help an organism survive conditions that it normally could not. There are several organisms known to use this technique: waterbears, five species of frogs, three species of turtles, one species of salamander, and one species of snake. Now, these animals don\\\u0027t just go out and stick themselves in the snow, doing that would cause nasty ice crystals. To prevent those crystals, they use an antifreeze - \u003Cem\u003Esugar.\u003C/em\u003E (to be technical, it\\\u0027s glucose.)

Secondly, I do not believe (based on my limited knowledge of medical science) that we are particularly good at reviving clinically dead people, which is what a thawed body would count as. Thirdly, I must admit to finding it a little odd that no-one is trying to cryopreserve small mammals (which we humans are rather closely related to in terms of biochemistry) and then revive them at a later date. I find this odd because I think that doing such tests would extend our knowledge regarding how to protect mammalian biochemistry from the rigours of cryopreservation, and that such tests could be run quickly and cheaply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Gonzo","CreatedById":10735,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-05T14:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned in the OP; when you try to freeze a body, ice crystals will form among the cells. As the crystals expand, they will tear and rupture the cell walls. Glucose is the secret antifreeze that allows some organisms to go through this process without any issues. It works pretty much just like your car would; you put antifreeze in, and even though everything is frozen solid, liquid will still flow normally and allow your car to run. In the same way, glucose acts as an antifreeze and keeps the liquids in the body flowing despite the body being frozen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to humans though, the levels of glucose that certain frogs and fish use to undergo this process is enough to be fatal for any human being. From what I understand, it is totally possible for human beings to be frozen with cryogenics, and then revived. But it would take genetic engineering in order to make the human body capable of holding the high ratio of glucose required to survive the freezing. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-05T14:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHedgehogs hibernate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cepheus","CreatedById":10683,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-05T15:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the fact that such a high level of glucose would be enough to kill a person, there are two theoretical alternatives: along with the glucose, introduce a powerful insulin - like substance; or use a completely different antifreeze altogether.
