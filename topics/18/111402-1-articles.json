The concept would be a heavily modified KSP, but no planets, and just Mun and Kerbol as scenery objects because it would focus on the seas and lakes of Kerbin - and you would have this MASSIVE underwater world with tons of interesting things. Inland lakes would have more interesting things because you would have to build a rover to get a submarine there, or maybe a rocket designed for getting places quickly with the sub as the payload, but your oceans would be full of amazing things too. You still would have missions, but they would be like \u0022Recover an ancient drool bowl of King Kerbanuken XVII\u0022, or \u0022Bring us a specimen of the Giant Kerbtopus\u0022\n\n,,,I\u0027d buy it, they say the oceans are the last great unexplored biome on Earth, so I would think this could fly. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"victory143","CreatedById":80787,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:45:44Z","Content":"Perhaps.

Sea Program would need to have very detailed maps of a big chunk of ocean floor, or at least a way of generating it on the fly and allowing the player to revisit the same place later. \n\nSquare miles of rock and grasslands is fine for the Space Program, but once you start talking about visiting an underwater environment... you need a much higher level of detail and interactivity. \n\nAnd I\u0027d want to see some interconnectivity between the games.
