I need to make an MCNP model of one module on the International Space Station, and I\\\u0027m thinkin the Zvezda module since it actually has some sleeping quarters in it. The only problem is that the dimensions I found on wikipedia are for a cylinder... and Zvezda is not a cylinder. Furthermore, I have nothing about how thick the walls are, and how big the sleeping cubicle is for the astronauts or anything like that. I\\\u0027ve searched on nasa.gov for any sort of real numbers and I can\\\u0027t find anything. I was wondering if there were any die-hard space station junkies out there who might know a few numbers I can use to make a somewhat reasonable approximate model.

I did see a mention of shielding added after integration to the station, but it was just ballistic shielding over a few square meters, with a few (Kevlar?) panels quoted at \u002720 pounds\u0027 apiece. You\\\u0027re the one taking a nuclear physics course, but my understanding is that scattering/absorption is basically a question of how much mass a ray passes through and dedicated shielding is simply a matter of getting as much matter in a small space as possible, the opposite of every other non-reentering spacecraft constraint. The impression I get is that dedicated shielding is simply nonexistent in all US ISS modules, and with all respect to the Russian designers I don\\\u0027t expect them to have deviated much from the same economic challenges, especially since that specs link states Zvezda is a modified Soviet-era Mir. We\\\u0027re talking millimeters of aluminum. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.15.7252\u0026amp;rep=rep1\u0026amp;type=pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThese people\u003C/a\u003E are working on optimization of radiation shielding, and they basically mention dedicated shielding once and dismiss it. The rest of the paper is devoted to grouping internal equipment racks around the sleeping quarters and rotating the whole rest of the station towards the worst cosmic rays. The fact that the ISS orbit was initially designed to stick even further in the magnetosphere is another sign that radiation shielding is likely to be light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI focused on geometric resources because my best guess is that you\\\u0027re going to wind up subtracting inner from outer volumes, multiplying by published loft masses and treating the pressure hull as a homogeneous body - with separate equipment bays if you get really fancy.
