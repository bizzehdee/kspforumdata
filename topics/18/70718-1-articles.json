I can currently play the game in roughly 12-20 FPS, even while recording, which is great and all; but I want more. I\u0027m on just about the lowest settings possible (i have aerodynamic gfx quality one notch above for the flameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees), and am debating whether or not to upgrade my laptop (dell studio 1737)\u0027s motherboard, because the laptop came with the option of a dedicated gpu chipset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessor: intel core 2 duo t6400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam: 4 gb, not sure of speed.
