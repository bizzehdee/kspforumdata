But I never wanted KSP to be as advanced as Orbiter in that respect. KSP is about freedom to build things that may not work, and having fun exploding really expensive spacecraft, while based on an above-average-realism physics simulation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-11T00:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding crashing in Orbiter: it\\\u0027s generally taken that as a spaceflight simulator, the aspects of the program dealing with the \u0027ground\u0027 are fairly limited.
