Every fifteen minute since I\u0027ve opened it out of the packaging, it will shout phrases such as \u0027I AM THE EYE OF PROVIDENCE\u0027, \u0027PAX ROMANA\u0027 and \u0027THE SECRET IS WITHIN THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot find the source of the sound on the toy (speaker, etc) and I cannot find a battery compartment either. It\u0027s beginning to worry me very much as my dog will do nothing apart from stare at it incessantly for hours on end until he collapses from exhaustion. When he wakes up, he will continue to stare again. He is unresponsive to anything and he is becoming extremely emaciated.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewtf xD it is filled with reviews like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-madspy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T23:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
