You don\u0027t have as much control over espionage. The trade-off is the religions, and ability to influence game development through the spread of culture. Overall, I would still recommend it. In fact, I would venture to give it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) :D ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWhilst I probably preferred Civ IV to Civ V, when you go back and play IV there are a few annoying things you start to notice. I personally think the combat system in V is far better than the \u0022stack of death\u0022 tactics you had to employ in Civ IV. Other civs constantly pestering you to give them free technologies was also annoying in IV, and diplomacy in general is better in Civ V... well as long as you have the expansion packs. It was notoriously awful in the base game, as you could be effective allied with another civ for the entire game only for them to turn around and stab you in the back for absolutely no reason.\n\nJust a shame Civ V was so restrictive to mods. Some of the ones from Civ IV were quite literally like playing a new game.\n\nCiv V is definitely worth it, as it is a very good game that\u0027s also quite different to Civ IV, which makes it worth buying. It\u0027s also exactly why Beyond Earth absolutely isn\u0027t worth buying."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:59:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Homeworld Remastered is on sale, get it while it is hot!\n\nI was really excited...then I read the reviews.

The intention Gaben communicated is laudable, but without hard terms and conditions to back that up, it is nothing more than a pleasant suggestion. They are in no way obligated to do so, and as far as I am aware, have made no arrangements to makes this happen. Both a third party buying Steam and there being financial problems in paradise are scenarios where the people in charge of the money tend to keep it for themselves, meaning that there will be no effort to change availability. There are actually certain legal requirements for companies in trouble that would mostly forbid a move like these, further reducing chances of it ever happening. Though if you look at the legal conditions as they stand, they can pretty much pull the plug tomorrow if they please and there is little anyone can do.\n\nSo yeah, the future is hazy, but looking at how online services generally fare, and how big companies deal when it comes to consumer promises without any legal basis (and even then declaring bankruptcy will void any promises and contracts) there is little doubt how the end user game libraries will end up. I would love to be proven wrong, but it is somewhat silly to expect it. \n\nThe only realistic way of approaching things is that you view it is a renting service, for however long Steam will exist. Between 5-15 years seems a reasonable expectation. Consider your library already void, and you will be much happier in the future.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Another thought, there is also the possibility of Valve doing away with their current DRM scheme and making offline copies playable as part of their business strategy.

Files will get corrupt and other problems will arise. It might mitigate the problem for a little while, but it does not solve it. Though I will concede that it is more like a physical copy, which sooner or later gets damaged, incompatible or lost."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T01:03:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I hate the though of tying lots of money to Steam, as you never know when they call quits and everything is gone forever.
