For those unaware of this amazing game, Europa Universalis IV (Often shortened to EUIV/EU4) is a grand strategy game (fourth in it\u0027s series), developed by Paradox! You control a nation of your choosing (Or creation, with the El Dorado DLC) and lead it through the turbulent times of the Early Modern Period (Specifically 1444-1821), and can do many things, ranging from diplomacy to trade to conflict to colonialism, and most things in between. I\u0027ve been playing for a good 320 hours, so I know my way around the game. The (gameplay) DLCs that I will be using are:\n\n- Conquest of Paradise\n- Res Publica\n- Wealth of Nations\n- Art of War\n- El Dorado\n- Women in History\n- \n\nNo Common Sense, as I do not have it. \\*cries\\*\n\nThis thread is inspired by [this really cool thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78084-The-KSP-Forum-plays-Spore).\n\nSo now the first question: Who should we play as?\n\nI\u0027m thinking a custom nation. What should we call it? What religion should it be? Where should it be? What should it be focused on? The flag?\n\nYou decide (almost) each and every move!\n\nLe Tiny Print: Updates happen when I choose to. This game is being played alongside my Milan-Italy-Roman Empire Borders run, so progress may be slow. This will be my first time playing on ironman, so please don\u0027t mess up the directions *too* much! Please no OPMs in desolate areas, please no overly OP nations. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:15:00Z","Content":"Western nation on the European part of the Ottomans?\n\nWish I could play this game rather than just owning it:("},{"CreatedByName":"Science-Recon","CreatedById":97594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:54:37Z","Content":"Hmm, the Elysian Empire perhaps?\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480992180](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480992180)"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:59:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\u003E No Common Sense, as I do not have it. \\*cries\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nCommon Sense ain\u0027t that common.
