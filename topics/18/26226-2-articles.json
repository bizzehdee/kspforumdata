There\u0027s no way you could transit between the two with the spacesuit SAFER\u0027s ~3 m/s, or even the discontinued MMU\u0027s ~25 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It would take about 42 m/s just to lower your periapsis to ISS\u0027s altitude from Hubble\u0027s orbit. Then, if you managed to set your Pe right at ISS\u0027s AN or DN and were able to time it to the microsecond to reach that point exactly when the ISS did, your relative velocity would be around 3 km/s just due to the difference in inclination, which means you\u0027d smash into the ISS at ~6,700 mph.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-26T19:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2013 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve saw the first trailer last week when I saw Pacific Rim, I\u0027ve saw it in 3d, not IMAX.
