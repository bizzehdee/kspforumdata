This is just the kind of thing I find fun and challenging - how to get things done without spending a crap load of money. I had a big pile of reclaimed lumber from an old barn that I\u0027ve used up for different projects around the house. Removing screws often comes down to brute force and lots of patience. Sometimes, you just have to grind the screws down and leave them there. It actually kind-of adds character to the wood, depending on the project you have in mind. If your trying to separate 2 pieces of wood that are screwed together, nothing beats a saw-zaw, or a reciprocating saw. If there is room to position the saw correctly, the blade will slide between the 2 pieces of wood and cut through the screw.
