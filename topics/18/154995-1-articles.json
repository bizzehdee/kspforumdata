It is actually a big step forward. There are many good things about Windows 10 I like, then there are some features I miss about XP (like the Settings Transfer Wizard). I think that Windows 10 is probably as good as XP was; it is definitely better than Vista and, 7 and 8 in many non-gaming aspects. This new patch will be bringing it into line with competing Apple and other operating systems when it comes to gaming. True, there is a lot of things Windows could be better at, but at least they are willing to work on their platform to make it better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T12:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222924059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154995\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484597877\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t have much impact considering I use a 1.5GHz\u00A0AMD APU (for those who don\u0027t know, a APU is a CPU and GPU merged into one, but with the benefits of neither).
