It mocked the trope in gaming of the narrator dictating every action of the player\u0027s movement by having the Narrator say something, and having the choice to either follow it, or not. The second subject is the HD remake that got Greenlit on Steam in 2013. This version was very* *similar to the mod, except a lot was still different.*\n\nSorry, the Narrator was holding his grasp on me. So basically, this is a discussion thread about this awesome game worth all $15 the HD remake costs with many weird endings, and many choices. (The way I was introduced was by the Danny2462 video. I loved it, watched the Pewdiepie let\u0027s play, and got the game right after I got the demo. (It\u0027s a confusing demo, even for what the game is.)) So just go wild and say theories about this game! (But don\u0027t spoil it without saying you are intending to do so with a spoiler alarm.)\n\nThe Game: [http://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/)\n\nDanny2462 video:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnkqsLO1rTA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n(Kind of vice president of the thread: Camacha.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T00:43:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:07:16Z","Content":"To be honest, I do not think the experience should be reduced by talking about it.
