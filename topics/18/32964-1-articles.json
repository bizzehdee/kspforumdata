I go to YouTube and see all the wonderful videos and I just want to contribute to the fun, but seem to have problems. I noticed in Scott Manley\u0027s video about editing .cfg files and parts that he uses CamStudio and it\u0027s open source, so being an open source fan that was my natural choice. Unfortunately it has less than optimal performance for me as you can see in my first attempt here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BeQsRvV47mE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default encoder didn\u0027t work so I tried in SWF mode, which gave me a recording framerate of less than 5 per second, ick. The above video was recorded with the Microsoft Encoder on AVI which gave me a better framerate, but the quality of it is terrible and it seemed to slow down pretty much everything on the computer until I closed CamStudio itself (things were slow even when I wasn\u0027t recording). Also I don\u0027t seem to be able to record from microphone and the game simultaneously. I have a fairly decent computer, quad-core AMD A-8 Vision processor, AMD Radeon graphics, 12 GB RAM, and Windows 8. So my question is this: What sort of system stats, settings, and software do you use when recording your videos for YouTube?
