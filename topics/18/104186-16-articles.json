Lightning is looking for a low resistance path to the ground, the rubber tires are good insulators and prevent that. Faraday cages (of which a car is a very poor one) don\u0027t protect against lightning.\n\n[citation needed]\n\nLightning doesn\u0027t necessarily choose the absolute lowest resistance path to ground. The electrons actually flow in stages of a few hundred feet at a time. The tire itself might not conduct electricity, but the centimeters between the auto body and ground is nothing compared to the thousands of feet the electrons have already traveled. \n\nFaraday cages absolutely protect against lightning - they are commonly used in \u0022lightning simulators\u0022\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage)\n\nOlder all-metal skin cars are better at protecting than newer cars with their plastic shells. That being said, you still should not do anything stupid - don\u0027t open a window, don\u0027t touch the exterior, etc.\n\n[http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/cars-can-be-safe-place-during/17283636](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/cars-can-be-safe-place-during/17283636)\n\nLightning bolts are tens to hundreds of thousands of amps, and the current in two paths will depend on the ratio of 1/(resistance) between them. So a metal-ish car with a few ohms and a person with a skin resistance of a hundred thousand ohms (touching the car metal in two places) can cause several amps to flow through your body - more than enough to kill you. A few inches of airgap makes your resistance now hundreds of millions of ohms or more, enough to be mostly safe.\n\n[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html)\n\nEverything lightning strike is actually several \u0022strikes\u0022 - so the old adage \u0022lightning never strikes twice in the same place\u0022 is wrong. Even a consumer video camera should be able to capture the lightning stages.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLWIBrweSU8\u0026feature=youtu.be\u0026t=165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLWIBrweSU8\u0026feature=youtu.be\u0026t=165)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T15:51:41Z","Content":"Perhaps I need to facepalm. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Thanks for the references and correction."},{"CreatedByName":"vinster7","CreatedById":141172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T16:01:12Z","Content":"The moon has no gravity - 6th grade science teacher"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T16:18:15Z","Content":"At work we have an intern, and he is a bit dimwitted.
