Of course one of the biggest fallacies about bouncing the LASER off the moon is how far away the return beam would hit the Earth. If we fire the LASER from anywhere on the equator, for example, we would be traveling at 1040 MPH. The LASER travels at the speed of light and calculating the distance to and from the Moon would be 239,000 x2 =478,000 Miles. So, we take the speed of light, which is 186,282 Miles Per Second and we divide that into 478,000 miles and that gives us a round trip value of 2.566 Seconds. At 1040 MPH rotation speed at the equator, the LASER transmission point would travel .741 Miles or 3,912 feet during the 2.566 seconds of time it would take for the LASER beam to return. This figure will change for every latitudinal position the LASER might be fired from but the point here is that this calculation is never brought up because they always show the LASER TX \u0026 RX position at the same location. FAIL!!!Furthermore, If the LASER transmission point on the Earth is traveling at 1040 MPH then the LASER beam would be blazing across the surface of the moon at 1040 MPH also. You would have to be one hell of a marksman to hit that little 1 meter bad boy! :-)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E first off where is the big burnt hole from the lunar lander landing? there isn\u0060t one cause they took a trillion dollars of americans family\u0060s money on ........ please everyone stop believing this crap ,the only thing you got mooned is your money is gone and your poorer for it! are you not right now! man oh man WAKE UP!\n\nHow do people agree with this guy, seriously.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T22:08:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by windows\\_x\\_seven**\n  \nTypo, wrote \u0022Mun\u0022 instead of \u0022Moon\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:02:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All of these rockets are fake, the only rocket that can make it to the Moon is this one:\n\u003E [https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRFoz2LbDwmAEYFwpfb2enw9SpaDPZvcauP1_NU8TUyftGy9a9K0Q](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRFoz2LbDwmAEYFwpfb2enw9SpaDPZvcauP1_NU8TUyftGy9a9K0Q)\n\u003E \n\u003E Goes on a straight line and has its engine always on, as opposed to these rockets that start turning to land back on Earth instead of going to space, and also goes straight from point A to point B.\n\u003E \n\u003E Delta-V, Isp and Orbital Mechanics are all lies made by NASA.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E By the way, the \u0022gravity turns are fake\u0022 dude uploaded a new video recently: ****\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9yF38ftpFw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m amazed at the comments, though:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E WHY ^\n\u003E \n\u003E How do people agree with this guy, seriously.\n\nThe very fact that those people, and people like them, exist is enough to make me want to dedicate my life to eradicating stupidity from this good world.
