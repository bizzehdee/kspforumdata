The only way to run the DX version of KSP is by running the widows version under Wine and that will most likely perform even worse.\n\nOpenGL is often faster anyways, so hopefully the unity5 port improves how it performs with opengl."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:36:57Z","Content":"OpenGL will make the game run more stable in either platform, your problem might be somewhere graphics related though.\n\nTry reading the[Linux Thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread) and post more information about your pc\u0027s specs or you won\u0027t get much help."},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T11:21:22Z","Content":"You could try WINE under Linux.

DirectX started as a \u0022low end\u0022 high level API, specifically for games.\n\nIt\u0027s release by MS was the torpedo that sank [Fahrenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_%28graphics_API%29), and by extension SGI.

It\u0027s only really good for games, and it only runs on Windows.\n\nOpenGL is the superior API for any number of reasons bar one: DirectX is easier to code for (being higher level / more abstracted).

(Nearly?) all 3D games use it on those platforms, and KSP is no exception. If your system has low OpenGL performance it is nearly always a graphics driver issue. If you haven\u0027t already, you might increase performance by installing the proprietary graphics drivers. On nVidia that\u0027s more or less mandatory, as the\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYWzMvlj2RQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n. With AMD the situation is different. Both, the open source and the proprietary drivers are developed by AMD employees, yet the open source drivers lack some features, as there are intellectual property issues with open sourcing some parts of Catalyst [citation needed] (the situation [will change soon](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item\u0026px=AMD-AMDGPU-Released)). So, while the open source drivers offer (much) better desktop integration, the proprietary drivers might, depending on the game you\u0027re running, offer quite some performance increase (an educated guess is that most often it increases performance by 50%, sometimes even 100%, in rare cases it also worsens performance slightly). For Intel there is only one driver available for Linux (not counting the recent work on a [Gallium3D based Intel driver](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article\u0026item=intel_ilo_mesa103\u0026num=1)), so you\u0027re more or less stuck with it.\n Nevertheless, OpenGL is not the only 3D graphics API available on Linux. On some graphics drivers, namely those that use the Gallium3D driver model (in other words: the open source AMD driver, the recently developed Intel Gallium3D driver and a few drivers which are not really relevant on the desktop), even **Direct3D 9** is an option. Nevertheless, as far as I know only [Fedora supports gallium nine](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item\u0026px=Fedora-22-Gallium3D-D3D9) out of the box, with other distributions some manual work is required, that might very well end in a system that can no longer boot to a graphical user interface. As I\u0027ve never set up a gallium nine installation, all I can do is forward you to the [iXit website](https://wiki.ixit.cz/d3d9). But keep in mind, that for being able to use the direct3d state tracker you\u0027ll likely have to run the 32bit windows version of KSP through wine, severely limiting the memory that can be addressed by KSP..."},{"CreatedByName":"KazanNinja","CreatedById":133398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:15:35Z","Content":"Wow!
