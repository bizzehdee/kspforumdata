This was all just a bad rain storm. \u00A0Most trees, and therefore most power lines, are still up. Also, no winds meant no flying debris, so rescuers by air, land,and flooded road could get in there immediately. \u00A0Still,\u00A0it came from nowhere, instead of giving us several days to prepare like a hurricane does, and the downstream rivers are\u00A0flooding way above any historical records. Many folks, relying on previous experience of not flooding, stayed put, and are now having to be rescued, \u00A0And then the storm moved west and did the same sort of thing to Lafayette and surrounding areas. \u00A0About half the state is flooded right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thoughts are with all those who have lost everything in this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-15T04:39:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2016 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T13:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKudos to you for all the work you\u0027ve put in to help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T14:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never heard about that...

Especially because about 3/4 of rain east of the Mississippi all fell Friday morning, and the bulk of the rain west of the Mississippi all fell Saturday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, some local damage. \u00A0My bailiwick is a peninsula of high ground and hills surrounded on 3 sides by flood plain, so the water didn\u0027t pool up. \u00A0Instead, it quickly ran off down the various creeks and bayous. \u00A0These of course way overflowed their banks and wiped out whatever was close to them, but those were the only problem areas we had. \u00A0Most folks live on the ridges between waterways so only a small fraction of our total population is now homeless. \u00A0We also lost a few bridges, and apparently 1 idiot who decided to try kayaking at the height of the storm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/KfMBAL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002201 Solitude

\u0022low water bridge\u0022 (basically an improved ford) across Bayou Sara. \u00A0The water level is already back nearly to its normal level at this spot just 48 hours later, which is why this sorry excuse for a \u0022bridge\u0022 suffices. \u00A0However, at its height, the water line was about at eye level where I was standing when I took this pic. \u00A0Rather surprisingly, the bridge itself

\u00A0Thus, in the several days we normally have before a hurricane hits, we evacuate all these folks. \u00A0This time, we had no warning so they\u0027re all trapped, except for a few breadwinners who left early for work Friday morning. \u00A0However, these folks have all their utilities still running and their houses didn\u0027t flood, so they\u0027re not in danger. \u00A0We can get supplies in there to them (and some can get their own with personal 4WDs), and can get medics in there if needed. \u00A0The main problem is, we can\u0027t get a fire truck in there so hopefully none of them will get stupid with fire until the bridge gets fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/KfMB6N\u0022 rel=\u0022external

Big and Little Bayou Sara. \u00A0As you can see, it was moved about 30 yards off its foundations by a colossal flow moving from right to left. \u00A0All the houses in this neighborhood (about 20) got about 5 feet of water in them. \u00A0We evacuated all these people when the water was only about 1-2 feet deep here, so nobody got hurt when this happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/L3h1ow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002204 Site of

Road where it crosses Alexander\u0027s Creek. \u00A0At the height of the flood, the water level was even with the bridge deck in the background so was about 6\u0027 deep in the low area in the foreground. \u00A0Note that the creek bed is about 20 feet deep below the bridge and normally has only a trickle in it. \u00A0This is the east side of the bridge and there\u0027s a similar low spot on the west side, although it\u0027s only about 2-3 feet below the bridge deck. \u00A0Anyway, Friday afternoon at the height of the flood, a kid waded the west part, walked across the bridge, and tried to wade this part. \u00A0He didn\u0027t make it and got washed into the woods on the left side of the road about even with the sign, where he clung to a tree. \u00A0Fortunately, he had a less-adventurous friend who called for help. \u00A0So 8 of us got on a rope, 7 in a line from this end of the bridge out into the deep area, then fed the 8th guy out on the end of the rope to the kid. \u00A0He got a life jacket on the kid, tied him to the rope, and then we hauled them both back. \u00A0This operation took only about 10 minutes from arrival to completion and was the only bit of semi-derring-do in my area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/L3gZNU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg

it was for trains but because the deck of the bridge was made of 3 old flatcars in classic \u0022redneck engineering\u0022 style. \u00A0It was on Island Road\u00A0over Williams\u00A0Creek. \u00A0Needless to say, it didn\u0027t survive. \u00A0Fortunately, both ends of Island Road. are accessible from other roads so this isn\u0027t as much of an inconvenience as the Jaycock Road bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good\u00A0news is that the main bridge of US Hwy 61 over Thompson Creek is OK, despite having been totally submerged for a while. \u00A0Initial reports were that it had been damaged, which would have been a big problem because it\u0027s the main supply route into my bailiwick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s about the it for my

August....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the big picture, I really don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening in the Lafayette area because my TV news comes out of Baton Rouge so is, of course, focused on local events. \u00A0But in the Baton Rouge area, the water has largely drained away at the latitude of Baton Rouge so from there north is now in recovery mode. \u00A0However, this just means the water is now further south, where it\u0027s still overrunning new neighborhoods and rescues are still going on down there. \u00A0This will probably continue for another day or 2 before the water finally dumps into Lake Maurepas to the NW of New Orleans. \u00A0See, the Mississippi River runs SE from Baton Rouge to New Orleans and the several smaller rivers, the ones that overflowed and flooded everybody, run parallel to the Mississippi instead of dumping into it. \u00A0And people live all long them, so this is going to keep happening all the way to the mouths of the smaller rivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the water now gone in the northern area, folks can get back in there and begin assessing damage and starting repairs and recovery. \u00A0This has started firming up the numbers on the size of this disaster. \u00A0The most shocking number I heard was that about 85% of all homes in Livingston Parish (2010 population over 128,000) were \u0022totally destroyed\u0022, although AFAIK from pictures (I haven\u0027t been there myself) they\u0027re still standing. \u00A0So I take this to mean all the contents ruined and the house requiring all the wall board\u00A0and flooring\u00A0replaced, but still structurally sound. \u00A0Anyway, folks are now going back home in these areas and trying to make the best of the situation. \u00A0Already the sidewalks of Denham Springs are taking on the typical Louisiana post-storm look.of piles of soggy sofas, mattresses, carpets, and ruined refrigerators as people start cleaning out their houses. \u00A0And this is just 1 of the 20 parishes (including mine) now in the federal disaster area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo obviously there\u0027s a HUGE number of people severely impacted by this, certainly well over 100,000. \u00A0Many of these folks have\u00A0nothing but the clothes on their backs.. \u00A0And while relief efforts largely focus on filling their personal survival needs, that\u0027s really only the tip of the iceberg here in terms of long-term recovery. \u00A0Just as so many houses flooded, so did all the adjacent businesses and schools. \u00A0Even if charities, FEMA, and insurance help them get their households back online, many of these people aren\u0027t going to hang around if they have no job and their kids can\u0027t go to school. \u00A0So I suspect that, just as about half the pre-Katrina population of New Orleans never returned there, there will be a large and permanent exodus from this disaster area. \u00A0We might even see a net population drop in my own, high-and-dry bailiwick, simply because we\u0027re mostly a bedroom community for Baton Rouge, so many of our residents have lost their jobs. \u00A0But OTOH, we have functioning schools with high reputations within the state (but with Louisiana\u00A0usually ranking about 49th out of 50 in public education, isn\u0027t really saying much), so we\u0027ll probably see some influx for that reason. \u00A0But there will be a lot of major disruptions over a this whole region for a long time to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very curious as to what FEMA will do this time around to provide temporary housing. \u00A0Back in Katrina, there were the now-infamous \u0022FEMA Trailers\u0022, which were small, cheap, shoddily built, and lacking many normal health-and-safety features. \u00A0They were so poorly made that they started falling apart after a few weeks. \u00A0Some folks used these as intended, parked in their driveways while they rebuilt their real homes, and that worked OK. \u00A0But quite a few Katrina refugees from New Orleans came from public housing and had been unemployed before the storm. \u00A0They had nothing of their own to go back to, no control over rebuilding their former homes, and no ability to better their situations, so for them the trailers became permanent quarters. \u00A0Soon the vast refugee trailer parks planted around the region sank into abject squalor and much more suffering and associated crime ensued. \u00A0Yesterday, I heard the governor and the local FEMA honcho saying they were NOT going to repeat that, but \u0022no plans were in place\u0022 for what they were going to do instead. \u00A0That\u0027s a bit ominous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still trying to wrap my head around the amount of water that suddenly dumped on us the other day. \u00A0The number of acre-feet is just off the charts. \u00A0They say this was a \u00221000-year flood\u0022. \u00A0The small rivers all exceeded their previous all-time record levels by about 5 feet. \u00A0Considering that the land around them is very flat, 5 feet of height makes a huge amount of extra width, which is why so many places that had never come close to flooding before got flooded this time. \u00A0And there\u0027s still no official name for this disaster. \u00A0Some are calling it the \u0022Great Flood\u0022, some the \u0022Historic Flood\u0022, some the \u0022Big Rain\u0022, and several others. \u00A0Hurricanes are less confusing because they have their own unique names.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown at the small picture level, I\u00A0have today\u00A0off. \u00A0I spent yesterday going door-to-door documenting damage to personal property (houses, cars, etc.) in areas away from the creeks and bayous. \u00A0My parish is a huge pile of Pleistocene loess so has lots of little terrain undulations across the surface. \u00A0When a large tract of land gets broken up into subdivision lots, some of these lots necessarily are in the low spots between little hills. \u00A0Rain runoff goes to these low spots but they have storm drains so this isn\u0027t usually a problem. \u00A0However,\u00A0this storm made so much rain so fast that it overwhelmed the drain\u00A0systems, so a number of these lower houses got some water in them, from a few inches to about 1 foot. \u00A0That\u0027s not nearly as bad as flooding to the window sills or higher, but it\u0027s still a serious problem for the residents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, things have calmed down a lot where I live and are starting to get back to normal. \u00A0Most of our spare bedrooms and all our motel rooms are full, and the schools are trying to figure out how many more students they can handle. \u00A0Meanwhile, we still await possible deployment to other places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-26T09:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this happened while I was
