Just little snippets and bits and pieces at a time, not even really paying attention to any structure or organization. Then, when it came time to actually write the paper, I\u0027d often find that I had enough information that I could just copy and paste whatever I had already written into another document, get it organized the way I wanted it, edit it a little to make it more unified and coherent, maybe type out an introduction and some concluding remarks if I didn\u0027t already have one ready, and convert my little personal reference notes into formal citations.

Instead of focusing on the One Big Thing that you know you\u0027ll have to do in the near future, focus on the little things that you know won\u0027t take you that much time, effort, and pressure to get done. Before you know it, those little things will start building up and looking a lot like what you want the One Big Thing to end up like, and the rest of that One Big Thing won\u0027t look so hard to work on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
