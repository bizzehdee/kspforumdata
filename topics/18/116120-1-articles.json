Your apparatus will last longer and safety will improve.\n\nAs a tip: only use aluminium that has been cast before. Cans, extrusion profiles et cetera will be harder to cast and a lot more contaminated. Get some nice cast scrap. Also, first melt things down into loafs of aluminium to remove contaminants, then use it to cast. It is more work, but should yield better results.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Trust me water and molten metal don\u0027t mix, most times it\u0027s fine but there\u0027s that random roll that ruins your day and sends you to the burn unit in the hospital.\n\nSteam explosions are the biggest danger in casting. You really absolutely positively need to be superduper sure that the stuff you use if dry. Anything even damp can seriously ruin your day and permanently disfigure you. Stuff either blows up in your face, or worse, sinks to the bottom of your crucible before turning to steam. That means you get a face full of steam powered molten aluminium.\n\nCasting is a lot of fun, but safety is the the number one, two and three concern. This is not just a matter of burning your fingers. Temperatures are a lot higher than most other things people do, and results are accordingly devastating. This also means practicing your run without heat before you do it for real, wearing at least leather but preferably something better, \\*NO\\* synthetics (unless kevlar or specific fire resistent stuff), having solid leather boots without laces or openings the stuff can run into, no pockets and shoes tucked well inside your pants (things should be able to run down your clothes without encountering ledges or pockets, much like roof tiles on a house), proper face and respiratory protection (which is more because it is scrap than because it is aluminium).\n\nInform yourself about all necessary safety precautions and adhere to them. Casting is dangerous.\n\nEdit:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Gloves: check\n\u003E Coveralls: Probably not\n\u003E \n\u003E Boots: check\n\u003E \n\u003E Mask: half-check (half face mask)\n\u003E \n\u003E My mold will be foam inside of wet sand. the molten aluminum instantly vaporizes the foam and fills the void. Its a cheap reusable mold.\n\u003E \n\u003E I will have water buckets and hoses for extinguishing. (and guys this is charcoal we\u0027re talking about here)\n\nFor the love of Jeb, all the water bits will hurt you very quickly ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif) Read up on what you are going to do. NO water in your molds. Foam is fine, it just stinks a lot. NO water to extinguish fires. Even wet sand below your melter can lead to nasty accidents, as crucibles sometimes crack. Some people even say there needs to be a dry layer of sand on top of cement or concrete, as both contain water and the extremely high temperatures force it out. That is mostly true for iron casting (almost thrice the temperature), though also applies to aluminium.\n\nNO WATER. Learn how the materials you are using burn and how to extinguish them safely. Sorry for repeating myself, but it is a cardinal rule if you intend to stay safe.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe I should just buy a bunch of bricks and make a little cube oven for this. Would that work better? I could make it out of fire bricks and fireplace mortar. and a door on it out of the fire bricks.\n\nYou want some round-ish setup, so things can swirl around for optimal combustion ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T17:45:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T00:43:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E also, it\u0027s not like I was gonna get sniff happy around the smelter. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI\u0027m not going to quote a random statistic here, but just realise how often you breathe in and out of your nose (the nose, of course, providing a pathway that is that much closer to the blood-brain barrier.)\n\nI am not an expert in material sciences, but trusting a YouTube \u0022internet fame\u0022 video is a horribly bad idea. Trusting a stranger on a forum is also a horribly bad idea; but the general warnings being pushed at you should be taken over a fool who cares more about views than consumer safety. Do your research, talk to people who have done this before; even how you haven\u0027t secured your smelter down concerns me as it doesn\u0027t take much to turn that into a hazardous situation.\n\nI understand that the bucket likely feels heavy on its own, but if a solid kick can knock it down, it isn\u0027t heavy enough. The ease of you doing something simple like dropping your tongs and while you\u0027re reaching down to pick them up you shift your footing and knock the smelter over should be taken into consideration. At the very least, you should surround the thing with cement bricks, (which are easy to sort of \u0022secure\u0022 without needing mortar)."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T01:52:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Lajo, just wondering.
