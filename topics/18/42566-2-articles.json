Cost savings was one of the reasons for doing the Shuttle, but it turned out in practice to be a myth. It cost more to refurbish the orbiter between missions than it would have to use a 1-shot rocket to do the same job, and mass-produced 1-shot rockets could have done many more launches per year, too. The cost of refurbishment very quickly led to the abandonment of plans to reuse the SRBs because it was cheaper (and probably safer) to make new ones. This is why the Shuttle\u0027s been replaced by 1-shot rockets and why nobody else is building Shuttles of their own. Bottom line: if reusability was such a good idea, you\u0027d see a lot more of it, especially in the cost-conscious private sector\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even assuming SpaceX has this problem sorted (which remains to be seen), I still wonder why they don\u0027t use parachutes.

They also offer the disadvantage of not allowing precise landings. If you think about it, they still needed most of the fuel in order to return to the landing site to begin with. When you factor that in, the remaining fuel to soft land vs the weight of parachutes becomes a no brainer.
