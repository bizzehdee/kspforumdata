An energetic railroad action movie.\n\nMiddle: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The book was really boring in the first part, and so the first part of the movie seemed slower, so it caused me to lose all interest in HP.\n\nWorst: Frozen.

It is truly amazing, it has everything, and even rockets and space ! good actors/acting, plot and universe.\n\nMiddle : not sure, i always either like a movie or dislike it. If it\u0027s middle/meh, i tend to consider it simply bad... so i\u0027ll give another one i like :\n\nThe right stuff : just awesome\n\nWorst : must be captain america. During the whole movie i kept wondering wether it was a parody or not. Turns out it isn\u0027t. It is actually so bad, wrong and ridiculous that it could be a good parody."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T18:59:59Z","Content":"Best: The General, by Buster Keaton.

Liked it, just isn\u0027t as epic as I thought it would be.\n\nWorst: As many has said, Frozen. It\u0027s terrible and has so many plot holes that it just gets irritating. Overrated by the mostly 6 year old girl fan base.

Fantastically paced with a great and large list of characters who - each and every one - have meaningful interactions with each other and the main bad guy. Plus, action. Prior to 3 years ago, the Best award went to Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nWorst: I\u0027m trying to go through the list of movies that I stopped watching partway through, and am reminded of Halle Berry\u0027s Gothika, which tricked me into watching it all the way to the end even though it went from fairly decent to TERRIBLE at about the midway point.

Some people might call it a \u0022so bad that it\u0027s good\u0022 movie, but I thought that it was just bad. I swear, there was not technical adviser on that movie at all. Plus, the CGI was quite literally all at about 5 FPS (When I first saw the CGI, I thought that Netflix was bugging out. Then I realized that that\u0027s just how the frame rate was.
