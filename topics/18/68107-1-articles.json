This was 1100 meter above ground so speed was close to ground speed. Small meteorites does not impact in high supersonic speed, you can see their impact and its not so impressive, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap021118.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap021118.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn massive meteorite will not be slowed much by atmosphere as it has lite surface area compared to mass so it will hit harder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note is that most medium sized meteorites 1-30 meter tend to air-burst, both the two in Russia the 100 year separated and multiple other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this is because of the reentry stresses it and if its not an robust rock this will cause it to break up and loose parts, this will increase the surface area who again increases the stress and heating causing more fragmentation, who increase it even more in an runaway faction and yes this is very good as it the one who hit Russia last year would be far more dangerous if it hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
