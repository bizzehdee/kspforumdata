Living in the US (specifically Florida), I know the NAR is very big on licensing after you outgrow the \u0022over-the-counter\u0022 engines. Could anyone give me a general direction I should follow to get the most out of the project in a year (and not break any laws in the process, of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). I\u0027ll be 18 in the first weeks of October, and have access to a shop and materials. Any tips or stories are appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBudgie\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
