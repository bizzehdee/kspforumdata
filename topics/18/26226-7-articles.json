Not everything needs to be told in movies. That\u0027s something most popular American movies tend to do. They explain everything and leave nothing to think about. The closure was there. Stone experienced an emotional rollercoaster and complete catharsis of her character. It was literally what Cuar\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B3n has said - she was in enclosed in her own state of mind and had to shed away her protection to reach the final safety. Words are unnecessary.

Breathtaking film. I loved the silence and grandeur of it all. As others have stated it won\u0027t win awards for accuracy in orbital mechanics, but it does nail that feeling of being in space for viewers who didn\u0027t have a clue before as to what it is like. I really enjoyed the movie, although like others I did have some hang-ups...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere Be Spoilers:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FAFAFA;\u0022\u003E1) Orbits - From what I can gather, the makers of the film simply took everything that everyday people know that was up in space (Shuttle, Hubble, ISS, Tiangong, every single tracking and telecommunication satellite), and put them in a single orbit and within ~100km of one another. There is no low-, high-, or geosynchronous orbits, there is just Earth Orbit and things will fall but no one talks about them going higher (unless you\u0027re the astronaut tumbling out into space). Then they treated the relationships between these objects as if they were flying through the atmosphere, i.e. debris will rotate the earth at faster speeds but won\u0027t escape, merely catch-up to the \u0022slower\u0022 stations. While this blows tons of holes in the plot, it does free the director from having to explain orbital transfers and rendezvous. To the average viewer, flying between objects in space is like driving from one gas station to another, just head \u0022west\u0022 along a single plane as they said in the movie. If you accept this, the story does work in the same fashion that Twister does: our hero runs for cover but is chased away every 90 minutes.

She was a medical engineer, trained for only six months to install a medical-based instrument on the Hubble. Yet we don\u0027t hear that this was an emergency repair, unless I\u0027m mistaken. So why the rush to get her up there? Why couldn\u0027t a veteran astronaut be trained to install the equipment? Afterall they do it all the time, and they rehearse it over and over for years even before a mission to make sure they got it right. Ryan would have certainly been a consultant/contractor. The rest of the crew didn\u0027t even seem to know Ryan, where she was from, whether she had family, etc. It was all very odd for a seemingly routine mission. I also think she would have had a difficult time being sent up there if she had to pass a psyche exam, given her tragic history. I get why they did it though. Ryan is supposed to be the unlikely astronaut, a rookie, anxious and untested. She is meant to represent the average viewer, a window for our senses. And it certainly works. The audience around me were clutching their seats and gasping with every hand-rail Bullock missed and every debris that whizzed by. They didn\u0027t express that at all for Clooney.

I guess this was meant to be an early sample for viewers on how micro-gravity works or an attempt to lighten the mood before all hell broke loose. I didn\u0027t feel it though.

The speed at which Kessler syndrome took hold was also faster than seemed reasonable, and again, it would be impossible to take out so many classes of satellites (communication, GPS, etc.) which in reality are in very different orbits, but once again it served the story so I didn\u0027t mind it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026lt;/SPOILERS\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of this detracted from the movie at all, it still worked as a pulse-pounding survival thriller and a moving metaphorical examination of the human experience.
