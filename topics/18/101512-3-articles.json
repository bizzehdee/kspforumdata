Consequence of not acting: catastrophic.\n\nOf course, that was nine years ago, and all we\u0027ve done since then is to accelerate carbon production. And the catastrophes are starting to occur. There\u0027s methane bubbling out of Siberia much faster than expected ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis#Current_outlook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis#Current_outlook)), and there\u0027s some suggestion that we\u0027re already seeing climate-driven wars ([http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/03/02/study_climate_change_helped_spark_syrian_civil_war.html](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/03/02/study_climate_change_helped_spark_syrian_civil_war.html)).\n\nThat\u0027s the big danger; the chance that we\u0027re going to trash ourselves by more traditional means before runaway warming has the chance to do it for us. Climate change is a threat multiplier; it makes all of the existing problems of the world more volatile. Water shortages, food shortages, refugee flows; these are all factors that are known triggers for war. Desperate people do desperate things.\n\nBTW, for population, see: [http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies?language=en](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies?language=en) Things aren\u0027t quite as bad as they seem on that issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T12:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T12:50:11Z","Content":"thoughts on this?

Deserts will not turn into lush areas. Zero evidence or theoretical predictions for that.\n\nWhat we see is an increased amount of energy in the atmosphere and hydrosphere, leading to more temperature and wind extremes: friggid cold waves, insane heat waves, worse and worse storms.\n\nFew years ago Arctic was turned into a completely passable sea *for the first time in the history of humanity*. That is not normal.\n\nSpecies are migrating. Tropical marine species are migrating towards the north because of the elevated seawater temperatures. That is extremely dangerous for natural variety of life in one area and it is detrimental to the fishery industry. By marine species I don\u0027t mean only fishes which compete with domestic ones. I also mean zooplankton - jellyfish included. They wreck havoc on juvenile fishes, destroying the fish stock.\n\nInsects are migrating. Europe is bombarded by dangerous tiger mosquitos. Domestic mosquitos survive winter.\n\nSummertime weeds survive winters, some of them are allergenic.\n\nThis and many more things are happening. It is difficult to accept for people who live in regions of USA where arctic airmasses blow. They are obviously more prone to think there is no global warming. But the rest of the world is having more and more problems.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This isn\u0027t going to be the end for humanity, the environment can only harm us so much.\n\u003E If worst comes to worst, eventually we\u0027ll update our technology and that will help.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once hybrids and electric cars become mainstream across the world, that\u0027ll help a little.\n\nIt\u0027s not going to be the end, but it will cause lots of death over a great period of time. Party is over. This is an extinction level event for many species already, but not a sudden one, so you can\u0027t make a superhero movie about it and people don\u0027t give a crap because their lives aren\u0027t endangered in a way like when an asteroid is about to cover their house with a kilometre of ocean or molten rock.\n\nHybrids will not help.\n\nElectric cars will not help if we continue to produce energy from coal.\n\nSolar panels will not help."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T14:38:42Z","Content":"The arctic is not completely navigable, and the open extent is not unique in history, either."},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T14:55:37Z","Content":"vote for the party that doesn\u0027t play the \u0022I\u0027m not a scientist\u0022 card.

At this point, fighting climate change is a political problem, not a technological one.\n\n I agree with this. Although, international non-governmental organizations like Greenpeace, [UNFCCC](http://unfccc.int/2860.php) (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), etc. exist (and are doing a fantastic job of spreading the word of the major impacts of climate change can have). I think that we need *one* country to step up to the plate, act as the catalyst of change, and the rest of the world will follow suit. There are many examples throughout history that pertain to this idea, take the Kyoto Protocol for example. It was a multilateral agreement, and when the United States of America stepped out Kyoto, it had a ripple effect across the whole agreement. Soon, the time will come when we **need** to do something, and I hope the reaction to that won\u0027t be too late.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sometime it\u0027s worse than that.

This actually scares me, and shows how many political agendas do not involve concepts and ideas in order to remediate the problem which is climate change. This again promotes the need for a hegemonic organization to lead meetings in order to put the framework in place to stop climate change. I feel that if no country steps up this problem climate change will not be solved, and may potentially get worse."},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:13:18Z","Content":"This just came up in my feed.\n\nFlorida\u0027s Department of Environmental Protection BANS \u0022climate change\u0022 and \u0022global warming\u0022 from all official communications.\n\n[http://guff.com/florida-officials-ban-the-term-climate-change/20?ts_pid=2](http://guff.com/florida-officials-ban-the-term-climate-change/20?ts_pid=2)\n\nClimate Change could end up being the \u0022Galileo\u0022 of our age.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T23:15:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:39:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This just came up in my feed.\n\u003E Florida\u0027s Department of Environmental Protection BANS \u0022climate change\u0022 and \u0022global warming\u0022 from all official communications.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://guff.com/florida-officials-ban-the-term-climate-change/20?ts_pid=2](http://guff.com/florida-officials-ban-the-term-climate-change/20?ts_pid=2)\n\u003E \n\u003E Climate Change could end up being the \u0022Galileo\u0022 of our age.\n\nIndeed.

The house being on fire already is not a good reason to continue pouring petrol on it.\n\nBut the barriers to having that action occur are political, not scientific. And hence beyond the scope of this forum; the inevitably political discussion around barriers to climate action would not be suited to the social norms here.\n\nApart from anything else, the usually beneficial rules of enforced politeness here prohibit treating denialist misinformation with the contempt it deserves. Compulsory civility can be used to manufacture false equivalency, and as the recent debate around vaccination shows, there are times when massed withering scorn is the most appropriate and effective response to harmful nonsense.\n\nSo I mostly stay out of these threads apart from providing an occasional reference.\n\nDiscussing climate change, and advocating for responses to it, is extremely important. But doing it here will achieve little apart from ruining the civility of the forums, and it is an issue of sufficient importance that it\u0027s worth advocating for in venues where it can be given the full-throated support it deserves.\n\nSo thinks me, anyway. YMMV."}]}
