Streaming also makes them a bit grainy (milage may vary, my gear VR doesn\u0027t let me tether, only WiFi allowed). That\u0027s a problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHowever, even had the image been crystal clear and in full view, it\u0027s still not ideal. What I probably really want to do is look around in some virtual console, where if you look down, you see a big ole nav ball, if you look left, you see your staging icons, etc, be able to focus my attention on part of the display like I do with a PC screen. I don\u0027t need a 4k headset, I need to have a headset that lets me look around on a 4k console, if you will.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSo, with the current setup of KSP where head tracking moves the camera position but the UI just stays where it is, that\u0027s not really going to happen.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for me personally, my conclusion is that the UI of KSP, which works just fine for a big PC screen, doesn\u0027t really work for me for this format, in it\u0027s current form. It could be fun if you just want to do a bit of flight simming (eyeballing most of it), but it makes the other components of the game I like (like designing craft, setting up manouvering, finnicking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budgets, doing suicide burns etc.) really hard. If I really want to get my 3d (which is admittedly not the same as VR) on in KSP at this moment , I\u0027d probably\u00A0go looking for a cheap (passive) 3d monitor and just use Vireio, TriDef or VorpX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rade Krman","CreatedById":151595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T19:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut but but, what about VR in IVA?
