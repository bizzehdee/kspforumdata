It looks very cool, has a very polished and easy to use UI, great mechanics and physics. All asteroids have their own gravitational field,can be mined, they can slingshot you, you can get into orbit, land, dock with ships, fly on comets-the first part was awesome, but the campaign was too short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp make episode 2 a reality and help the devs!
