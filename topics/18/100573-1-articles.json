The speed of the portal \u0022projectile\u0022 is equal to the speed of light, and has no limit that we know of. Makes a system with a ton of tiny guns like that in a secured place, maybe on the moon, planting one end where they are, and then shooting the other end everywhere in space and then wait till something connects to another body that may have the same make up as the moon, then send a probe over to see things."},{"CreatedByName":"temporalExile","CreatedById":127675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:49:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The portals works on a special material made from moon dust only.
