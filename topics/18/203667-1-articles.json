I like the people here, I like the way they help, but I think that I\u0027ll have to say goodbye to my profile. You see, I just can\u0027t find anything interesting in those forums anymore, I also don\u0027t really need help with mods because I\u0027m thinking about quitting KSP anyway, also KSP1 has already got it\u0027s last Major update. It\u0027s the end for me. And my classmate has died because of heart failure, so I\u0027m not really in the mood for gaming at all, I\u0027ll have to change the vibe of my life, turn it the other way, experience something new, not getting stuck on the KSP \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for hours of the day, in which instead I can do helpful things to my neighbors, pass time with my friends, this game almost ate me. I had an addiction to KSP1 which I wanted to stop and I did it, at the last moment, I am quitting KSP and the Forums. This may be the last post you will see on this profile. Thank you for letting me participate in the forums, people. This\u00A0experience was magnificent,\u00A0but I should do other things in my life. I will uninstall Kerbal Space Program from my computer and forget everything that just happened over the months. I just can\u0027t go further on Kerbal Space Program anymore, I barely even post any content anymore. I just understood that I cannot make a career out of this, if it\u0027s tiring. I did not even reach Mars on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, because the game became the nothingness of my long life. So once again, thanks for all of the nice things people, this was really the best community on the internet, but I will just stop, there is no other choice for me rather than stopping all of this. Thanks. I wish the best of the world to you! From now on, I will abandon my profile. It will be left buried in the history rubble of the forums to remind that I was here. Goodbye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T05:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGaming addiction is a very real and serious matter, so I won\u0027t try and convince you to stay.

Losing someone close can be devastating, and afterwards the smallest things can seem insurmountable. It can seem like an easy choice to just give in, but if you keep getting up each day and doing something, it will get easier eventually, sorry there is no rushing it, but it will happen. This is just a nice game and forum to distract us from the harshness of real life. Your life, and feeling right in it are far more important. Please be strong. most people can\u0027t be there with you, but it doesn\u0027t mean that you are alone.
