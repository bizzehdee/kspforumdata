After a lot of playing around , and after finding out that the Mi Band is by far the cheapest one around, and with considerable protection and battery life, I got intrigued. However, I also found out that it does not have a heart rate monitor, is a bit generous on the steps, and the LEDs do not light up correctly, which was a disappointment. And then MiBand 1S came out, with a new heartbeat monitor. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways, this is great and all, but there is not enough information about it avalaible to satisfy me - not even in the official Mi.com page, which doesn\u0026#39;t include it for some reason. So, if anyone knows whether or not the steps are more accurate, the heart rate monitor is accurate enough, and if generally it is a worthwhile improvement over the original Mi Band, I would really appreciate it. Oh, and how much the monitor lowers the battery life. I do not worry about it much though, since the original held for at least a month.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS: I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, so yes, I can use the Smart Unlock feature. Which is one of the main reasons I tend to gravitate towards the Mi products.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T14:09:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coga19000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
