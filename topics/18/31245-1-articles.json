I bet a mod would probably move this to the Junkyard hehehe), I too started with Orbiter, before I discovered KSP. I have to admit that, some of the more difficult concepts to figure out in Orbiter, I now understand better, after having played KSP. My grounding in math and physics is not that solid, so when I read tutorials and discussions on certain maneuvering subjects in Orbiter-related fora, I usually get lost \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E But after \u0022relearning\u0022 about the principles while doing KSP, I must admit I understand them a lot better now.
