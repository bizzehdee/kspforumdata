I\u0027m resigning as of this thread. The KSP community has nothing left for me and I just randomly click links trying to find something on here that I have even a blink of interest in. I don\u0027t play KSP anymore, either. I\u0027m also trying to cut down on my use of electronics and this forum isn\u0027t helping any. I\u0027m moving onto greener pastures, as the saying goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be reading, but not replying to any comments left on this thread. Merry Christmas to you all.
