I believe it is an strategic time\u00A0to prepare our community.... just in case, right?\u00A0 Elon needs space candidates and rocket seats filled.

Hear me out, it wouldn\u0027t be worth much now, but in the world of meme coins today. Heck it could potentially make modding actually worth peoples time in the future. As the original creator of kerbalized SpaceX, I can attest,\u00A0It takes so much effort to get the mods out at the pace and quality people on this forum do. I\u0027ve witnessed the power people can have when they come together and that leaves me asking myself... Why cant we do something like that? I\u0027m learning about crypto atm by creating my own currency and figured hey, this could be a cool test case.... If something like this existed, how do you guys think it would work?\u00A0 Like could we start by giving everyone on the forums a certain number of coins if they wanted them?\u00A0 Any ideas really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-19T14:47:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2021 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by harrisjosh2711\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EToo much misinformation and attention.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-15T20:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027d rather people didn\u0027t try to do financial transactions through the forum.

You have a crypto wallet and download my mod, which gives you for absolutely free, 10,000 kerbincoin (made up name). You can instantly send those kerbincoin to another address simply by scanning it with your phone. No banks, etc, the block chain does all that. The block chain has no need for oversight like this forum. One might consider it a replacement for likes, because let\u0027s me honest, they\u0027re lame and useless.. Atleast a free crypto could by chance catch a meme on Twitter, pop in\u00A0popularity and buy a modder new rig or something. We know you aren\u0027t doing that. Or are you?

For comparison, 100$ USD bills are super hard to forge, but no one leaves them lying around on the ground. You put them somewhere secure, or just deposit them in a bank so you don\u0027t have thousands of dollars sitting in a safe in your closet. You probably already have some fraud protection so if someone steals your credit card, they\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ecant\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ego spend all your money, and even if they do, the financial system will be able to help you deal with it, so overall there is just\u00A0less personal risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo using cyrpto means taking on\u00A0massive personal financial risk for increased freedom and anonymity, where the critical crypto\u00A0users are those doing shady dealings which can afford that risk as they need that anonymity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever for a main-stream person to make a full jump just makes no sense, as the risk vastly outweigh the reward. Leaving cyrpto on the side as more of a novelty, rather than an actual viable alternative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo cryptocurrencies fundamentally\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ecant\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0go mainstream because a decentralized model fundamentally isn\u0027t practical. Mind you it has nothing to do with the underlying block-chain technology itself, it has to do with the idea you can use block-chain to create cryptocurrencies that are better than existing financial institutions. That idea just doesn\u0027t hold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-16T08:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2021 08:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
