I have a little question that I need a bit of help with. My pc is a decent laptop but not built for gaming let alone video recoding/rendering but I make it happen. With KSP if I am in an atmosphere it lags really badly while recording so my solution... Get a video editor that can have faster play back, Scott Manly for example uses sony vegas I believe, only problem it costs big bucks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all I need is a video editor that will allow faster play back after rendering that is free. I have tried windows live movie maker and it does faster play back but only shows key frames. I need the whole thing to show just faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, what would be a good way of adding audio to a video that has a faster playback. Before rendering use a program such as audacity and watch the video while recoding only sound, then add sound to the video in an editor and render it that way? Again I think this is how Scott Manley does it not sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7499275\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T05:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d have no idea what Manley uses but I think his laptop is a MacBook Pro (seen in the video of he and a former astronaut playing KSP).

With windows movie maker, you can set the playback speed before compressing the video for youtube. Yes, the jet engines sound a little funny, but not as bad as one might think. I for one think that windows movie maker does an excellent job, and it\u0027s free. Dynamic warp is no longer maintained by the original author, but has been updated and still works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit : I may not fully understand what you are asking, I\u0027m a little confused about the way you\u0027re using the word \u0022render\u0022. A video card renders a video file for monitor playback. Editing software changes the video file for whatever effect you want, compresses the video for file size, and allows you to choose the file type (or container) to suit your preferences. If you want to compress the video before editing, I would think you could use windows movie maker for that also, but you may find Handbrake useful, and it is free : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://handbrake.fr/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://handbrake.fr/\u003C/a\u003E . With Handbrake, you could compress the video first, and then load into windows movie maker. Also, are you sure you have the latest version of windows movie maker? I had to manually update mine to get all of the latest features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-17T12:47:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2013 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T16:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely sure if this is helpful or not, so I\u0027ll just throw it out there. Also a little confused on your use of rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA video file has an encoded frame rate, and this is a constant for the entire file. If you tell WMM to make a part faster, it does this by removing frames until it achieves the target time multiplier, it does not just cause them to be played faster. Similarly, slowing the movie down will add duplicate frames. If you slow a section to half speed, all the frames will be duplicated, causing that section of the recording to fill twice the amount of time in playback. If you are planning on significantly speeding up a movie in post production (that is, post recording, manipulating the movie file the recorder made), you might want to change the recording frame rate (and keep the playback speed the same) instead. If you are recording at 20fps and playing back at the same when you make the file, then you could say change it to record only 5fps, and keep the playback at 20, and the movie will play back at 4x speed without manipulation or lost frames. From here, you should be able to tweak it a bit in either direction as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost rendering, that is, once you have made all the changes in WMM and had the program re-render the entire movie into the final file, the playback speed can be altered by a program like windows media player or youtube (which also has a playback speed option). This actually affects the frame rate (and also the audio playback, of course), and is the equivalent of fastforwarding a video cassette (where speeding up in a movie editor is more like fast forwarding on a DVD).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T16:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I set Fraps to record at whatever framerate I want?
