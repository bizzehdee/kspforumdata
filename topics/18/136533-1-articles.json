From the radioactive, polluted and ruined remains of the world, life has sprung again, forming five factions. With it appears magic, a force known differently to each race, yet equally devastating.

They roam the open seas on monstrous mounts, and they follow their Fertile Queen blindly. However, their incursions are becoming more frequent, each time moving deeper into land.

Dwellers of swamps, jungles and humid forests, this race awakened before Man. They resemble crocodiles with elongated limbs, frogs walking upright, geckoes with human eyes... they are the peak of the food chain. They have rudimentary tools, with which they build lethal traps to protect their forests and the wonders rumored to be hidden within. The lucky explorers die in spike pits or are riddled with poisoned arrows. The unlucky ones are captured and put to use as sacrifices in elaborate rituals to please the Howling God. Their screams echo throughout the night, and the next morning, villagers are raided and women and children poached by scaled warriors that move through the undergrowth with supernatural speed, shooting arrows and hunting with spears and nets. If it were not for the inter-tribal warfare that ravages their population, they would conquer the world in short order.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EAshra\u003C/b\u003E - Central Asia/North Africa. In the dry plains east of the Stone Empire, hordes of demons roam. Deadly archers on horseback, impressive tacticians on the fields of battle, these nomads only resemble humans from afar. Under their armor, they have jaws built for rending flesh, claws for slicing open their victims and bright red skin. They utter chants of dark magic that frenzies their warriors. The raids are announced by a shadow assassin, a mere cloud and knife, slitting the throat of a senior commander or leader, to be found dead next to his relatives in the morning. The intelligence and skill of these creatures is evident, but instead of building cities, they tear down others. Some say this is the work of the Centaur King\u0027s prophecies, himself the creation of a Sorceror\u0027s Cabal privy to knowledge forbidden to humans.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EBlack Kingdoms\u003C/b\u003E - Russia/East Europe. In these cold lands, the pollution of ancient wars persists, and so the MetaSeed is strong. Early men were cursed by the combined presence of the pollution and the harsh winters. They degraded into ghouls that preyed on their families after death. Corpses withered but never decayed, sometimes springing to life with otherworldly hunger. Vampires are the brave souls that hunted for power in the magical wastes and returned, their noble hearts turned black by the curse of immortality. Their life was now sustained by consuming the blood of the living. Together, they destroyed the Republic and formed the Black Kingdoms on its remains. Each Kingdom has its Vampire King- a being centuries old, transcending mortality and humanity, always desperate for blood. They war as much between themselves as with the Stone Empire.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EFree Realms\u003C/b\u003E - South Europe/Arabian Peninsula. A diverse tapestry of tribes, nations and republics that fight for a democratic, cosmopolitan way of life. They make their living braving the seas and deserts to trade between themselves and the Stone Empire. Disputes are settled by both sides hiring mercenaries from the Stone Empire. This flow of gold back to the Empire is said the be the sole reason why the Empire\u0027s ports open up for them. Others say it is the education of their mages and their control of the sea lanes that keep the Empire from mounting a full offensive. While a citizen might enjoy freedom and rights found nowhere else, there are dark corners in the Free Realms. Greed has pushed some into piracy and dealings with Man\u0027s enemies. Others delve into the dark arts, either in a quest for power or forbidden knowledge. Many a mage has been caught smuggling black tomes from the North and trying to recreate the blood magics of the Vampires...\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EStone Empire\u003C/b\u003E - Central Europe/West Europe. The once greatest civilization of men. A thousand years ago, they expanded from their birthplace on the European shores as the Republic, growing tall and powerful as they reclaimed land and forest from the wilderness. Any non-humans they encountered, they crushed. They discovered the use of magic through technology, fuelling their research and building undefeated armies with it. When the Republic crumbled, its population fled into the mountains, where they burrowed and starved for generations. A hundred years later, they crept out of the holes a different people. Each step forward was behind a fortress. Each farm was ringed with defensive walls, each road dotted with watch-posts and each hill topped by a tower. The paranoid, pessimistic rulers murdered each other over the newly acquired scraps of land, and the survivors formed an iron-fisted Empire. Driven by magic, armies grew once more. To feed their people, the Stone Empire trades manpower and mercenaries for food and skills. To control them, there is an oppressive monotheistic religion and a personality cult around the Holy Emperor. Many fear the Empire returning to the deviancy of the Republic.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EThe Vroz \u003C/b\u003E- Outer space. Drawn by the gamma ray energies emitted by the Elves\u0027 final wars, they launched an expedition from hundreds of lightyears away. This predatory alien species was born to instill fear in the rest of the galaxy. However, their voyage across the void has defanged them. Cosmic rays, decay and biological deviations as the generations grew and died after a short and miserable life inside the closed spaceship has reduced them to a fraction of the ability of their ancestors. Today, they approach from the edge of the solar system, sending forward scout forces in dropships to sample the local biosphere and prepare appropriate weapons for their subjugation.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003EWhat about the game?\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ll keep this brief, as I\u0027ll go into detail about it in later posts. The core concept is that each player has a total number of points for an army, and a certain number of spells.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nThese points are divided freely between a number of units of the player\u0027s choosing. An \u0027army deck\u0027 for a 1000 point game can consist of 250 units of 4 points each, up to 10 units of 100 points each. Regular units can reach 40 points. \u0027Skill\u0027 units can reach 75 points. Heroes are a fixed 100 points.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nThe individual unit\u0027s points are distributed into Attack, Defense, Hitpoints and Speed, with Skills (up to 2 per unit or 3 in a hero) having fixed costs. They can be specialized into three movement categories and 4 unit types. They are also divided by faction, with each race providing bonuses and maluses, and faction skills providing intersting playstyles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nThe units, once designed and the points distributed, are assembled into regiments. An army can have a maximum of 10 regiments. There will be more details later, but a regiment acts as one \u0027super-unit\u0027 in combat.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nRegiments have a movement range dependent on the speed stat of their slowest unit. They are played in order of speed. For example, a regiment of 8 units with 10 speed will be played before a regiment with 7 units at 11 speed and 1 unit at 5 speed. This keeps a back and forth between players.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nCombat involves a Movement, Shooting, Melee and Damage phase. When attacking or defending, Regiments use the sum total of their units\u0027 Attack and Defense. Flanking gives a bonus to Attack power.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nAfter the fastest regiment has had its turn, the next fastest regiment gets to play, even if it is the opponent\u0027s regiment. If there is a wide distribution of speeds, the regiments will be played back and forth between players, so there are no distinct \u0027turns\u0027 where one player crosses their arms for half an hour.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nAfter all regiments have been moved, the opposite player can use a spell card. The number of spell cards available to each player is determined at the start of the game. The spells a player can start with depends on the composition of their army. A 100% undead army can use the most powerful faction spells, while an army with 10% of each race has to contend with generic spells.\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003ETo sum it up:\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022background:transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%;\u0022\u003E\nFree movement turn-based tactical wargame, with unit cards freely created by the player and assembled into regiments.

When they returned to the Republic, they grew rich and powerful, and infiltrated the highest spheres of power. In one night, they decapitated the Republic and revealed themselves as the Vampires. Today, the Black Kingdoms occupy the magnificent capital of the Republic. Each is centered on a Vampire King, centuries old, and is populated by hordes of undead ghouls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStone Empire:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing the collapse of the Republic, men fled to the mountains in Western Europe. They burrowed inside, and starved in hiding for decades. When they re-emerged, they were changed. Harder, colder and united by the Holy Goddess. The rulers murdered each other over the newly acquired land and soon, an Emperor emerged. He rules the population with an iron fist, and kept in power by a totalitarian, theological state with frequent purges, public hangings and religious inquisitions. Paranoid and determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past, every farm has a wall, every road has a watchtower and every mountain is defended by a fortress, lending the name of \u0027Stone Empire\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFree Realms:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFew men dared brave the seas and deserts to escape southwards from the Vampires and the Ashra. Today, their children form the Free Realms, an amalgam of republics, nation-states, tribes and clans that ring the Inner Sea. They have been joined since then by Stone Empire refugees and sometimes even non-humans... Although all enjoy freedom and can avoid persecution of their home state, the Free Realms does have some dark corners. Some, pushed by greed, turn to piracy, others, seeking power, dabble in the dark arts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVroz:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong ago, a predatory alien race detected the explosion of energy released by the wars of the first humans. They sent an expeditionary force, intent on subjugating this new world and add it to the list of their countless victims. However, the interstellar voyage took its toll. Radiation sickness, malfunctions and in-breeding has left the Vroz as only a shadow of their former selves. With their objective in sight, they are only able to send off small portions of their number down to Earth. These creatures blindly obey their extraterrestrial masters, and try to pave the way for a full invasion. Despite their failings, the Vroz can still field unfathomable technologies and power enough to wipe out all life on Earth. Only by uniting human and non-human can they be beaten, but that is the least likely of outcomes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T19:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso could you make a map showing where everything is?
