Being very protective of my PC, after buying the game (\u003Cstrong\u003Elegitimately - I\u0027m not a pirate\u003C/strong\u003E), I decided to run a virus scan just to make absolutely sure... I know that\u0027s overkill, but it\u0027s my SOP with all new games and especially one with a reputation such as this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt came up with one threat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewatch_dogs.exe - W32.Trojan.Gen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know why this would be? I did some Googling and found that the trojan people had seen was usually Winlogin.exe, a fake version of Winlogon.exe that would open all kinds of nasty back doors. But the actual game EXE file itself? I tried launching the game and it worked just fine, so I\u0027m not sure why my computer is bringing this up as a trojan. Does anyone know why this might be happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I use Webroot as my security program, but I also have a copy of Titanium that can be installed for a second look if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T23:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh!
