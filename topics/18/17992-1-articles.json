How in-depth do you plan on getting controls set-up? With simplicity, those controllers seem fine, and even with a more complicated set in mind, they\u0027d probably be great. Size constraints are a big factor, and those seem good for small spaces. Of course, personal things are look and feel, feel being difficult to judge via image, but look is simple to determine. I own a Saitek X-52 set, and while I only really use them for IL-2 1946 or FSX, they are a bit much for KSP. And more than $30. If you really want to go small and relatively cheap, buy a PS3/360 controller. The keyboard will of course need to be used, but it is better in terms of more precise controls over keyboard only.

Tried some WD40 which fixed it for a few months but then it started acting up again so I chucked it in the bin. Typically logitech quality basically, don\u0027t expect it to last beyond a few years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I bought a Saitek X52 and the main stick has been reliable but the trim controls on the rudder half seem to have developed a crossed wire somewhere and are sending the wrong signal.

I really like the design but it responds to the slightest hint of a twist of the stick itself. I do, however, have a Logitech Dual Action controller which I\u0027ve had for many years and it works very well. It\u0027s pretty much the identical setup to a Playstation controller so it\u0027s not the perfect answer, but they are versatile and inexpensive. Alternately, (speaking of console style controllers) Xbox 360 controllers are compatible with PCs and there are a few brands that can be picked up for around 30 dollars. Those aren\u0027t actual \u0022flight sticks\u0022 but I just thought I\u0027d throw out some options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
