How is that satisfying?\n\nIt\u0027s not. And once you get really good at the game you don\u0027t need to rely on the RNG to have mercy. You will face those \u0022impossible\u0022 situations and scrape by. Then you\u0027ll dominate. Finally, you\u0027ll flourish.\n\nI am dead serious here. 99% of the \u0022oh the RNG screwed me\u0022 moments ARE surmountable. If not at the time they happen, then because your ship should have been better prepared and your choices prior to that event were not the best. And I\u0027m not talking that you need prescience to avoid the situation. I\u0027m saying that if you build your ship up in a good way you will just naturally be better able to face those events.\n\nFor example, with the exception of missiles most ships in the first 2 sectors can\u0027t get through 2 shields. So you should spend your \\*first\\* 50 scrap on shields. Don\u0027t bother with the power, just get those shields. Every time you face a ship with 2 shots, or a single shot and a beam, power down your engines (who cares about dodging when you\u0027re invincible?) and put on your shields. Then, take your time tearing the enemy apart. That alone can net you HUNDREDS of risk-free scrap to use to upgrade your engines, buy a nice new weapon, or take advantage of something you find floating in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T21:30:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While strategy does exist, it\u0027s still about spamming restarts until the RNG has mercy, though. How is that satisfying?\n\nWhat? I respectfuly disagree. It\u0027s a roguelike. It\u0027s about doing with what little you have against bad odds. It\u0027s about learning the game through dying. It\u0027s about the feeling you get when you beat the game, even when the game is trying hard to beat you. And beating the game through strategy alone is very much possible, even consistently.\n\nSpamming restarts until you get a carry run is not satisfying.
