To get it right you may have to try many times, and when it goes wrong, you have to look at what happened and try to fix it before the next flight. But metaphors only get you so far. Relationships are their own kind of hard work, both to get started and to maintain. But as someone who has been there, I\u0027d say it was worth the effort to get through it and make it work.
