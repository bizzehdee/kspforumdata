Plus, by doing this early on, I\u0027m sure that it helps form that company\u0027s reputation 10-fold, over implementing it later on, after they become the Bethesda/MS Studios that we see now...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot to mention, Squad is already a huge step ahead of most small indy companies: Their first debut game is HUGE!....
