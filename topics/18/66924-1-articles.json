To think something so minor as a piece of foam hitting the wing could cause such a catastrophic failure. I also watched a bit on the Challenger explosion during launch. I\u0027ve seen my rockets in KSP blow up the same way and I am now starting to feel bad :-( I know this game isn\u0027t supposed to be taken all that seriously but I\u0027ve now implemented abort procedures on all my crafts. I\u0027ve had some really close calls with Jeb but believe it or not he hasn\u0027t died yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closest he came was when I had him bouncing around in a rover on Minmus when he crashed and the resulting explosion launched him into an escape trajectory out of the system. I panicked as launching a rescue would take several days to reach him. Luckily I put him into a stable orbit using his jet pack and eventually rescued him with his original lander. Granted he probably would have been out of oxygen as it took several hours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question is, do you take this game seriously? Or do you play as the game as designed with goofy kerbal antics and exploding rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T15:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of my manned rockets are equipped with launch escape systems.

Colombia, Challenger ... scary scary things. To see that these scientists put their lives on the line simply for the pursuit of knowledge is the most humbling of lessons. The first time I really took in the real-life WOW moment was when I pushed away from Kerbin to head toward my first Mun landing. Yes, we have \u0022manuever nodes\u0022 and \u0022orbit lines\u0022 to see what our burn is doing to our craft, but in the 1960\u0027s these guys were doing it for real, without a lot of computer assistance. Think of that first time, sitting in a cramped capsule, firing up the engines to push you away from Earth and into the black .... hoping the math is right and hoping you\u0027ll get close to that other floating rock out there. What if you miss? You could drift forever.
