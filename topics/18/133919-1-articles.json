That\u0027s what I mean when I say that it impresses me to see someone say, \u0022No, you\u0027re all wrong\u0022, because it proves that their thinking is unbiased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re interested in learning more about the method, and training your dog with it, go to the Koehler website linked in the OP and check it out. \u00A0If you\u0027d like to buy the book, you\u0027ll have to look it up(The Koehler Method of Dog Training) on Amazon or eBay to buy, because it\u0027s unfortunately out of print. \u00A0There are a lot of 1 star reviews by misinformed Social Justice Warrriors who would sign a petition for the book to be banned, but most haven\u0027t even read it, so I promise you there\u0027s no validity to their argument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what you think, and if you have any questions, feel free to message me. \u00A0This post was written on mobile though, and I don\u0027t have the time to proofread it, so let me know if anything needs clarifying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex Mechs Robot","CreatedById":83406,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T18:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222451097\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133919\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457635618\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135987\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SlabGizor117\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, SlabGizor117 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what you think, and if you have any questions, feel free to message me. \u00A0This post was written on mobile though, and I don\u0027t have the time to proofread it, so let me know if anything needs clarifying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m amazed you wrote that on a mobile device lol.
