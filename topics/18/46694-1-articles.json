First, ignore youtube comments because they are full of trolls reflecting imaginary human personas, not a reflection of actual human behavior. You also have to look at the magnitude of the injury, and dehumanization. Something like Wipeout is funny because it looks spectacular without people actually getting hurt. Amercas Funniest Home videos works on much the same principal. People might get bruised (physically or emotionally), but they aren\u0027t showing people breaking bones, losing limbs, or getting killed. I suppose it still says something about us that we can get pleasure from watching even that, but it\u0027s a far cry from people watching torture for entertainment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for animals, that would be the dehumanizing I suppose, and a sense of normalcy. In western culture, you grow up with the understanding that cows are for food, and dogs are pets, which seems to segue into branding cows makes you a farmer, while branding a dog means you are a monster. Animals are categorized in our heads, and what is and isn\u0027t okay for us depends on how they are categorized. If you grow up in a culture where bullfighting is normal, then the idea that it\u0027s not okay would be just as alien as perhaps the idea that dogs should be food. In this category, you can\u0027t hold anything to be an absolute truth. In fact, in that realm, about as far as you can get is \u0022I think therefore I am\u0022. Even assuming the world exists is an assumption you can\u0027t prove. As it applies to this picture, what is right and what is wrong is entirely influenced by cultural perceptions. Why shouldn\u0027t we kill and torture other animals? Why is that wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a supporter of animal cruelty, not by any means. Frankly, I consider abusing a cat or a dog a bigger crime than the same to another human, but I wouldn\u0027t hold that it\u0027s a rational system. Why am I okay with people who hunt animals for food, but not for sport? How can I hold harming a cat/dog as such a grievous offence while eating meat as a staple of my diet?

Sure, we do a fairly good job on the killing, not so much on the whole living conditions, or lab animals, or other scientific studies in the wild. There is a lot of room for improvement on that front. What I am getting at though is that you (I assume) and I are part of a culture that views forcing animals to suffer as wrong, and perhaps a culture that allows it out of a combination of ignorance and convenience. But I don\u0027t believe that we are in a position to look down on other cultures, because they can only do right by their own beliefs and values. I might like to believe that our empathy driven urge to not cause undue suffering in others might be the high ground, but in truth, it\u0027s an emotional thing, not a logical one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, rather than judge other cultures, you must trust that this is a natural progression, and let people come to the conclusion for themselves, or arrive at something even better. I also bleieve that trying to push beliefs is counter productive at best, but that\u0027s another debate for another time. Do I like the bull fights? No, I\u0027d be quite happy if they stopped. But I have no logical ground on which to call my point of view superior, and doing so on emotional grounds goes against my own values.
