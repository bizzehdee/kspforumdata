Can use them to stick to\u00A0stuff (can hold up a box with one hand now by sticking your\u00A0hand to it) or to taste stuff/smell stuff before you put it in your mouth. You can also toggle the taste on and off. Climbing walls would still be really hard, since although you can stick, lifting your own bodyweight is hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbility 2: Can spew out\u00A0blue gas from your mouth which irritates other peoples eyes, but more importantly, it compels them to answer truthfully any question that YOU ask them. At least for a few minutes before the effect wears off. A person may run from you but if you ask them a question and they are under the influence they will say the answer truthfully as loud as they need to for you to clearly hear them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbility 3: You get a furry long cat tail and furry cat ears. The tail is no ordinary cat tail but is prehensile, and also has smell holes at the tip that can detect scent as good as a dog. In other words, simply by waving the tip of your tail over the floor, you can detect where a person last was to where they where earlier in the day. You also get enhanced hearing via cat ears but lack human ears. And you get retractable forefinger joint claws. Useful for opening boxes and cutting bags/envelopes etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does the world change in a year if everyone\u00A0receives one of the abilities each?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus: Unlike most people, you can choose which ability you want, so which is it? These changes are permanent and cannot be undone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T03:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh... so the world becomes filled with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ekaiju\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0?
