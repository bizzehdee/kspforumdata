Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux. The concept of the Linux brand character being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list. Torvalds took his inspiration from an image he found on an FTP site, showing a penguin figurine depicted in a similar style to the Creature Comforts characters created by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin \u0022Tux\u0022 was James Hughes, who said that it stood for \u0022(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)\u0022. However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which bears resemblance in appearance to a penguin. Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux brand character and not the logo. Tux was created by Larry Ewing using the first publicly released version (0.54) of GIMP, a free software graphics package. It was released by him under the following condition: \u0022Permission to use and/or modify this image is granted provided you acknowledge me \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022c7aba2b0aea9a087aeb4a4e9b3a6aab2e9a2a3b2\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E and The GIMP if someone asks.\u0022 According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a \u0022fixation for flightless, fat waterfowl\u0022 and Torvalds claims to have contracted \u0022penguinitis\u0022 after being nibbled by a little penguin on a visit to the National Zoo \u0026amp; Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. joking that the disease \u0022makes you stay awake at nights just thinking about penguins and feeling great love towards them\u0022. Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux, and he felt that a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having eaten a great meal perfectly fit the bill. In 2009, a sign at Canberra zoo said that staff believed the \u0022original Tux\u0022 was still resident in the penguin enclosure. In an interview Linus commented on the penguin bite: \u0022I\u0027ve been to Australia several times, these days mostly for Linux.Conf.Au. But my first trip\u2014and the one when I was bitten by a ferocious fairy penguin: you really should keep those things locked up!\u2014was in 93 or so, talking about Linux for the Australian Unix Users Group.\u0022 Tuz, a Tasmanian devil wearing a fake penguin beak, was the brand character of the 2009 linux.conf.au conference. It has been chosen by Linus Torvalds as the logo for version 2.6.29 of the Linux kernel to support the effort to save the Tasmanian devil species from extinction due to the devil facial tumour disease. For the Linux 3.11-rc1 release, Linus Torvalds changed the code name from \u0022Unicycling Gorilla\u0022 to \u0022Linux for Workgroups\u0022 and modified the logo that some systems display when booting to depict a Tux holding a flag with a symbol that is reminiscent of the logo of Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which was released in 1993. The image was designed by Andrew McGown and recreated as an SVG using Inkscape by Josh Bush, and released under the CC BY-SA license.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-07T16:27:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2020 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-07T17:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the official, sugary, vanilla version of story...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if read the ancient grimoires, one can realise that the penguins live in Antarctica, the far and grim place, best known from the studies of the Miskatonic University, described in the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAt the Mountains of Madness\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 by H.P.Lovecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrange alien fungi-like creatures were ruling there,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0022and blind six-foot-tall penguins wandering placidly, apparently used as livestock\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why the penguin is a mascot of this weird, unhuman system, full of unpronouncable\u00A0humanish words,\u00A0 mindless rituals, verbal formulas, and weird finger gestures even in the text editor.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s used to highlight the alien and unhuman nature of this system, rather than comfy and natural graphic interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrange people, proud of their superiority in remembering senseless exclamations and unspeakable words, like they are a higher race of the human following the sacred way of dark knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust compare the description of the Lovecraftian cultists to a typical linux community...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother proof?

Unlike a binary software distribution, the source code is compiled locally according to the user\u0027s preferences and is often optimized for the specific type of computer. Precompiled binaries are available for some larger packages or those with no available source code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo Linux was named after the fast-swimming gentoo penguin. The name was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimization, which is a major feature of Gentoo. Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and flexible. Gentoo describes itself as a meta-distribution because of its adaptability, in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to the system and the applications they use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo Linux was initially created by Daniel Robbins as the Enoch Linux distribution. The goal was to create a distribution without precompiled binaries that was tuned to the hardware and only included required programs. At least one version of Enoch was distributed: version 0.75, in December 1999.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel Robbins and the other contributors experimented with a fork of GCC known as EGCS, developed by Cygnus Solutions. At this point, \u0022Enoch\u0022 was renamed \u0022Gentoo\u0022 Linux (the gentoo species is the fastest-swimming penguin). The modifications to EGCS eventually became part of the official GCC (version 2.95), and other Linux distributions experienced similar speed increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter problems with a bug on his own system, Robbins halted Gentoo development and switched to FreeBSD for several months, later saying, \u0022I decided to add several FreeBSD features to make our autobuild system (now called Portage) a true next-generation ports system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo Linux 1.0 was released on March 31, 2002. In 2004, Robbins set up the non-profit Gentoo Foundation, transferred all copyrights and trademarks to it, and stepped down as chief architect of the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current board of trustees is composed of five members who were announced (following an election) on March 2, 2008. There is also a seven-member Gentoo Council that oversees the technical issues and policies of Gentoo. The Gentoo Council members are elected annually, for a period of one year, by the active Gentoo developers. When a member of the Council retires, the successor is voted into place by the existing Council members.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Gentoo Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit foundation, registered in the State of New Mexico. In late 2007, the Foundation\u0027s charter was revoked, but by May 2008 the State of New Mexico declared that the Gentoo Foundation, Inc. had returned to good standing and was free to do business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo appeals to Linux users who want full control of the software that is installed and running on their computer. People who are prepared to invest the time required to configure and tune a Gentoo system can build very efficient desktops and servers. Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware. It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running. Memory usage can also be reduced compared to other distributions by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo\u0027s package repositories provide a large collection of software. Each package contains details of any dependencies, so only the minimum set of packages need to be installed. Optional features of individual packages, such as whether they require LDAP support, can be selected by the user and any resulting package requirements are automatically included in the set of dependencies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Gentoo does not impose a standard look and feel, installed packages usually appear as their authors intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelease

The earliest scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster with a type locality in the Falkland Islands. They call in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting which the bird emits with its head thrown back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe application of gentoo to the penguin is unclear. Gentoo was an Anglo-Indian term to distinguish Hindus from Muslims. The English term may have originated from the Portuguese gentio (\u0022pagan, gentile\u0022). Some speculate that the white patch on the bird\u0027s head was thought to resemble a turban.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may also be a variation of another name for this bird, \u0022Johnny penguin\u0022, Johnny being Juanito in Spanish and sounds vaguely like gentoo. The Johnny rook, a predator, is likely named after the Johnny penguin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe specific name papua is a misnomer; in the original description, Johann Reinhold Forster, a naturalist who had circumnavigated the world with Captain James Cook, mistakenly assumed that the species occurred in Papua (New Guinea), the closest gentoos actually being over 6000 km to the south (on Macquarie Island). There are no penguins in New Guinea. Others trace the error to a \u0022possibly fraudulent claim\u0022 in 1776 by French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat, who also alleged a Papuan location for the king penguin despite never having been to the island himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gentoo penguin is one of three species in the genus Pygoscelis. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago, about 2 million years after the ancestors of the genus Aptenodytes. In turn, the Adelie penguins split off from the other members of the genus around 19 million years ago, and the chinstrap and gentoo finally diverged around 14 million years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo subspecies of this penguin are recognised: Pygoscelis papua papua and the smaller Pygoscelis papua ellsworthi. A recent study suggests that the Gentoo penguin should be split into a species complex of four morphologically similar but separate species.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gentoo penguin is easily recognized by the wide white stripe extending like a bonnet across the top of its head and its bright orange-red bill. It has pale whitish-pink webbed feet and a fairly long tail \u2013 the most prominent tail of all penguin species. Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping from side to side, hence the scientific name Pygoscelis, which means \u0022rump-tailed\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoos reach a height of 51 to 90 cm (20 to 35 in), making them the third-largest species of penguin after the emperor penguin and the king penguin. Males have a maximum weight of about 8.5 kg (19 lb) just before molting, and a minimum weight of about 4.9 kg (11 lb) just before mating. For females, the maximum weight is 8.2 kg (18 lb) just before molting, but their weight drops to as little as 4.5 kg (9.9 lb) when guarding the chicks in the nest. Birds from the north are on average 700 g (1.5 lb) heavier and 10 cm (3.9 in) taller than the southern birds. Southern gentoo penguins reach 75\u201380 cm (30\u201331 in) in length. They are the fastest underwater swimmers of all penguins, reaching speeds of up to 36 km/h (22 mph). Gentoos are well adapted to extremely cold and harsh climates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe breeding colonies of gentoo penguins are located on ice-free surfaces. Colonies can be directly on the shoreline or can be located considerably inland. They prefer shallow coastal areas and often nest between tufts of grass. In South Georgia, for example, breeding colonies are 2 km inland. In colonies farther inland, where the penguins nest in grassy areas, they shift location slightly every year because the grass will become trampled over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoos breed on many sub-Antarctic islands. The main colonies are on the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and Kerguelen Islands; smaller colonies are found on Macquarie Island, Heard Islands, Crozet Islands, South Shetland Islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula. The total breeding population is estimated to be over 600,000 birds. Gentoos breed monogamously, and infidelity is typically punished with banishment from the colony. Nests are usually made from a roughly circular pile of stones and can be quite large, 20 cm (7.9 in) high and 25 cm (9.8 in) in diameter. The stones are jealously guarded and their ownership can be the subject of noisy disputes and physical attacks between individuals. They are also prized by the females, even to the point that a male penguin can obtain the favors of a female by offering her a choice stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo eggs are laid, both weighing around 130 g (4.6 oz). The parents share incubation, changing duty daily. The eggs hatch after 34 to 36 days. The chicks remain in the nests for around 30 days before joining other chicks in the colony and forming cr\u00E8ches. The chicks molt into subadult plumage and go out to sea at around 80 to 100 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoos live mainly on crustaceans, such as krill, with fish making up only about 15% of the diet. They are, however, opportunistic feeders, and around the Falklands are known to take roughly equal proportions of fish (Patagonotothen sp., Thysanopsetta naresi, Micromesistius australis), squat lobsters (Munida gregaria), and squid (Loligo gahi, Gonatus antarcticus, Moroteuthis ingens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gentoos\u0027 diet is high in salt as they eat organisms with relatively the same salinity as sea water, and this can lead to complications associated with high sodium concentrations in the body, especially for gentoo chicks. To counteract this, gentoos as well as many other marine bird species have a highly developed salt gland located above their eyes that takes the high concentration of sodium within the body and produces a highly saline-concentrated solution that drips out of the body from the tip of the beak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGentoo penguins do not store as much fat as the Adelie penguin, their closest relative: gentoos require less energy investment when hunting because the net gain of energy after hunting is greater in gentoos than Adelies. As embryos, gentoos require a lot of energy in order to develop. Oxygen consumption is high for a developing gentoo embryo. As the embryo grows and requires more oxygen, the amount of consumption increases exponentially until the gentoo chick hatches. By then, the chick is consuming around 1800 mL O2 per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the sea, leopard seals, sea lions, and killer whales are all predators of the gentoo. On land, no predators of full-grown healthy gentoo penguins exist. Skuas and giant petrels regularly kill many chicks and steal eggs; Petrels will kill injured and sick adult gentoos. Various other seabirds, such as the kelp gull and snowy sheathbill, will also snatch chicks and eggs. Skuas on King George Island have been observed attacking and injuring adult gentoo penguins in apparent territorial disputes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of 2019, the IUCN Red List lists the gentoo as least concern, although rapid declines in some key areas are believed to be driving a moderate overall decline in the species population. Examples include Bird Island, South Georgia, where the population has fallen by two-thirds over 25 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Linux distribution Gentoo Linux is named after the Gentoo penguin. This is a nod to the fact that the penguin is the fastest swimming penguin, as Gentoo Linux aims to be a high performance operating system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-09T21:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, then who is actually Octocathulhu?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-09T22:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoke aside, in the last 2 weeks I\u0027m having a bad time on my gentoo based server (a lab for new distros).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome packages are being withdrawn in the last 2 years because \u0022they are not receiving new releases\u0022, blatantly ignoring the fact that no new releases are being issued because no new bugs were reported - what\u0027s completely different of no having people using them (I was).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s pretty uncomfortable to maintain my own overlay to keep basic (but, granted, uncommon) things that I think should not had be withdrawn from the main repository without a good, technical reason.

The source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n90% of all cloud infrastructure is powered by Linux including supercomputers and cloud providers. 74% of smartphones in the world are Linux-based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT\u0026amp;T\u0027s Bell Labs, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT\u0026amp;T was required to license the operating system\u0027s source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT\u0026amp;T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a \u0022complete Unix-compatible software system\u0022 composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984. Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel had been available at the time (1991), he would not have decided to write his own. Although not released until 1992, due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has also stated that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn operating system principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being free software until the licensing changed in April 2000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems. Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only, he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTorvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention \u0022Freax\u0022, a portmanteau of \u0022free\u0022, \u0022freak\u0022, and \u0022x\u0022 (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project\u0027s makefiles included the name \u0022Freax\u0022 for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name \u0022Linux\u0022, but initially dismissed it as too egotistical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke, Torvalds\u0027 coworker at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that \u0022Freax\u0022 was a good name, so he named the project \u0022Linux\u0022 on the server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to \u0022Linux\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to a newsgroup post by Torvalds, the word \u0022Linux\u0022 should be pronounced LIN-uuks with a short \u2018i\u2019 as in \u2018print\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 as in \u2018put\u2019. To further demonstrate how the word \u0022Linux\u0022 should be pronounced, he included an audio guide\u00A0with the kernel source code. Contradictory, in this recording, he pronounces \u2018Linux\u2019 LEEN-uuks with a short but close unrounded front vowel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use began when Dell and IBM, followed by Hewlett-Packard, started offering Linux support to escape Microsoft\u0027s monopoly in the desktop operating system market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually all supercomputers, and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular LAMP application stack. Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing. Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks. Botnet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux\u0027s greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android being one of the most dominant operating systems on smartphones and very popular on tablets and, more recently, on wearables. Linux gaming is also on the rise with Valve showing its support for Linux and rolling out SteamOS, its own gaming-oriented Linux distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments, such as the federal government of Brazil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreg Kroah-Hartman is the lead maintainer for the Linux kernel and guides its development. William John Sullivan is the executive director of the Free Software Foundation, which in turn supports the GNU components. Finally, individuals and corporations develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and non-GNU components, with additional package management software in the form of Linux distributions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany open source developers agree that the Linux kernel was not designed but rather evolved through natural selection. Torvalds considers that although the design of Unix served as a scaffolding, \u0022Linux grew with a lot of mutations - and because the mutations were less than random, they were faster and more directed than alpha-particles in DNA.\u0022 Raymond considers Linux\u0027s revolutionary aspects to be social, not technical: before Linux complex software was designed carefully by small groups, but \u0022Linux evolved in a completely different way. From nearly the beginning, it was rather casually hacked on by huge numbers of volunteers coordinating only through the Internet. Quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy but by the naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback from hundreds of users within days, creating a sort of rapid Darwinian selection on the mutations introduced by developers.\u0022 Bryan Cantrill, an engineer of a competing OS, agrees that \u0022Linux wasn\u0027t designed, it evolved\u0022, but considers this to be a limitation, proposing that some features, especially those related to security, cannot be evolved into, \u0022this is not a biological system at the end of the day, it\u0027s a software system.\u0022 \u00A0A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system, deriving much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel, which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals, and file systems. Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel, or added as modules that are loaded while the system is running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GNU userland is a key part of most systems based on the Linux kernel, with Android being the notable exception. The Project\u0027s implementation of the C library works as a wrapper for the system calls of the Linux kernel necessary to the kernel-userspace interface, the toolchain is a broad collection of programming tools vital to Linux development (including the compilers used to build the Linux kernel itself), and the coreutils implement many basic Unix tools. The project also develops Bash, a popular CLI shell. The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System. More recently, the Linux community seeks to advance to Wayland as the new display server protocol in place of X11. Many other open-source software projects contribute to Linux systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstalled components of a Linux system include the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bootloader, for example GNU GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, or Gummiboot. This is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer\u0027s main memory, by being executed by the computer when it is turned on and after the firmware initialization is performed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn init program, such as the traditional sysvinit and the newer systemd, OpenRC and Upstart. This is the first process launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root of the process tree: in other terms, all processes are launched through init. It starts processes such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSoftware libraries, which contain code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using ELF-format executable files, the dynamic linker that manages use of dynamic libraries is known as ld-linux.so. If the system is set up for the user to compile software themselves, header files will also be included to describe the interface of installed libraries. Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems, the GNU C Library (glibc), there are numerous other libraries, such as SDL and Mesa.\u003Cbr\u003E\nC standard library is the library needed to run C programs on a computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. For embedded systems, alternatives such as the musl, EGLIBC (a glibc fork once used by Debian) and uClibc (which was designed for uClinux) have been developed, although the last two are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library, Bionic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the copyleft BusyBox, and the BSD-licensed Toybox.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWidget toolkits are the libraries used to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including GTK and Clutter developed by the GNOME project, Qt developed by the Qt Project and led by Digia, and Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) developed primarily by the Enlightenment team.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA package management system, such as dpkg and RPM. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source tarballs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUser interface programs such as command shells or windowing environments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe user interface, also known as the shell, is either a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), originally developed for the GNU project. Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the userland, use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple inter-process communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the GUI shells, packaged together with extensive desktop environments, such as KDE Plasma, GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, Pantheon and Xfce, though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System, often simply called \u0022X\u0022. It provides network transparency and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network. Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation, X.Org Server, being the most popular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nServer distributions might provide a command-line interface for developers and administrators, but provide a custom interface towards end-users, designed for the use-case of the system. This custom interface is accessed through a client that resides on another system, not necessarily Linux based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral types of window managers exist for X11, including tiling, dynamic, stacking and compositing. Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler X window managers such as dwm, ratpoison, i3wm, or herbstluftwm provide a minimalist functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as FVWM, Enlightenment or Window Maker provide more features such as a built-in taskbar and themes, but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as Mutter (GNOME), KWin (KDE) or Xfwm (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWayland is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; as of 2014, it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager. Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME\u0027s Mutter and KDE\u0027s KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux currently has two modern kernel-userspace APIs for handling video input devices: V4L2 API for video streams and radio, and DVB API for digital TV reception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the complexity and diversity of different devices, and due to the large number of formats and standards handled by those APIs, this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices. Also, a good userspace device library is the key of the success for having userspace applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain articles: Linux distribution and Free software\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software. Linux is not the only such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used. Some free and open-source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft, a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU Project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux-based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to POSIX, SUS, LSB, ISO, and ANSI standards where possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified, Linux-FT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFree software projects, although developed through collaboration, are often produced independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger-scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany Linux distributions manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a package manager such as apt, yum, zypper, pacman or portage to install, remove, and update all of a system\u0027s software from one central location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, Debian being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as Red Hat does with Fedora, and SUSE does with openSUSE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn many cities and regions, local associations known as Linux User Groups (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroups. Online forums are another means for support, with notable examples being LinuxQuestions.org and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for Ubuntu, Fedora, and Gentoo. Linux distributions host mailing lists; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle cover disks that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of free software. An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified. Major corporations that provide contributions include Dell, IBM, HP, Oracle, Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) and Nokia. A number of corporations, notably Red Hat, Canonical and SUSE, have built a significant business around Linux distributions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe free software licenses, on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as symbiotic. One common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as CP/M, Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer\u0027s computer that shared the same architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost programming languages support Linux either directly or through third-party community based ports. The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the GNU toolchain, which includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Build System. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for Ada, C, C\u002B\u002B, Go and Fortran. Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, Java, Go, Rust and Haskell. First released in 2003, the LLVM project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages. Proprietary compilers for Linux include the Intel C\u002B\u002B Compiler, Sun Studio, and IBM XL C/C\u002B\u002B Compiler. BASIC in the form of Visual Basic is supported in such forms as Gambas, FreeBASIC, and XBasic, and in terms of terminal programming or QuickBASIC or Turbo BASIC programming in the form of QB64.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at scripting, text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support shell scripts, awk, sed and make. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, regular expressions are supported in programs like grep and locate, the traditional Unix MTA Sendmail contains its own Turing complete scripting system, and the advanced text editor GNU Emacs is built around a general purpose Lisp interpreter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost distributions also include support for PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python and other dynamic languages. While not as common, Linux also supports C# (via Mono), Vala, and Scheme. Guile Scheme acts as an extension language targeting the GNU system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small, static, compiled C programs of Unix design rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant, functional high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile bindings to this end. A number of Java Virtual Machines and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM (HotSpot), and IBM\u0027s J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like Kaffe and JikesRVM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGNOME and KDE are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the GTK and Qt widget toolkits, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of Integrated development environments available including Anjuta, Code::Blocks, CodeLite, Eclipse, Geany, ActiveState Komodo, KDevelop, Lazarus, MonoDevelop, NetBeans, and Qt Creator, while the long-established editors Vim, nano and Emacs remain popular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures, including the hand-held ARM-based iPAQ and the IBM mainframes System z9 or System z10. Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors, while the \u00B5Clinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit. The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as Macintosh computers (with both PowerPC and Intel processors), PDAs, video game consoles, portable music players, and mobile phones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as FreedomHEC. Over time, support for different hardware has improved in Linux, resulting in any off-the-shelf purchase having a \u0022good chance\u0022 of being compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 2014, a new initiative was launched to automatically collect a database of all tested hardware configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides the Linux distributions designed for general-purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: computer architecture support, embedded systems, stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for real-time applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software. As of 2015, over four hundred Linux distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years. Most modern distributions include a graphical user environment, with, as of February 2015, the two most popular environments being the KDE Plasma Desktop and Xfce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo single official Linux desktop exists: rather desktop environments and Linux distributions select components from a pool of free and open-source software with which they construct a GUI implementing some more or less strict design guide. GNOME, for example, has its human interface guidelines as a design guide, which gives the human\u2013machine interface an important role, not just when doing the graphical design, but also when considering people with disabilities, and even when focusing on security.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform language localization of some Linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost-effective. For example, the Sinhalese language version of the Knoppix distribution became available significantly before Microsoft translated Windows XP into Sinhalese. In this case the Lanka Linux User Group played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors, linguists, and local developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic; for example in 2007 Con Kolivas accused the Linux community of favoring performance on servers. He quit Linux kernel development out of frustration with this lack of focus on the desktop, and then gave a \u0022tell all\u0022 interview on the topic. Since then a significant amount of development has focused on improving the desktop experience. Projects such as systemd and Upstart (deprecated in 2014) aim for a faster boot time; the Wayland and Mir projects aim at replacing X11 while enhancing desktop performance, security and appearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems. For example, Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice and Blender have downloadable versions for all major operating systems. Furthermore, some applications initially developed for Linux, such as Pidgin, and GIMP, were ported to other operating systems (including Windows and macOS) due to their popularity. In addition, a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on Linux, such as Autodesk Maya and The Foundry\u0027s Nuke in the high-end field of animation and visual effects; see the list of proprietary software for Linux for more details. There are also several companies that have ported their own or other companies\u0027 games to Linux, with Linux also being a supported platform on both the popular Steam and Desura digital-distribution services.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany other types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and macOS also run on Linux. Commonly, either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux, such as with Skype and some video games like Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2. Furthermore, the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. It is sponsored by commercial interests including CodeWeavers, which produces a commercial version of the software. Since 2009, Google has also provided funding to the Wine project. CrossOver, a proprietary solution based on the open-source Wine project, supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office, Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks, Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2, and many popular games such as World of Warcraft. In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing and professional audio, there is equivalent software available on Linux. It is also possible to run applications written for Android on other versions of Linux using Anbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides externally visible components, such as X window managers, a non-obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by freedesktop.org, such as D-Bus or PulseAudio; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit (GTK or Qt). A display server is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the X.Org Server and Xlib. Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol, Wayland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstalling, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the Synaptic Package Manager, PackageKit, and Yum Extender. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices such as the Asus Eee PC and Acer Aspire One shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 2009, Google announced its Chrome OS as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the Chrome browser as the main user interface. Chrome OS initially did not run any non-web applications, except for the bundled file manager and media player. A certain level of support for Android applications was added in later versions. As of 2018, Google added the ability to install any Linux software in a container, enabling Chrome OS to be used like any other Linux distribution. Netbooks that shipped with the operating system, termed Chromebooks, started appearing on the market in June 2011.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions have long been used as server operating systems, and have risen to prominence in that area; Netcraft reported in September 2006, that eight of the ten (other two with \u0022unknown\u0022 OS) most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their web servers, with Linux in the top position. In June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten, FreeBSD three of ten, and Microsoft two of ten; since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, FreeBSD three of ten, and Microsoft one of ten, with Linux in the top position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions are the cornerstone of the LAMP server-software combination (Linux, Apache, MariaDB/MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python) which has achieved popularity among developers, and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes, partly due to pricing and the open-source model. In December 2009, computer giant IBM reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframe-based Enterprise Linux Server. At LinuxCon North America 2015, IBM announced LinuxONE, a series of mainframes specifically designed to run Linux and open-source software.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions are also dominant as operating systems for supercomputers. As of November 2017, all supercomputers on the 500 list run some variant of Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral operating systems for smart devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, home automation (like Google Nest), smart TVs (Samsung and LG Smart TVs use Tizen and WebOS, respectively), and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems (for example Automotive Grade Linux), are based on Linux. Major platforms for such systems include Android, Firefox OS, Mer and Tizen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndroid has become the dominant mobile operating system for smartphones, running on 79.3% of units sold worldwide during the second quarter of 2013. Android is also a popular operating system for tablets, and Android smart TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems have also appeared in the market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough Android is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel, commentators disagree on whether the term \u0022Linux distribution\u0022 applies to it, and whether it is \u0022Linux\u0022 according to the common usage of the term. Android is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation, Google\u0027s open-source chief Chris DiBona, and several journalists. Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the GNU C Library (it uses Bionic as an alternative C library) and some of other components typically found in Linux distributions. Ars Technica wrote that \u0022Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel, the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCellphones and PDAs running Linux on open-source platforms became more common from 2007; examples include the Nokia N810, Openmoko\u0027s Neo1973, and the Motorola ROKR E8. Continuing the trend, Palm (later acquired by HP) produced a new Linux-derived operating system, webOS, which is built into its line of Palm Pre smartphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNokia\u0027s Maemo, one of the earliest mobile operating systems, was based on Debian. It was later merged with Intel\u0027s Moblin, another Linux-based operating system, to form MeeGo. The project was later terminated in favor of Tizen, an operating system targeted at mobile devices as well as IVI. Tizen is a project within The Linux Foundation. Several Samsung products are already running Tizen, Samsung Gear 2 being the most significant example. Samsung Z smartphones will use Tizen instead of Android.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of MeeGo\u0027s termination, the Mer project forked the MeeGo codebase to create a basis for mobile-oriented operating systems. In July 2012, Jolla announced Sailfish OS, their own mobile operating system built upon Mer technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMozilla\u0027s Firefox OS consists of the Linux kernel, a hardware abstraction layer, a web-standards-based runtime environment and user interface, and an integrated web browser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCanonical has released Ubuntu Touch, aiming to bring convergence to the user experience on this mobile operating system and its desktop counterpart, Ubuntu. The operating system also provides a full Ubuntu desktop when connected to an external monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Librem 5 is a smartphone developed by Purism. By default, it runs the company-made Linux-based PureOS, but it can also run other Linux distributions. Like Ubuntu Touch, PureOS is designed with convergence in mind, allowing desktop programs to run on the smartphone. An example of this is the desktop version of Mozilla Firefox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother smartphone is the PinePhone, made by the computer manufacturer Pine64. The PinePhone can run a variety of Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu Touch and PostmarketOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to its low cost and ease of customization, Linux is often used in embedded systems. In the non-mobile telecommunications equipment sector, the majority of customer-premises equipment (CPE) hardware runs some Linux-based operating system. OpenWrt is a community-driven example upon which many of the OEM firmware releases are based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the popular TiVo digital video recorder also uses a customized Linux, as do several network firewalls and routers from such makers as Cisco/Linksys. The Korg OASYS, the Korg KRONOS, the Yamaha Motif XS/Motif XF music workstations, Yamaha S90XS/S70XS, Yamaha MOX6/MOX8 synthesizers, Yamaha Motif-Rack XS tone generator module, and Roland RD-700GX digital piano also run Linux. Linux is also used in stage lighting control systems, such as the WholeHogIII console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past, there were few games available for Linux. In recent years, more games have been released with support for Linux (especially Indie games), with the exception of a few AAA title games. Android, a popular mobile platform which uses the Linux kernel, has gained much developer interest and is one of the main platforms for mobile game development along with iOS operating system by Apple for iPhone and iPad devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn February 14, 2013, Valve released a Linux version of Steam, a popular game distribution platform on PC. Many Steam games were ported to Linux. On December 13, 2013, Valve released SteamOS, a gaming-oriented OS based on Debian, for beta testing, and has plans to ship Steam Machines as a gaming and entertainment platform. Valve has also developed VOGL, an OpenGL debugger intended to aid video game development, as well as porting its Source game engine to desktop Linux. As a result of Valve\u0027s effort, several prominent games such as DotA 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 are now natively available on desktop Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn July 31, 2013, Nvidia released Shield as an attempt to use Android as a specialized gaming platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome Linux users play Windows games through Wine or CrossOver Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn August 22, 2018, Valve released their own fork of Wine called Proton, aimed at gaming. It features some improvements over the vanilla Wine such as Vulkan-based DirectX 11 and 12 implementations, Steam integration, better full screen and game controller support and improved performance for multi-threaded games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the flexibility, customizability and free and open-source nature of Linux, it becomes possible to highly tune Linux for a specific purpose. There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu (which is itself based on Debian), Arch Linux, Gentoo, and Slackware. In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the JeOS philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding resource overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution\u0027s use cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA home theater PC (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a home theater system. It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpenELEC, a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software Kodi, is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the MythTV media center software, such as Mythbuntu, a special edition of Ubuntu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying security exploits. The Ubuntu derivative BackBox provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Arch-based BlackArch includes over 2100 tools for pentesting and security researching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including Tails, Tin Hat Linux and Tinfoil Hat Linux. Lightweight Portable Security is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the United States Department of Defense. Tor-ramdisk is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software Tor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux Live CD sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use GParted as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGParted Live \u00A0 \u2013 a Debian-based distribution developed by the GParted project.\u003Cbr\u003E\nParted Magic \u00A0 \u2013 a commercial Linux distribution.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSystemRescueCD \u2013 an Arch-based distribution with support for editing Windows registry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design in its Falcon 9 rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other\u0027s operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose. For flexibility, commercial off-the-shelf parts and system-wide \u0022radiation-tolerant\u0022 design are used instead of radiation hardened parts. As of July 2019, SpaceX has conducted over 76 launches of the Falcon 9 since 2010, out of which all but one have successfully delivered their primary payloads to the intended orbit, and has used it to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. The Dragon 2 crew capsule also uses Linux in conjunction with Chromium OS for its user interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows was deployed as the operating system on non-mission critical laptops used on the space station, but it was later replaced with Linux. Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space, is also Linux-based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory has used Linux for a number of years \u0022to help with projects relating to the construction of unmanned space flight and deep space exploration\u0022; NASA uses Linux in robotics in the Mars rover, and Ubuntu Linux to \u0022save data from satellites\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions have been created to provide hands-on experience with coding and source code to students, on devices such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition to producing a practical device, the intention is to show students \u0022how things work under the hood\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ubuntu derivatives Edubuntu and The Linux Schools Project, as well as the Debian derivative Skolelinux, provide education-oriented software packages. They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstant WebKiosk and Webconverger are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web kiosks and digital signage. Thinstation is a minimalist distribution designed for thin clients. Rocks Cluster Distribution is tailored for high-performance computing clusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include Ubuntu Kylin for Chinese language users and BlankOn targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include Ubuntu Studio for media creation and DNALinux for bioinformatics. There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name Sabily that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including GendBuntu used by the French National Gendarmerie, Goobuntu used internally by Google, and Astra Linux developed specifically for the Russian army.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany quantitative studies of free/open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux. The Linux market is growing rapidly, and the revenue of servers, desktops, and packaged software running Linux was expected to exceed $35.7 billion by 2008. Analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of Linux to its security, reliability, low cost, and freedom from vendor lock-in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to web server statistics, (that is, based on the numbers recorded from visits to websites by client devices,) as of November 2018, the estimated market share of Linux on desktop computers is around 2.1%. In comparison, Microsoft Windows has a market share of around 87%, while macOS covers around 9.7%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nW3Cook publishes stats that use the top 1,000,000 Alexa domains, which as of May 2015 estimate that 96.55% of web servers run Linux, 1.73% run Windows, and 1.72% run FreeBSD.\u003Cbr\u003E\nW3Techs publishes stats that use the top 10,000,000 Alexa domains, updated monthly and as of November 2016 estimate that 66.7% of web servers run Linux/Unix, and 33.4% run Microsoft Windows.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn September 2008, Microsoft\u0027s then-CEO Steve Ballmer stated that 60% of web servers ran Linux, versus 40% that ran Windows Server.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIDC\u0027s Q1 2007 report indicated that Linux held 12.7% of the overall server market at that time; this estimate was based on the number of Linux servers sold by various companies, and did not include server hardware purchased separately that had Linux installed on it later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndroid, which is based on the Linux kernel, has become the dominant operating system for smartphones. During the second quarter of 2013, 79.3% of smartphones sold worldwide used Android. Android is also a popular operating system for tablets, being responsible for more than 60% of tablet sales as of 2013. According to web server statistics, as of December 2014 Android has a market share of about 46%, with iOS holding 45%, and the remaining 9% attributed to various niche platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor years Linux has been the platform of choice in the film industry. The first major film produced on Linux servers was 1997\u0027s Titanic. Since then major studios including DreamWorks Animation, Pixar, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light \u0026amp; Magic have migrated to Linux. According to the Linux Movies Group, more than 95% of the servers and desktops at large animation and visual effects companies use Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments. The federal government of Brazil is well known for its support for Linux. News of the Russian military creating its own Linux distribution has also surfaced, and has come to fruition as the G.H.ost Project. The Indian state of Kerala has gone to the extent of mandating that all state high schools run Linux on their computers. China uses Linux exclusively as the operating system for its Loongson processor family to achieve technology independence. In Spain, some regions have developed their own Linux distributions, which are widely used in education and official institutions, like gnuLinEx in Extremadura and Guadalinex in Andalusia. France and Germany have also taken steps toward the adoption of Linux. North Korea\u0027s Red Star OS, developed since 2002, is based on a version of Fedora Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. The GPL requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license must make the originating source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms. Other key components of a typical Linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the GPL, but they may use other licenses; many libraries use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a more permissive variant of the GPL, and the X.Org implementation of the X Window System uses the MIT License.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTorvalds states that the Linux kernel will not move from version 2 of the GPL to version 3. He specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management. It would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders, who number in the thousands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 2001 study of Red Hat Linux 7.1 found that this distribution contained 30 million source lines of code. Using the Constructive Cost Model, the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand person-years of development time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by conventional proprietary means, it would have cost about $1.6 billion (2020 US dollars) to develop in the United States. Most of the source code (71%) was written in the C programming language, but many other languages were used, including C\u002B\u002B, Lisp, assembly language, Perl, Python, Fortran, and various shell scripting languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a later study, the same analysis was performed for Debian version 4.0 (etch, which was released in 2007). This distribution contained close to 283 million source lines of code, and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand man-years and cost US$8.84 billion (in 2020 dollars) to develop by conventional means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe name \u0022Linux\u0022 is also used for a laundry detergent made by Swiss company R\u00F6sch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the United States, the name Linux is a trademark registered to Linus Torvalds. Initially, nobody registered it, but on August 15, 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. filed for the trademark Linux, and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was settled. The licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the Linux Mark Institute (LMI). Torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it. LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the Linux name as part of trademarks, but later changed this in favor of offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Free Software Foundation (FSF) prefers GNU/Linux as the name when referring to the operating system as a whole, because it considers Linux distributions to be variants of the GNU operating system initiated in 1983 by Richard Stallman, president of the FSF. They explicitly take no issue over the name Android for the Android OS, which is also an operating system based on the Linux kernel, as GNU is not a part of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA minority of public figures and software projects other than Stallman and the FSF, notably Debian (which had been sponsored by the FSF up to 1996), also use GNU/Linux when referring to the operating system as a whole. Most media and common usage, however, refers to this family of operating systems simply as Linux, as do many large Linux distributions (for example, SUSE Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux). By contrast, Linux distributions containing only free software use \u0022GNU/Linux\u0022 or simply \u0022GNU\u0022, such as Trisquel GNU/Linux, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, BLAG Linux and GNU, and gNewSense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of May 2011, about 8% to 13% of a modern Linux distribution is made of GNU components (the range depending on whether GNOME is considered part of GNU), as determined by counting lines of source code making up Ubuntu\u0027s \u0022Natty\u0022 release; meanwhile, 6% is taken by the Linux kernel, increased to 9% when including its direct dependencies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-10T16:58:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2020 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELinux \u00A0is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
