I have satellite internet. I wish I had another option but I don\u0027t. I get 10GB/month before I get throttled to dial up speed. Problem is I was throttled 2 months ago and the speed never reset in the new period. They keep telling me it is on my end and tell me to reset my modem and router. It doesn\u0027t matter I tell them I have done this a hundred times, that is always how the conversation starts. I\u0027ve even had an onsite tech who told me the problem isn\u0027t on my end. Long story short, they have a glitch on their end and can\u0027t or won\u0027t fix it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I decided to blow through my data at the end of the last period (new period starts today). I downloaded 1.1.3 through Steam. It took 11 hours. All that effort and KSP won\u0027t run. Using\u00A0KSP64.exe loads fast but there are no parts/flags. The KSP.exe starts loading then goes into an endless loop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the download there were a couple surprise thunderstorms that interrupted the connection. I am guessing a file or two are corrupt. I want to verify my install but have a question - Will this cost me another 1.3 GB of data and another 11 hours? I am assuming yes but hoping I\u0027m wrong. You know, just in case some knucklehead accidentally resets my speed.

Though I am not fully sure of the technical details, I assume Steam employs some form of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echecksum\u003C/a\u003E. Simply put, it means that you apply an algorithm to a file and reduce it to a sentence of random looking letters and numbers. If you make a checksum of exactly the same file twice, you get exactly the same combination of characters as a result. If one bit is different in a file, however, you will get a fully different set of characters. That way it is easy to compare one file with an original without having to have both actual files. You simply compare the resulting short sentence of characters. If they are the same, the file is the same. If they are different, the contents of the file is different in some way. It is likely Steam makes a hash of the files on your disk, compares those with the hashes of the original files and only re-downloads those files that have incorrect hashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same technology is often used to verify the integrity of software downloaded for phones. That way you are sure you do not flash a corrupt file to your phone and brick it. Checksums are useful in many other applications too, it is a very useful tool to have in your kit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T15:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222646590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142407\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466844207\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259088\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Camacha said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume Steam employs some form of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echecksum\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I decided as validation didn\u0027t take long at all - couple minutes maybe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and blowing through my data trying to force a throttle reset didn\u0027t work.
