It got up to 307 K on one occasion, but mostly hangs around 300\u00A0in the day. Last winter was really warm and dry compared to the average. We got like a week in which it got really cold, though, one location sort of near me got to 229 K including the wind chill. That was February 3, I think. Felt like a return to the few years before that, because 2014-15 and 2013-14 were really cold. Sometime in March this year, before the spring started, it got to 289 K one day, which was very surprising to me because it would be the most extreme temperature range of a season I can remember. If you include the wind chill, the effective temperature,\u00A0it\u0027s a difference of sixty degrees K. That\u0027s bloody ridiculous. There was a big snowstorm in March, the only one this year. Right now it\u0027s cloudy and I\u0027m hopeful. I like the winter better because you can do something about the cold. Not the heat.
