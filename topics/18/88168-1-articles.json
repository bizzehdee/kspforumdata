Five months. 150 days. We\u0027ve been waiting since APRIL 29th! And it is coming. Soon. Soon. Less than one week. We have been waiting. His name is Rendog. And he... is returning. He was the FIRST youtuber I ever watched!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what is all this hype about? What series?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027ll answer the first question with a question: Why are you asking what the hype is about? It\u0027s obvious!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to answer the second question: It\u0027s a Minecraft Let\u0027s Play. I know what you\u0027re thinking, but hear me out, alright? First, this was the first minecraft lets play I ever watched! I\u0027ve been watching it since Season 1, Episode 51. The upcoming video is.... Season 4, episode 1. I am a dedicated viewer. But, over these 5 months, I have forgotten him. Due to a video drought. He uploaded a season 4 teaser about 2 months ago, but that was it for a while, enough to bring my viewership back for a few days. But then it left again. Until about a week ago, when he uploaded 4 videos, all titled, \u0022Our Escape [Part # of 4]\u0022, and that got me hyped. I am so excited, I may lose sleep over it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T02:09:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T03:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh Rendog.

I really enjoyed his Terraria series (I used to be a BIG Terraria player... I had over 1000 hours in that game) so understandably, I was a bit sad that he discontinued it in favor of a Minecraft series. But I\u0027m getting way off topic now, at least its good to see that he\u0027s still \u0022in business\u0022 so to speak.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T03:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Stratzenblitz75\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eapparently I cant math\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyDarkStar","CreatedById":115126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T13:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI miss macey dean....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
