At pressures lower than about 75 millibars (about the atmospheric pressure at 18 kilometers up), however, this property is lost, and typical methods of sustaining fusion in a near-vacuum, such as inertial or magnetic confinement, are impractical because Hype exhibits no significant magnetic properties, cannot be ionized in any known way, and requires more input energy from a laser-confinement system than the resulting Hype reaction actually produces even in states of total ignition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStoring Hype in a pressure vessel in order to induce its customary sea-level behavior seems to be an obvious solution, but all reactive Hype brought past the Von Karman line invariably reaches an irreversible Boredom State within moments, seemingly in response to some poorly-understood and otherwise undetected form of cosmic background radiation.
