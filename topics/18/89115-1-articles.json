She enjoys playing casual games like angry birds and she\u0027s really into The Sims but she can\u0027t acknowledge value in anything else (you don\u0027t imagine how much time I spent trying to explain to her how awesome KSP is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing, she respects my view as she understands games are very important for me and I respect (although am secretly a bit sad for) her lack of fascination for an entire entertainment medium. I honestly just think she\u0027s been playing the wrong games and am anticipating Telltale\u0027s Game of Thrones game (she loooves GoT) as I think that might slightly change her opinion. But that\u0027s all aside from the main point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe point is:\u003C/strong\u003E Although she tries to respect games she doesn\u0027t believe a game can be scary. I don\u0027t believe I can make her like games but I do believe games are at least (if not more) as scary as movies. There\u0027s tons of reasons for why I think that so I\u0027m not going into that here... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we made a bet... If I can introduce her to a game that genuinely frightens her she pays me dinner and acknowledge games as scary... If she\u0027s not scared I\u0027ll pay dinner... Seems simple, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo here is where I need some help: \u003C/strong\u003EI need help deciding which game she should play. She finds ghost/haunting movies scarier so I wanted a horror game that would focus more on supernatural. Also since she isn\u0027t a gamer I would like a game that\u0027d have a simple control scheme so she could quickly forget which keys to press. The third thing that is very important is, she\u0027s not going to play the game for 8 hours straight to beat it so it either must be a small(ish) game or a game where the horror escalates pretty quickly and the scarier parts are delivered relatively quickly. Also any suggestion must keep in mind she doesn\u0027t exactly \u0022respect\u0022 games all that much so we need to think if the game might be considered \u0022silly\u0022 to a non-gamer. If she sees a horror trope on a movie she ignores it but if she see\u0027s it on a game I think she\u0027ll be quick to point it out, laugh and dismiss the rest of the experience as the immersion will be killed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the game must: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBe about supernatural horror (like Paranormal Activity or The Conjuring) and not about other kinds of horror (zombies, aliens, monsters, psychopaths);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBe small or at least quick to deliver some good scares (she won\u0027t play for that long);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe game must avoid things that might be considered \u0022funny\u0022 or else she\u0027ll disengage of the experience. This includes over the top action sequences and maybe some of the things from the latter silent hill games (giant faces on a room);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave a simple (as much as possible) control scheme so she can easily get used to it. If she spends a lot of time thinking about the correct keys to press she\u0027ll quickly jump out of the immersion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENot be heavy on action/shooting.

Penumbra has the same issues as Amnesia (while I loooved Penumbra). Which leaves us with SCP and Slender... I know Slender is great and very scary and since I have the newer version (Slender: The arrival) we can play that. It\u0027s about ghosts (a ghost) it has very simple controls and each playthrough can be very quick. On the other hand I never heard of SCP: Containment Breach. It does look very promising but I\u0027m afraid it might be a bit too much like F.E.A.R. or Dead Space. Even though it\u0027s scary I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll be turned off by the sci-fi setting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill I\u0027m going to take a closer look at SCP: Containment Breach but for now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETHE WINNER IS: SLENDER!!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those interested, here\u0027s a complete list of results (ranked by votes and alphabetical order):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmnesia - 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenumbra - 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCP Containment Breach - 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlender - 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlien Isolation - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClive Barker\u0027s Undying - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECry of Fear - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarkness Within 2 - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalf-Life - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParanormal - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutlast - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilent Hill - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Shock - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help everyone! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broax","CreatedById":109333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T14:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do I make this not sound awkward - probably more fun this way anyway: Hide a cam in your playroom. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol Maybe I\u0027ll put my GoPro to good use...
