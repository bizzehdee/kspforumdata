The first place I start is with the motherboard and processor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a specific type of processor that you like then you can start with that, I usually like to put AMD processors into my machienes so I\\\u0027ll look for an AMD board to start with, so for example, I recently upgraded to the new FX series processors from AMD so I shopped around (mostly on newegg.com) and looked up boards that were compatable with the type of processor that I wanted to put in there. Then I just made sure that the board had things on there that I wanted. I made sure that it had a proper video card slot, that the board supported the ammount of RAM that I wanted to put into my machiene, if it had SATA 6.0Gb/s ports for the hard drives and whatever else I wanted with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have those two things its pretty much just fill in the holes after that. Just pick yourself up a video card, a hard drive, an OS, and whatever other things you want to put in it. Just make sure that you get compatible RAM for your motherboard and a Power Supply Unit (PSU) to make sure things stay powered and thats pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewegg has nice little helpers to show you which \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/MemoryFinder/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERAM\u003C/a\u003E is compatible with your board and an estimator on how much \u003Ca href=\u0022http://images10.newegg.com/BizIntell/tool/psucalc/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epower\u003C/a\u003E you will need to run your machiene so they make it pretty easy to get yourself up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T18:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XenuOT3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XenuOT3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general you just want to make sure that everything is compatible with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the toughest part of building a PC.
