Too much similar activity overstresses your body and it gets tired. Focus more on sports or other outside activity. Your body will recover a bit and you will get better again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple rule: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour relax activity should be different to your everyday duties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWich means:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have lot of mental activity (students, teachers, engineers, etc.) your freetime should be focused on manual activity (Sports, gardening, tourism etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have lot of body activity (Sportsmans, manual workers, etc) then you need mental activity to relax.
