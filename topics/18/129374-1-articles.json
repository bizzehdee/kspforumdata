Basically, if you get the kill and die in the process, it is overall worse for you than for them. That is because you are going to miss minions (coloq. farm) and thus gold. Also, killing 16 minions (one wave worth of them) roughly equals one kill, so it\u0027s not that much. Despite the urge you might have, I\u0027d recommend only going for the kill if you are ahead enough.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLearn to last hit minions ASAP. It will boost your scores enormously. My technique is to wait until they are at about 10% health or so (without hitting them myself, letting our minions to do the damage), then do one attack as last hit. For starters, try to aim for 35-40 minions killed at the 10 min mark, or 80-90\u00A0by 20 min. As you learn, push the envelope further and further. When I stopped playing, I was routinely having 70 creeps at 10 min, and I was among the worse players in my division.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRanged champions, especially so-called AP Mids (mages) are easier to play in my opinion, but they lack toughness.

Most others are not too hard either, but avoid Syndra, Orianna, Kindred, Rumble, Heimerdinger, Azir\u00A0and pretty much any support champion in your first games.

Always ensure you are able to see where the enemies are, and where they may be. If they are missing from map, notify your team. Always have vision wards at important places like baron and dragon, but depending on your progress you may move your ward to jungles, yours or theirs. Once you see enough enemy movement, you can read their strategy and respond appropriately. Information warfare is extremely important if either you or them has a jungler, since it is important for those champions to be able to gank unnoticed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoba games are rather similar to chess in a way, in that there is only a numbers of possible moves at one time, and learning to recognize them early then counter them will help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
