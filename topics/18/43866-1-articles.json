It\u0027s way more than any realistic hardware you can imagine (I mean like oculus rift etc.) However it is a little it difficult at he beginning to stay awake as you usually wake up when you realize you are in a dream.

As said by everyone else, this part of your brain is kept switched off during sleep for a reason. Like sleep-walking, your brain sometimes forgets to switch things off, and things happen.

Also, based on experience, lucid dreaming doesn\u0027t have to last the entire dream, because I remember on one instance I realized I was in a dream, but I thought that it was too risky turning it into a nightmare, so I tried to avoid thinking about it, and I eventually forgot about that (something easy to do in a dream) and it turned back into a normal dream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: \u003C/strong\u003EIt\u0027s your dream, do whatever the heck you want to do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miracmert","CreatedById":67128,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T10:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randox\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randox\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nRandox said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nWhat I am reading now would suggest that rather than strengthen connections, NREM sleep weakens them to return the brain to a base state, and make important stuff stand out.
