I found something interesting, Helium 5 decays into Helium 4. And if you shoot a neutron at a nucleus, it will be one isotope higher. You could exploit this by using a neutron gun to shoot a neutron at a helium 4 nucleus and it will turn into a helium 5 atom. That will then decay into helium 4 and a neutron witch could hit another helium 4 atom and so on, so on. Tell me what you think of this idea.
