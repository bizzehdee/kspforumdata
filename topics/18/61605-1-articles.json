I am asking on behalf of a developer of a Satellite Tracking program(WXtrack). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll was working well, with the orbit numbers matching up with NASAs display in the ISS control room, however recently they seem to be out of sync. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example at 16.00 UTC the space station was on its 14th Orbit for today, yet wxtrack is showing 11th. The developer is trying to fix this but as he is unsure how these numbers are defined its proving a bit difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a friend on facebook that works in the control room and he says this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not really sure of criteria on when Orbit 1 begins, will need to check. It\u0027s not based on GMT 00, we just started a new Orbit 1 at approximately 20 GMT. That also means it is not based on the original launch time of Zarya, which was 06:40 GMT ON 11/20/98.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense, and appreciate any help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiam\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
