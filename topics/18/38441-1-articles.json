Please don\u0027t be hostile towards this game As I see this is probably how this thread will end because of people against FPS will start arguments. Well anyways what\u0027s your rank, What clan are you in, What\u0027s your favorite ship?

Been a heck while I pulled it out though, I played Halo 4 more lately. I think I was... Captain grade 3??? I don\u0027t remember, honestly I barely played online at all. Playing an FPS\u0027s online are not my thing. But yeah, my favourite ship will always and forever be the Pillar of Autumn.

It\u0027s quite complicated, I\u0027ll try to get a big picture for you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBungie first made Halo: Combat Evolved independently. It was supposed to be this game and that\u0027s all. Turned out the success of it was far over what they expected. Soon enough, they decided to make a trilogy out of it. In the meanwhile, Halo caught the attention of Microsoft Studios. Bungie and Microsoft Studios made an agreement to work on the next games together, and thus, Microsoft had a hand on Halo from the second game of the series. After making Halo 3, Bungie decided that they did not wish to push the Halo franchise further and said that Reach would be the last Halo game made by them. However, As stated above, Microsoft has rights on the Halo franchise, and they decided that they wanted to push it further. Thus, they created 343 Industries (after 343 Guilty Spark), a Microsoft Studios subdivision who\u0027s only purpose is to make new Halo games. 343 industries made Halo Wars, worked in cooperation with Bungie for Halo Reach and then made Halo 4, starting a second trilogy for the franchise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, Bungie didn\u0027t sell the Halo franchise. They just decided to \u0022quit the project\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since I don\u0027t think I played Halo Reach in a year, and that my Live subscription is most likely expired, I\u0027m forced to politely decline your offer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E As I said above, I barely play online at all, and when I feel like busting some Convenants, I usually go for Halo 4 :l\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T00:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0060t like 4,something just felt...off about it and it ruined the whole thing for me.Reach on the other hand the scale of everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T01:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E343 industries made Halo Wars\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Ensemble Studios\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did play Halo Reach, though I haven\u0027t touched it for awhile, and it was my last Halo game.
