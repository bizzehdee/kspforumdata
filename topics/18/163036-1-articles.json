The rocket has a nice heft to it and is very solid. The lunar module fits nicly in the provided fairing, and the service module engine as well. It is very accurate to the original.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did not like the command\u00A0and service modules themselves. They were too plain and didnt fit in with the rest of the craft. The provided CM was also plain white with no printing, but the \u0022landed\u0022 one in the ocean scene had printing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, it was a great build and a lot of fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Regor","CreatedById":175796,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-09T01:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy birthday!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
