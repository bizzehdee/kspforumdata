Considering that kerbals throw much bigger things around, perhaps an estimate of 100T (100000kg) would be more reasonable. That needs .007c in velocity. And, since we\u0027re hitting a planet, we know all the energy will be delivered to the target. With the kraken drives of 0.23, you can get that velocity in 13374 seconds, or about four hours. And, since those drives are a) dirt cheap and b) produce acceleration, not force, they can throw limitless asteroids of 3800T (class E), which match the ICBM at only .001c (300000m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why finding out the Human\u0027s universe\u0027s physical laws make pretty much everything that makes them better than us useless is going to be a \u003Cstrong\u003Ereal\u003C/strong\u003E bummer for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T05:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal can into relativistic weapons only if they have access to cfg files or have KSPI-E mod installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven their chemical engines are much worse than\u00A0the humans\u0027,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, do not tell them about KSPI-E and restrict their privileges on\u00A0cfg files editing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-29T12:30:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2016 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T09:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, if you restrict them to our physics...
