The domain is no more. This doesn\u0027t mean that the content has vanished, though, because a site called Spacedock.info has taken all the code and put it on themselves to host, run, and display all that Kerbalstuff once had. This isn\u0027t an old-friend-died-now-replaced-too-soon type deal, it\u0027s a group that picked up the pieces left behind by someone who no longer wanted to devote his time and effort to the mod site. He let them take it, and now that\u0027s what it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you ask me, this isn\u0027t a bad thing. It allows all the old and abandoned mods to get cleared out, and new ones to take their place. It\u0027s a fresh start for the community. It\u0027s the same, yet new. It\u0027s up to you and me to treat it like KSP community family, so let\u0027s give it a warm welcome:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.spacedock.info/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceDock.info\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T05:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease stop making new threads about the Kerbal Stuff thing, folks.
