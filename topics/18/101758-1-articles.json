Turn off computer, let it sit for a little bit.\n\nStep2.) Ground yourself, open up computer; clean the inside\n\nStep3.) Take the GT 630, Install it into the PCI Express port\n\nStep4.) Close it back up, turn on computer\n\nStep5.) Confirm that the computer registers a new Driver (but it wouldn\u0027t be active)\n\nStep6.) Go the the Nvidia Website, install the GT 630, let it do its thing\n\nStep7.) Take the monitor output cable out of the Integrated\n\nStep8.) Take the monitor output cable and plug it into the GT 630\u0027s Input.\n\nIs this right? More to it?
