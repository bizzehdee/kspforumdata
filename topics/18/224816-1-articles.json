When I was a kindergarten student in the 80\u2019s we had half day (am and pm kindergartens, I was PM) classes and my mom would wake me up. After breakfast and an hour or two before the bus shed draw me a bath and tell me to bathe. While I was doing that shed make me lunch. A can of vancamps beanie weenies warmed on the stove, a glass of milk and two slices of bread cut diagonally with butter on them. Id sit in my chair and shed give me my lunch. Then shed walk over to the tv and turn on PBS so I could watch 3, 2, 1 Contact!\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003Ei cherish the memory of those simple days.
