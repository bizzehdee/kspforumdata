I was with my friend at a lake and around 9:30 PM she pointed out a bright light moving across the sky and it was too quiet to be a plane so I googled ISS sightings for Edmonton and sure enough right there, April 9th 9:23 to 9:27 PM. A couple moments before it went out of sight she noticed a dim light trailing right behind it. I actually said to myself \u0022there is no way that\u0027s what I\u00A0think it is\u0022. After it disappeared I googled launches to the ISS and I\u0027m betting there\u0027s a good chance what I saw was the cargo ship prior to docking that launched on the 8th. I rechecked the pass times and it was coming back just before 11 so we went back out and watched it for a couple of minutes before it passed into the shadow of the Earth halfway over the planet. She wasn\u0027t as interested with it as I was and was more concerned with the fact that it was only 3 degrees out. It was incredibly cool for me though and I\u0027m going to watch it tomorrow night (today I guess) around 10 for sure. I was wondering if anyone here has some cool stories about seeing the ISS. It was amazing and now I really want to invest in a good camera.
