The computational unit can be located in the playing computer itself (multithreading without the program needing to be thread safe) or it could be located on other computer. So, in short, if your game lags, just throw more computers into it. This have an advantage that a normal supercomputer cluster could run the computation units\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KSP have a lot of this brute force physics power, maybe all the things/vessels doesn\u0027t need to be on rails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is: Is it possible?

Then you have a \u0060mod\u0060 program handled by a message passing interface and so forth with a main controller program. Split the host PC into many 4Gb sections each with their own domain of control that recieve inputs and pass outputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless Unity cannot pass information to another program in real time I don\u0060t see the problem as far as it being possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a pig to program though with all the different setups people have and would require a rewrite from the ground up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
