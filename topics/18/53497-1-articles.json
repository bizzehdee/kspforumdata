For the same price, you\u0027re much better off with a tower. However I myself game on a laptop. Turns out last year my tower died for good and my laptop was old (eight years) and needed replacement for school. Instead of paying a tower about 800$ and a laptop for school at about 400$, I went for something that could do both easily. Not exactly a gaming laptop, but a potent laptop. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-HP-Pavilion-m6-1050sg-Notebook.83080.0.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is what I got\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8Gb of RAM, dual graphics with an AMD 7670 2Gb dedicated/AMD 7660 integrated, AMD A-10 4600m processor, 2.3Ghz quad core, usually clocks up to 2.8Ghz, and fits in my bag for school.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rolls KSP just fine with rather high graphics, Portal 2 at highest graphics without a problem, and performs very well on most games. Of course it\u0027s limited by being a laptop and often struggles for air. Got it for 800$CAD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically all this to say, if you are just looking for something to game on, don\u0027t get a laptop. You could get the same stats out of a tower for 600$US probably. There\u0027s no point into getting a laptop for gaming as laptop are inherently not good for gaming. But if you need one for reasons, and, like me, are restricted on money and need a potent gaming platform, you can get a good deal if you look a bit. It won\u0027t be the best, but it will do the job. There\u0027s no point into getting a 1500$ laptop for gaming, you\u0027re really just throwing cash out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T06:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGaming laptop?
