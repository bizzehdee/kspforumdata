Back in the winter of \u002794, my old man came to me for a second opinion on what car to buy to replace the aging family station wagon. I\u0027d been driving motorcycles pretty much exclusively until then, and only had an \u0022M\u0022 class license (motorbike-only for non-Ontario peoples; it acts as a beginner\u0027s permit for any car (which was called a 365 at the time), but dealers aren\u0027t going to let an M-licensed/365 person drive a shiny car from their lot) . He wanted to buy a standard transmission car, and hadn\u0027t driven manual in years, so we generally took automatics out, or let the dealer drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, while we were at a Ford dealership, they had a new, 1995 Ford Probe GT in - an inexpensive, rather sharp looking sports coupe (three liter, six banger, if I recall correctly). The sales guy took the car out and started pushing it through it\u0027s paces. Dad was up front in the passenger seat, and I was in the rear seat, feeling a bit cramped. We were heading up a hill, and the last thing I remember is the sales guy saying, \u0022let\u0027s see what this baby can do\u0022. Apparently we hit a patch of ice and spun into oncoming traffic and hit an old boxy Oldsmobile, which completely crushed the rear end of the Probe. The sales guy was pretty badly hurt and I was rushed to the hospital, unconscious. I\u0027d taken a pretty heavy blow, and to this day can\u0027t recall what happened between those last words and about a week later. Took a good deal of dental work to get the teeth on the right side of my mouth back in shape, but fortunately the dealership had insurance which paid for everything (dental isn\u0027t covered under OHIP, never was).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDad decided to buy a different car. The sales guy was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road. The Probe GT was a write-off (there\u0027s a photo of it somewhere), although I bet the dealership got a good number of parts out of it, the front end was undamaged. I always watch like a hawk when other people are driving me.
