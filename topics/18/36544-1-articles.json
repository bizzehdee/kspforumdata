Most of the community is very helpful to new players, and the game can range from quiet buildup of a planet\u0027s economy, to intergalactic total war (One happened just recently, but I was not a part of it). I am not one of the major players in the politics of any super-cluster, but even small players, like me, have the ability to conquer every one of a player\u0027s planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T12:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat site has no screenshots.
