Kids know and say worse but the MPAA is an ancient organization with leadership just as old, naive, and prude. They say that a pg-13 can only have 2 f-bombs. No frontal nudity but butts are ok. The book realistically is a pg-13 book even with all of the cursing. In this day an age I think the distinction should be drawn at nudity. Even though realistically as well kids see much worse too on the internet. However if we are going to have ratings swearing is the least of the MPAA concern. Over sexualization that is a problem also extreme violence. I\u0027m not talking about like die hard violence. I\u0027m talking the likes of the SAW series. I think long story short realistically there are things kids see and hear everyday. Swearing, the oversexualization of everything from Halloween costumes to bubble gum and fighting and violence in video games and on tv.

When the upper stage burns out the capsule separates from it.  \n\nBut what\u0027s the idea here? Is the MAV capsule also the capsule the crew will use to return to earth once Hermes is back in earth orbit? Seems like a waste if that\u0027s the case, having to haul MAV capsule with its earth reentry rated heat shield all the way to mars, land it on mars, then haul it all the way up to martian orbit then haul it all the way back to earth for splashdown. Wouldn\u0027t it be much easier to ditch the MAV in martian orbit and do the Hermes crew exchange with a spacecraft launched from earth when Hermes returns?"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T07:52:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Temstar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For those of you who read the book, can you explain a bit about the MAV to me?\n\u003E \n\nThe MAV was not hauled to Mars by Hermes, it was sent there on its own way before the crew set out. It lands on Mars and generates its own fuel from the Martian atmosphere, only bringing enough hydrogen to do so. (Should the MAV fail, the mission would be scrapped/delayed, as Hermes does not carry a Mars-orbit-surface transfer vehicle.)\n\nThe only complete MAV launch we do see is Mark\u0027s at the end, when the MAV has been stripped down to its bare necessities, even ditching the OMS (Orbital Maneuvering System). Whether the OMS was part of the capsule (possible, as the thrusters Martinez used to keep the MAV upright during the initial storm seemed to fire from the capsule itself) I do not know, but it seems that way by how it seperates in orbit.\n\nWe also have no information on the means of the crew to return to Earth\u0027s surface. As Hermes will enter an orbit, it might be possible that a seperate vehicle is launched - although that would need a dedicated launcher, a waste in and of itself if you ask me. Maybe they use the same vehicle that brought them up at the beginning of their mission, maybe NASA has a new space station with an orbital shuttle to pick them up and return them with a resupply vehicle - the book says nothing about this. (iirc, bits)\n\nThe stories Ares mission follows basically the same profile as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct#Mission_scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct#Mission_scenario) with some differences regarding the introduction of the Hermes.  \n\nAnd I found this here [https://www.docdroid.net/Zxk9zKw/the-martian-ares-3-mission-guide.pdf.html](https://www.docdroid.net/Zxk9zKw/the-martian-ares-3-mission-guide.pdf.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-06T07:58:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2016 07:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T08:18:14Z","Content":"I know of course MAV did not come with Hermes - given that MAV for Ares IV was already on planet when Hermes was still busy with the Ares III mission. However if the crewed part of the MAV only needs to dock with Hermes and then discarded in Martian orbit then the separation between the capsule and its upper stage seems a bit pointless - that would be like having a separation event between the Apollo LM and its ascent engine before docking with the CSM.  \n\nI figure if I was to design the mission then when Hermes return to earth after mission complete then there will be an exchange of crew with something like an Orion (or a smaller manned spacecraft, if Hermes actually returns to LEO) where the Ares III crew will hand the ship over to the Ares IV crew for refurbishment before their mission, and the Ares III crew will then ride the capsule back to earth.  \n\nActually I just remembered something - at the very end of the movie it showed the Ares III crew looking at live TV coverage of a launch for Ares IV and it showed an Delta-IV Heavy launch, so the crew exchange could very well be done with something like an Orion. Seen as the Ares III crew is already on the ground, if the Delta-IV Heavy was carrying a manned spacecraft that would probably be an exchange of crew between Ares IV crew and caretaker crew that mans Hermes between Mars trips.  \n\nDon\u0027t get me started on MAV\u0027s OMS, if it\u0027s powerful enough to resist a storm that could topple the ship then surely it would be powerful enough to make up that 20m/s.  \n\nAnyway one thing I thought was really cool was that throw away line by the deputy head of CNSA who said something like  \u0022I\u0027ve had our engineer run the numbers and our Taiyangshen boosters is powerful enough to boost their payload to Mars\u0022. I thought that was actually a very important thing that\u0027s probably not apparent to someone who\u0027s not familiar with orbital mechanics or play KSP - although Hermes and Iris docked above earth, the Iris probe was actually already on a course in the general direction of Mars after it separated from it\u0027s booster (plus any delta-V added by Iris\u0027s own engines). If Hermes shutdown its engine then Iris and Hermes will actually drift side by side for a very long time to near Mars orbit. Conversely if Hermes wasn\u0027t able to dock with Iris for some reason then Iris might still be able to land on Mars to supply Mark while four of the five crew kill themselves to allow that girl to return to Earth alone on the Hermes.  \n\nIIRC, the original launch vehicle for Iris was some kind of Atlas V, one of those big ones with lots of SRB but not a three core one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-06T08:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2016 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T08:45:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, Temstar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E if the crewed part of the MAV only needs to dock with Hermes and then discarded in Martian orbit then the separation between the capsule and its upper stage seems a bit pointless  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Ares III crew will hand the ship over to the Ares IV crew for refurbishment before their mission, and the Ares III crew will then ride the capsule ship back to earth.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E at the very end of the movie it showed the Ares III crew looking at live TV coverage of a launch for Ares IV and it showed an Delta-IV Heavy launch, so the crew exchange could very well be done with something like an Orion.

And the same as with Iris (see below) Mark would have been on a trajectory to solar orbit, right? So no quick and painless death by crashing back onto Mars, no?\n\nThe Taiyangshen was able to reach Mars and could have resupplied Mark, yes.

This would require the Ares IV MAV ascent scene to include a shot of the OMS firing after separation from the upper stage. The CG artists might have had this in mind when they designed the movie MAV but was probably cut due to time.

There were other minor things that the movie changed (Crew left Sol 18 instead of Sol 6, etc. etc.) but they\u0027re tiny nooks and crannies that a sane person probably shouldn\u0027t pay attention to. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The design of the space suit.. looks funky. It is described in the book that his face isn\u0027t visible, while it is in the movie. Then again, not seeing Watney\u0027s face for a big portion of the movie wouldn\u0027t look good. But it seems far less bulky than described, too.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seeing the rover finally made sense of things in my head. When I read the book, I didn\u0027t think of it as one with a full interior and everything, but one that looks like a modified Apollo rover. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hermes was also pretty big -- way larger than I expected. In my head, the Hermes looked like.. well, a bunch of solar panels, a Hitchhiker, and a Mobile Lab in KSP. Turns out it was far bigger.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Acidalia Planitia looked far different than I expected too. For a crater, I doubt it would have many mountains if at all. It\u0027s described as being really flat, so...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Movie was overall great (OST was also nice), but I think someone who hadn\u0027t read the book beforehand would\u0027ve enjoyed it far more.\n\u003E \n\n[@Columbia](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/135031-columbia/) glad you enjoyed it! The OST was ok, and the David Bowie soundtrack was very fitting too. Sad that he passed away this year ;("},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T22:11:04Z","Content":"I really, really enjoyed the book. It was really fun to read even though it wasn\u0027t 100% scientific and realistic. Let\u0027s be honest, would anyone want to read a boring mission report without any drama in it? I wouldn\u0027t.\n\nAbout the film: I really like Matt Damon as an actor. He performs really well. I didn\u0027t like \u0022Prometheus\u0022. Was fun to watch but definitely didn\u0027t have the feel of the first Alien movies. Also plot holes. OST and the special effects were spot on tho. Now you may think \u0027But what does \u0022Prometheus\u0022 has to do with \u0022The Martian?\u0022\u0027 Same director, obviously. \u0022The Martian\u0022 as a film didn\u0027t have the same feel as the book, which is something I was expecting after I\u0027ve seen what has been done to \u0022Prometheus\u0022. It lacked the funny parts and some things were changed. I don\u0027t mind the fact that they had to remove some events from the film, but the Pathfinder could at least get fried just like in the book. Or the storm That Watney encountered on his way. By only mentioning and showing how he puts the solar panels there and going back would take like 1 or 2 extra minutes? It was a really smart move and I feel like the whole movie was kind of stripped off all of those smart moments.\n\nThe Book: 9/10\n\nThe film: OK/10"}]}
