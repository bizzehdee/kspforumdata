I looked around like a child looking at the things I dreamed of seeing in real life for the very first time. After all the reading about it, looking at pictures, remembering the names of astronauts who did the impossible and there you are, right in the middle of it. The roaming masses around me, weren\u0027t as amazed and totally enthralled as I was walking around that place. If you had fancied space flight and everything to do with space your entire life, you find a beauty in everything you see at that place. All of that was amazing technological art to me. And, a lot of people saw a grown man cry at these things and don\u0027t understand why. And I\u0027m glad they don\u0027t understand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/d5ba8/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T02:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really spectacular seeing these things for real. I remember when I saw the Saturn V for the first time, and marveled at the size of the F1 engines and the great length of the room in which it was kept. It was spectacular;\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was a machine that could take men to the Moon, the machine I had read about in books, watched in documentaries, and dreamt of flying in, and it was here, right in front of my eyes, in all its immensity and shiny metal splendor. I just wish I could have stayed to see\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDiscovery\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Emake its last roaring flight, it launched about a week after I went home. One day I\u0027ll watch a rocket launch, though, and one day I\u0027ll be in the rocket and I\u0027ll leave the \u0022watching\u0022 to others because I\u0027ll have to be doing the \u0022doing\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing I want more than to watch a sunset on Mars, then see the miniscule Earth in the night sky. I am working towards that goal now, and I will keep working towards it until I have done it. My generation will travel farther than ever before, regardless of NASA\u0027s underfunding. Politics can slow, but cannot ultimately suppress humankind\u0027s desire to become one with the stars. Science and engineering will push on through each new frontier, making our world a better place for us and letting us travel to countless new worlds to make them our homes as well. Before the end of the century, spacecraft will launch from today\u0027s airports carrying passengers from one side of Earth to the other in less than an hour. The Future has started, and it is about to get awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Did you eat lunch at the restaurant by the Saturn V?
