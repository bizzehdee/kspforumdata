I have applied my nascent rocketry knowledge (acquired exclusively via a few days with KSP) to another game with which I am enthralled: Osmos HD - and I\u0027m completely amazed to find that the ballistics still work! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E There are only Level Based hoop jumps in that game, applying orbital mechanics to propel \u0026amp; steer a \u0022galactic mote\u0022 through various challenges. But accelerating in the right direction - and at the right speed, timing, and using an economic amount of force - to alter your flight path becomes very, very intuitive, after having had my Kerbal perform a midflight burn course correction or three. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOsmos HD is not a rival for KSP, btw - only a vastly different (and cool) application of arguably universal math and mechanics; but I wonder if there are any other geeky apps/games/sims that utilize the same synapses as these two games - which I am finding to be way good for my meager brains!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease share anything (games or otherwise) of a similar bent, \u0026amp; I\u0027ll go back to flinging my Kerbals off this rock (while munching on Fig Newtons)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder what real rocket scientists say, when a problem is too simple? \u0022Well...it ain\u0027t brain surgery.\u0022? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T18:35:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I quite enjoyed those levels in Osmos. Took me about 5 seconds to realize what was going on though. There was that game on Android that came out, everyone said it was like 2D ksp. Also \u0027Curiosity: The Mars Mission\u0027 is a fun and free Android game. My Kindle unfortunately lost its root and I can\u0027t seem to re-root so I cannot use Google play!
