However on the other hand, War Thunder was actually able to run (to a small extent) and only was it when I joined a game did it crash. In comparison, KSP crashed on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, My question is this: Should I take the plunge and remove the Saved App State and see what happens?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T14:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do know the title says wart thunder, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketTurtle","CreatedById":67534,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T03:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEw...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T03:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALso I don\u0027t have permission to read that thread... for some reason...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wulf899","CreatedById":67061,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T02:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELol.\u003Cp\u003EALso I don\u0027t have permission to read that thread... for some reason...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to sign in to see it, far as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
