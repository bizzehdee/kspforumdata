So i found that making a recovery disk (which was recommended) helped to a minor extent. it took like 5-6 hrs to fix and I haven\u0027t tried to reboot due to fears of not working again and losing my precious data. but I managed to get in and am typing this but everything takes a few minutes to open and everything is laggy.

He took it to the local computer place and discovered that something was funky with the hard drive. Another thing happened with the computer with I am using is that it got a bad case of root kit which is a really bad kind of virus that sneaks in past your anti virus stuff and starts wrecking everything. We had to take that in to the computer store as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T17:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to guess that your HDD is on the verge of failing.

It essentially filled it to the brim, deleted the cache and repeated about a dozen times. It still soldiers on, but crashes whenever you try to download anything bigger than a few Mb, or in a few other circumstances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep meaning to replace it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman116","CreatedById":108435,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T21:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get my computer working again, horrah! no 100-300 dollars wasted fixing it!
