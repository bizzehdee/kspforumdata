I came really close to buying an XPS 12 (the cool one by Dell that has a flip screen and turns into a tablet) but I decided to wait for the next gen to come out (while also saving my money so I could better afford such a luxury). The new lineup doesn\u0027t have any XPS laptop (yet...) but I do rather like the new Thinkpad Helix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering though, has anyone benchmarked the new Core M chips for gaming? Most of the Haswell laptops I\u0027ve seen for sale had Intel HD 4400 graphics, I\u0027m not sure what the new M chips have in terms of graphics to compare to. I know the big push for the M chips has been for battery efficiency, but it would be nice if Intel could have worked it\u0027s magic and made it more powerful than it\u0027s predecessor as well. KSP on the go on one of these would be really nice...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find a few links, but again I\u0027m not sure which laptops use which exact chips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ark.intel.com/products/75459/Intel-Core-i5-4200U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-2_60-GHz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ark.intel.com/products/75459/Intel-Core-i5-4200U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-2_60-GHz\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ark.intel.com/products/83612/Intel-Core-M-5Y70-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-2_60-GHz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ark.intel.com/products/83612/Intel-Core-M-5Y70-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-2_60-GHz\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
