It\u0027s really kind of cool, as I\u0027m sitting here already nailbiting in excitement over .17\u0027s (hopefully soon!) release, to go out and look at the folks who\u0027ll probably finally get humanity off this rock. Or at least help. These are the corporate guys who looked out at the solar system and said \u0022... hmm. Peter, there\u0027s money to be made out there. (referencing Mr. Diamandis, the lead engineer) \u003Cem\u003ELots of money.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 And, as history has quite ably shown, once the Governments get the exploration out of the way, it\u0027s always the entrepreneurs who get us to whereever we end up going, because they can and do do it more cheaply than the government ever could - thereby making space travel more of a reality (in this case) for all of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to the news stories..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.planetaryresources.com/2012/06/back-us-on-kickstarter/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.planetaryresources.com/2012/06/back-us-on-kickstarter/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.planetaryresources.com/2012/07/asteroids-alien-planets-or-your-house/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.planetaryresources.com/2012/07/asteroids-alien-planets-or-your-house/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
