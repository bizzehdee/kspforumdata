It was a good time, and an important time for me to further my knowledge of Space and science in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m making this post because I want to say thanks to KSP for installing in me a love of flying and engineering. Though those things were always a part of me, KSP brought out an interest in flight that no other game had truly captivated me with. I\u0027ve come a long way since I first started playing in 2014. Funny to think it\u0027s been more than half a decade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a video I recently made of my recent advances in my flight adventures. I have to add another thank you credit to KSP for inspiring me to first start making videos, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the best, everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JmrHAHoSro?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
