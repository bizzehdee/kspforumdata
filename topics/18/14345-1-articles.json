Oh FSX supports TrackIR or the alternative which you have to make yourself lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying that there are allot of VFR scenery files and airports replacements out there which just pushes the envelope up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh if its Helicopter\\\u0027s you want to play with... id suggest doing a good search for mods/files to optimize for it, in FSX helo\\\u0027s are an after thought, flyable but an afterthought non the less (granted missions with the EH-101 are pretty fun, Customs intercept and Mt St Helens evac.... two missions that have to be done though are the \u0027Secret Shuttle\u0027 bus services to Area 51 and the \u0027Amazon Trek\u0027 in a Grunman Goose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir Hauler is a good add on, though to me it felt half finished (so i thought I\\\u0027d code my own Courier type Virtual Airline... which is progressing!) You got some good Virtual Airlines and multiplayer networks like VATSIM. 100 Dollar Burger flights are fun if your into your GA but for Big Tin a VA is really the way to go, it gives purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on about this for ages, I\\\u0027ll stop now... I don\\\u0027t want to but I will! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (Apologies if the post is a little erratic... it\\\u0027s end of the working day and its friday the brain is fried!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy! OH and make sure you bought FSX Gold or the Acceleration Pack separate. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rs2k","CreatedById":7965,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T18:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, Xplane is a lot more accurate when it comes to aerodynamics... but I don\\\u0027t think that\\\u0027s very important for pilot simulations. FSX is accurate enough that except for the missing visual queues and forces on the yoke and rudder, flying a mushy, near stall simulated Cessna 172 feels very similar to flying a real Cessna 172 near a stall. I think FSX takes the prize for being a better pilot trainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t say the same for downloaded aircraft. I have a lot of time in Sundowners (musketeers) and Bonanzas. the downloaded Beech aircraft don\\\u0027t handle anything like the real things. The Beech aircraft were a dream to fly while the game versions felt a lot like Cessnas that just flew at different speeds. By the way, I don\\\u0027t like Cessnas, they are safe and stable aircraft, but they fly like dump trucks. haha!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"be77solo","CreatedById":28365,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T23:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFSX is a great choice, and as mentioned make sure you get the Acceleration Pack if you didn\\\u0027t get the Gold edition. The flying physics feel great and the visuals are just fine, really nice IMHO. You\\\u0027ll love it, and it will help you save both time and money if you ever do pursue real world flying... which I can\\\u0027t recommend enough!!! I am a pilot and own a single engine Grumman, and nothing else compares to spending a nice crisp morning punching holes in the sky to both forget stresses and have a ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX-plane I REALLY want to like, and have owned all versions since 4, but the flight physics while \u0027suppose\u0027 to be better and modeled on the actual airflow, etc, just have always felt wonky to me... very bouncy and just very unsatisfying.... I do enjoy the failures it models, but Austin (the developer) has yet to get the \u0027feel\u0027 right. Not to mention I can\\\u0027t get version 10 to run worth a crap on my system, while every other sim runs great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrosoft Flight is dogged a whole lot, and in my opinion that\\\u0027s just not justified... I have finally taken the time to actually play with it, and it\\\u0027s basically FSX improved in about every way, just limited to currently Hawaii and Alaska scenery and nowhere near the aircraft choices. The warbirds without cockpits are an annoyance to sim fans, but the actual flight model and simulator itself is fantastic. The planes just feel proper and handle as expected, and the \u0027deluxe\u0027 planes that include virtual cockpits are quite frankly fantastic... the RV-6A and Maule especially. I really hope this does well and Microsoft continues to develop this sim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the other mentioned military sims are awesome... the entire DCS series, B-17 2, and IL2-1946.... can\\\u0027t go wrong with any of those!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with your new sim! I\\\u0027m sure you\\\u0027ll have a ball!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
