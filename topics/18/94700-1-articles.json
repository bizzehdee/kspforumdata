Nuclear powered reactor supplying constant thrust throughout the journey, thereby generating gravity onboard the ship. Water, Algae, livestock and an entire earth-like eco-system brought on board. Far fetched for the 1960\u0027s or even today? Yes, the envy of any Kerbal, and that\u0027s where the twist comes in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy\u003C/strong\u003E: NATO (founded 1949) realized that it could not withstand a Soviet land invasion into Europe, and has always had as one of it\u0027s first defensive strategies the use of nuclear weapons to ward off ground advances. They calculated the risk of war with Russia, and along with it the decimation of American civilization to be rather high. I think it stands to reason that if the US thought they could build such a ship at that time, they would\u0027ve. I mean, they built command posts in mountains, shelters in cities, eventually put nukes on subs, featured \u0022duck and cover\u0022 drills and commercials featuring the end of the world nearly every week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDo they even know about the planets there?\u003C/strong\u003E: Not back then, but the ship was designed to support life onboard 30 years after arrival, and the base building systems where designed to establish the ship\u0027s eco-system in structures underground. The ship was also equipped with terraforming labs for multiple types of planets. They didn\u0027t need life there, they would bring the life and perpetuate it. Also, don\u0027t forget the twist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd what happens if we do get FTL in this alternate reality universe and show up there before them?

I don\u0027t remember a simulation room, where was that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut remember the first color films came out in the early 1930\u0027s and wizard of oz came out in 1939. By the late 1950\u0027s color projectors were fairly common in theaters I would think, and we all know the military has stuff before the public (especially at that time). And you are right that they strongly emphasized R\u0026amp;D onboard during the journey (there were scientists that \u0022left Earth\u0022 to join the crew afterall, probably some of the smarter ones lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I thought was a bit far fetched were the commodore-like computer systems onboard.
