That\u0027s a latest generation card, a massive leap over a 610 and should do well in almost all games. It also requires little power and most examples don\u0027t need a PCI-e power connector, so you shouldn\u0027t have any concerns about your power supply. Do get a 2GB model not a 1GB, some games will need the extra video memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD will I think offer you more performance for your money on Windows. The drawbacks are much higher power consumption, so you\u0027ll need to check your power supply can handle it, and inferior performance on Linux if that\u0027s a concern to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENever buy a graphics card for gaming which has a second digit \u0026lt;5.
