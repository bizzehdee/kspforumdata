As some of you may know I have a lower end PC so my choices were slightly limited, but I thought I would go ahead and share the games I got and what I think of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegends of Eisenwald: Its an RPG in midevil times but Its pretty crappy in my opinion, played for a half hour and uninstalled it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIron Warriors T-72 tank command: Its a tank sim, the story line is kinda hard to follow and the controls need to be states better but I think its not bad to play around with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurgeon Sim 2013: Hilarious game, love it so far but it seems like it will get boring after a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorld in conflict Soviet assault: Played the demo and downloading it right now, the demo was incredibly fun and I except the full version to be even better we will see soon! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheater of war 3 Korea: Installing it right now as well... The trailer and images of it looks fun but I\u0027m kinda skepticle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrutal Legends: An RPG based around a fantasy world and heavy metal. I bought it for one reason... The music, love classic and thrash metal and thats all this game has, and it features Jack Black! I\u0027m installing it last but I think it will be pretty good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EState of Decay: A zombie survival sim, I\u0027m not too fond of it right now because the controls are jacked up. Walking is like walking on hex tiles even though there are no hex tiles... Kind of annoying might be a deal breaker for me idk yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any of you all ever tried these games?

I was not planning on buying anything anymore and certainly not for that amount of money (26 euro in the Flash Sale), but my racing wheel has been idle for a while now and, more importantly, I have been looking for something like Forza on the PC. I heard that the simulation is wonderful and I was pretty impressed by the perception of speed even in the movie clips in Youtube, so I decided to give it a go. I hope they will add LMP cars, as I like to drive those in Forza most, but I think I will enjoy the current cars too.
