So I\u0027m considering buying it, but I need some opinions regarding my laptop\u0027s ability to play it. \n\nI\u0027m a console gamer, so it\u0027s rare I play a PC game, hence why my laptop isn\u0027t great, but KSP seems too good to ignore.\n\nI\u0027m not expecting to build like 1000 part rockets, but I want to basically be sure I\u0027ll be able to do most things, on the low settings, i.e. space stations etc.\n\nHere\u0027s my laptop\u0027s details, sorry about the colouring, I can\u0027t seem to change it.\n\nWindows 7 64 bit- Sony Vaio \n\nVideo card: \n\n**Intel\u00AE HD Graphics 3000**\n\n**Pixel Shader Version - 4.1**\n\n**Vertex Shader version - 4.1**\n\n**Dedicated Video RAM - 64mb**\n\n**CPU:**\n\n**Intel\u00AE Core i3-2350M CPU @ 2.30GHz**\n\n**RAM:**\n\n**4.0 gb**\n\n**I\u0027d appreciate the help, incase I make a mistake of buying a game that\u0027ll break.

I think you\u0027ll have a dandy time playing the game. Just make sure that your cleaning fans and vents are all cleaned out, I dropped my temperatures by 35\u002B degrees Fahrenheit just by cleaning dust out of the comp and the fan. Most laptops have overheat protection, they\u0027ll shut down automatically if they get too hot, so clean your vents and get a cooler like Blue said. I don\u0027t use a cooler myself, though I probably should, but if you don\u0027t have enough money or time you could probably find a fan laying around and imitate this strapping young lad:\n\n![3e35a8ff842d7955f55daae2c8d0a8b0.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3e/35/a8/3e35a8ff842d7955f55daae2c8d0a8b0.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Solon","CreatedById":142835,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:02:10Z","Content":"I play on a low end consumer laptop and the game runs fine.
