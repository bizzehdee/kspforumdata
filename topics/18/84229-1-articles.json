It has slow upload times (10s of content taking 15 minutes to upload?! Come on, guys!), the editing program has never actually worked properly for me, and one of my loops (and I only uploaded two!) is weirdly cut off in standard definition but runs normally in HD. I would have preferred for KSP to have waited for some of these problems to be fixed before having a coub competition, as I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one having them.
