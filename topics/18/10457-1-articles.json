This is a work computer, so if it gets screwed up, I\\\u0027m screwed.\n\nI won\\\u0027t be taking anything with potential for damaging the system (Overclocking).\n\nI want to cut down the PageFile to 500Mb, but it\\\u0027s tough to see how much RAM is being used exactly.\n\nTask Manager only reports PageFile usage. I setup PerfMon.exe to show RAM usage, but the graph scale blows and makes it hard to interpret.\n\nCurrently, a Disk Defrag (probably the first ever to happen to this system) is running.\n\nSurprisingly little Fragmentation was analyzed, but then again the drive is mostly empty (47Gb free).\n\nEdit: This computer is left on 24/7 and only reboots when it crashes, so boot speed isn\\\u0027t necessary."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T17:40:54Z","Content":"Have you disabled all unused and unneeded services?\n\nCheck out [Black Viper\\\u0027s Service Configurations](http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/) page for a great rundown of the various services in Window OSes.\n\nCheers!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T17:57:21Z","Content":"I will definitely look into that on monday (almost quitting time:D) I hadn\\\u0027t even considered shutting down extra services.\n\nDisk DeFrag was a remarkable success, and is already noticeably faster."},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T17:58:14Z","Content":"if a format is allowable(probably not, but covering it anyways), its amazing what will result from that.\n\nAdditionally, before completing the format, splitting the partitions, create a small partition in the first few Gb(or few hundred mb, how ever much you\\\u0027d want to give it) to hold the swap file, devote the rest as desired. The idea is to give the swap file a nice clean, fairly high performance part of the disk all to itself, no more fragmented swapfile....ever. Create the main OS parition after that partition is made.\n\nIf you can devote the space to it indefinitely, define an actual swapfile size instead of allowing it to be system managed. 4Gb should be plenty, depending on what it needs to do i wouldn\\\u0027t go under 1gb. If the work related tasks are very low memory usage, it might be possible to operate just fine without a swapfile, so your thought of trying out 500mb should be enough in that case. The system does have a decent amount of Ram. The point of defining its size is to prevent fragmentation caused by the changing size of the swapfile. Windows can get rather....fussy if its current desire for memory exceeds both your ram and swapfile combined.\n\nBeing a work computer, there are a fair number of processes that run in the background that might not be necessary for you. Shutting them down won\\\u0027t do alot, but i suspect in this case it\\\u0027ll be a matter of every little bit that can help. Edit:blackViper\\\u0027s site, as mentioned by Cap\\\u0027n Skunky is the ideal reference point for that.\n\nEliminate every little running application that doesn\\\u0027t need to be run. if your good with computers, [http://www.silentrunners.org/](http://www.silentrunners.org/) provides a script that when run will list every single thing set to run on its own, which isn\\\u0027t part of the windows default. Every little tasktray item, hidden process, and even browser addons that tie into explorer will be listed, as well as where you find the reference that controls it. Do export the entire registry before you begin, provides a nice safe backup for those Oh Shi.....! moments. It will also list off malware related tasks, processes, and tool bars.\n\nIf the boot is a slow and drawn out process, bootvis can work wonders on that for you. [http://majorgeeks.com/BootVis_d664.html](http://majorgeeks.com/BootVis_d664.html) it reorganises the order in which things are done. in effect, when the system will stop and wait for something, it tries to organise things so that while the system is waiting on whatever it was, it starts the next task to be done. Sometimes you don\\\u0027t gain much, sometimes you gain ALOT.\n\n[http://www.gtopala.com/siw-download.php](https://www.gtopala.com/siw-download.php) can tell you just how much memory and swap file is currently in use, as well as the max that has been used recently. That way you can see if it maybe needs more sometimes than you might have set it too.\n\nBeing an old install, there\\\u0027s a fairly good bet it also has alot of space consumed by useless stuff. If you have the freedom to clear out unused data, [http://windirstat.info/](http://windirstat.info/) is invaluable in seeing just where your space has gone, and what has consumed it. Maybe there are ALOT of old restore points just sitting there swallowing space. Its not much, but this can help you keep the size of the MFT down a bit, and this helps older HD\\\u0027s feel a little more responsive. Again, tiny improvements, but pile enough little things together and you\\\u0027ve got something.\n\nIm sure there are more things im forgetting, but that should be enough to show a noticeable improvement at the least.\n\nEdit, ninja\\\u0027d by Skunky.\n\nForgot about blackVipers page, theres your number one reference for which services can safely be killed, and which you need to keep around. its surprising just how lightweight Xp can become, if you trim off all the little things you don\\\u0027t need."},{"CreatedByName":"mc8888","CreatedById":23756,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T18:59:48Z","Content":"If you have access to task manager, you can change the process\\\u0027 priority.\n\nIf you go: \n\n Task Manager \u003E Processes, then right-click on the KSP process \u003E Priority\n\nyou can change its priority to \\\u0027High\\\u0027.

That\\\u0027s what I read a while ago at least.\n\nAnd yes, Formatting the drive, partitioning, or anything of that sort is totally out of the question.\n\nI know partitioning doesn\\\u0027t delete data, but I\\\u0027m not sure how the network backup configuration is setup.\n\nBreaking compatibility with that would cause so many headaches, and eventually those headaches would lead back to me D:\n\nI work at a Fire Safety shop, the computer has databases on it (backed up remotely) of all the Fire Extinguishers, AED\\\u0027s, Fire Doors, Emergency lights, and other things on it.

If not, rebooting more often will help quite a bit.\n\nYour best bet then is probably just to:\n\nCreate a restore point\n\nstop unecessary services from loading at startup\n\nstop unecessary task tray apps from loading at startup\n\nstop unecessary tasks from launching\n\n by this point, window\\\u0027s memory and processing needs will be alot lower, which will free up more resources for other things.\n\ndefine the size of the swap file to help reduce drive fragmentation.\n\ntrim all temporary files, and remove unused portions of windows [http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=31494](http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=31494) -how to enable all the hidden stuff in the add/remove control panel, such as messenger, windows games, and accessibility features. The more empty the drive, the smaller the MFT file becomes, and the quicker windows will respond to things.\n\nThere is a small risk of a registry snafu using cleaning apps(just as there is a small risk in changing anything at all really), the restore point will have you covered there, anything goes awol that definitely shouldn\\\u0027t, just restore. That said, this can be a source of significant slowdown in older installs of windows so its worth doing.\n\nand you could probably stop there.\n\nIt may also be worth checking to be sure the CPU isn\\\u0027t overheating. With time both the heatsinks get clogged up, and the thermal paste wears out and stops conducting heat effectively. no need to go pulling the heatsink off or anything drastic. SIW.exe, which I posted a link to earlier can report temperatures. if your getting up in excess of 80 on a regular basis, the CPU/mobo might be throttling itself to prevent a critical overtemp.\n\nIf it is overheating, you can clock the system down, which will reduce temps, and make its overall speed more predictable, instead of it getting too hot and going even slower now and then. If this is happening, it should be easy enough to get the average speed above where it is by clocking downwards a little. Will also help the system last longer, current and temperature are both enemies of system life, the less of each, the longer it lives.\n\nIts also fairly painless and low risk to apply new paste, that said, anytime you physically handle the parts, there is risk of them not functioning after.....so, yeah. At the least, its still worth checking for crud and high temps."}]}
