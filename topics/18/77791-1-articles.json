If they had to route around every trouble spot on the globe they\u0027d be flying in circles. I\u0027ve flown over Afghanistan recently, for example. The thing is that civilian aircraft can 100% positively identify themselves to military radar. Since there\u0027s no sane reason to bring down an airliner it\u0027s not normally a problem. You\u0027ll be tracked by military radar entering most countries, but because they know you\u0027re not a threat there\u0027s no trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T15:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArea 51.
