And i want to turn it into something more. I don\u0027t want a fancy schmancy gift i want to turn it into something i can generate an income off of (Like an app, me and my dad had an idea but dont want anyone stealing it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was mainly inspired to do something like this from two things: Casey Neistat and his app Beme, and this article my dad found: A professor gave his students $5 and challenged them to see who could generate the most money (they were split into a few teams). the people who made the most money were the ones who didnt focus on \u0022Okay i have $5 what can i do with that\u0022; the students who made the most were the ones who basically said: \u0022How can i make something, out of nothing.\u0022. For instance: the group that made the most was a group that went around making reservations at popular resturaunts and approaching people with 45\u002B minute wait times and sold the reservations that would take less time for about $20. No i don\u0027t have the man-power or the ability to do that, but you get the gist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have considered streaming, it\u0027s not worth it to me and i wont make much from that (I\u0027m not saying i need to make a lot, just streaming will take forever and make considerably less money than a lot of other options).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post your ideas below, and maybe we can collaborate on something and split the income somehow. (Or message them to me, you can trust i wont take em without including you, I\u0027m an Eagle Scout.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: another thing on funds: Money ain\u0027t a problem. I can go earn a lot, mow 20 lawns a day if i have to (I get about $20 per lawn).
