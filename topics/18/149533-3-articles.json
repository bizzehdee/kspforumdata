That most curiously active structure of matter. It devours, it multiplies, and it dies. But this is not unique to life. The flame of combustion is, too, an adept of these arcane arts. What, then, is it that makes life, living? It is not its dynamism; the star too evolves. Perhaps it is the way it denies its inevitable demise. The way it rages against thermodynamics itself. The way it endeavors to reject the lukewarm embrace of death.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe way it poisons its environment with entropy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife isn\u0027t all, though. From life comes intelligence. With it, happiness, suffering, and strife. And from it, a strange, intense relation with that ancient enemy of life. Medicine and engineering hold thermodynamics at bay, prolonging that beautiful spark before it is quenched.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yet the same creations of intelligence are put to use crushing that very same spark into nothingness, destroying it in the name of entropy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut at the end, each intelligence realises its error. Realises that all along, that flame was doomed. Realises that from the beginning, thermodynamics held no place for life, no special favors.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd no promises of eternity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe last iceberg, as it melts into the tepid sea, knows the truth. The final glorious flash of light into the void, as the flame finally succumbs to mediocrity, knows the truth. Just as these know it, so too does life.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut intelligence denies it, overruling that which the underlying life understands.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYet, as the last bit of hope fades, as there is nothing after but dull homogeneity, somehow intelligence sees the truth. As the last night sets upon the darkening satellite of an ailing star, as the last star burns itself to cooling cinder, as the last great singularity evaporates into mist, intelligence finally understands.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is no after. At last, this is the end. All has melted like a pool of wax, mixed like a vial of inky water. There is no here and there, no then and now. The universe has truly reached its ground state, and only memories distinguish one region from another. Entropy reigns supreme.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yet intelligence cannot accept defeat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne last crusade against mediocrity, its exceptional character forming it into a symbol of that which it holds dear. One last bastion of order. Even as its lifeblood, its heat and its cold, leak away, even as its walls are eroded by the subtle caresses of entropy... still it rages on. Still it keeps the spark of life, of extremes, of intelligence within itself. Perhaps it, too, has become alive. It struggles, as all life has, to find a way onward. But there is no onward. Even at its last, it still pushes against the inevitable. Yet no salvation comes. No new sunrise will provide it with the mountains and valleys it craves, the slopes and the flows it needs. The vacuum does not yield. The atoms fuse no more. The singularity has nothing left to give.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe last bastion can fight no longer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ripples it makes as it finally falls will resonate for aeons, a signal of hopelessness and defiance.

He landed on his feet. with impact, an audible vibration carried through in the form of a \u0027thump\u0027 sound, it rippled through the ground and into Xf39b\u0027s audio sensors, he heard the vibration as a sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe ran in the direction of his travel pod, his bare feet making slapping noises against the icy ground. With a velocity that Classicals would consider \u0027inhuman\u0027, he crossed several hundred kilometers of smooth plains and jutting mountains to reach the pod. It took him only point-nine kiloseconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nThe travel pod was a smooth, egg shaped, craft; pure white in color. Xf39b touched his hand against its surface, and it suddenly became a liquid, it kept its shape despite this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nSlowly, he inserted himself into the pod, pushing his body into the fluid. When he\u0027d gotten partway in, the pod sucked him in the rest of the way. The pod rotated him into the right position, and manipulated his limbs into their rightful positions, he did not resist. When it was completed, the pod solidified again, and it instantly became a part of his body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nWith a thought, he took off from this planet and accelerated away from it. He quickly picked up speed and was soon going at a tenth the speed of light. The feeble star and its icy companion zoomed away behind him. He could feel the faint stellar wind subside. Then he put on another burst of acceleration, picking up speed without g-forces, he reached a speed close to\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EC\u003C/i\u003E, the nearby stars all began to move, he could feel dozens of megaseconds going by rapidly; he wasn\u0027t just flying through space, he was flying forward into the future. every parsec put him further ahead, luckily not much ever changes at these slow velocities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nIn his mind, he already knew that the entire Small Magallenic Cloud had been explored save for the system he\u0027d just visited, and one more. He accelerated further, gigaseconds now went by as the galaxy itself began to move. The wispy nebular clouds suddenly became alive, ribbons of color rippling and stretching and colliding; isolated clouds dissipating over time, bright flashes in their midst as young T-Tauri stars ignite to fusion and blow away their cocoons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nTheKansas - Dust in the Wind (Official Video)\u003Cbr\u003E\nstars flew by rapidly now, like streaks. But one star straight ahead didn\u0027t move, it grew slowly brighter. He knew little about this star, no examination had been made by anyone prior, it was merely a speck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nGetting close now, he slowed down to point-one\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EC\u003C/i\u003E, the animation of the galaxy was suddenly frozen. Upon inspection he could distinguish its color, class-G; a few seconds later he got the full spectrum, G7, a yellow dwarf. Another few seconds and he entered the system, the transition from peaceful interstellar medium to harsh solar wind was jarring, he felt a moment of discomfort before his senses adapted and the feeling became milder. He began to discern planets, eighteen worlds; seven planets of rock, five of ice, six of gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nThe fourth world was particularly interesting, a verdant planet with a native biosphere and great oceans, only ten percent of its surface area was solid land. It existed in a binary orbit with the fifth planet, which had succumbed to a runaway greenhouse effect. It is very rare that a planet is discovered that has a naturally gained oxygen atmosphere, oxygen holds a special relevance as the gas that most plant life produces, and most animal life consumes; oxygen rich worlds were once highly sought for colonization by the people of the Transformation-Era (the time when humans evolved from yet another animal species on the homeworld, to a spacefaring civilization of immortals), oxygen worlds are completely unnecessary to all but the classicals who still stubbornly live in flimsy organic bodies. Their very lifespans are only a few gigaseconds!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nSaving the fourth and fifth planets for last, he explored all the other planets, Some were reasonably interesting, some had rather grand topography. All average really...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nWith the other worlds finished, he moved on to the fourth planet. It was visibly green from orbit, a good sign. He landed in a clearing and emerged from his pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nThe surface was covered in a thick moss-like turf. In the distance, he saw forests of tall plants, and snow capped mountains. He bent down and tore off a little bit of the moss, he peered into it at the micro scale, a standard genetic design. He then examined the open spot from which he\u0027d torn the sample, looking closely, he saw no sign of cellular regeneration. Evidently, these plants grow to a certain size before growth ceases entirely, and wounding it does not seem to stimulate new growth, a very detrimental trait it would seem, are there no herbivores here? Scanning his surroundings he saw no signs of animal life, nothing but plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nXf39b had never been on a Terra-class planet before. He switched his body to classical mode, just to feel like the people of pre-transition. Suddenly he felt different, the chilly wind bit gently on his naked skin. He became aware of breathing, inhale, exhale, part simulated, part emulated, it felt real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHis limbs didn\u0027t respond to simple thought anymore, luckily he knew how to move thanks to a data package he\u0027d once downloaded with a collection. With effort, he began to walk, then run. Slowly,\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003Ehumanly\u003C/i\u003E, he crossed the moss field and into the forest.He was already learning a lot about this world. The moss brushed against his skin, producing many new sensations. He ran, and ran, and ran.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe finally made it to the nearest \u0027tree\u0027, not at all similar to the trees imported from the homeworld and widely enjoyed by the classicals. It was completely smooth, no sign of anything resembling bark; the leaves appeared to be massive claws. He realized what he had to do, and reluctantly switched off classical mode; he felt the new sensations disappear, replaced by the same cold, stony, robotic form as before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nWith\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003Einhuman\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Evision he examined the \u0027tree\u0027 and made a startling discovery, it consumed oxygen and exhaled carbon dioxide. Switching to Xray, he could see a visible bone structure and even the presence of muscles. It wasn\u0027t a plant, it was an animal; an animal completely rooted into the ground. He suddenly realized that this planet would definitely require a more detailed investigation, an entire team, maybe even a colony, surely the classicals would be willing to come here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nBut then a disturbing notion hit him: if the tree had claws, what was it going to catch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe took a glance upwards, the sun was low in the sky.

Ugly, insect-like creatures with black exoskeletons and giant mandibles, their wings were transparent like a fly\u0027s, and they made a terrifying buzzing noise as they flew. Ravenously, they swarmed across the fields of moss, mowing it like a lawn. Within minutes, the entire patch was nothing but a bare area, the moss almost completely\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ecut\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eaway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nWith a mixture of interest and horror, Xf39b gave rapt attention. As soon as the patch was clear, the swarm moved on to the next; as they flew through the forest that was in between, the trees suddenly came to life. Their claws reaching out like lightning, snatching hundreds of the creatures out of the air with ferocity, then curling inward with their struggling prey and disposing of it in an open cavity on the top of the trunk, the creatures shrieked horrendously before going completely silent, the sound of crushing bones was audible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nThis went on for many kiloseconds until the sun finally returned, the surviving creatures rapidly returned to their holes, the smart ones\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ehaving\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eflown over the forest instead of through.

He emerged from the pod and examined the bare ground, the moss was growing back, evidently, it saves its energy in its roots, and heals immediately after a frenzy. Astonished, he looked closer; he identified rapid\u00A0cellular regrowth, and it was accelerating! He predicted the moss would be grown back to normal height by noon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nThis planet was like no other. Very few naturally\u00A0habitable worlds had ever been discovered, and they all were quite primitive, only single celled life ranging to lichens and invertebrates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nReturning to his pod, he took off again and began an exploration of the planet\u0027s diverse environment. It was a rich world, mountains, rivers, valleys, deserts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe flew over the planet\u0027s western continent, a massive desert, not a single bit of greenery in sight. An endless sea of dunes, dotted here and there by an island of rock poking out. On one island he spotted a peculiar formation on one of the rocky islands, three hourglass shaped pillars, each fifty meters high, gleaming white under the sun. He made a landing there, ten meters to the east of the formation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe liquefied the hull of his pod and climbed out. Everything was extremely bright as the sunlight reflected off the sand, he registered the ground as hot. Seeking a sensation, he switched to classical mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe suddenly felt a painful burning feeling, his feet roasted upon the hot sands, his eyes burning in the brightness; but he took no harm, the classical mode was an emulation, he was no less metal and polymers than he was before. He unlocked the customization settings, and deactivated the pain receptors in his feet, then lowered the brightness of his vision. Much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nHe crossed the sand onto the small outcropping. The towers felt even bigger up close, they were extremely smooth, not a single scratch or imperfection, they were like glass. This was obviously not a natural construct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nAt the base of each pillar was a ring of inscribed symbols. Xf39b\u0027s historical package told him it was writing, but he couldn\u0027t recognize the language or alphabet, it didn\u0027t seem to be human. But it meant something even greater, intelligent life! intelligent alien life had not been seen since the Andromeda Massacre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nanything of\u00A0He bolted back to his pod and quickly transmitted a message to the nearest outpost, he included the exact location of the columns and requested a research team, it would take a few hundred years though.

Then he noticed a small pool of sand in the middle of the rock island, it was suspiciously squarish in shape. With cupped hands, he scooped the sand out. As the sand thinned, an elongated metal loop became visible, it appeared to be a handle. He grabbed it and attempted to turn it, it was stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nAfter several other attempts to unlock it by pulling it, pushing it, and turning it the other way. He switched out of classical mode and tried turning it again, it came out easily. Revealing a long dark tunnel, no sign of a ladder or other assistance method for safely going up or down, he assumed it to be a trash disposal. He jumped down into the shaft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nAlmost immediately he lost nearly all velocity, slowed to a crawl.

The door to the room hung limply, its seal and hinges broke beyond repair. He effortlessly swung it open, revealing a small room, coffin-like boxes covering the floor with a little bit of walking room in-between. Each box was draped with a barely legible plastic garment, the flag of a dead country. Xf39b lifted the flag gently from one of the boxes, it was an old cryotube, obviously broken, evidently damaged by the impact rather than long-term decay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nInside it were\u00A0mummified human remains.

The\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAquila\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0had disappeared shortly after departure, its last messages being nothing more than cryptic status data from the main computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nXf39b searched the ship and finally managed to locate the crystalline black-box, it was completely intact. Then he zoomed his vision inward and read the laser-engraved binary data, with knowledge of the encoding methods used at the time, he decoded the binary and compiled it into a data pack, he then applied it to his consciousness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\nInformation flowed into his memory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EA Billion\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003EYears\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0(Old Measurement) Before:\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Hand me the chip will you, Jean?\u0022 Asked Dr. Micheal Halsey. His close friend, Jean Alvis, nodded and grabbed the computer chip that Halsey had been pointing to. Halsey soldered the chip onto the main motherboard of the gravitic prototype.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#555555;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022I think that\u0027s enough work for today,\u0022 Halsey remarked, his hands black with the lubricant oil of the machine.
