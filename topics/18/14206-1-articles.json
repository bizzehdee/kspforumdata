Since a laptop has to be relatively smaller than a desktop and has to give some degree of comfortable mobility while carrying it, their parts are custom fit to the laptop. That\\\u0027s why most graphic cards are integrated to the motherboard, as a way to make the machine smaller. Speakers are integrated, keyboards are integrated, touch pad, screen, etc, all in a bid to make the package smaller. There all original to only that laptop, making them very expensive to build, which in turn is reflected at the price. Also, because its all integrated into that machine, you can\\\u0027t take out one piece and replace it with another. This is especially true of the graphics card which is pretty much embedded in the motherboard. Yes you can add extra things to your laptop like a mouse, speakers, extra screen and it works fine but it can only go so far. Again, lets go look a the graphic cards. It is possible to route an external graphics card into your computer via usb, HDMI, or more practically, your express slot. However, those ports can only allow so much data to pass into your laptop. So a graphics card that\\\u0027s rated as such would actually perform a good fraction because the port can only allow so much data through at a time. At tops, your laptop would be pretty top of the line for about four years, then it starts to go obsolete. Since you can\\\u0027t upgrade it, you will need to buy another laptop which is pretty much expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to desktops which can be constructed out of any hardware (which isn\\\u0027t customised, so it isn\\\u0027t that expensive and can be upgraded, giving it a good 10 maybe 15 years depending on care), I don\\\u0027t see why I would buy a high end laptop if I have to replace it in 3 years and spend all that money again where I can construct a desktop myself and only pay a few hundred dollars every two years for upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final say is you shouldn\\\u0027t invest so heavily on a laptop. It should be lightweight, easy to carry and not bulky; not like the desktop replacement laptop your eyeing Mr. OP. And it should only be powerful enough to atmost run hd movies. Your going to replace it pretty quickly so don\\\u0027t invest so much. If you need more powerful computing, go with a desktop. Yes it\\\u0027s not carryable, but its the most economical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you can afford throwing 1200$ every few years, than go ahead and invest on the laptop.
