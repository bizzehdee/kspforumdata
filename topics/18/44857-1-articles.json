Marines and aliens. Both team have a commander that hops in the command chair/hive and plays the game from an RTS perspective that can drop building, research upgrades, and help other players with team res. The marines are more centralized in play style, they use res to purchase items such as shotguns, mines, flamers etc... but more or less it\u0027s a marine with more versatility. Aliens have a more tf2 like class system where they can evolve to higher life forms for res. Starts out a as a wall running skulk, next a gorge medic, harassing lerk etc... with a different play style for each. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are they fighting over? Res nodes and techpoints. Tech points are where CC\u0027s and hives go, they are important structures because they open up the tech tree, and you will lose if all are destroyed. Then Res nodes generate income when captured by the appropriate team by building an extractor/harvester on them. They generate 2 incomes for the teams. Team res which the commander uses for mentioned above. And player res that they use to purchase weapons/life forms with. Your goal is to destroy your opponents while protecting yours. No money=No upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T23:35:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T22:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds fun.
