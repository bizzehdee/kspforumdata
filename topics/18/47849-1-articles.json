I thought is was, really, really, really good. The trailer might not suggest it but the actors are doing a stellar job of portraying the reality of deep space travel. And its just brilliantly filmed and executed on a high level of realism. Although this doesn\u0027t avoid some little movie cliche\u0027s, but then again which movie does, its just a great spacefilm. I liked it better then 2001 ans Sunshine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see a modder take some inspiration from this regarding the ship interiors and perhaps EVA activities etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would highly recommend it to any spacefreak, its a thrilling movie.

Instead of giving you a hollywood style green men who come from a mothership, one could ask if this is a really intellegent creature that knew what was going on the entire time. That knew that another species had landed on their planet, that knew that they couldn\u0027t be discovered. Or is is just a killer which is thirsty for blood. If you choose for one or the other you can get conflict and plotholes, instead its mysterious and creepy. And that\u0027s exactly how an encounter should be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T16:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forum has not missed it.
