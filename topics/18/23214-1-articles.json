I was trying to record a solution for the Pogo Party using CamStudio. But when I finished recording (decoder is Intel IYUV Decoder), Camstudio suddenly stopped decoding and announce a failure in decoding. All 4.00 GB of data became unusable. The next time using Microsoft Videos 1, after recording about 2.82 GB of data (10 minutes worth of data), during the decoding process Camstudio reported another failure and that 2,82 GB is dead. The third time using Intel IYUV Decoder, after recording about 10 minutes (worth 4.00 GB), during the decoding process more failure and the 4.00 GB of data became corrupt. I wonder, which recorder is more sstable recorder, and which decoder is more stable?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T23:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried Fraps?
