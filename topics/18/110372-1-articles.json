Ideal in the sense that all pollution, dust, plankton etc is left out of the equation and all they look at is the water-salt mixture. If you take 2 spoons of this ideal sea water you won\u0027t be able to tell the difference. Take 2 spoons of (ideal) muddy water (water and lumps of dirt) and there would be a difference in the mixture. So, sea water: Homogeneous.
