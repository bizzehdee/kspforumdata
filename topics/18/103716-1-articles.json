A lot of the FNaF praise I\u0027ve heard of (and all of the praise I\u0027m giving) is because of the dark lore, and how secretive it was in the games. FNaF3 was so insane to me because it brought so many new concepts to the conspiracy table, many of which blew my mind and totally changed what I thought about the deeper story.
