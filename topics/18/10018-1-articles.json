Not as bright as the ISS can get, of course, but enough to be fairly easily spottable by eye in bright locations.\n\nAnd [Iridium Flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_flare) can get brighter than Venus. Venus can get up to magnitude -4.6, and I\\\u0027ve seen nighttime flares as bright as -7.
