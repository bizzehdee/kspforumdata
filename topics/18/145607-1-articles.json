After some discouraging setbacks, I have managed to find something that allows me to record the video, the game audio and my commentary at the same time (Open Broadcaster), but its output does require some editing before I would be willing to upload it (at the very least remove some lading scenes etc.). And I have not yet been able to find one that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried I software that simply refuses to work at my screen resolution (1280x1024), but don\u0027t remember the name\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried avidemux, which kind of works, but it doesn\u0027t like the recording very much and half the buttons cause errors reverting everything done so far\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried virtualdub but it cannot handle my mpeg-4 recordings and I have not figured out how to install required filters/codecs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nand I cannot install windows move maker. Setup works till 99% and then aborts with a different error every time I try\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you have any advice for me or can suggest a different, free, video editing software for windows 7 that can handle the basics (cutting, slowmo/timewarp, text/picture overlays), I\u0027m all ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and I would also be very interested in advices for codec option setting. You know what is good or which option are bad and should not be chosen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes, I\u0027m not the first one asking this question here, but all the answers I found were a couple years old. Something new and better might have appeared since then.
