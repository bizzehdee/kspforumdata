Win98 was designed and programmed for use on the hardware of it\u0027s time. It probably wouldn\u0027t be able to use 64-bit processors as it probably can only address 32 bits and not 64. It might also not be able to address multiple cores. And then you get problems where it might essentially wonder where all the new space came from. I actually think that you can\u0027t use more than 1 TB on a single partition with WinXP now that I think of it. and it might just be slower or not work at all compared to a computer from the turn of the century or with specs matching an average computer from Win98\u0027s time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T21:22:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:18:40Z","Content":"Windows 98 (SE included) does not support the newest DirectX, so you\u0027d have a bad day."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T23:05:25Z","Content":"Hmmm, I see.\n\nAnother question, do you think that it\u0027s safer?\n\nMost viruses probably won\u0027t even work with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T23:44:18Z","Content":"old versions of directx were really bad. it didnt really stabilize until around version 8. upgrading just one version up could break some games. meanwhile opengl games from the same period work fine. i even had some luck with glide based games through a wrapper. but thats getting old games to run on new hardware, going the other way would be even more difficult. for one a lot of new hardware doesnt have win 9x drivers. though i did once see a video of\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUVXAl0dgYY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
