Well, that was a couple months ago, and I finally got off my fat green butt and headed over there Saturday morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis place is quite a jewel. It\u0027s a *very* small operation, but it\u0027s got stuff I\u0027ve never seen in person before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has the entire set of Complex 36A Atlas/Centaur launch consoles, rescued and refurbished by one of the guys that used to maintain them. He is a guide and explained how it all worked, complete with a demonstration of a launch by the Mod IV Sequencer that he\u0027d synced to a DVD of the actual last launch it performed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike most displays, they\u0027re perfectly fine with you walking up and flipping all the switches and pushing all the buttons. They even encourage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have an enormous model of the Complex 39A pad, complete with crawler, mobile launch platform, Shuttle, launch tower, and rotating service structure. It takes up an entire room, and is bigger than 1/72 scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember all the drawings/pics of the ORIGINAL 1963 Lunar Module design? The one with 5 legs, a round front hatch, and a bulbous shape with large glass windows? I\u0027ve seen that for years, but they have the model!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also have a \u0022Russian room\u0022 with a Sokol suit and Russian memorabilia, including a poster of all the cosmonauts. Of course it\u0027s all in Cyrillic writing, so I wasn\u0027t able to tell much. Even after all these years, it still feels weird to look at Russian stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major donor was a KSC fire crewman for many years, so there is a room with lots of his stuff in it. His crew was at a Shuttle launch tending the M113 emergency vehicle. Mission control told them the launch was on hold, and gave them permission to get out and stretch the legs. Mission control DID NOT tell them the launch was resumed, so there\u0027s a pic of them standing there OUTSIDE the M113 when KABOOM the Shuttle launches. They got in a lot of trouble until they were able to prove no one told them about the count starting back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re over in Titusville, Florida, and their website is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacewalkoffame.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacewalkoffame.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe $5 buck admission gets you a lot of neat stuff to look at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a park nearby with mission memorials. I\u0027m going back today (Monday) to check out the park and see the SpaceX launch from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PnsLV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
