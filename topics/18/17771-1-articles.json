During which, I opened it up to get rid of some dust since it had been a while since I last did so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt one point, I dropped a screw inside, and it even went underneath the motherboard... afterwhich I realized I had left the PSU on! I switched it off, and used a paper towel to clean dust off the CPU heatsink... and maybe a little off the PCB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, after 2 months in storage, I have reconnected my PC and I am getting no video output. I have tried both GPU outputs, I have tried the motherboard output with the discreet GPU plugged in and with the discreet GPU taken out. I can hear the HDD being accessed, so I know that at least some of the Motherboard and the CPU must be working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone heard of a similar problem? Does anyone have an idea what it might be? I think it\u0027s something on the motherboard, but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: Q6600 @ 2.40GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobo: Gigabyte GA-G33M-DS2R|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 4GB Crucial 667MHz DDR2|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: Powercolor Radeon HD4850\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPSU: Corsair TX650W\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T19:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this happen to me on two different occasions, in both the culprit was one of the RAM sticks that had shaken loose, the HDD was accessed by the BIOS but there was no CPU activity, so no signal sent to the GFX card and no signal to the monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may not have a loose memory stick, but one might have gone bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTim","CreatedById":4138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T19:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I\u0027ll try with each stick individually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTim","CreatedById":4138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T19:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESORTED.
