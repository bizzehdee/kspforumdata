While I don\u0027t know too much about that, I was curious about their potential for powering human infrastructure in space. Bases, villages, spaceships, deep space exploration, propulsion systems, what have you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Yesterday I set out to turn Gabyalufix\u0027s nuclear reactors into functioning Electrical Energy Generators, but quickly realized i have not the faintest idea of how spacecraft reactors would be constructed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC especially thorium ones about which I am very curious \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC despite hearing not a few times of how they would be extremely helpful if not vital to long-term space missions. I could have posted this in General Add-on Affairs, but I figured you off-topic braniacs would have more to say about such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding clear information about reactor design on the Internet seems difficult. The only tried and tested space reactor I know of is TOPAZ, a 300kg vessel that could produce 5-10kW of power. A forum post on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=104814\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis site\u003C/a\u003E suggests that a 1MW reactor could be constructed using a few hundred kilos of plutonium and a few hundred more to build the reactor itself, but that\u0027s not quite the data I\u0027m after (although I\u0027d love to hear more on the subject if you know about it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much better could modern or near-future molten salt reactor technology make this, realistically speaking? How well do TOPAZ, or other existing systems, measure up to the requirements for a crewed journey to Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars? I have heard that the VASIMR engine will require a reactor capable of 1kg/kW power generation in order to get flying faster than chemical rockets in an appreciable amount of time. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong on any of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe civil, and stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T17:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne MSR has, I believe, already been built that can sit on the flatbed trailer of an artic\u0027 lorry.
