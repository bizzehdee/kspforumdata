I race an \u002706 GT. So this is incredible I really want one.\n\nI need to see more pictures. Because honestly... If someone didn\u0027t tell me it was modeled after the SaturnV I wouldn\u0027t tell what theme it was. It looks good don\u0027t get me wrong, but I think there\u0027s a lot more they coulve done to make it resemble more of the rocket. A more intricate paint job with rivets in key places would really set it off. And then the inside needs to resemble the command module to an extent. Switch guards on the center console would be nice.\n\nI\u0027d like to meet some of the astronauts at the auction in Wisconsin. I\u0027m willing to bet they all sign their names on the car.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T17:19:56Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"}]}
