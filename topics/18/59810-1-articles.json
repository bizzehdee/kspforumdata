So to run everything at high (with AA on and not fiddling with the ocean terrain settings) you probably need something around an HD 7850 / GTX 660. I thing those go for around $150. Obviously super high resolutions might need more, but that should be good enough for most resolutions.\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU is another matter. The more powerful the CPU the better KSP will perform.
