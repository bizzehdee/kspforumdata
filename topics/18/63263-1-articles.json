I think it\u0027s the best space-dogfighting game of all. A variety of ships to fly and weapons to carry, decent graphics, lots of scenarios, interesting storyline, and when it ends, you can just roll over and start it again while retaining your pilot\u0027s accumulated medals and kills. Good tutorials for new players, too. I especially liked the way it handled large ships. They slugged it out with each other while the fighters mostly fought a separate but parallel battle. More realistic that way. And you *felt* like you were in a fighter, because if you were unwise enough to get between the big ships, their guns would knock you spinning while they shot past you at enemy capital ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T07:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hard-light.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.hard-light.net/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ego get the scp, do it now! the engine is still being actively developed (ive even contributed a couple minor features myself). from the graphics you couldnt tell that this game came out in \u002799.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe physics suck, yes, but it was always meant to be an arcade space shooter (it ended up being the best of its genre). the physics model has had some overhauls over the years, but its still mostly a space shooter. i actually tried to script in a orbital mechanics and atmospheric flight model, but the engine has numerical stability issues that cant be resolved without a major rewrite, so i pretty much abandoned that project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe important thing is that it has a strong modding community and new mods keep coming out to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow the game does require the retail content to play the original game (which you can get from gog for practically nothing), but there are a few stand alone total conversions that you can play for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-16T07:41:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2014 07:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T15:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hard-light.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.hard-light.net/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ego get the scp, do it now! the engine is still being actively developed (ive even contributed a couple minor features myself). from the graphics you couldnt tell that this game came out in \u002799.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe physics suck, yes, but it was always meant to be an arcade space shooter (it ended up being the best of its genre). the physics model has had some overhauls over the years, but its still mostly a space shooter. i actually tried to script in a orbital mechanics and atmospheric flight model, but the engine has numerical stability issues that cant be resolved without a major rewrite, so i pretty much abandoned that project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe important thing is that it has a strong modding community and new mods keep coming out to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow the game does require the retail content to play the original game (which you can get from gog for practically nothing), but there are a few stand alone total conversions that you can play for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, game is bought and being downloaded.
