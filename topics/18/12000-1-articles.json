Its a sci-fi. The character giving the introduction is Felix. The first few panels make him look creepy, then suddenly your looking at something which does not look like it could have stabbed someone recently. He\\\u0027s a feline Genetically Engineered Life Form. The layman\\\u0027s term would be anthro/furry.
