I always wait a few days after release for user reviews."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:16:12Z","Content":"Just wait until you have at least read the reviews. People buying games before they know they are okay are the reason big publishers can keep producing bad titles again and again."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:35:33Z","Content":"In the specific case of The Witcher, *my personal opinion*, is that it\u0027s probably a safe bet. Although the release of the original was troubled (the game really lost a LOT in translation, literally), CD Projekt Red came back with the Enhanced Edition and nailed it. The Witcher 2 was top notch, again, in my opinion. \n\nBut, like anything you read on the internet, do your own research first. \n\nAs a blanket rule, don\u0027t pre-order anything by EA or anything with Assassins Creed in the title."}]}
