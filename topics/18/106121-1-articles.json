Congrats and thanks to all you guys at Squad!\n\nAnyways, this is a bit of a story about how KSP has influenced my life and my future. I\u0027ve always been a pretty smart kid and was quite interested in space as a kid (as many young children are) but it wasn\u0027t really a big passion of mine. Either way, for a lot of my life so far I never knew what I wanted to do. Skip forward to 2012, and I\u0027m just an average kid playing games on PC. However, I was going through some hard times. My dad and grandfather had just passed away in the fall of 2011, and I didn\u0027t know what to do with myself. I had some pretty disturbing thoughts about both myself and others. One day, I see Robbaz upload a video on YouTube about KSP. I thought it looked kind of cool, so I downloaded the demo, which was in .13 at the time, and played for a bit. I never really caught on and stopped playing after a while. Then, around December of that year, .18 is released. I soon start to see a few videos about it and I become pretty interested in KSP again. I figured that I enjoyed the demo enough, and the full version looks really fun (keep in mind this is before the demo version was updated to .18) so I decided to buy the game. At this time, I\u0027m around 13 years old and in 8th grade, still not knowing what to do with my life.\n\nHere is where everything changes. I really start to enjoy KSP, even though I don\u0027t understand the real science behind any of it at the time. I play more, and more, and more, and I fall in love with the game. By early 2013, I am watching videos and actually learning about the general science about rockets, especially the physics. I even get a few friends to start playing the game. Anyways, I finally drag myself out of this deep pit and start doing something worthwhile. KSP re-ignited my love for science and space I had as a kid. By Summer, I\u0027ve already decided I want to be something regarding physics, maybe a theoretical physicist or an astrophysicist. KSP is moving forward in development, and so am I. Soon, I start my freshman year in high school, and I find something hidden in my closet, and old telescope my father bought for me as a kid. I dust it off and bring it outside, but it doesn\u0027t work! I will later find out that I needed an eyepiece (duh) but at the time, I decide I want to try and look at the stars, which I very rarely got to do as a kid. So I go out to the store and buy a pair of 10x50mm binoculars, which might not seem like much but they were enough to get me started. I sat out on my front steps every night that fall, opened up my iPad, and tried to figure out what I would find tonight. Some more time passes on, and I buy a Celestron Nexstar 4se telescope in February 2014. Now, rather than being obsessed with rocketry and physics, I am obsessed with astronomy and space. Now my entire life I have had an interest in aviation as well, and always though being a pilot would be pretty cool. Soon, I realize I can actually started taking flying lessons within 1-2 years. I have a new direction to my life.\n\nToday, I am a member of my local astronomical society, a local aeroclub, and I am planning on joining an aviation chapter and Civil Air Patrol. I am working through my flight ground school and will be flying this summer. I\u0027ve used my telescope to see galaxies I\u0027ve never thought I would see. I have a plan set as a future air force pilot and astronomer. Would I have made it to this point without the influence of KSP? Maybe, but I very much doubt it.\n\nSo I want to give a HUGE thank you to everybody who is or has worked at Squad. KSP is still one of my favorite games and no matter what anybody says, KSP is a great influence on lots of people, and I hope to see both content and community continue to expand. Speaking of which, you guys on the forum are all great, thank you. I also want to thank Robbaz for getting me started, and Scott Manley as well for his help in teaching me the ways of KSP. Finally, Danny2462 deserves a bit of recognition for helping me find more... fun ways to play KSP.\n\nP.S. Don\u0027t tell Jeb, but I still don\u0027t have any plans for that rescue mission either, but I\u0027m sure he can figure it out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:06:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Djsnowboy267**"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:23:20Z","Content":"Great story.
