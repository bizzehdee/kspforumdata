It had awful graphics (by today\u0027s standards):\n\n![6108-Elite1.jpg](http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/1cf76c/6a08/6108-Elite1.jpg)\n\nbut it was so addicting that I used to spend a lot of time with it. I skipped all the sequels (Frontiers, First encounter, etc) but now I watched a gameplay video from the new Elite: Dangerous and felt a pang of nostalgia. \n\nMy question is - is it worth buying it or am I going to be disappointed?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T11:40:17Z","Content":"No idea myself. Elite was, pretty boring for me. I liked the concept, but it felt like a grind.

I think the whole solar system can be described by only a handful of figures (radius, mass, distance from the star, etc). You get a seed number from random number generator and then some math formulas to derive all of the above. So, in order to re-create this system you only have to know the initial seed."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T11:48:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s not a very hard thing to do.
