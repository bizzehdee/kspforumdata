Firstly, if I have posted this in the wrong place, please move ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOK, so today has been a complete success imo. I managed to really get the best out of my laptops Intel HD graphics card to a point where I have the graphics settings turned up to the max where before I was limited to low settings. The planets and rockets have never looked so good (apart from my gaming PC which I dont use much due to space restrictions in my house so I use my laptop mostly).\n\nHeres my laptop specs:\n\nAcer Aspire 5733:\n\nIntel Core i3 CPU M380 @2.53Ghz\n\n8GB RAM\n\nIntel HD Graphics:\n\nPhysical memory 7862MB\n\nMinimum graphics memory 128MB\n\nMaximum graphics memory 1760MB\n\nProcessor - Intel64 Family 6 Model 37 Stepping 5\n\nProcessor speed 2527MHZ\n\nI am no tech head so Im not sure about many of the above stats but I wanted to see if I could improve its performance so I Googled away and came across a video on YouTube. I followed it exactly upto the part where it goes on about installing Razor Game Booster (I didnt want that) and fired up KSP ramped up the graphic settings to max and tested.....\n\nWhoa! What a huge difference! I have never seen Duna\u0027s dust clouds before and the Mun looked stunning. I did also notice quite an improvement in my FPS, especially when moving the camera around my space station in orbit around Kerbin which before this was very jerky.\n\nIf any other Intel HD users would like to try this the link is below. I would be really interested to see if it improves your KSP experience as it has mine ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cCxH8wRsNs](www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cCxH8wRsNs)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:58:32Z","Content":"As this is not about the game itself, the thread has been moved to the off-topic lounge."},{"CreatedByName":"Whizzkid","CreatedById":126892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T19:20:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nLooks cool!

How is any of this increasing perfromance? The guy in the video doesnt seem to know what he is doing, everything looks quite random. Updated drivers are no miracle and anything else just looks quite useless (or is Win8 realy set to run background tasks with higher prority?). And how is that game booster thing working? It looks like it just increases the prority of some tasks, or is it auto overclocking the CPU/GPU?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T19:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elthy**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T03:14:26Z","Content":"I find his audible mouse clicks highly annoying.\n\nI\u0027ll agree with **Elthy** above ^\n\nThis video has the guy making a lot of comments about \u0022I don\u0027t know what this is/does\u0022, which should have alarm bells ringing in your head.

I think the defragging won\u0027t help on laptops using SSD\u0027s, but on the other hand increasing the paging file size for the SSD\u0027s may help prevent memory leak crashes. Other than that, disabling other services will definitely help.  \n\nIn my case the real issue is that until KSP officially supports 64-bit Windows I\u0027m kind of up .... creek without a paddle. I have 8 GB of RAM at my disposal, but can only use 4 for KSP, and since I\u0027m running a heavily modded game I get massive amounts of lag and crashes.
