Need I remind folks aobut the 1967 Flash Fire of Apollo I, or the 190 event with Apollo 13 (Which amazingly with some innovation, we were able to save 3 lives from bring the first real casualitys in Real life space.. and then after All of that was said and done, Need I remind folks of the 1986 Challenger disaster, or the 2004 Columbia accident. in which another 17 lives were lost..\n\n(Sure SPaceX hasn\u0027t sent any real astronauts into space but NASA has and yes this is a NASA project.. and you saw what NASA\u0027s own project (Oriion0 has been like..

Leave that to the russians and the Chinese..\n\nBut even their space Track records aren\u0027t spotless.. Russia\u0027s first death occurrede in 1965 when over 5000 people died in a rocket test that kiled everyone including the head of the Russian Space program.. They\u0027ve lost astronauts too, 3 aboard Soyuz 11, another one testing out the original Soyuz, They\u0027ve had near escapes by Astronauts as their rocket\u0027s literally exploded on the launch pad and it\u0027s the sheer luck that the abort systems did work..

The one that ended up taking out a nearby village/ Howmany died in that failure/ 400 -500? More maybe? (The Chinese aren\u0027t going to reveal howmany..After all their agency is tight lipped as it too is government controlled and being censored because of this..\n\nNow let\u0027s take a look at how much each agency in the world has done.. and you\u0027ll be surprisd why we ar in such financial straits we are today..\n\nThe Space Program, Billions if not at least a trillion dollars. (Let\u0027s see if were were to adjust for inflation, the end cost of the moonshot backin 1969 would be now about 300 billion instead of the 24 billion it did cost/ The Shuttles? Well with the loss of CHallenger and Columbia the Goveernment lost not only 14 lives but also 4 billion dollars worth of equipment, and the flights into space were curtailed.. In fact All 5 shuttles were supposed to last 100 flights each and instead.. the tiotal number of shots into space totalled only 135 or 136... way way below the expected life time of the 10-20 billion dollarr space truck that turned out to be a white elephant..(Oh and did they have an escape system on teh shuttle/ Tell taht to the Challenger crew.. an see what they think..\n\nOh and then, let\u0027s not forget us the players in Kerbal space program.. How many Kerbals die on any given day? 10, 100 a 1000? You give me an actual figure, and put that against these agencies and 17 in a 50 year life span at nasa is nothing, in fact it\u0027s stellar.. .. heck more than 50,000 people die here in the states in Car Crashes.. 17 people ? That\u0027s nothing..\n\nAnd like I said, if you want to see Rank amateurs, we\u0027re it.. BUt then do we have the innovtation or drive to put a rocket and send it somewhere there? Of coursse it is, but then if Kerbal money was like Real money, how much have we wasted as we\u0027ve had to g in and rebuild our ships and redesign them jsut to get into space (I know this is a game, but when you stop and think about this, that 500,000 Kerboleans that it cost to build the FASA Saturn V is the equivalent to 2 or 3 billion actual dollars in the real world.. (So yeah 500 Kerboleans is nothing.. but 3 billion dollars? How is economy doing? Well you tell me..\n\nAnd to think a lot of this is based solely on decision making.. \n\nAnd then there\u0027s innovation.. The modders in this game are much like the SpaceX\u0022s the Virgin Galactics, and the Orirtal Transports of the real world.. Even ESA NASA, the Russian and Chinese and India Space budgets are that way, but the russians had their world topple in 1989, and their economy is now one of the poorest, sure the Americans have the drive to make it to space but at a cost that is draining the coffers of our own treasury that they are helping cause Hyper inflation... \n\nAnd then you got the privatized sector of the space program.. the SpaceX, the Orbital Transport, The Boeings and Lockheeds of the world.. do you think when you launch a rocket in game it\u0027s cheap? it\u0027s not.. and if the thing blows up on the pad, that a few bucks of yur money comes out ofyour wallet to make the next flight better? \n\nThe point is, sure it\u0027s overrated, sure it\u0027s hyped, sure it\u0027s innovative..

They didn\u0027t need to perish because a governmental agency didn\u0027t think of an escape plan incase of failures like Challenger or Columbia.. and when they did, it was paltry at best..(Yes Nasa did coe up with an idea, but you try tryinig to get out of a out of control cumbling capsule and try to jump out in a bulky space suit with a parachute before you capsule hits the water.. (See if any of your Kerbals can make it.. (And now with 1.0, the reentry factor is now real...\n\nSo in the end, when you look at the entire space program, think about this the next time you put a Kerbal insto space.. if this was the real world, Millions if not billions of Kerbals are dying everyday, in car and plane crashed, in wars, and starvation, in behing homeless and even due to technological failures..\n\nI mean if yo want this game as real as it gets (No offense to Microsofr for the use of their \u0022Flight Simulator Line\u0022 ) The point is this.. PEople and Kerbals live every day, they die every day too, and if we had it such that we put the real life events of all these disasters in space into context then it adds up quickly and a lot, the lost science , the lost money, just the loss.. \n\nIN closing i have this to say.. Space is dangerous, maybe it\u0027s space that is hyped up to much.. Maybe it\u0027s the poepole who are afraid of innovation, maybe they don\u0027t want us to find new drugs that can help fight off disease.. and possibly find new cures for Cancer.. \n\nIn short, space is dangerous. and we need working secape systems to be tested, tweaked and tested again.. even if it is our money.. After all if you were to go to Marrs, wouldn\u0027t you want to be safe too the next time something goes horribly wrong? \n\nThat\u0027s all I have to say about this.. No need to carry on about it anymore.. afte rall I put this up there for a reason.. to show you how a system could work to save 7 astronauts .. but hey go ahead kills your kerbals, I don\u0027t mind.. \n\n\\*Rant Off\\*\n\nSpace\\_Coyote"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:48:46Z","Content":"I like ULA more."},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:59:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I like ULA more.\n\nResults\n\nRhetoric\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T01:01:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RobotsAndSpaceships**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:09:16Z","Content":"I respect ULA for their impeccable reliability, and SpaceX for their innovation.

I think they do good work at SpaceX, I just think that other space agencies and companies might be hurting in the public eye because SpaceX is getting all the attention. I know very well of the very large difference and sharp, bold line between KSP and real-world space programs. I know that thousands of kerbals are \u0022killed\u0022 on a daily basis while comparatively very little deaths have been incurred in real-world spaceflight. I know of the large amounts of money that are required to launch rockets, regardless of the political climate surrounding such money issues. I know that money and lives have been lost in pursuit of space, and I surely don\u0027t want to impede innovation and the progress of new disease-treating drugs and cancer cures.

North Korea (or rather Kim Jong-un) knows it will be wiped off the map when it actually pulls anything, so just an uncomfortable stale mate will remain. The top tier guys have a good life there, they have no use for an actual war. Meanwhile, going to space has had good effects on the spirits of people in most countries, so maybe some actual good will come of it.\n\nAgain, I know I am being somewhat optimistic, but someone has to be ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunting.Targ","CreatedById":141427,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:48:20Z","Content":"I can\u0027t help but be quite bemused on how such a simple, otherwise boring item as test launch video footage can spark such -um, er- impressively passionate discussion. And since we\u0027re here talking (or ranting) about it, I might as well put some chips on the table.\n\nNASA is a gov\u0027t. agency. SpaceX is a private contractor meeting certain specific requirements set forth by NASA and specific legislation. There are pros and cons to each operational scenario. As a gov\u0027t. agency, NASA has to work with whatever money and directives they\u0027re given from Capitol Hill (determined by the Congressional budget and appropriations legislation and committee decisions), which is sometimes a little, sometimes a lot (of either/or or both). They are also subject to the disease that plagues every gov\u0027t. body: Bureaucracy. If you read the official documentation (or even the Wikipedia summaries, which is far less tedious and boring), you will find out that both space shuttle disasters were caused or contributed to by the \u0027bureaucratic mentality\u0027 of business-as-usual and \u0022that will never happen. Get back to work.\u0022 It was so bad, that as Richard Feynman pointed out, it spread from NASA to (some of) its contractors, namely Morton-Thiokol, manufacturer of the Space Shuttle Launch System SRBs.\n\nNow look at SpaceX. Operating missions with far less overhead and administrative oversight than NASA, and also less systems and flight engineering testing. Proven, practical, but by no means perfectly safe yet, E.M. is blazing a trail for private contractors to make a profit from gov\u0027t. funds in a rather slick and attractive way - taking crews and cargo into space and back. Until some enterprising venture manages to bring back a rare-earth asteroid and start mining it for nickel, silver, and titanium ore, there will be no true \u0027profit\u0027 in going into space.\n\nI also don\u0027t see why Elon Musk gets targeted when Virgin Galactic has become responsible for the first commercial space program fatality. Richard Branson has been funding and overseeing an effort to provide tourist flights on suborbital trajectories, with the goal of taking non-astronaut passengers to low earth orbit and possibly the I.S.S. The SpaceShipTwo incident has been a wake-up call for Virgin Enterprises, who already runs an unconventional but successful commercial airline operation. This has the potential to bring in profit only in the sense that some people are willing to part with significant sums of money just to be part of \u0027space fever\u0027.\n\nAnd as for the early Mercury and Apollo incidents - we (I can hardly help but speak as an American at this point; the space race was rather nationalistic) were learning, and we were learning fast and hard. Most of the lessons we got were technical, and I am fond of saying *the laws of physics are merciless and uncompassionate*. The last few decades have shown that the lessons facing spaceflight now are less technical and more leadership- and organization-oriented. From Challenger and Atlantis, to Mars Climate Orbiter, to the (recent) Project Orion debacle; the real question becomes not \u0027do we trust this technology?\u0027, but \u0027do we trust the people behind (and in) this technology?\u0027\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T11:52:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 11:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hunting.Targ**\n  \nI apparently can\u0027t use the word s.e.x.y. in a news commentary. \\*sigh\\* I do get weary of YCBTC."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:26:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As long as they only use the technology to go to space and come back safely I wish them all the luck in the world.
