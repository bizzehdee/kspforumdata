In fact, I think I even commented in the earlier thread here about it saying I was not excited for it at all.\u00A0 Having spent quite a bit of time in the beta (once it was made available to me), I can say that my opinion has completely changed and I\u0027m very much looking forward to the game\u0027s release so I can play it more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a lot of the initial backlash against the game when it was announced actually shocked Bethesda, and for once, they listened to people\u0027s complaints and criticisms. There were a lot of changes and improvements made in the last couple months that addressed most of the things people didn\u0027t like about the announced game. And those changes are a big part of the reason for my change of opinion from mostly negative at announcement to mostly positive now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, any PS4 players looking for someone to team up with next week (and beyond), feel free to message me with your gamertag and we\u0027ll try to hook up in game. I\u0027ve played mostly solo, but I can see how the game experience would change with multiple players actually working as a team and I\u0027m curious to try that out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-11T03:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill holding out for another isometric Fallout game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, it\u0027s not likely to ever happen again.
