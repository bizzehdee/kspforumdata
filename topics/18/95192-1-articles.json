I\u0027ve used Deep Sky Stacker a fair bit to stack frames to yield a longer effective exposure, but I am limited by the quality of the images that I stack. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say. It doesn\u0027t take a very long exposure before you get star trails when you\u0027re using a long lens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracking mount that I am considering getting is the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ca.skywatcher.com/_english/02_mounts/02_detail.php?sid=68\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESky Watcher Star Adventurer\u003C/a\u003E. It seems to get good reviews online and it is in the $350-$500 range depending on accessories. And it can be used with a small telescope (up to 5kg) as well as a camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone here have any other suggestions? Or maybe someone here even has a Star Adventurer? I know that there are better tracking mounts (i.e. multi-axis mounts or \u0022go to\u0022 mounts) out there, but I don\u0027t want to spend thousands of dollars. I\u0027m looking for the best value mount rather than \u0022bells and whistles\u0022. Maybe there\u0027s even a cheaper option?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ca.skywatcher.com/upfiles/670x435xen_mounts_caty01398885973.jpg.pagespeed.ic.HUeRPQR1y4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022670x435xen_mounts_caty01398885973.jpg.pagespeed.ic.HUeRPQR1y4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T03:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a new one so I don\u0027t know much about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing to consider is what you\u0027re putting on it.
