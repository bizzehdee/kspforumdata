Currently I would say it is out of scope, however I know that a game like this can evolve naturally in that direction. Players will have basic \u0022weapon like\u0022 tools anyways with things like the asteroid grappling harpoon launcher.\n\nThe current part sizes I consider to be mid-sized, so there will be smaller, and there will be larger. Not a lot larger though, complications arise in a game like this where the planets are on mini scale to the the players rockets and avatars. I am considering increasing planet size by 10 to even possibly 100 times the current size, however it depends on some technical issues I am working on right now.\n\nHope you can enjoy the prototype!

Yes removing parts coming soon, for now you can click a new command pod and it will remove the whole rocket. The difficult placement is due to some slightly oversized part colliders, I just need to go and fine tune some of the parts. Originally there was no anti clip protection for placement, so the colliders were not an issue.\n\nWill be fixed soon!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:28:27Z","Content":"i can only see the lsunch pad?"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:29:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i can only see the lsunch pad?\n\nPlease explain?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:35:43Z","Content":"i load the game and all there is is the launch pad?"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:35:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i load the game and all there is is the launch pad?\n\nYou don\u0027t see any menu?\n\nIt should look like this.\n\n![soNjTqQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/soNjTqQ.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:35:45Z","Content":"Nope just a launch pad and a blue earth with a square for a center?\n\nmabye my computer isn\u0027t strong enough to handle this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:05:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope just a launch pad and a blue earth with a square for a center?\n\u003E mabye my computer isn\u0027t strong enough to handle this?\n\nIt should not take much, mind giving the specs on your computer?
