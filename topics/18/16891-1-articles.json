So if we wish to decrease the acceleration on our crew with a given force, all we have to do is to increase the mass! For a manned spacecraft of this kind, therefore, the weird fact is that a big heavy spacecraft is better than a small light one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T19:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI almost feel like that first part should be copied and pasted in the \u0022How To\u0022 section, the part dealing with computations of Delta V.
