If you make a mod its your baby and you want to make the most of it yourself, in your own way. some people will make modding systems to make modding easier (plugin writers like Tosh for example, the original carts mod, very open to development), some people will make their own mods, maybe based on those systems or entirely independant. Some will change their minds over time. But that should still be their decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you invented something, and another person took it away from you without asking, and marketed it with a bunch of other stuff hes taken off other people, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be too chuffed either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, I do use Tekkit, because I like it.

I\u0027m a firm believer in the concept of \u0022no harm, no foul.\u0022 In the case of free mods, as entaran said here, you really shouldn\u0027t complain if money isn\u0027t changing hands. And as far as I\u0027m aware, Tekkit hasn\u0027t passed off any of the mods as its own. I personally would be thankful for inclusion in a major modpack, permission or not. Yes, asking permission is basic respect, but I can\u0027t see any reason to really throw a fit about it when the reality is \u0022Yo dawg, this is Minecraft.\u0022 Which reminds me, I need to Google \u0022IRL Fights over Minecraft\u0022 because 1) my day has not had enough lulz, and 2) I found myself having faith in humanity once today. Neither of these things are acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t use Tekkit. I did previously, but now I just piecemeal my own mods.
