A few months later I told the tale to some friends of mine and my friend Laz refused to call me anything other than Fry from that point forward and it pretty much became my name after that (some people still don\u0027t actually know my real name, heh). Naturally it became what I would call myself in some places, but would you believe that in some places that name was already taken. One of these places was a certain online shooter. Frustrated over what to call myself, another friend of mine suggest \u0027Frybert\u0027 as he assumed that\u0027s what Fry was short for(not joking about people thinking my name really was Fry). So anyway, one day I was describing said game to my girlfriend at the time and when I mentioned my rank in the game she interrupted, \u0022Wait, you mean you\u0027re CORPORAL FRYBERT?\u0022 at which point she busted out laughing at the name.

Why? No clue. But that particular account became successful as instead of quitting and restarting, I worked through every loss and grew. From then on I named most of my online accounts based on the name, hoping and believing in it\u0027s success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not superstitious, it\u0027s more out of habit and or hope that the name can continue to do well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the last part of my name, that came later, specifically when I came to the KSP forums.
