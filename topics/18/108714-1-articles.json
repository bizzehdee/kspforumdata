When I tried running it on 4 gigs, it would be fine til I got to the city, where it would have to load new assets and such... which lagged out my poor RAM. With 12 gigs, it runs almost flawlessly.\n\nNot sure about your CPU: I use an AMD FX-4100 3.6 gHz and it seems to run pretty well.\n\nAs for graphics cad, just make sure whatever you get has **AT LEAST** 2gB on-board memory. If you get one with 4 gigs, you can run all textures at full (so long as the rest of the system can keep up). Below 2 gigs of on-board, and it won\u0027t be able to handle it (at least not in 1920 x 1080... haven\u0027t tried with lower resolutions)\n\nOnly issue I\u0027ve had personally is my CPU (or mobo, potentially) getting a little hot and starting to drop the framerate... quitting the game for a few minutes to let it cool off seems to help though.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Uh, HD 6670 users unite? ![k_cheesy.gif](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E I\u0027m looking at a R9 280-290\n\nHeh, I had a HD 6850 and upgraded to an R9 270... a decent upgrade ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Wish I had had the cash to get an R9 290... that\u0027ll be next year, I think.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T18:01:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whippler","CreatedById":143730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T10:00:06Z","Content":"Well here goes, and it\u0027s not just for gaming.\n\nintel i7 5930K\n\n2x MSI GTX970\n\nG.Skill 4000Mhz, 16GB\n\n1TB Samsung EVO SSD\n\n4TB \u002B 500GB HDD"}]}
