They are the ones making the game. The Elder scrolls online isn\\\u0027t a TES game in my opinion. TES is a singleplayer game, this is a multiplayer game. Can\\\u0027t wait for the next TES though.\n\nAlso, Morrowind is the best of the three mentioned, but it has a steep learning curve, then followed by skyrim, and then oblivion."},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T20:59:39Z","Content":"In some ways I found Oblivion better than Skyrim.\n\nI wish you could wield a staff (non magic) that could block and attack but also have the ability to cast a spell... :\\\u0027("},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T21:07:12Z","Content":"Man, they really screwed this one up."},{"CreatedByName":"r4m0n","CreatedById":5404,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T21:14:38Z","Content":"From the official site:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u00C2\u00A9 2012 ZeniMax Media Inc.

TES Online will be a terrible WoW ripoff.\n\n2. Skyrim, I have realized, was almost a hype machine, so incredibly simplified from morrowind and even oblivion I can no longer take it seriously.\n\n3.
