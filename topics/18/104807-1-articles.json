Not guaranteed, mind - but very likely. There are two reasons for this:\n\n1.) Most areas are already named, sometimes down to quite fine detail, since craters offer lots of landmarks. Here on Earth, new settlements were often created in places where the settlers themselves decided the name because they did not yet have any name for it. This will be different on other planets.\n\n2.) The first settlements are not going to start as settlements. They\u0027re going to start out as research bases, and those have an even higher likelyhood of being named after where they are located/what they are researching. Later these bases will develop into settlements, because settlers will stay where the infrastructure is. And they will continue to bear the name they always had, maybe with small modifications.\n\nAs such, it\u0027s possible that for example a research base erected in Endeavour Crater, which Opportunity is exploring right now, might start off as \u0022Endeavour Station\u0022 and later becomes \u0022Endeavour City\u0022.\n\nOr well, you know, since Endeavour Crater is frickin\u0027 huge... they could go smaller. Start off as \u0022Marathon Station\u0022 (in Marathon Valley, Endeavour Crater), later becoming \u0022New Marathon\u0022 (since Earth already has a city called Marathon, in Greece).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T10:41:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 10:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T14:19:58Z","Content":"Enterprise.
