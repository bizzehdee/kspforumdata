Genre? For our covers, mostly classic rock and jazz. Our repertoire includes Electric Light Orchestra, Santana, Ray Charles, The Moody Blues, the Doors, and a few others. For our originals? Well, I write most of the songs, and I\u0027ve been influenced by Kansas, Rush, Genesis, Pink Floyd, and similar artists, so a lot of my songs kind of sound like blends of them.
