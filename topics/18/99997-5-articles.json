We\u0027ll stop at a nice lunch, and then the point behind the exercise. I found a place that has exceptionally beautiful gardens. I\u0027ll take her a walk through those. I also intend on giving her some small token of affection. Nothing crazy or ostentatious, but something. And then, when the moment is just right, I trigger my phone to play Lou Reed\u0027s \u0022Perfect Day.\u0022 And ask her to dance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am terrible at dancing. I will not perform well at all. And I don\u0027t care. I think she\u0027ll be very happy, and that\u0027s what matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got thoughts, ideas, ways I can improve this?

I\u0027ve been dumped, stepped on, and cheated on more than once. And once I found someone very special that I got very serious with, or so I thought, and she ended up leaving me for a woman out of the blue... (that particular incident was several years ago but it has given me severe depression for my whole life and it will always haunt me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis year after years of being alone I thought I found someone again. She seems very special, but to make a long story short she is stalling ever going on a single date with me because she is stuck living with a freaking guy she supposedly doesn\u0027t want to be with. She swears she wants to leave him for me \u0022sometime this year\u0022, she has to move out and it sounds like he may be abusive. But I\u0027m not holding my breath. It\u0027s a long story... I\u0027ve also tried the online crap to find someone as well. I would say between match and a few other site I have probably messaged over 200 women and don\u0027t have a single reply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone says I\u0027m good looking, I have an athletic body, I have a career, I even work for Hollywood in the movie industry. But no woman seems to want anything to do with me, or if they do they end up stabbing me in the back somehow. I\u0027m also getting older now and it\u0027s getting harder to put one foot in front of the other anymore regarding this subject. I\u0027m an agnostic, borderline atheist, I don\u0027t believe spiritualistic bullcrap and love cliches where everyone is destined to find someone. I have a statistically terrible track record for being rejected by women both online and in person, and the only direction I think it\u0027s going is down deeper into the hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while it starts to suck the life out of you and make you feel worthless. I have a good career and money and things but material goods and wealth don\u0027t always make you happy after a while. I sincerely hope you \u0022Whackjob\u0022 and others on here never, ever have to go through or be put through what I have with your feeling and emotions. Besides KSP and a few other hobbies of mine off the computer, I don\u0027t feel like I have much of a life worth living anymore. But that is the game of life, and like everything else someone has to lose for others to win.

Hindsight is 20/20, and I know now the context behind the awkwardness of that date. On my end, it was because it was date number one. No reason more required. On HER end, she was nervous of ME, because from that dating site, up until now, she\u0027d only met real jerks, and tall lady fetishists. She was very worried I might be another one of \u0022those\u0022. But I\u0027m not, which is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can give you seriously good advice on the dating sites bit. Make sure you fill out your profile. Make it VERBOSE. No \u0022under construction\u0022 or \u0022add more later\u0022. If you find a lady you like, READ the profile! All of it! And when you message a lady, don\u0027t send a \u0022\u0027sup?\u0022. Give her a long and detailed message. To make it easier for her to respond to you, ask one or two questions specific to her profile. Remember, women get bombarded with messages on those places, and you need to do something to stand out from the usual chaff. A nice, thoughtful, thorough message is sufficient. Remember to ask a question or two, but no more! And even if you don\u0027t get an immediate reply, send another in a few days. Just one more. Just a quick, \u0022Hey, I hadn\u0027t heard from you, so I thought I\u0027d pipe up again. How are things?\u0022 If she doesn\u0027t reply a second time, she\u0027s not interested. Move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth, I probably messaged about five HUNDRED women in the time I actively used that site. And the lady I date now? One of the earlier ladies I\u0027d messaged. But I\u0027d send a message, and then get a reply five days later. It was only after a few weeks of that that she suddenly gave me her direct phone number out of the blue.

And if there\u0027s hope for me, then there\u0027s hope for you. Keep at it. And be CONFIDENT.
