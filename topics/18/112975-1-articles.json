It\u0027s just so clean, and minimalistic... I\u0027ve always preferred it to the \u0022meatball\u0022 logo.\n\nAnyone else feel me on this?"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:47:20Z","Content":"I like both, and wouldn\u0027t mind both being used.

It was made as a graphic that would be used for less formal occasions, and is based on the [NASA seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_seal.svg), which was made first before the meatball and worm logos at the very start of NASA. The official seal would\u0027ve been used for more formal occasions and nowadays is only used by the Administrator for awards and other such things. The \u0022Worm\u0022 logo was actually made in 1974 when the government launched a \u0022Graphics Improvement Program\u0022 and NASA got some National Endowment for the Arts funding to give to an artist to design a more modern NASA logo. The \u0022Worm\u0022 was retired in 1991.\n\nI prefer the Worm on spacecraft and the Meatball on buildings, uniforms, shirts, and ground vehicles."},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T23:38:05Z","Content":"Yeah, I know the meatball was the original logo, and it looks *REALLY* dated to me. The worm was in use from Apollo-Soyuz through early \u0022shuttle years\u0022, and it just always sat well with me, certainly better than reviving an older design.
