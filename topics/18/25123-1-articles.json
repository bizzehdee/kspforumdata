Especially if you fly a lot of similar missions (like building a station in LKO). Except mechjeb is not reliable all the time so you need to control what it\u0027s doing. I find MJ 2 strange. I like that it\u0027s been packed into smaller box, so you don\u0027t have to put those funny animated parts. But some functions I think got more complicated, or more simplified, like the randevouz AP, I can\u0027t ONLY match planes, I need to wait for it to match planes and turn off AP..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people find piloting more fun, some people find planning more fun, there\u0027s everything for everyone!

With the exception of landing and docking (and even then I\u0027ll still occasionally use Smart A.S.S. to help with alignment) flying isn\u0027t really that exciting for my any more. So, instead of going hands on with everything I just play KSP as a space program sim instead of a flight sim. I use MJ as the go-between between me and my (mostly unmanned) ships, instead of me on the controls I issue commands to the flight computer and let it do its thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra data displays are also a huge help, I don\u0027t have the time or patience to add up everything in the VAB manually, and the faster I get a ship in the air the faster I\u0027m back to running my missions so taking a bunch of guesswork out of my ship is a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T23:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use it.
