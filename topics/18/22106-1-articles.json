Unfortunately, they don\u0027t seem to be good at advertising the project (I\u0027ve came across it by accident). That may be the reason why they are only at 20% with only 14 days left. Probably there\u0027s a ton of people who would love to see a sequel, but they just don\u0027t know about this. Spread the word, back the project, do whatever is needed to help this game become a reality!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mustwinfull","CreatedById":41681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T17:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s because of lack of funding, it\u0027s that most people go for the cheap deal offers and they don\u0027t get as much from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it looks to be a good game and I might donate some money to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T02:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite right. I\u0027d love to see a sequel. That game Nexus TJI was great at making space, well, freaking space-like.

I\u0027ll try to find some money for it, but I went on a stupid spree with XCOM, Carrier Command, and Dishonored so...yeah. Dammit, I need to eat too, apparently.
