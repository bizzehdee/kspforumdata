Making them worse is exactly why the Gaza Strip is home to extremists against Israel, and is controlled by militant Palestinian group Hamas.

Way too many parents refuse to parent their kids (either due to too much time at work, or because they want to pamper their kids), resulting in a generation of kids who grow up undisciplined and become infected with the \u0027Special Snowflake\u0027 complex. These offspring don\\\u0027t develop the concept of respect and begin to believe that the world revolves around them. I grew up with spankings from my parents whenever I got woefully out of line, while I suspect a large number of kids I went to school with never received a stern word from their parents (or if they did, shrugged it off). Whenever called to the office due to getting into a fight (our schools considered both parties guilty, no matter who the victim was), the bully usually just smirked when his/her uncaring parents were notified, while I sat in abject terror: My parents didn\\\u0027t tolerate any sort of fights, and didn\\\u0027t believe my claims of bullying until a suicide attempt in 7th grade. I was then pulled out of the public school system and homeschooled for the 8th grade. Because my parents ensured I was focused on my schoolwork at (often via a strict \u0027get your schoolwork done before anything else\u0027 rule, enforced by angry looks), I ended up with much higher scores than any of my peers in the state-mandated tests for homeschooling, and eventually skipped highschool, moving on to college at age 13. \u003Cp\u003Etl;dr Parent your damn kids and they won\\\u0027t turn into whiny little brats like this one.
