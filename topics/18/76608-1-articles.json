Later, thanks to Thomas the Tank Engine (Whom I still enjoy watching older 1979-1999 episodes of.) The cars and planes died down. My dad liked the BTTF trilogy as well. He was watching Back to The Future part III, and near the end was the train scene. I joined him and watched the amazing train every time he watched that scene. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few years later, Dad said that we should see the whole trilogy as a family movie night. I asked if that was the movie with the train, and he said that the last movie was. So We watched the trilogy over the course of three nights, and I fell in love with it. For about a year I was as obsessed with BTTF as I am with KSP for the past 1.5 years. It was the first indication that I was going to be a nerd, and I still enjoy it to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
