This is best done in the day. With the lowest magnification eyepiece, point the main scope at a distant object, something like a tree or power pylon. Lock the main scope\u0027s motion if you can, then tweak the finder\u0027s adjustment so it\u0027s over the same distant object. Repeat the process with a higher magnification eyepiece for more precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost stars aren\u0027t very interesting to look at. They\u0027ll still look like stars, just brighter. Some are doubles though, they can be nice to see especially if there\u0027s a colour contrast.
