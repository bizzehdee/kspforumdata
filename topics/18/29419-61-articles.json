Modern engineers tend to be forced to do things the cheap way as much as possible because of the forces of money and corporate politics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real world industrial robots, the operating system and vital config info is stored on either a hard drive or flash chip- I actually recently modified one that ran from a floppy disc to utilize a CompactFlash card as a hard drive for storing its OS and configuration because the floppy drive kept wearing out. They do eventually get messed up, but a trained technician will take mere hours at most to repair one when that happens assuming that proper backups were being kept- and offline maintenance is often needed to produce those backups. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as CPU and RAM goes, no for the most part ordinary hardware is used. The only real difference is it is packaged into casings that are more durable than your household computer, in my environment these are designed to resist dust and coolant infiltration and small impacts such as a forklift bumping it while moving a skid of material. Typically the actual hardware stats reflect a low end system for the time period it was built, again the result of the forces of money and corporates. I\u0027ve upgraded a few of them over the years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cost reasons redundancy is only added for applications where a failure resulting in downtime is unacceptable. Most of the time the machine is wired and configured such that if anything goes wrong it performs an automatic emergency stop, and then sits there unusable with the error that caused it on the screen until a technician arrives to put the trouble right and get it going again. That\u0027s my job, figuring out just what happened and making sure it doesn\u0027t happen again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I work, you do not press the big red button unless it is an actual emergency.
