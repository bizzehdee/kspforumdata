Used, of course; I have no idea when it was made aside from being in that curious technological overlap area when the manual I downloaded mentions both ifit.com and videocassettes. The control console is a typical old-style with black-on-grey LCD display, some blister buttons, and some colored workout-intensity LEDs. So I started pondering the how relatively\u00A0simple it would be to just sell upgraded consoles for these things. After all, the only wires coming from it would be for a speed sensor, a heartbeat sensor, and the little motor that controls resistance. Aside from power, which can be supplied by 4 D cells or the wall AC adapter (presumably 6v, haven\u0027t botherer to look). But why make a new console in this day and age?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI soon realized that it could be as \u0022easy\u0022 as rigging a dongle (to connect those two I/O\u0027s to an iPad, then writing an\u00A0app to interface with the machine.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EMy main roadblock here\u00A0is that while I get the concept of using Arduino\u0027s and Raspberry Pi\u0027s to interface between computers and hardware, I know pretty much nothing about them. Ditto for writing apps. Not to mention no fine soldering skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably more of a mental exercise than actually intending to replace the control console with an iPad. But how hard would it actually be? A microcontroller to feed data to the iPad (via dongle or Bluetooth) and control the resistance motor on command from the iPad is probably the easy part, but I don\u0027t even know if I\u0027d use a Pi or an Arduino for that. After that, it\u0027s writing the app, which could be as simple as overlaying performance data over YouTube videos, up to a more virtual \u0022walk\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any ideas on how I would go about this? Or suggestions for a website/forum that specializes in this sort of thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice if it had a generator to charge a battery bank....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-18T05:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the choice between Arduino and RPi is simple. RPi is a huge overkill for this. You don\u0027t need a full blown computer to control one motor and a few LEDs. The power requirements alone would be a deal breaker here.

Some of the guys there expect you to know a lot of theory before they are willing to help you, and just point you towards a (very) general direction, which I suppose is\u00A0somewhat fine (noone should be doing your homework), but directing a newbie that asks about using a MOSFET to read up on transistor doping, is ridiculous, and doesn\u0027t help at all since the guy asking will not only fail to understand it, but has no need for it anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter community is eevblog.com/forum/ but they are oriented towards more professional aspects of electronics, so a lot of them might not be interested in meddling with Arduinos.
