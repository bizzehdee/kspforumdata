Global Outbreak is violence against zombies and Luftrausers doesn\u0027t even have any kill-able people in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDEFCON is about playing as a faction in a nuclear war and Uplink is about playing as a hacker ruining people\u0027s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing how I play Mount and Blade I should avoid that and Plague Inc is about playing as a disease trying to wipe out humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the trend now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should, the games I stopped playing are violent and generally just about being a jerk to the world and the games I play now are kind of the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you probably don\u0027t know the origin of this trend, and probably don\u0027t care but I\u0027ll tell you why anyways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA game coming out on the 24th called Gods Will Be Watching is a moral decision simulator, where all and all it\u0027s about making hard choices, and a lot of them at that. The main reason I stopped playing these games is because I need the virtual karma for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flash version is available somewhere (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://godswillbewatching.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E) and was made for the Ludum Dare contest on the theme of minimalism, trust me the flash version is hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full version is $8.99 on Steam as of now, it has raised a lot of controversy (Particularly from my new mortal enemy due to a post he made on the Hotline Miami forums [Coincidentally another Devolver Digital game] hunterRose) from the Steam forums due to the rather violent trailer, which I won\u0027t post here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing someone play the first chapter was insane, it managed the feel nicely and certainly could work through the typos made by the Spanish developers (Though they said Devolver will help with that), and was hard as hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly looks fantastic, though the lack of an editor disturbs me, the developers stated that the hardest part would be programming it, everything else would be pixel art and writing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now for me I have to play Gods Will Be Watching in real life, hopefully I don\u0027t go insane or freeze to death before it comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr starve...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr get murdered by guards...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr murdered by XENOLIFER...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr get hyped up about something else...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T01:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022SO LONG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14 More days....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Conversation with myself while laying in the corner in a ball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
