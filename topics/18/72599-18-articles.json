If the shuttle has an offset CoM, it can rotate off-centre. If that CoM happens to line up with the docking port, the ship can match the wobble of the gravity ship without trouble. If they are connected or docking slowly, the offset CoM is not an issue. For all that to work out you need a few coincidences to line up, but hey, it is a movie, not a history lesson. Stranger things have happened in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen they wouldn\u0027t be sitting pressed into the right side of chair,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are seated side by side, yet both lean to another side. She leans right, he leans left. For whatever reason they are leaning, it is apparent it is not gravity.

People need to understand that it is a work that is intended to evoke emotions, not to be a scientific documentary. They got a lot closer than most movies and took a few liberties to make it all tick. I am fine with that, both because I loathe to become the geek asking awkward questions at conventions, and that they did an awesome job painting a picture of technological hope for mankind in a fairly realistic setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
