They wanted me to go full time, but their health insurance program is abhorrently expensive and quite frankly, what I\u0027m on now is affordable and has reasonably decent coverage. If I went full time though, I\u0027d not qualify for the insurance I\u0027m on, cause as a part time employee, I don\u0027t have access to the company health plan, and having employer coverage would disqualify me from the insurance plan I\u0027m on now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, with that out of the way, I work two part time jobs. One job at a testing lab, and the other doing electronic assembly and occasional design engineering for a machine shop that makes electric motors. The machine shop is run by an old friend, and former supervisor from my old job, also making electric motors... His business is a continuation of what we did at out old employer, before they were bought out and closed (The old company was purchased so the buyer could acquire our linear motor product line).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the shop job for 7 years, and prior to that, I\u0027d worked 9 years at the old motor manufacturer. Sadly, while it\u0027s a very profitable business, it\u0027s also very small. On slow months, I typically only get a couple days of actual work. Sometimes, when we\u0027re busier, I can have a\u00A0week or two\u00A0worth of stuff to work on, but it\u0027s a far cry from full-time. Pay isn\u0027t bad though. It makes a great supplemental job, as I can go in and work 3-4 hours over two afternoons, and come home with an extra hundred bucks in my pocket. The job at the shop has been exceptionally busy. Apart from the regular monthly stuff I do there, we finally got orders for a cable for a surgical tool, for the first time in almost two years! (We used to make the motors that go into the tool) That is GREAT, cause I can do 90% of the work from my home workshop. I\u0027m also designing a piece of test equipment (I finally learned KiCAD to make the PC board), so that\u0027s a big project that\u0027s racking up the hours too...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s where the problem lies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe lab job. It was alway part time. I started there doing an 8-12 shift. They decided a year in, they wanted me to do 10-2pm instead... No additional hours gained, no pay raise, but I LOOSE 2 hours of my afternoon. I refused to accept the change without fair compensation for the loss of my time, and they agreed to shift me to a flexible hours arrangement. I\u0027d come in and do an \u0022official\u0022 9-1pm shift, but I had the option to come in early if I knew the next day would be busier, and I could stay as late as I wanted to get additional hours, if there was work to do. This was actually GREAT! All the time benefits of part time work, with the option to work extra as needed (and pad that paycheck). As time went by, things began to change. Suddenly, everyone in my area had to \u0022check out\u0022 before leaving. The managers all took lunch at the time I normally would leave, so suddenly, on days I wanted to get out, right then and there, at 1pm, I suddenly couldn\u0027t check out for up to an hour. Then it shifted from, \u0022okay, you\u0027re good to go\u0022 to \u0022well lets make sure there\u0027s nothing left that you need to do\u0022... Mind you, there are always 2 full-time employees there, and I was the part time help for when things are supposed to be busy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nQueue another year or two later, and we\u0027ve had 3 or 4 total employees in our area at any given time, at least 2-3 full-time, and me as part time. Sometimes it was 2 full, and 2 part time. Occasionally, it\u0027s drop back to 2 full and me as part time, when we were between fourth employees. The area I work is most definitely a three station workflow. Sample disposal, container lining, and media filling. There\u0027s other tasks, but they get divided up, and that was often the responsibility of the fourth employee. We had a particularly troublesome fourth employee, who managed to last a year. The two full timers transferred to bigger and better things, and a new third full timer was brought in, bringing us to three employees. Well... The troublesome one got fired a month or so ago, and we\u0027ve now been down to one NEWish full time employee, and me... Still part time, but working 7-10 hour days. A two person crew, trying to operate a three station workflow. Anyone with half a brain understands that that\u0027s a bottleneck. if one person handles two stations, they operate each station at half the capacity as the third station being operated at full capacity. It creates buildups, delays, and leaves the autoclaves suffering from major idle times. It\u0027s... It\u0027s real bad!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I addressed these issues to my manager... Her response was \u0022I\u0027m not hiring a third employee. We don\u0027t need one.\u00A0Besides, don\u0027t you think you two couldn\u0027t just work faster?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m NOT going to burn myself out, to do MORE work, for NO ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION, ESPECIALLY when I see that the friggin\u0027 ALDI\u0027s grocery store... You know, the REALLY CHEAP place, is hiring people with a STARTING WAGE that\u0027s half a dollar HIGHER than what I\u0027m earning after nearly FIVE YEARS at the lab... What the!?!?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe tells me that there are enough people in other departments that if things get busy, they can just have other people put in a little time to help. This is a garbage response. First off, EVERYONE is busy in the mornings, and that\u0027s where our worst bottlenecks are. Most times, when people FINALLY come to offer us help, we\u0027re in the middle of cleanup, at the end of the day. One day, the first offer of help was literally so late, that I had to respond \u0022Well, you could help by wiping down the counters, but then we would have to leave, cause there\u0027s literally nothing left to do. I would literally have to stop working for the day, to let you help me right now\u0022.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u00A0While there are RARE cases where we get help at useful times, it\u0027s not all that common, and it\u0027s burning me out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat\u0027s more though, is I have ALWAYS had two or three separate jobs, and the lab always accommodated my need to get my hours in elsewhere.\u00A0When I needed to work a shift at my old job at Gamestop, or get hours in at the shop, what was once my manager saying \u0022Once you\u0027ve worked your official shift, you\u00A0can optionally\u00A0stay later and work any extra hours you can take. If you need to leave at 1pm, that\u0027s fine.\u0022 has recently shifted all the way to \u0022Well you can leave once everything is done. I need you need to finish with everything here before you head out\u0022. Yeah... My \u0022part time\u0022 duties seem to have shifted to full time duties, without any of the full time benefits.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTomorrow, I\u0027m leaving at 1 PM, and my manager can just\u00A0deal with it. I\u0027ve told my coworker that I\u0027m leaving at 1pm, so it\u0027s not a surprise, and it\u0027s not like it ain\u0027t fair to him. He got a whole day off.\u00A0The previous day, my manager actually called my coworker to stay home on Monday (Our days off shift between Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, to keep someone in the lab all week round), cause she didn\u0027t think it would be busy enough to need two people... DESPITE me telling her the previous Friday that I needed to be taking off at the end of my normal shift to go to the machine shop the next week... BTW... it wasn\u0027t a slow day at all!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe impression that I get is that:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA: She is completely dismissive of my other job, and feels I should ignore it, to prioritize the lab.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s reached\u00A0the point where it almost\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeels\u003C/em\u003E like she\u0027s sabotaging my ability to leave at a normal time (like on Monday).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: She wants me to go full time, and is treating me as if I already was FT, but is ignoring the fact that I get \u003Cem\u003Eno FT benefits at all.\u003C/em\u003E It\u0027s been months since I left AT 1pm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC: Multiple people in the lab think firing the troublemaker and not replacing him is an active ploy to pad her bonus, by reducing labor beyond reasonable means. She\u0027s actively \u003Cem\u003EIGNORING\u003C/em\u003E the fact that the lab employees are struggling to keep up (and who\u00A0have spoken up to her about it), and taking advantage of part timers like me to get full time work hours from non full time employees, and pad the total labor pool with non-overtime hours, and fewer employees to pay out benefits to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI should have had a sweet paycheck from my other job, but days and days of delays, where I just don\u0027t have the time to drive out to the shop (which is out of town) have prevented me from getting as many hours in over there! If I could get a position at the other lab in town, I\u0027d jump ship in a heartbeat. Sadly, the lab I work at JUST built a MASSIVE expansion that directly competes with the other lab in town, and they\u0027ve been slow for the past year. I know, cause I\u0027ve been checking with them. I mentioned that the friggin\u0027 ALDI\u0027s in town is hiring at a starting wage higher than my nearly 5 years at the lab... At my employee review, they literally pointed their thumb at the new building, and used it as an excuse for an abysmal QUARTER raise. No one got good raises. The company likes to spend on the buildings, and cheap out on the labor. Those people have me hating my job. I genuinely hate going there. My coworker is awesome. He hates it, but we have fun. It\u0027s how we cope with such crummy\u00A0management, and such low wages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ONLY REASON I haven\u0027t already walked... Is it\u0027s probably the most stable job I\u0027ve ever witnessed in my entire life. I watched a man tell his managers he was quitting\u00A0FIVE TIMES, be called into meetings about his behavior and attitude four times, run a cart into a pregnant woman, and verbally harass other employees, and not show up for a few days, cause he was in jail for a DUI... And HE\u0027S STILL WORKING THERE!!!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u00A0He\u0027s NOT even the guy who got fired!!! The one who got fired eventually got fired for repeated no-shows, blatant NSFW speech and behavior, and repeatedly getting into it with managers. He ONLY got fired cause he went directly up against management... And it took a YEAR.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u00A0As long as you do your job reasonably well, and don\u0027t pick fights with management, I\u0027m not sure you even could get canned from this place. I\u0027ve only heard of one other firing in 5 years, and that was for stealing from the company.\u00A0As for what we do, my department does food testing. Unless the government suddenly stops requiring foods to be tested to be safe for human consumption, or humanity suddenly\u00A0stops eating, we will ALWAYS have work. It\u0027s the most stable industry I\u0027ve ever seen in my life. In five years, we\u0027ve never had a downturn, never had a layoff, never had lack of product to test. We\u0027re stable, BECAUSE we are a service industry, that services a government mandated safety regulation, on something every human needs (food), and that testing needs to be done fast. You can\u0027t outsource it to China, cause it\u0027d take too long and cost too much to send the samples around the world. Instead, there are numerous testing labs dotted all over the country that service local food growers and manufacturers. It\u0027s the fast response that is beneficial, and drives companies like where I work. A customer doesn\u0027t even need to wait for UPS overnight, cause we have a network of couriers that can literally drive straight to you and pick up your sample, same day. If a company can\u0027t sell what they produce till they get a test result, then having rapid response makes a world of difference. Shipping by the afternoon, vs storing everything in a warehouse for a day or two. It\u0027s cause of that stability, that I\u0027ve not walked away. I will probably never find a job as stable as a food testing lab in an agricultural town.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, I want out...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know it\u0027s a waste of money, but they\u0027ve driven me to start buying the occasional lottery ticket, just so I can \u003Cem\u003EDREAM\u003C/em\u003E of \u003Cem\u003EHOPING\u003C/em\u003E to wave that in their face and \u003Cem\u003EWALK\u003C/em\u003E!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy dreams!
