Obviously the ship wasn\u0027t designed to be used in that way. They probably could\u0027ve modified it for that purpose, IF they\u0027d had more time. And they had even less time than they logically would have, because the closer they got to the black hole, time on Earth would accelerate. Just like when they were on the planet surface, every second was critical.\n\nAnyway, could the ISS do that? Control the engines of a docked ship without someone being in there?

Thus it was only possible to dock the Ranger and the Landers to the docking ports, but impossible to transfer fuel, connect electric lines and establish a connection between the Ranger and the Endurance ring module. Someone was supposed to detach the Ranger on their side. Though it is a mystery why CASE couldn\u0027t do that.
