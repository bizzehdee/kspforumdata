You wouldn\u0027t have the experiences of the thirty-year period you skipped. Each stage in life prepares us for the next. You\u0027d be unprepared - and even more miserable than you are now. The only way to become happier and better NOW is to begin by changing the way you think of yourself. Whether you believe in creationism or evolution, one thing remains unchanged.

I was once in the same boat you are in except I came from an abusive family. Until the age of 36, I had a very low opinion of myself and sounded nearly like you did. I went from relationship to relationship, each one leaving its own set of scars. I just endured life each day. I tried faking the happy thing day in and day out. But in 2006, all that changed as I changed. I wanted to change, I needed to change, and I went looking for answers. I found that purpose and it actually gave meaning to me.

Instead of just talking to them, engage them. Have a small cooler with ice and a few bottles of water. Make sure they are new and never been opened. But when someone sits next to you, offer them a bottle of water. You\u0027ll be surprised what that kind of act will do. You\u0027ll soon discover that many people out there simply do not know how to accept good, heartfelt generosity because our society has beaten generosity and compassion into something seen as some sort of weakness.

As someone that teaches college, not everyone needs to go to college to become successful. Success is what you define it to be. For some, like myself, being happy is success. I enjoy teaching and I literally get paid to play all day. I also like being a problem solver and the \u0022why this?\u0022 guy... and that is where my love of research comes in. Now within my faith, the Bible tells us to be content with what we have, and for the most part I am, which takes the stress out of, as you say, to get \u003Cem\u003E\u0022the best job to buy the most.\u0022 \u003C/em\u003EIt is a matter of fact and not of faith you cannot take possessions with you when you die.

Nope, not going to happen. If you want to get better at writing, you\u0027ve got to do two things - you\u0027ve got to work on it to develop your talent AND you\u0027ve got to have patience with yourself.

I know it because the average 19-year old doesn\u0027t study space technology, plan orbits and know in extensive detail how rocket engines and celestial mechanisc work. You do because you\u0027re here, playing this game. You\u0027ve written some fiction here on the forums. That\u0027s more writing than the average person will probably do in their entire lifetime. So you\u0027re already ahead of the curve on that one too. You have all kinds of ideas which may or may not be good, but that\u0027s already more than most people. The average person has ideas on what they\u0027re gonna have for dinner. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with being average, but I\u0027m just saying those are some of your strengths, in some areas you\u0027re probably below average and that\u0027s fine too. Everyone is. I bet Elon Musk really really sucks at something. Maybe cooking. Problem is that you\u0027re expecting to be exceptional. One thing that others have said many times and I\u0027m gonna repeat again is that everybody is bad at everything at first. Then they spend years being bad and then they spend years being OK and then they become good. No way around that fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut first of all, start giving yourself credit where credit is due. I don\u0027t know you so there\u0027s gonna me much more than what I just wrote but at least I know those are real things and I\u0027m on the other side of the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really tempted to say I know how you feel, but I\u0027ve long ago realized that another person can never truly know how someone else feels. So instead I\u0027ll say I\u0027ve felt something really similar pretty much my whole life. For what it\u0027s worth, here\u0027s my view on your situation based on this thread and some other posts around the forum from you that I\u0027ve come across.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst here\u0027s a little story from my youth: I really wanted to play the guitar when I was young. I really liked heavy metal when I was like 10 or 12 or so and it was my dream to be in a band one day. We even had a guitar so there was literally nothing stopping me. Somehow I never got around to it though. When I was about 15 I tried to learn it but it was hard and I never got too far. Then at 16 I changed to another school and became friends with some musician types, especially one guy who was a very good guitar player. Back then I wanted to play like he did but it turned out he had been playing since he was 8 years old so already he had 8 years of practice. So obviously I couldn\u0027t catch up in a year or two, how could I? So I kinda settled in with the thought that it\u0027s too late for me to start playing any more since I\u0027m so far behind, I\u0027ll never catch up. He even tried to get me to play and actually he even mentioned I\u0027d have the perfect fingers for it, too. Saying that might sound a bit weird to some but if you\u0027ve ever played the guitar, having long and nimble fingers is a pretty big advantage so as a serious musician he kinda took notice of such things. For reference you can look up how big hands Jimi Hendrix has, I\u0027ve got the same hand type. Now it\u0027s got nothing to do with actual playing skill, but it\u0027s a big help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what? I was 16 when I decided that I\u0027d too old. I\u0027m 32 now. If I had started playing back then, I\u0027d have 16 years of experience now, twice that which my friend had back then. Even if I had no talent at all, 16 years of practice would make anyone at least good, if not very good. So when at 19 you think you\u0027ve missed your train, it pains me to see you making the same decision about yourself than I did at 16. If you start doing anything at all right now, when you\u0027re my age you\u0027ll have 13 years of practice doing it and you\u0027ll be very good at it. And trust me, when you\u0027re 32, you won\u0027t have reached any sort of endgame in your life where you\u0027re settled in and know everything. You\u0027ll still be young and you\u0027ll be at a perfect age to grab opportunities and do pretty much anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it for a while. If you had started doing something when you were 6 years old, you think you\u0027d be any good at it now? Compared to your peers? For example imagine you\u0027d started writing stories the second you learned how to write and would\u0027ve done that regularly your entire life so far. You think you\u0027d make good stories? I know you would because you do so even now (I\u0027ve read them so shut up, I know) it\u0027s just that you need some practice to polish out some technical issues and learn how to make good into excellent. And that\u0027s what every single writer has always had to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what else? I\u0027m in that same exact boat with my writing than you are. I\u0027ve written enough to be decent but since I\u0027ve had the same attitude towards writing that I had towards guitar playing, I haven\u0027t really practiced it properly. Thing between you and me is that I\u0027ve wasted 13 years of writing time. You haven\u0027t, so make sure that at 32 you\u0027re not lamenting on the wasted 13 years and your decision of not to actively pursue whatever it is that you wish to pursue. Time is precious and even though at this age I luckily (and hopefully) still have a boatload of it to do things, you probably have 13 years more than I do. That\u0027s a lot of time to become good at something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the subject of enjoyment and fulfillment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres\u0027 a comic I relate to.

I do it because it\u0027s meaningful to me and not being a writer feels much worse than being a writer and enduring all the bad things that come with it. The sense of fulfillment or some abstract notion of happiness is hard to find. But meaning and purpose behind what I\u0027m doing is what makes it worth all of it. When I have that, I find it\u0027s easier to find those nice emotions from other things like running in the woods, sunrises on crisp autumn days like this one and a nice cup of coffee and a muffin for breakfast on an airport just before heading out on a new adventure. But without meaning it\u0027s hard to find that happiness anywhere. So feeling good and doing meaningful things are not always at the same place for everyone.

I know it because the average 19-year old doesn\u0027t study space technology, plan orbits and know in extensive detail how rocket engines and celestial mechanisc work. You do because you\u0027re here, playing this game. You\u0027ve written some fiction here on the forums. That\u0027s more writing than the average person will probably do in their entire lifetime. So you\u0027re already ahead of the curve on that one too. You have all kinds of ideas which may or may not be good, but that\u0027s already more than most people. The average person has ideas on what they\u0027re gonna have for dinner. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with being average, but I\u0027m just saying those are some of your strengths, in some areas you\u0027re probably below average and that\u0027s fine too. Everyone is. I bet Elon Musk really really sucks at something. Maybe cooking. Problem is that you\u0027re expecting to be exceptional. One thing that others have said many times and I\u0027m gonna repeat again is that everybody is bad at everything at first. Then they spend years being bad and then they spend years being OK and then they become good. No way around that fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut first of all, start giving yourself credit where credit is due. I don\u0027t know you so there\u0027s gonna me much more than what I just wrote but at least I know those are real things and I\u0027m on the other side of the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really tempted to say I know how you feel, but I\u0027ve long ago realized that another person can never truly know how someone else feels. So instead I\u0027ll say I\u0027ve felt something really similar pretty much my whole life. For what it\u0027s worth, here\u0027s my view on your situation based on this thread and some other posts around the forum from you that I\u0027ve come across.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst here\u0027s a little story from my youth: I really wanted to play the guitar when I was young. I really liked heavy metal when I was like 10 or 12 or so and it was my dream to be in a band one day. We even had a guitar so there was literally nothing stopping me. Somehow I never got around to it though. When I was about 15 I tried to learn it but it was hard and I never got too far. Then at 16 I changed to another school and became friends with some musician types, especially one guy who was a very good guitar player. Back then I wanted to play like he did but it turned out he had been playing since he was 8 years old so already he had 8 years of practice. So obviously I couldn\u0027t catch up in a year or two, how could I? So I kinda settled in with the thought that it\u0027s too late for me to start playing any more since I\u0027m so far behind, I\u0027ll never catch up. He even tried to get me to play and actually he even mentioned I\u0027d have the perfect fingers for it, too. Saying that might sound a bit weird to some but if you\u0027ve ever played the guitar, having long and nimble fingers is a pretty big advantage so as a serious musician he kinda took notice of such things. For reference you can look up how big hands Jimi Hendrix has, I\u0027ve got the same hand type. Now it\u0027s got nothing to do with actual playing skill, but it\u0027s a big help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what? I was 16 when I decided that I\u0027d too old. I\u0027m 32 now. If I had started playing back then, I\u0027d have 16 years of experience now, twice that which my friend had back then. Even if I had no talent at all, 16 years of practice would make anyone at least good, if not very good. So when at 19 you think you\u0027ve missed your train, it pains me to see you making the same decision about yourself than I did at 16. If you start doing anything at all right now, when you\u0027re my age you\u0027ll have 13 years of practice doing it and you\u0027ll be very good at it. And trust me, when you\u0027re 32, you won\u0027t have reached any sort of endgame in your life where you\u0027re settled in and know everything. You\u0027ll still be young and you\u0027ll be at a perfect age to grab opportunities and do pretty much anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink about it for a while. If you had started doing something when you were 6 years old, you think you\u0027d be any good at it now? Compared to your peers? For example imagine you\u0027d started writing stories the second you learned how to write and would\u0027ve done that regularly your entire life so far. You think you\u0027d make good stories? I know you would because you do so even now (I\u0027ve read them so shut up, I know) it\u0027s just that you need some practice to polish out some technical issues and learn how to make good into excellent. And that\u0027s what every single writer has always had to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what else? I\u0027m in that same exact boat with my writing than you are. I\u0027ve written enough to be decent but since I\u0027ve had the same attitude towards writing that I had towards guitar playing, I haven\u0027t really practiced it properly. Thing between you and me is that I\u0027ve wasted 13 years of writing time. You haven\u0027t, so make sure that at 32 you\u0027re not lamenting on the wasted 13 years and your decision of not to actively pursue whatever it is that you wish to pursue. Time is precious and even though at this age I luckily (and hopefully) still have a boatload of it to do things, you probably have 13 years more than I do. That\u0027s a lot of time to become good at something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the subject of enjoyment and fulfillment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://theoatmeal.com/comics/unhappy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres\u0027 a comic I relate to.

I\u0027m gonna go with Oatmeal and contradict some stuff that\u0027s been said in this thread. If you want to do something, you don\u0027t have to feel good about doing it.

Break your dreams down into more manageable steps. Your overall end result becomes your vision. The large, abstract things you need to do to get there are your goals. Below that are sub-goals, which are mini goals used to achieve the goals. Finally are steps. These are the most basic you can go.
