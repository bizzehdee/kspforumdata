Duna has a very thin atmosphere so I\u0027ve always used grazing and then angled reentry to maximize the duration of braking. Something tells me you\u0027ll have mere seconds between end of fiery ablation and impact. The atmosphere might not be powerful enough to cause significant resistance and G-force. You basically slam into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend a simple Venera-like probe for starters.

Because I am going for as close a recreational as I can to Curiosity\u0027s entry and landing. The big thing on my mind is just as you said.. the time from atmosphere entry to ground. I\u0027d rather not pop a chute before peak heating. Not sure how it\u0027d stand up with DRE and Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere. It may hold up. Basically what I need to do is.. Parachute deploy asap, drop the heatshield ( I\u0027m hoping the chute can slow the craft enough AND the thinner atmosphere is enough for the shield to actually fall away ) then the rover/crane drop out of the shell, fire engines, lower rover, disconnect and done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks great on Kerbin. But there\u0027s a whole lot of atmosphere on Kerbin that allows me to really take my time with the \u0022six minutes of terror\u0022 phase. On Duna im going to have to work alot faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see alot of quick loading in my future. Testing is tricky. Right now I\u0027m just getting the process perfected. But without actually sending the rover there I figure a good test would be a very steep entry into Kerbins atmosphere to limit the time between atmosphere entry and landing.
