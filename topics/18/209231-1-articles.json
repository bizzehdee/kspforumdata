It\u0027s old and it doesn\u0027t have an integrated WiFi card, so I have to use a dongle to connect. On boot there is nothing out of the ordinary, and when I get to desktop I just get a little X icon in the bottom right, and I\u0027m not connected. No matter what port I connect it to the dongle doesn\u0027t work. A spare dongle doesn\u0027t work either, but that dongle works on my laptop when I use it. On further inspection the dongle I was using was fried, but the spare still doesn\u0027t work at all, no matter what ports I connect it to. I suspect drivers but I\u0027m not sure how to go about doing that. The USB ports are good because I can use USBs and charge my iPhone from them. But the wireless dongles still don\u0027t work. Any ideas? I can specify specs of the PC if y\u0027all need them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
