It gets fuzzy starting from here. Being able to save everyone is obviously desirable, but if you let everyone die, you are considered incompetent, and may be downright villainous by some due to your incompetence. Perhaps in this case, it is better to save some, rather than let all of them die. You may not be everyone\u0027s champion, but you are for some of them. And it matters. (note that this might sound like a glory hound\u0027s thinking, but it is more of like \u0022for the greater good\u0022 where that \u0022good\u0022 is defined by the community around you.

The most fuzzy kind of ethic. Let\u0027s say, if on that sinking ship, 1/3 of passengers are children who will likely die much faster than the adults, you better send out the smaller ship to save them first, because they will probably die even if you got the bigger ship in time for the adults. On the other hand, say on that ship are a bunch of convicts. You are not able to judge who is worth living and who is not. Better try to save them all, but if you didn\u0027t make it, it is karma. Situational ethics are damn fuzzy and you can\u0027t really decide which is \u0022best\u0022 based on some kind of cosmic scale of right and wrong. It is just you and the situation you gotta solve.
