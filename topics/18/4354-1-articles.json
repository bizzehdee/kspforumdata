Now, cards on the table - I\\\u0027m not a rocket scientist. I am a High School Science teacher, meaning I\\\u0027m scientifically literate; and I have a very basic understanding of orbital mechanics (which, incidentally, has been enormously augmented by my playing a certain space game involving insane alien astronauts! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat simple, straightforward understanding is enough that I appreciate the size of LEO space. It was originally also enough that I thought I understood the utter futility of parking a large amount of fuel in orbit for a future mission to rendezvous with. After all, unless the future mission happens by luck to be on the same trajectory and use the same fuel as has been stockpiled in the depot, it can\\\u0027t access the depot. Let\\\u0027s face it, there aren\\\u0027t that many possible destinations on particular orbital paths - a mission to Mars couldn\\\u0027t use a refueling depot set up to send something to Venus, etc. I\\\u0027d simply put the Commission\\\u0027s ideas down to having watched \u0027Armageddon\u0027 too many times.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have noticed a data point which may well be significant. It\\\u0027s that I haven\\\u0027t seen a chorus of scientists screaming \u0027You are so stupid!\u0027 to this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this means one of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The Commission are so far from understanding ANYTHING relating to the realities of space that the scientists don\\\u0027t believe their findings to be worth the paper they\\\u0027re written on. Since President Obama (for all his faults) appears to be a fairly clever bloke, surely he picked a commission which had scientists and engineers as well as bean counters, so I include this option only for completeness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The scientists are intimidated into silence (conspiracy theories, don\\\u0027t you love \\\u0027em?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The idea hasn\\\u0027t had enough publicity to arouse a serious response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I don\\\u0027t know orbital mechanics as well as I thought I did, and there\\\u0027s actually sensible concepts for depots that might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m tipping 4, but please discuss!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a clarification: I\\\u0027m completely au fait with the idea of rendezvous of two or more units in space, giving a larger and more capable spacecraft than a single launch can manage. But that\\\u0027s different in my mind - both launches are specifically targeted for a particular purpose, so consequently you deliberately place them on intersecting orbits. In addition, to my mind it\\\u0027s ridiculous to refuel a spent tank - wouldn\\\u0027t it make more sense to have a complete stage in position? Eliminates a lot of pointless fluffing around, and when you\\\u0027re finished with it you just drop the stage, meaning you\\\u0027re not carrying all that extra mass all the way to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Once is too many times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RulerOfNothing","CreatedById":14,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-06T09:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect me if I\\\u0027m wrong, but aren\\\u0027t the proposed fuel depots considered as part of the mission, rather than going \u0027Let\\\u0027s put fuel in orbit around Mars in case we want to go there in the future\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-06T09:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\\\u0027s kind of the thing.

It\\\u0027s estimated you have about 1 molecule of hydrogen per cubic meter of your run of the mill vacuum of space. Of course, this number will vary depending on where you are, but it doesn\\\u0027t change the fact that the vast majority of space is pretty devoid of that stuff. Proposed ship design that uses a bussard ramscoop to collect hydrogen and use it as fuel would need to have the ramscoop dish part that collects the hydrogen at an estimated diameter of 100km, if memory serves. It was mentioned in Carl Sagan\\\u0027s \u0027Cosmos\u0027 but it\\\u0027s been.. way too many years since I last read it, so it\\\u0027s quite possible I got some of the numbers wrong. But the main gist of it was, there\\\u0027s not a whole lot of hydrogen molecules in your typical cubic meter of space, and you\\\u0027d need a giant collector. The point is - as nice a theory as it is, for all intents and purposes it\\\u0027s not a practical idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScooping something off of Jupiter\\\u0027s atmo wouldn\\\u0027t have that problem since there actually is hydrogen in large quantities over there. But that would prove to be a huge technical challenge for other reasons. First of all, even reaching Jupiter is a non trivial, and very fuel intensive task. Secondly, the high levels of radiation that close to Jupiter would make the technical challenges of such a mission rather high. A much cheaper and easier way would be a Lunar base built over a subterranean patch of ice that converts it to hydrogen. I seem to recall they did find some ice patches below Lunar surface using an orbital spectrometer last time they \u0027bombarded\u0027 the moon, impacting the surface with a special probe and analyzing the dust/debris cloud that formed. Someone correct me if I\\\u0027m wrong, I\\\u0027m not entirely sure just how much ice was found and whether or not it would be enough for a sustained fuel manufacturing operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
