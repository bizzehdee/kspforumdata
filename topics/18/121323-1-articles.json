It mentions that we don\u0027t see light by casting our vision at it, we perceive light as it goes into our eyes. This is the same way a camera works. The author is arguing that we wouldn\u0027t be able to see the laser beam going through the bottle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, my mind has come up with a solution, albeit a mind boggling one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the laser light enters the bottle. At the speed of the camera, it takes several seconds for the beam to go through the bottle, at the speed of light. Well, the way we can actually see the beam, is that the light bounces out of the bottle towards the camera, giving us a visual of the beam. If this is true, that means that however long it takes the beam to travel the distance of the bottle, it would take the light bouncing out of the bottle that long to travel that far, in any direction. So if the camera is say, 3 bottle lengths away from the bottle, it would take 3 times the amount of time it takes the beam to cross the bottle (in the camera playback) for the camera to actually \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E the beam. That means that even at that crazy camera speed, light is \u003Cem\u003Eso fast\u003C/em\u003E that the camera can\u0027t see the light until it\u0027s already \u003Cem\u003Ethrough the bottle!\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich gives a whole new perception to the video, we aren\u0027t witnessing the light go through the bottle, we\u0027re witnessing the visual of the light going through the bottle after the light has already passed through the bottle. Light is so fast that we will never be able to actually see the light as it passes through, due to the fact that our vision is limited by that very same speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my theory somewhat correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T15:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much.
