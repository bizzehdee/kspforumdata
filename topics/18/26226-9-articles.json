He was stopped relative to her, but the system Stone-tether-Kowalski was still slowly rotating around the station. Remember how they initially got to that position - Stone got caught into parachute ropes and straight line movement was turned into a rotation around the point where the rope holds to the Soyuz (is the point called a vertex in English? I can\u0027t find those terms, for the love of Newton). Impact of Kowalski never completely stopped the motion, but it was slowed down. However, even with low angular speed, the distance between the Soyuz and Kowalski was really long, so the force is significant.

I went in with some reservations that the public would get a bad vibe about space travel after the movie, but i tried to keep an open mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three biggest points i summarized my criticisms into boil down to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The \u0022Action Box.\u0022 As many of us have pointed out, Tiangong, the ISS, and Hubble wouldn\u0027t be nearly that close. Also, i find it hard to believe that much debris would pile up in the \u003Cem\u003Eexact\u003C/em\u003E orbit of all 3 installations. It seems like they stuffed space into an \u0027action box\u0027 where everything is put in closer proximity for dramatic effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Early Warning. As far as i know, the US Air Force keeps a constant eye on the tracking of debris in orbit. Any spacecraft in danger of a collision would be informed well before \u0027imminent impact\u0027, during which time the craft could raise or lower its orbital plane to miss the oncoming debris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u0022Interpretive Physics.\u0022 I know Hollywood gets kind of a free pass on this one, and most sequences were stunningly accurate. But a few scenes that contributed to the plot did annoy me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-First, no space program in their right mind would let astronauts get to the propellant and oxygen reserves to the levels Bullock and Clooney dealt with, in anticipation of some disaster similar to the movie\u0027s. I don\u0027t think Bullock would\u0027ve burnt as much oxygen as she did on her ride to the station anyway. Plus, when she grabs Clooney in the parachute rig scene, shouldn\u0027t she have canceled his rel-V with the Station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t see how he could\u0027ve accelerated without any exterior force after detaching from Bullock. He shouldn\u0027t have run out of pack fuel anyway, as Bullock couldn\u0027t have \u0022slowed him down\u0022 on the approach to the station (as she said); one short burst prograde to the station would\u0027ve let them coast there without a drop more of propellant (and he gave no indication of critical fuel before departing the shuttle, anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When Bullock tries to use the RCS thrusters on the Soyuz to free its parachute from the ISS, she applies retrograde RCS thrusting, demonstrating its capability to adjust its linear motion as in KSP. Now, when she departs for Tiangong, she \u0027cannot turn on the engine\u0027, driving her near to suicide when she thinks she\u0027s out of options. Why not use the linear RCS thrusters?! Sure, it might take a while, but you never said you were out of hypergolic fuel, and it\u0027s certainly a better option than a suicide attempt!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than those itty nitpicks (and a few others not worth listing), i think it was an amazing showcase of our proudest projects we, as a species, have made in space, even if they did get torn to pieces. I still maintain that the producers are making profit of the intellectual property of kerbals - they made an action movie about a normal Kerbal workday. Besides, we deorbit space stations for fun around here!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loknar","CreatedById":77750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T04:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DannySwish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DannySwish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust found this KSP trailer of Gravity: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/3utRZdCJ9iQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/3utRZdCJ9iQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in this forum is now obligated under inter-galactic law to watch this video...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T12:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do you guys use the actor names instead of the character names?
