By this I mean to exclude space-based solar power systems for terrestrial consumption, as there is no serious planning for a system that, while technically possible, reeks of sci-fi (besides, it has its own thread). I kind of expect this thread to fork between residential/commercial discussions and an idea I just came up with using giga-scale deployment. So while this thread is meant to be focused on solar power, I realize that the tendrils may wander astray and that is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am curious to hear the experiences of anyone here who has or had a residential solar power system. I live in a townhouse complex,\u00A0 so going solar here is not really an option. but it intrigues me. My only experience with solar aside from fence-post lights is the recently installed 100W panel on our RV, which hasn\u0027t really been put to the test aside from keeping the batteries topped up. I know it\u0027s not really enough, but it\u0027s a start (the charge controller was the main thing to get), and hopefully we\u0027ll try going off-grid this year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to shake my head at the lack of thought that went into this complex: our unit has three large windows facing SW onto our small \u0022yard\u0022, which is mostly concrete tiles. So it absolutely bakes in the summer\u00A0afternoon sun, meaning we need AC. And where is the condenser? Out in that same yard, baking in the Sun. That can\u0027t be good for efficiency.\u00A0 During the recent heat waves, the AC unsurprisingly could not keep up. We finally just picked up a ten-by-twelve awning to shield some windows; it\u0027s not installed yet but\u00A0hopefully it will help. Sure, a tree could help; but the one we planted two years ago and was promising shade this year failed to survive\u00A0our unusually cold snap last winter. And then there\u0027s the dead leaf clean-up.\u00A0But what we really need is a louvered patio cover to keep more sun out of our yard ($$$!). Then I start thinking of having photovoltaics on the louvers ($$$$$$!). I have no expectation of powering our whole unit, but if it could shave off our Step\u00A02 usage...\u00A0(BC Hydro does not use Time-of-Day billing because they promised not to when the smart meters were rammed down our throats. Instead we pay 9.41c/kWh\u00A0for the first 666kWh, then 14.1c/kWh after that). And that \u0022Step 2\u0022 usage sure spiked last month with the AC running nonstop. Unfortunately, the cost of wiring is pretty constant regardless of installation size, so it is not very economical for such a small install. Perhaps getting all five units on our strip done would provide some economy of scale, but getting the other units to buy in could be a non-starter. Still, just a louvered cover would be a big help, I think, to make the yard livable and AC more efficient. Even good exterior window coverings would help keep the heat out,\u00A0at least. Storm shutters are out of fashion since glass got stronger (I assume that\u0027s a reason), but maybe a version needs to come back, to keep the heat outside the building. Sure, we have blinds and curtains, but the heat is already inside at that point. Perhaps exterior blinds with a material \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/new-mirror-fabric-can-cool-wearers-nearly-5-c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike this...\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0When I cogitate on it, I realize that efficiency and renewable planning is next to non-existent here, even as Vancouver likes to tout some of its \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.usgbc.org/help/what-leed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELEED\u003C/a\u003E-certified\u00A0high-efficiency buildings.\u00A0Chilliwack has been booming lately, with multiple new large residential developments going up simultaneously (I dread traffic in a few years; it\u0027s already bad and planned road upgrades will probably not be enough). But no thought towards potential future solar upgrades, efficiency, etc. I dislike the recent architectural styles with peaks going every which way; it smells of inflated roofing cost in an overheated housing market to me. And it\u0027s certainly not conducive to solar, which I admit only recently became barely competitive. Which is another thing in BC; there are no grants for solar, probably because we will have globs of power from the in-troubled-progress Site C dam project. The BC Hydro site pays lip service to solar; saying panels last 25 years and would take 20 years to pay for itself (in other words, not encouraging while not actively discouraging). At the risk of cookie-cutter neighborhoods, IMO developments should run east-west, with plain south-sloped roofs suitable for solar collectors (thermal? PV? whatever!) and rainwater collection (rainwater cisterns for irrigation use should be a standard thing!). Then HVAC can be situated on the shady, cooler northern side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose our latitude makes PV\u00A0less useful, but I think if there\u0027s enough sun to farm there should be enough for PV. Which brings me to a concept which recently occurred to me: fighting polar warming* with PV. I\u0027m talking massive deployment of PV units. The first step, of course, would be a massive expansion of PV panel manufacturing, preferably on highly-automated production lines. These would be deployed across ice fields and\u00A0especially polar seas everywhere (yes, PV buoys), with the objective of shading as much polar surface as possible; to prevent warming of permafrost and sun-absorbing polar waters and encouraging reflective polar ice. The low elevation of the Sun at these latitudes means a panel can shade a few times its own surface area. These units would need to be able to track through the endless polar days, and be cabled together and to nearby settlements as much as practical. Using batteries to store such a glut of power would be uneconomical; it should be\u00A0much easier to store and transport large amounts of energy\u00A0in the form of hydrogen. Centralized electrolyzers\u00A0 would fill tanks for collection and transport to wherever needed (a new polar profession: hydrogen harvester, probably automated before it even becomes a thing); when more storage is needed, just add more tanks. Fuel cells and hydrogen-powered ICE generators would provide heat and power through the long\u00A0polar winter nights. Panels would enter a winter mode as polar night sets in, using reserved power coming back through the cables from the electrolyzer plants to re-activate (melting itself free of ice and reorienting) when the sun finally rises again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* - While most concern is focused on the Arctic, there\u0027s no reason this wouldn\u0027t work in the Antarctic as well. For those not aware; the Arctic region is of great concern because melting permafrost releases lots of methane, a much more potent GHG than CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E. Also, as the reflective sea ice recedes, it opens more sun-absorbing water\u00A0which speeds the warming and melting of yet more ice. And freshwater melt from the Greenland ice sheets can float where the Gulf Current should sink, stalling the current that keeps northern Europe temperate. So yeah, I think shading the Arctic could be a big step in fighting global climate change. And generating power at the same time is a bonus, especially for a region that finds itself mostly limited to diesel generators or extremely long, vulnerable transmission lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, discuss! I\u0027d really like to hear about other\u0027s solar experiences, and any feedback on my polar shading concept is welcome, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-03T00:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2021 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enot enough proofreading\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stormpilot","CreatedById":195836,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-02T23:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a Chilliwack person (I don\u2019t know would I go as a Chilliwackian?)

Prices have actually dropped significantly, and longevity of panels improved. Insolation, of course, is still a huge factor, but there is no part of US where solar isn\u0027t drastically cheaper than grid prices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is, until you start looking at energy storage. If your power company gives you a good rate on pushing power to the grid, you should get solar. Sell electricity to the power company during the day, buy at night.\u00A0If you live in a place with very expensive electricity (E.g., parts of California,) definitely get solar - cost of lithium battery installation AND the solar panels with labor is going to be lower than what you are paying for electricity. But in most of US, if you install panels and batteries, you\u0027ll be paying more than your electric bill. Now, that might still make sense. You aren\u0027t at risk of power outages, you are protected against electricity price hikes if new regulations come in, you might still be getting good use out of the system after you\u0027re done paying it off, and you get to feel good about helping the environment. But not everyone\u0027s going to be able to afford to think this way. In fact, most people won\u0027t. And this gets even worse for renters. I can easily throw a couple of Tessla batteries in my garage, put up solar panels on the roof, and pay the same money I pay to electric company to the bank instead. A few days of construction noise, and I\u0027ve done my part for the planet. But if you want to provide solar for an apartment complex, well, that\u0027s an adventure. Roof to living area ratio is nowhere near that generous, and the power banks not only take up a lot of space but start to present real hazard that you probably aren\u0027t allowed to keep on the same property as the apartment complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the trend\u0027s in the right direction. In 2015, when that video was made, there were very few places where solar made financial sense for anybody. It was a self-imposed green tax. Now we\u0027re at a place where it\u0027s just a cheaper way to power your home for a lot of people. And a lot of progress has been made on making it work on industrial scale. The main problem being, again, storage, with a number of ambitious projects running all over the place using batteries, flywheels, hydroelectric storage, and even silly things, like compressed air underground. Some of it is promising and even operates as various pilot projects as part of the power grid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this stuff\u0027s happening. Just isn\u0027t clear if it\u0027s fast enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-28T14:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224025195\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630150597\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is definitely outdated. *snip* In 2015, when that video was made...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It was recorded in 2019; 2 years ago.
