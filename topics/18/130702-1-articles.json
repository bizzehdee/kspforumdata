I bought the Stealth version because people scared me with stories about the noise. In hindsight, I probably wanted the normal, more clicky version. The feedback of the Brown-ish keys is just not what I expected from a mechanical keyboard. Do not get me wrong, it does type very nicely, but not being able to feel the exact moment the key is actuated kind of goes against why I wanted a mechanical keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, some people cannot stand a clicky keyboard and love the Stealth version.

A rubber dome actuates at the bottom of the key movement - you have to hit the bottom or something close to it to type a letter. Browns have a (somewhat soggy) resistance early on, then after a slight bump resistance quickly fades away. That is also why you punch through relatively easy. It is akin to rubber dome, though the resistance is encountered at a different point (high for Browns versus low for rubber dome). Blues break resistance with a crisp click, which is the exact actuation point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will likely be testing a Razer Blackwidow with the Blue-ish keys, so I am curious how what works out in practice.
