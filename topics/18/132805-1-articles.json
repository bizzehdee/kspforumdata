Like many people here, sometimes I come across a mod or ship that I want to check out ingame. However, I can\u0027t play KSP on my iPhone (for now) and my laptop is not good for KSP, so I do all my KSP-ing on my desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ll cut to the chase. Using Dropbox from my laptop or phone, I put the files in, and they get downloaded to my desktop basically instantaneously (the desktop is on 24/7). I was wondering if I could somehow make a lightweight\u00A0script or some such that keeps an eye on two folders in my Dropbox folder on my computer, and if it sees anything, automatically move it over to the GameData or Ships folder. (I have very little programming experience.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any other ideas for how to accomplish this, just tell me-my solution is certainly a convoluted bit of work.
