I think you need to broaden your horizons as I actually attended a YouTube livestream of a guy who was doing a live editing of his most recent Star Wars YTP not too long ago. They are still very much around, as to which specific thing their \u0022pooping\u0022 is subject to change. Memes, popular events and so on will come and go. Doesn\u0027t mean the whole genre dies with it, in fact, I think it\u0027s reached it\u0027s peak popularity now more than ever since I\u0027m hearing outside sources mentioning it more and more often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-03T18:34:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2016 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
