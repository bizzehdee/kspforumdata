Pfft), did anyone else really enjoy the sets and overall look of the movie? While I felt that the LM interior seemed a bit larger than it actually was, I was still impressed overall with how realistic it all looked. And with the style they applied to the scenes to make it resemble old Apollo footage was a really nice touch.\n\n And even the LK lander was pretty cool to look at, even if it made no sense for the Russians to be able to get to the Moon without the US noticing."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T01:01:20Z","Content":"I LOVED it.

I don\u0027t think your average horror fan would like it as much, but as someone with a weakness for Space Stuff, I really liked it. Great consistent and authentic apollo \u0022found footage\u0022 throughout, and it was cool to see the LK on the moon. I bet there was almost the same split between CG and physical effects as in Moon (2009).\n\niirc one of the trailers basically spoiled the film for me but I saw it anyway.\n\nI\u0027d rate it on-par with Europa Report, but they are quite different."},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:21:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I never said it was the only thing that bothered me about the film, just one of many points.

The difference is that although the internet claims people actually thought Blair Witch was real because there wasn\u0027t a \u0022internet\u0022 to help them distinguish reality from fantasy; the time for such a film has long past.\n\nOf course, the entertainment media (a.k.a. the News) is very corrupt these days. I think it would be conceivable that someone could \u0022gift\u0022 them a large sum of money to put some credibility behind one of those films.
