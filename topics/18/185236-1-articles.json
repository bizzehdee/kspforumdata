Like the previous movies of DreamWorks, Antz and Sharktale, the Bee Movie features a character that deviates with the norms of the society and lands in a conflict and again, saves the day. Along the story, there are unrealistic instances like a bee falling in love with a lady, bees carrying a huge airplane, etc. This makes the story entertaining but less interesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe look and feel of the movie gives the viewers an insects point of view with a mixture of the human world. The cinematography was undoubtedly good as well as the audio visual elements. It was a little short (90 minutes) and some scenes are forgettable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are moral lessons in the story that was expressed in the movie. In the community, even though we only play a minor role, if we do it good, it will make a difference. Everyone deserves to be treated equally with no discrimination. Tiny creatures also have the gift of life and they deserve to enjoy the short time that God has given them. We should not be a hindrance to other\u0027s enjoyment but we should support them. The world has a balanced system and everyone benefits to one another. If the system is altered or if one does not do their parts, the system would not work. There will be a disaster. Every creation, great or small, has dignity and each one of them deserves respect and love...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-08T20:25:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2019 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T06:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter reading wiki about the bees and their hive life cycle, the life will never stay same.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease, make me unread this thriller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-09T06:06:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2019 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T21:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe movie is forgettable, and if it wasn\u0027t for it being a meme i would have likely had zero memory of existance at all.
