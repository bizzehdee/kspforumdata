I was in the kitchen, making coffee, and NASA TV was on the computer in the other room. \u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything was quiet, when suddenly I thought I heard the music from \u0022Build, Fly, Dream\u0022...\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn NASA TV???\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I turned on the coffee maker and hurried back to the computer... and it was an advertisement for Boeing! Exactly in the style of \u0022Build, Fly, Dream\u0022... even the music, while not the same, was almost a perfect mimic! \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis ad was either a blatant copy... or a beautifully subtle shout-out to KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMakes me wonder if someone in the Boeing Ad department plays KSP.... lol.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T18:55:19Z","Content":"\nDoes anyone have a link to it?
