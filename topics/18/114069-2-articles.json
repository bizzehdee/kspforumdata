That could help a lot in trying to target locations to hold a series of conventions, or simultaneous conventions (live feed video conference between them all - that would be fun). How about hitting up the educational angle of KSP and looking to schools or college campuses for event hosting?\n\nChoosing a school or college campus would be a great angle to approach this at (and kenbobo\u0027s university suggestion is a good one). It may cost less money overall to just attend an existing convention, though. Does anyone know how much it would cost to rent out a few buildings at any given university for a weekend?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What about having regional conventions?\n\nHaving multiple regional conventions wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea at all (in fact, it would be nice to organize some of these meetups in the future). That being said, it would definitely be quite cool if there was a single convention that was considerably larger than all of the others.\n\nIf there was a larger convention, hundreds of KSP players from around the world could meet and greet in a single building. We could organize dedicated panels for craft construction and the like, recruiting only the best of KSP players. The chances of KSP celebrities dropping by to visit would increase exponentially. We could even get a little bit of media attention, if we coordinated our efforts well enough. So having one larger-scale \u0022Kerbal-Kon\u0022 would benefit pretty much everyone involved.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the original post, by the way. Of the conventions suggested, I\u0027m really liking the one in Oregon... though there may well be better conventions out there. It sounds as if a lot of notable KSP players are on the East Coast... are there any appropriate conventions there?\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T18:20:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T18:20:42Z","Content":"Yeah, I knew the conventions I listed for Vancouver weren\u0027t a good fit for KSP, but those were the only ones here that were remotely like KSP.

I\u0027m well aware that many people wouldn\u0027t be able to come, so if at all possible, it would be nice to livestream the panels and major events. Perhaps (as was *almost* the case at Denver Comic Con 2015, which I went to\\*) there could also be streams featuring small groups of KSP players building and flying craft together.\n\n\\*A big source of inspiration for this idea was the KSP booth at DCC 2015, where I spent many happy hours with DasValdez. I built a pretty VTOL and we flew around some planes and rockets. He was going to livestream the event, but sadly there was no internet in the games room... otherwise, I would have had five minutes of Internet fame.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T19:22:16Z","Content":"South-East coast USA please. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027d love to go.

I\u0027ve put a link to it in the original post.\n\nFrom the limited data gathered so far, it seems as if a lot of people want to attend a convention on the West Coast... which is another vote in favor of the Spokane convention. Unfortunately, tickets aren\u0027t being sold for this convention, which means that either the convention is sold out or cancelled... or maybe just that ticket sales haven\u0027t started yet. I\u0027m not sure. Regardless, we may need to find some more locations.

(No worries about wrecking my train of thought; I want this convention to be the best it can possibly be if it happens, and your points are valid.)\n\nI will, however, counter with the following statements: \n\na) most of the organizing would fall on the shoulders of the regional convention managers, who often have volunteered their time and energy to make the convention a success. If we simply use an existing convention as a way to get together, individual community members really don\u0027t have all that much to do to make this plan a success, do they? I\u0027m wondering what I\u0027m \u0027vastly underestimating the time needed to organize,\u0027 perhaps you can clarify this a bit ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) pretty much all conventions strive for increased traffic, as this leads to more money for the convention, the vendors, and the local community. Perhaps convention staff would not approve of our presence if the population of the convention doubled, but they probably wouldn\u0027t mind selling several hundred extra tickets if they could do so without overwhelming the con (kon?).\n\nOh, and do you really think that thousands of people may attend? I had tentatively decided that the KSP population of such an event would be, at most, about 500. Five hundred extra people wouldn\u0027t be too much for a medium-sized convention to accomodate, as far as I know. I just pulled the number 500 out of a metaphorical hat, though, and I\u0027m not sure how many people would actually end up attending.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I stand by my earlier suggestion - a SQUAD approved convention at a gaming or aerospace meeting would be best (hence my suggestion of FlightSimCon for next year).\n\nI would love for this to happen too, though it seems as if SQUAD is rather reluctant to arrange a major space at a convention themselves. You\u0027re likely in a better position than me to ask whether they would be willing to arrange a major event at FlightSimCon or elsewhere; it might be worth asking about.\n\nI did PM KasperVld to ask whether creating this sort of thing would be okay, though he hasn\u0027t replied yet... perhaps he\u0027ll offer some other ideas as well.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:02:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could always fly over to the UK and come to my house to host the convention.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nMust be a mansion.\n\nAlso, who voted for the southern statss (How can you peoppe understand the 95% of southernors who have the accent?!), and who voted for antartica?"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:51:47Z","Content":"Ya know, we could totally do a group thing to watch the Martian next year around the Holidays.
