I\u0027m not completely sure what I think of it, but it looks phenomenal. Feels like a very sandboxy game in the spirit of Star Trek. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first glance of the footage, I was grabbed. The imagery is absolutely stunning, and you can pilot your craft from the bridge (which has a full crew) or in third-person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploration is your primary objective (you\u0027re humanity\u0027s last hope to find them a new home), but all the elements of a 4X strategy game appear to exist in some form. Combat, resources, upgrades, diplomacy, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only grip I have is the combat system, which looks like it mimics the classic turn-based style of the old RPG\u0027s. This isn\u0027t really because I have a problem with that combat style, but judging by the graphics, it feels like a missed opportunity. The battles would rival any Hollywood blockbuster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T07:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFancy graphic, but it plays awkwardly otherwise for me.
