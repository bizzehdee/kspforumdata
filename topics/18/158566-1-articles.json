millimeter accuracy is not neccisary if you are printing a house for example (its being done). at the small scale it seems jumping from a hobby machine (mine only has a 160 cubic inch build volume), to something bigger is about a thousand bucks. its sort of like computer monitors, size is expensive, resolution is expensive, both are really expensive. increases in slop as the printer gets bigger necessitates closed loop control instead of the discreet stepping that desktop scale printers can get away with. even going as far as camera based systems or even radio beacons precisely positioned by a surveyor for the machine to use as reference points. its only a matter of time till some lunatic puts a hot end on a quad copter and creates an infinite volume 3d

Inverse square sounds a little weird, considering that it gets less as you go away. Or are you actually talking about the cost to upgrade from n to n\u002B1? Still, that\u0027s -1/x, which, while it does increase, is asymptotic. Maybe x^2? Cost scales by surface area? Could be. Machining larger parts requires larger equipment, and we\u0027re right back where we started if we try to find how that scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mimiguy2","CreatedById":180708,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T19:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy was it closed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-18T19:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223150904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158566\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502999574\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180708\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mimiguy2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, mimiguy2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy was it closed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://eucl3d.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://eucl3d.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe... were not able to develop our internal technology to a point that made our custom product sales cost effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mimiguy2","CreatedById":180708,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T01:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223151745\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158566\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503083891\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klesh\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, klesh said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://eucl3d.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://eucl3d.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
