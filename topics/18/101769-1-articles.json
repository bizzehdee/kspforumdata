I was fiddling around with the installation of Linux and a dual-boot system, when I realized the dual-boot could only boot Linux, and that I had to set the BIOS to start up the Windows booting system.\n\nIt felt too complicate to me, so I decided to keep using Windows and crush the partition dedicated to Linux (using EaseUS), which I crushed without difficulties, and fused with C:\n\nSince I had another rogue install of Linux on my secondary HDD (F:), I reformatted the J: (old Linux) drive into NTFS, to allow F: and J:, which are on the same drive, to fuse together.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn\u0027t do backups, and was really scared of what might happened, since all my movies, games, and other extremely unique and important data were stocked on F:\n\nThe fusion failed, but by pure surprise, EaseUS temporarily resized J: to fit exacly what was on F:, and copied it\u0027s content over J: (with 4 KB of free space left).\n\nI immediately backed up all this into my tertiary hard drive, which is in a perfecly safe situation.\n\nSorry if I wasted your time with this little story, but this is an occasion to remind everyone :\n\n***Do you backups***\n\n(feel free to drop a comment)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T11:01:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MegaUZI**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T02:41:51Z","Content":"you backup when things are working fine. you most certainly back up before you start fiddling around with your partitions."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T06:00:24Z","Content":"Keeping all goodies on an external (USB) drives usually is nice for their safety. \n\nAs the specialized external drives can be too expensive and bulky, a combination of USB HDD dock station and \u0022usual\u0022 HDDs works fine for me for several years. \n\nInternal HDD for system and operative data \u002B two USB dock stations and several 2..4-TB HDDs on a book shelf."}]}
