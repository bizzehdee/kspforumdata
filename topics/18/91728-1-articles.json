KSP has the balance of spaceplanes completely off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are missing a lot of things to make an SSTO spaceplane, but the biggest roadblock is weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA conventional rocket is basically engines\u002Bpropellant\u002Btankage\u002Bpayload. The payload fraction is about 0.5% of the takeoff mass of the rocket, which is achieved by throwing away empty tankage along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spaceplane is engines\u002Bpropellant\u002Btankage\u002Bwings\u002Blanding gear\u002Bheatshield\u002Bhydraulics\u002Bpayload. That extra stuff that you are carrying all the way to orbit and back is much heavier than a 0.5% payload fraction, meaning that you won\u0027t reach orbit with any significant payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour particular proposal involves carrying (at least) two sets of engines, which means even more mass. Those jet engines are also going to have to survive hypersonic re-entry, which requires some sort of shielding or fold-away contraption, making it more complex and heavy. Even if those jet engines take you Mach 5, that\u0027s still only 20% of the acceleration you need to reach orbital speed (which is ~27000 km/h).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 tricks to make an actual reusable SSTO spaceplane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Carry less propellant by making the engines more efficient. This is hard, because the same engine has to propel the vehicle from subsonic to hypersonic, both in and out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make the airframe lighter. For example, using a lifting bodies is a way to combine tankage with \u0022wings\u0022, but there are physical limits to how light the airframe can be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Find a business model that makes a reusable spaceplane viable. This is probably the hardest bit because there is no market to absorb the high flight rate that a reusable SSTO is designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-01T17:00:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2014 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we miss a planet with 2.6 km/s orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother big problem is aerodynamics - the atmosphere is like pea soup\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother big problem is aerodynamics - the atmosphere is like pea soup\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Souposphere\u0022, not atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually like the current atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easier to get to orbit with either a rocket or a spaceplane with the FAR addon, just saying \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough preventing your plane from flipping out on the way up, and slowing it on the way down?

It is suppose to be cheaper, but it will rarely turn out that way..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle was originally purposed to cost in the mid $50 million per launch (you can check this out in NASAs archives btw, I did a paper about this recently for a class), but instead cost between $300 - $600 million per launch. That price range will also send a mission to the moon (probe or rover style mission if I remember correctly?), which is of course something that the shuttle could not do..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an American, I feel like the shuttle program was a failure. It was costly, could not meet its launch quota (org proposed 24 a year - best was in 80s @ 11), could not carry as much weight as planned (although I thought is was descent), could not take us beyond LEO limiting what we could accomplish. Then there were those tiles.. I DO NOT, feel like it is NASAs fault though. Congress approved the program as the budget for NASA was falling through the floor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a re-useable CM might be worth it without the additional weight of those extra flight systems and would probably be far cheaper to maintain. Don\u0027t get me wrong btw, the shuttle was a marvel (especially for the time). Which is why I think it captures peoples imagination, but imagine if we had kept the Saturn V and only used it to go to LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T19:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI actually like the current atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove me some atmo-soup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T19:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, there\u0027s nothing stopping us from developing a spaceplane, there\u0027s nothing missing.

I suppose you could shrink it\u0027s airframe if you converted it to use kerosene (less efficient, but a lot more dense, which would mean less heatshielding and structure), cut down on the payload and used a kerosene-burning SABRE.
