Not remotely practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter is to put the lasers on the Moon and aim them at Earth. Again based on the xkcd work, a rough guess is that will need a gigawatt or so. That guess can be checked; a gigawatt of green light all aimed at Earth would give about 5000 microlux, and that\u0027s about a thousand times brighter than a magnitude 0 star. So if you arranged the lasers on the Moon into a pattern the ones on the lunar night side at least would be easily visible. While a gigawatt is a lot of power, especially since you probably need more like 20 GW electricity to make 1 GW of laser light, it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E plausible. Probably about 40 nuclear reactors would do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould bulldozers and/or paint be easier? Well the smallest features on the Moon visible to the naked eye are a few hundred km across. That\u0027s a *lot* of area to smooth or paint, even if you only need to do it partially. My intuition is that the lasers would actually be less work - yes it requires arranging laser facilities and power generation, and perhaps building long transmission lines (unless you do one power plant per laser), but compared to painting an area the size of a good-sized country it\u0027s not so much. If the Moon ever gets extensively colonised, the colony resources could be naturally piggybacked on by a Moon laser advertising project too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatttheCzar","CreatedById":135304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T21:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hqdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPdvHgXC8do/hqdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
