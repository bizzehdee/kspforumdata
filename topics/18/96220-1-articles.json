You control a unique car that allows you to boost, jump, rotate, and even fly through a chaotic and twisted city. The world has a mysterious history, and as you explore you\u0027ll be able to uncover pieces of its past. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe roads are treacherous and unpredictable with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, you\u0027ll be trying to survive to the end in the quickest time. Since your car has several abilities, it allows you to not only drive fast on the track but also upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. You\u0027ll be able to take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is a spiritual successor to the multi-award winning game Nitronic Rush, created by ourselves and 8 others while attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. It was widely praised for its innovative mechanics, visual style, audio design, and atmosphere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGet it HERE:\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://survivethedistance.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://survivethedistance.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrailer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/57AFXGzrhrs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else tried this? I bought it a couple days ago (It\u0027s $20/20\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC/\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A315 on Steam). I\u0027ve played it for 5 hours now and I gotta say, it\u0027s one of the most interesting racing games I\u0027ve played. \u003Cstrong\u003EI highly recommend buying this if you\u0027re a fan of Trackmania, Wip3out or other fast-paced racing games\u003C/strong\u003E. It looks very promising already, and it\u0027s only going to get better. It\u0027s a bit expensive at the moment, so you might want to keep an eye out for any sales if you\u0027re not willing to spend 20 bucks on an early access game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, some gameplay. This is my best run on \u0022Monolith\u0022, one of the most difficult official Sprint maps in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tsG_Ak_hh-A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T12:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
