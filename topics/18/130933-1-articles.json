became comfortable with navigation. did the beer run and racked up a couple bounties in the process. then i decided to go asteroid mining. this took forever and was tedius, especially because i could only refine one ore at a time. i had to watch plantum float by because i had 95% gold. i came back with gold, platnum, and silver. unfortunately i got my landing gear mixed up with my cargo eject and ejected the cargo in the station during landing. to add insult to injury they fined me for it. i had never ragequit a game so fast. i havent played since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

running away to be the most rewarding strategy.\u00A0 (You might be more hardcore than I however :D)\u00A0 Many PvPers will re-interdict you after fleeing.\u00A0 If so, simply either jump to another system, or drop back out of supercruise as soon as possible and boost for a while in case they scan your wake and follow.\u00A0 Hiding in normal space for a couple of minutes is a reasonable strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor PvE, the Kill Warrent Scanner is essential for maximising cash returns from combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Cobra Mk3 is the fastest ship ingame and will outrun most ships with ease.\u00A0 I would highly recommend it as a first ship upgrade.\u00A0 Not only is it the quintessential ship as far as Elite lore goes, but it\u0027s also an excellent multipurpose ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Asp Explorer and Imperial Clipper are two other ships I highly favour (although you will need a few ranks with the Empire to get access to the latter.)\u00A0 In fact these two are my day-to-day workhorses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploring:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet the Advanced Discovery and Detailed Surface Scanners asap.\u00A0 You can make non-trivial amounts of money scanning systems as you go about your daily business quite easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are looking to go exploring proper and get your name on some objects (and get the cash bonus for being the first to discover thigs) go above or below the galactic plane before heading towards any interesting-looking nebula.\u00A0 Many of the direct routes will tend to have been heavily travelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining is fairly meh in my opinion.\u00A0 You are going to want to use prospector and collection limpets if you want to make any serious cash in a reasonable timeframe, and really try to focus on collecting painite and the like which are often sought on the bulletin board.\u00A0 Try to find pristine metallic rings for best results, and avoid RES sites, unless you want to spice up your mining with combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet a fuel scoop.\u00A0 You will need it at some point.\u00A0 Remember you can only scoop from KGBFOAM class stars.\u00A0 The fuel rats are a player group that can help you if you ignore this bit of advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT FLY SOMETHING YOU

the community goals thread on the forums.\u00A0 Can be good money for relatively little work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no shame in dropping into solo play at times.\u00A0 Well, there is, but only you will know ;D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver 1200 hours ingame, and about 25 years playing games in
