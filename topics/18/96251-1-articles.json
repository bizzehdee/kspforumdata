But there\u0027s hope...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELatest Tweets from Elon Musk:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7hrs ago: \u0022Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7hrs ago: \u0022Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7hrs ago: \u0022Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7hrs ago: \u0022Didn\u0027t get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8mins ago: \u0022Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6mins ago: \u0022Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6mins ago: \u0022Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like they\u0027re getting it nailed down. Not to shabby to hit a target 300km downrange from the launchsite after slowing down from hypesonic speeds. Must not have landed too hard if some deck equipment is all that was damaged.
