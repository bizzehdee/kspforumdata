I like the scale of things, and the overall feel and look of it. The foundation is solid. I have literally no idea what the overall plan is, given I just downloaded, ran, screenshotted, and posted here, but I got some ideas with where you can take this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this could be a kinda neat space / economy simulator. Start out on the terran planet. Start a business launching probes and satellites. Build factories and distribution centers on the other planetoids. Design and build transport craft to deliver goods. Expand between star systems. AI can handle most, player can do some flying of their own as they please. The frequent small problem and occasional god awful disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the way you\u0027ll want to go as far as star system design would be procedural generation. By simplifying things you could greatly expand the complexity of it all. Imagine having a small commercial empire, several systems across. But, oh no! A competitor approaches! Suddenly you\u0027re competing against other species and are suddenly subject to pan-galactic trade law and tariffs!
