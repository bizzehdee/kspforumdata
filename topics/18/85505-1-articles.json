My rough idea is for him to hit the main rocket body with a sniper rifle, piercing the fuel tank from a mile away. Since he does this at the very end of the countdown/as it launches, the fuel leaking out is ignited by the main engine. and the whole thing ka-booms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehow would that work in real life?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(hope this doesn\u0027t break any rules, i did re-read them)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T02:47:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t. After ignition the fuel would be forced off of the side of the rocket faster than it could burn, on account of the whole \u0027moving rocket\u0027 thing. Major technical issues would add to the Splinter Cell feel though; I see you\u0027ve already got the ludicrous propagandist story down pat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T03:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eid try to hit the gimbal hydraulics. that would lead to some major control problems. that would likely be hidden behind fairings so you would need prior intel about the rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T18:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo they really need to be sabotaged to fail spectacularly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore seriously, how thick is your average fairing?
