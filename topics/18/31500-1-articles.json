The mission director has announced that there is a possibility of periodic flights every now and then, with a possibility of normal operations continuing in August this year. Nearby residents are advised to stay clear of Kerbal Space Centre due to irresponsible kerbonauts strapping seats to rockets. The KSC observatory will function as normal, however the museum will be closed to the public till further notice as we deal with stolen boosters and debris falling from the skies. Please stay at least 50 kilometers away from the KSC\u0027s perimeter to prevent civilian casualties.
