Ubisoft screwed with my whole schedule here. Watch dogs would be launch game, then AC4 and Killzone for christmas, then infamous in the spring. Now im either going to get ac4 or killzone at launch, then the one i didnt get for christmas. And I have no idea whats going to happen in the spring, I wont have enough money. Thanks Ubisoft for ruining my foreseeable gaming future, i\u0027m not nearly as excited for AC4 or Killzone as I was for Watch Dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jnrdingo","CreatedById":15763,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T03:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I\u0027m probably not getting a next gen console anyway. If I was to get one, it would be the Xbone because of Forza. But at this stage, there arent many interesting games for me to play on them. I also don\u0027t see the point in complaining when/if a game will be released. Look at GTA V, that was delayed, and it came out spectacular(That being said, its not a 10/10 game, its a 9/10 game at best).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
