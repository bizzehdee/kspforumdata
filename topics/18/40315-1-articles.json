Friday can not come fast enough haha. I have been an off and on telescope enthusiast for years and I have always wanted a \u0022big\u0022 dob (big for my budget lol), I am finally getting one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a dobsonian? or a telescope in general? Care to share some pics of your scope, or your collection of eyepieces/filters? I will be sure to post a few, once mine arrives Friday.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sid","CreatedById":72855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T19:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot a Meade ETX-70, the computerised GOTO mounted thingy. I bought it cheap at an auction and the optics are pretty depressing to look through. I usually piggyback a digicam on it for simple astrophotography and never even look through the eyepiece. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso have a 125mm F\\10 refractor. I need to build a decent mount for it - I have dark skies where I live but it\u0027s often windy and the current mount can\u0027t cope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
