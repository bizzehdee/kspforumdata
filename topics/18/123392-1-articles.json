I am making modular moon and planetary body bases with Sr docking ports on top and bottom, each with it\u0027s own rover base to allow assembly once everything is landed. I can bring each module down from orbit one or two at a time with my LV-N space tug, and bring them back up again when I\u0027m ready to move the base to another planetary body. Due to the nature of the pieces being modular, and needing to be able to drive themselves, when all assembled (for space travel), its got a Massive part count, and it\u0027s very difficult to fly, takes a lot of the fun out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what settings can I use, (ideally listed by each setting option), to put the LEAST burden on my CPU? If I knew which settings will add load to my CPU, I could then play with the purely GPU intensive settings until I find a good load for my GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost thread\u0027s I\u0027ve seen in my quick search seemed to discuss how to lower any and all settings, and they all seem to mention that the GPU isn\u0027t usually the limiting factor, but I couldn\u0027t find a breakdown of which settings are dependant on the CPU, and which are dependant on the GPU.
