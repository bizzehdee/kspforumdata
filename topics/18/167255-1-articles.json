Anyways I have been trying to make dubstep with GarageBand on my ipad. But I have a problem, I can\u0027t make that bass wobble sound, which is the main part of dubstep. So if there are any suggestions that you guys have about dubstep production please tell the me. (Do not post vids, vids don\u0027t work where I live, also anything google)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
