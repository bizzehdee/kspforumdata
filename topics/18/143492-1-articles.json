Not as accurate as a proper sextant, but it\u0027s a lot less work to stick in your luggage when you go somewhere, just in case you end up on a deserted island\u00A0and need to find your way\u00A0home. You use it by holding it vertically so that the keychain ring hangs down, looking along the edge of the protractor at some reference point in the sky, then checking the angle made by the string and subtracting 90 from it. That gives you the height of the reference point in degrees, just like a sextant, so with this and a reasonably accurate clock you can tell where in the world you are with enough precision to make it back to the nearest continent or large island.

Use your ring and rope as a plummet to set the staff vertically.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdvice: the flattest place you can ever meet is a surface of water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNotice: it was indeed necessary to make it sharp and from scientific pov too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwait a sunny day, and scratching marks at the end of the stick shadow, mark the noon (the shortest shadow, the closest mark to the staff).\u003Cbr\u003E\n(If you are doing this staying in a water shallow, use expendable sticks, planting them into silt).\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow you have a meridian line.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKeeping your staff and the closest stick planted, get away from them keeping them aligned and put two more sticks to make your meridian line as long as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Every next noon keep adjusting their positions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwait the sunset and plant one more stick keeping aligned: the staff, the stick and the Sun (or another star you\u0027re orbiting).\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou get the sunset direction.

It\u0027s normal and even good.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne fine day you notice that this drift stopped and even reversed. So, you marked 4 solstice directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstall 4 remarkable poles to designate two solstice lines. Now you have 3 intersecting lines: meridian and two solstices.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour staff is planted in the intersection point and it is the reference point.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRename your staff into Pillar of Morning Star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a stick or so, put four marks in every solstice direction at the same distance from the staff.\u003Cbr\u003E\nConnect them and find the midpoints (measuring with a stick). You now get an equinox line (East-West direction).\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesignate this line too. Now you have a complete set of eight main directions: N, S, E, W, 4 solstices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the angle between these lines, study your latitude and make a sun-dial planting a stick tilted under this angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso split the quadrants each in twain (points NE,NW,SE,SW).

Don\u0027t be afraid: every year they first rise on the same day. It\u0027s the key.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you probably anyway don\u0027t know the star names, name them yourself. Better compose a simple story and name the stars after its characters.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you probably also can\u0027t distinguish the constellations, combine them by yourself. Say, Big Picachoo, Small Picachoo and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time when something important happens in nature, remark: how many days passed after the last bright star first rise.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeveral years later you\u0027ll steadily tell that turnip gives its first fruits 3 days after the Left Eye of Big Picachoo first rises in the morning light.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKeep doing these observations all years after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your own comfort, mark such directions too. So, you will know that the Left Eye of Big Picachoo will first rise over that rock of red stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPay attention: turnip on your island can grow up earlier or later (not 3, but, say 1 or 5 days after the Picachoo Day). It depends on weather, humidity, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, you should observe the planets: are they sharp or blurry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, if the Left Eye of Big Picachoo rising over the Red Rock looks at foggy Jupiter, you can easily say that turnip will grow up 2 days later than average, but will be more plenty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttach every significant agricultural or climatic event on your island to the closest astronomical mark and a bright star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will notice that:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The same star or constellation corresponds to several significant agricultural or climatic events. In brief, Big Picachoo rules turnip and autumn winds, while Small Picachoo helps him with winds and makes the underwater food sleep.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The same direction on your dial also corresponds to several significant agricultural or climatic events. I.e. Big Picachoo, figuratively speaking, brings both turnip and aubergines from behind the Red Rock.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdapt your mnemonic story to make it more smooth and dramatic. Let it tell how the Big Picachoo and his lesser companion brought the turnip from behind the Red Rock where they played with winds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the wooden sticks are nondurable, replace them with logs or even stones. If stones - don\u0027t forget to put heavy flat stones atop making triliths.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou will get your personal Woodhenge or Stonehenge where you can feel yourself as a fish in water, masterfully predicting the important events of your agricultural life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs different parts of your agricultural year have different durations, split the year to months according to what you are doing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSay, 45 days - a Month of Turnip Awaiting, next 16 days - a Month of Fishing and so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you don\u0027t need winter - don\u0027t split it into months, let it be just a Useless Part of a Year.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUse your bright stars events as the months markers. Say, Big Picachoo brings a Month of Turnip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter you accomplished this development, find a tribe, give them this knowledge and tell them that you must return to the Land of Druids, and they have the privilege to serve this purpose.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr just stay and become the Great Druid, if you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T19:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222685922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143492\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469128837\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0very big snip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I was just going to make a raft and find my way to the nearest continent, I still have to get to space you know.
