The politics about Syria is too complicated.

Those \u0022refugees\u0022 injured many of Turkish soldiers just because they didn\u0027t feel comfortable. They live in way better standarts then they did in Syria, and war time they cross borders and fight with Syrian army then come back and take rest in refugee camps not mentioning threatening Turkish citizens about bombing cities. We also found out that Al Nusra members stored Agent Orange in places they were living and those gas cans were immidiately seized by Turkish army. So things are a little bit confusing with Syria and probably none of us know much about what\u0027s going on because of the complicated politics about the area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T20:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMan, I was reading a blog from a photographer that lives there.
