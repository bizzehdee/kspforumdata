Starfields are... problematic.\n\u003E \n\u003E Lots of intermediate exposure lengths seem to have jitter, despite leaning the camera on objects, or setting it down with a 2 or 10 second exposure delay and then stepping aside. And of course, the sky glow can be nightmarish if there are thin clouds or lots of haze. Leaving the camera facing straight up when the plane of the milky way is overhead seems to be best. My biggest success would be:\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://farm1.staticflickr.com/463/19889501759_6c434baef3_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/463/19889501759_6c434baef3_k.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E That building in the way is shielding the camera from a waxing gibbous moon. I *think* this *barely* detected M13, M92, M56, and M29. If [Source Extractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) can deal with JPGs it might be interesting to see if it can find them? The image also split the AB-CD component of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B5 Lyr, but as I was at minimum zoom (f/2.8, 6.2 mm) to maximize light gathering, don\u0027t expect resolution beyond 1\u0027/pixel. At 51s, there are noticeable (12-13 pixel, I think) star trails. Given the amount of sky glow locally (Bortle class 8-9) I\u0027m not sure if a 5-30 minute exposure (for actual star trails) would be worthwhile.\n\u003E \n\u003E How about something brighter?\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VTBXY1DsZfNjwP5M1FLbZZCmNNJ-cGJX2RwklbwngAU=w483-h347-no](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VTBXY1DsZfNjwP5M1FLbZZCmNNJ-cGJX2RwklbwngAU=w483-h347-no)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z2d1x2HeiS7TN8fhtr83NQE6Jl1_h3aE31pB-_F11Zw=w165-h168-no](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z2d1x2HeiS7TN8fhtr83NQE6Jl1_h3aE31pB-_F11Zw=w165-h168-no)\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s certainly possible to get well exposed and in-focus images of the Moon, but with max zoom (f/4.9, 18.6 mm), the image scale appears to be ~20\u0022/pixel. This does not lead to an interesting amount of detail, and practically speaking makes Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn unresolvable. Also, the red bit in the lower right is as best I can tell a bad pixel. Avoidable provided I don\u0027t aim directly at anything.\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, let\u0027s just have the Moon as a background object for a structure? Make the very wide FOV/poor angular resolution a feature instead of a bug?\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/20091850745_65dc85b3ea_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/20091850745_65dc85b3ea_k.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://farm1.staticflickr.com/508/19903830720_6f662061ac_k.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/508/19903830720_6f662061ac_k.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The dynamic range just isn\u0027t there for both the Moon/lights and structure to be properly exposed. Now what? Only shoot during the day?\n\nThis guy used a phone pressed up to a telescope and got some really great pictures.

Not sure if the brightness gradient vignetting or varying sky brightness from the near-full moon.\n\n![19917516418_76b98934d9_o.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/549/19917516418_76b98934d9_o.jpg)\n\nWhat else is left? Set a neutral density filter on top of the lens to try to increase exposure time? Improvise an r-band filter and hope for a clear moonless night in November so I can attempt an SNR 3 detection of M31?\n\nedit: There was supposed to be a flickr link in an earlier post.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/39407198@N02/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/39407198@N02/)\n\nedit2: Googling around for super resolution options suggests that I\u0027d either need to code up something or buy photoshop.
