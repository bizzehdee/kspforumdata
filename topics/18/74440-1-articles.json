It\u0027s a space exploration game based around the mechanic that the solar system\u0027s sun is exploding in 20 minutes. When it does, the game resets. However, this is to the player\u0027s advantage, as many of the planets change over the 20 minute period, so this way you can see everything. The physics aren\u0027t very realistic, but it\u0027s a fun game regardless, and definitely one worth checking out (especially since it\u0027s free)! I\u0027ll be posting some of my screencaps soon, but feel free to talk about the game or ask questions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T00:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like a Ray Bradbury type of story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just downloaded it, this is blowing my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-08T00:59:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2014 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZedNova\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T19:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know about it,could sit with the explorers and just sit around,soaking up the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really captures that \u0022explorer\u0022 type of feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut alas I managed to break it and now the sun wont go nova even after 50 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
