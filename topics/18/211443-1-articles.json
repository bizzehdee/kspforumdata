I think under a more responsible creator she would have turned out peaceful...\u00A0 only harming if absolutely necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all the killing she did... she really did have good intentions... but with no boundaries, since her creator was too irresponsible and rushed for time to program that into her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-11T23:09:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2023 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
