The art style is much more cartoony, and while it has been transforming into something more realistic, total realism like those shots is not the intent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T16:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShades of \u003Cem\u003ECelestia\u003C/em\u003E.
