Popping a question here to ask all you with experience or have been there and done that: Here in the UK, how can I make a path into the space industry? My ideal career path (assuming I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get hooked by some other field at Uni) ends working in the space industry, either at ESA or any space agency contractor. Ideally I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love to end up working on missions like Rosetta, or if I\u0027m fortunate enough manned space programs. My issue is that here in the UK there doesn\u0027t seem to be much going for space (which may be a fortunate thing as I\u0027ve always wanted my career to take me abroad). Yes, the UK is a member of ESA but it doesn\u0027t seem to have much input, and so I\u0027m wondering how to try and push myself in the space direction.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor what it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worth, I\u0027ve probably played my cards as well as I can so far, because not only is the course well renowned, it also works unbelievably closely with industry (Boeing, Airbus and other great companies of that ilk) so if a good way is by getting a foot in the door and jumping over to space-related positions, the above is a good thing. But would any of you recommend trying to jump onto the continent? For example, do a bachelor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s or a master\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s here in the UK and then try and do a postgrad degree at a specific aerospace school that does space-based material in Europe (fluent in a few languages and love to travel, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t assume that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a burden), or maybe even across the pond in the States?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m also curious about the level of qualification needed/required for that kind of work. For positions at space agencies and their contractors, would it be worth doing a PhD assuming I could find something I was really interested in?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EReally I\u0027m just looking for any advice at all, do\u0027s and don\u0027ts, stuff about internships, whatever you\u0027ve got and think may be relevant. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love feedback from any and all, great to get some knowledge from those more experienced, anecdotes from those of you who\u0027ve got the t-shirt or have got two pennies to throw in is much appreciated, cheers guys.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove your guys\u0027 inputs as well if you have any.
