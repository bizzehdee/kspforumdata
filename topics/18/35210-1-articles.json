Made mostly by me, except a few assets from a buddy. Anyways, I am having trouble with a few things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Name: I a really can\u0027t find any sort of name that hasn\u0027t been taken yet, and I want it to be unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Advice: I intend for it to be a found footage style film, which I have no experience in whatsoever. Any advice from fellow moviemakers, would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Music: I really need to find some music which fits a lonely, dark, cold, and desolate atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I need to get all this done by the end of next week, as that is the window of time I have to finish it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~CosmicK3rbal\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
