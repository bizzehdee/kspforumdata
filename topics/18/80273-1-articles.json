You are free to express your opinion, but don\u0027t just go raging \u0022Apple sucks!\u0022 or \u0022Samsng is cr**\u0022, you have to provide at least 1 VALID ARGUMENT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am an Apple fan. Yes, I am wilting this post on my 4 year old iPad which is still going strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also currently have an iPhone 5s and an iPod touch, which was my first I-device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually really, I mean really hate Samsung and Google now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my reasons for sticking on the Apple side:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple makes both the hardware, and the software for the same device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes the software use the hardware much better. With Samsung, 2 separate companies make the hardware and the OS, and this results in some terrible things like screen stretch, incompatibility, lag etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple was always and is still considered cool and premium. The design is elite(made from actual metal) unlike the cheap plastic Android tablets you see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple was the pioneer. Apple created the first smartphone with a capacitive multitouch screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple created the pinch zoom. Apple created the auto brightness. Apple created the worlds smallest and most eas to use MP3 player. Apple made the first computer with a UI for gods sake! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple created the famous iPad. Apple created the best editing software and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did Samsng invent? Only a massive screen on phones thanks to which you need a separate bag to carry the phone. Also you need surgery to get longer fingers to reach eac part of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung is known for ripping off Apple. Most recent example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple makes the worlds first 64 bit smartphone, also with a fingerprint scanner. A few months later, Smasung makes a smartphone with a fingerprint scanner too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, Samsung can\u0027t make smartphones, or tablets. They make good TV\u0027s and microwaves, but not tablets and smartphones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing on to Android...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EiOS is still the most easy to use mobile OS in the world. Even a grandma can learn to use itin a few hours!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EiOS gets the latest apps first. IOS has the largest app collection than any other store.iOS has a lot more exclusives. iOS has AirPlay-and eas to use streaming option. iOS has Siri-the closest thing you can get to an AI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we don\u0027t see man Samsng stores. Apple stores always look cool. You are cool if you work in one too. Admit it:they are just plain awesome-design, structure, layout, simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethisnis why I love Apple, they keep everything simple. They make everything look modern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAd they don\u0027t make fun of opponents unlike Samsng which made 2 ads where they laugh at iPhones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T17:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAndroid for phones, iOS for tablets.

The bloatware on the phone isn\u0027t to my taste, and the tablet has the same, and has also failed to get updates from Samsung so it\u0027s marooned on an old version of Android that leaves it looking pretty ropey compared to the Samsung-built Nexus machine that gets updates direct from Google.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung are an excellent hardware company, but their software isn\u0027t as sharp IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock Android from Google is excellent though, as are some of the ROMs like Cyanogenmod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple, meh.

Please, The first GUI with mouse interaction that Apple made was stolen from a little company that patented it, and Apple just ate them to gain the patent. (This is why Windows had to use double-click by the way, because the single click was patented by the company that lated was earned by Apple. Now that the patent is not actual, Windows can use single-click (this is an option in Win7 and 8 BTW, but isn\u0027t activated by default))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndroid is an open source project, owned by Google, so that a BIG point to me. I\u0027m not a Google fanboy (oh wait, maybe I am \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), but the fact that Android has support from Google services natively is a thing that I love, and the fact that it is open source is a thing that I love too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Android natively runs beautifully (I suggest you to test Nexus devices, these are the best to experience the power of Android), CyanogenMod is a project that makes it possible for some devices to run newer versions, or even modified Android versions (because open-source). It is absolutely NOT mandatory, it is just a plus that geeks like me love. For some reason Samsung didn\u0027t want to roll on the 4.4 KitKat version to the Galaxy S3 and S3 Mini, so that\u0027s why I put CM11 into it, to have KitKat, that is the best of all the Android versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout Android versions, too.

Why? Why would you make me pay 2 grands for a computer that can be only be used for basic gaming (Haha, Minecraft and KSP under 150 parts), when I can make a PC that can run Watch_Dogs in 1080p 60fps, for the same price ? Or have 2 laptops the same configuration for less than that? I guess I pay for the extremely slick design the remaining $1200 ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe phone, because we\u0027re on that. Never I\u0027ve seen an ad that brags about the specs of the phone (except for the Retina display, which didn\u0027t quite needed a proper name), but rather for the design, that \u0022it is cool to have an iPhone\u0022. I know for a fact that I never seen a Samsung phone with a smashed display (and mine survived 100\u002B falls screen first), but I\u0027ve seen several falls of iPhone and iPad that went all smashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s the only good thing I have to tell about Samsung itself. I probably hate as much Samsung as I hate Apple, but not for the same reasons. Primarily, they just ruin my Android experience with their TouchWIZ thing and all the Samsung thing that are bound and cannot be removed unless rooted. In fact, I removed everything Samsung related (well, except the phone itself, but only because I have it and it works for now). My next phone will probably be a Sony one. So this post is more on the iOS versus Android than Samsung / Apple post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndroid is more popular over the geeky communities, because of it\u0027s flexibility, and the fact that you can have total control over it. Once rooted (takes some things to do but it is easy enough and safe enough, but it wasn\u0027t made for \u0022basic\u0022 users in mind), you have absolutely total control over it, and it becomes even better (when you\u0027re a geek like I am ^^). iOS on the other hand, does not allow you to do things manually, there\u0027s always an \u0022Apple\u0022 something to \u0022help\u0022 you do it: iTunes is probably the best example. I never quite understood why the heel you need to go through proprietary software, convert to proprietary lossy format (when , if converted from MP3, makes the music even worse), when you could just open the SD card on the device and put your WAV, OGG or MP3 (or whatever) files directly in there. Maybe the default player will not support the formats, but VLC is here, and Poweramp, while not free, is the best of all the Android players out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, don\u0027t take me as an absolute Apple hater.
