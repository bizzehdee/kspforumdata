Really there was nearly nothing I could do apart from trying to destroy dupplicate uploads as they came back. We couldn\u0027t ban, we couldn\u0027t moderate, we couldn\u0027t restrict users, we couldn\u0027t message people, we couldn\u0027t control the content of spaceport. The software was buggy beyond thought, errors would pop up when there were none, causing bazilions of uploads, password resets would break down nearly half the time and it took hours and hours for N3X15 to fix them, the email link was broken, the page counts also were, if you weren\u0027t logged in you would get bad views of the statistics, ratings would behave however they wanted and some mods would spawn 1000\u002B ratings out of nowhere when they had received none, the download server would break every now and then rendering it impossible for anyone to download anything. Trust me, Spaceport was /terrible/. And I\u0027m far from saying Curse is better, but the simple idea that Spaceport was good is so wrong my brain hurts when trying to understand it. Curse is just a very different kind of \u0022bad\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, Spaceport was not salvageable. It needed to be dumped as soon as physically possible, and the 30th of May was far too late IMO, it should\u0027ve been done ages ago. Fixing Spaceport would have literaly meant rewriting it from ground up, because whoever did it clearly had no idea what he was doing and screwed up real bad, and in the end, you\u0027re far better off making a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T19:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fyre Flare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fyre Flare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpaceport IS FAAAAAAAR better than Curse.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy?
