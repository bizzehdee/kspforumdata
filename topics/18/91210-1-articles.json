It will be even better for you all since I have seen every one a few times before I put it in the wallpaper file. I feel it is a good mix of old spacecraft, including lots of great old concept drawings from the early days (generally framed in white boxes to make them look and fit nice), modern spacecraft, and future spacecraft, along with beautiful planets and moons of the solar system and other celestial bodies. Every image that I decided to include, I looked around to make sure I found the highest quality version, then resized and cropped to try and keep that quality as often best possible. I\u0027ll probably continue to add more as time goes by but this is a pretty good set so far. I\u0027ve tried to include some of everything here but let me know if you think I\u0027ve left something crucial out. Not too many rocket launches sadly, as they are almost always in the portrait orientation don\u0027t fit well horizontally on a screen without leaving big empty areas on the sides.
