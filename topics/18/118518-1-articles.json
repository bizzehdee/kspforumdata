It\u0027s set 500\u002B years in the future, but qualifies as diamond-hard sci-fi. All the technologies in evidence seem feasible, and there are very detailed descriptions of everything. I was struck, when I read the Mars trilogy, by how much economies are driven by energy, they\u0027re energy at the root. In Aurora, I find a similar focus on the integrated nature of ecologies, of which Ship is one. Aurora is about biology, organisms, mass psychology, micro-politics/societies, human cognition, how narrative functions, short-time evolution, etc. The book is fascinating start to finish, has very accurate orbital dynamics, and has obviously been researched to the nines. I\u0027d love to see a KSP or Orbiter remake of a particular maneuver found late in the novel. Read it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
