most were short, disastrous, or meaningless (pick two).\u00A0way i figure it, women claim to want a lot of things from men, but present them with a man who can do all these things, and you will get a resounding meh. however there is one thing women cant resist, and that\u0027s something another woman has. dating for me came in waves. i once dated this party girl, a couple times. this did not go anywhere. however i got bombed by the flirtations of almost every one of her friends, all of which immediately ceased the second we broke up. there was a girl i dated before that, she was a bit more introverted. that relationship was both short and disastrous, despite the fact that we got along really well it ended tragically because of circumstances out of our control. anyway i ended up dating

have your back, for women the need to procreate, and taking care of children if you already have them. i haven\u0027t been 40 long enough to know what relationships look like at this point. im not really closed to the prospects of a relationship now, but im not going to pursue it it with the same fervor as when i was younger.\u00A0relationships aren\u0027t all they are cut out to be and ive had

things from men, but present them with a man who can do all these things, and you will get a resounding meh. however there is one thing women cant resist, and that\u0027s something another woman has. dating for me came in waves. i once dated this party girl, a couple times. this did not go anywhere. however i got bombed by the flirtations of almost every one of her friends, all of which immediately ceased the second we broke up. there was a girl i dated before that, she was a bit more introverted. that relationship was both short and disastrous, despite the fact that we got along really well it ended tragically because of circumstances out of our control. anyway i ended up dating her best friend and a couple of her other friends, except i didn\u0027t know this at the time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso i turned 40 last year and i have to say the motivations change as you get older. in your 20s hormones pretty much run the show (this was where most of my dating took place). when you get to your 30s things get pragmatic. shared expenses, income, having someone to have your back, for women the need to procreate, and taking care of children if you already have them. i haven\u0027t been 40 long enough to know what relationships look like at this point. im not really closed to the prospects of a relationship now, but im not going to pursue it it
