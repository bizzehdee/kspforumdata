He only cares about knowledge he needs at school and for studying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe will never learn anything extra. This whole \u0022idea\u0022 of his is based on what a fictional character(Sherlock) said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe calls whoever is a computer geek(like me) someone who doesn\u0027t have a life and that there are more important things than computers. Also, that programmers are useless and computers will never replace some basic things like handwriting. So he can\u0027t even launch the command prompt. When I excersize working with it he calls it completely useless and that I will never need to use the command prompt in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe hates games. He thinks those who play games are morons and, once again, \u0022waste their time\u0022. No matter what game it is, even if it is KSP, he still calls it a game and unless it is a simulator, there is no way (in his opinion) to learn ANYTHING from a game and games don\u0027t improve any mental skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe thinks he is superior over everyone only because he goes to the gym.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe is very impatient. If someone starts talking about something he doesn\u0027t want to hear, he\u0027ll just tell them to \u0022close their mouth\u0022. So yeah, he is very blunt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe based his opinion on \u0022Interstellar\u0022 having watched 10 minutes and walking out. Of course, he said the movie was crap having watched 10/169 minutes and called it crap because he read some random review.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe is very spoilt, but he doesn\u0027t admit it. He is also terrible with money. He has enough money to spend 10$ on coffee and a chicken wrap at an overpriced cafe, and thinks 40$ for an iPhone case is \u0022cheap\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe flew to Australia 2 years ago in FIRST CLASS and called it \u0022uncomfortable, the chairs where so big they weren\u0027t comfy\u0022. Heck, I flew to Australia this summer in economy class and I was fine with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe will never go to Mcdonalds or Subway. Ever. He thinks the meat there is made out of plastic, so during lunch it is impossible for me to go to either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe is totally unprepared for individual life and relies solely on his parents. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe can\u0027t cook anything, he thinks it is impossible to travel abroad without a travel agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe never flew anywhere by plane by himself and believes it is impossible for someone underage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote I flew by myself numerous times by plane, I even did a transit many times in Frankfurt, so flying has become easy for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess that is all I can think of for now. How do I show him that games aren\u0027t that bad? How do I prove that space exploration matters? How do I prove that knowing computers is beneficial? How do I ever prove anything to him? I don\u0027t have a very strong personality, but I want to learn to stand up for my opinions better(which is why i also joined a debating club).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, he calls me weird for liking to watch live rocket launches and NASA streams, or even gameplay commentaries(like Scott Manley\u0027s for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, he doesn\u0027t approve of me being an atheist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I never make fun of believers or call them \u0022mindless idiots\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, he thinks he is better than others because he learns French whereas I and a few others learn German.
