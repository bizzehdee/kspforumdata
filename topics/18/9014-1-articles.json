Mine landed without the chute opening, and made a small crater in the snow!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a club would be a good idea unless you have a lot of land to launch at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T04:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy brother used to have a model rocket. The only time I can really remember it launching it broke up into pieces on the way back down, and only the propeller (it had a propeller like thing near the top to slow it down instead of a chute) landed safely. I think we found all the parts though. I think that thing only ever went up a handful of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get to build these twice in school. The first one was using streamers instead of a chute because we we\\\u0027re told they we\\\u0027re more reliable. Mine didn\\\u0027t deploy and instead made a lovely nose first landing that shortened the styrofoam nose by an inch and added a jaunty angle. With a new cone, it would have been fine to fly again though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly one person in the whole class had anything resembling a controlled descent (using a chute), and I think they landed about 2km away in the woods. A couple streamers deployed as well, but I\\\u0027m not sure I\\\u0027d call that controlled. Just upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got to do it again a couple years later. I can\\\u0027t really remember what happened. I think it went up, deployed its chute and landed in the forrest. One of my classmates sabotaged his fins to make things more interesting for us. That one got up about 20 ft before going sideways and zooming around in the head height to 20ft range. Everyone ran for cover for that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd someone else sabotaged their thrust ring, and the engine migrated into the body shortly after takeoff. Their chute did NOT work after that, but there was a bit less rocket to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
