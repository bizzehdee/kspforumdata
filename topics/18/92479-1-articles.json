I\u0027ve got an idea for a Kerbal video, and I need to squish a couple hours of gameplay into a couple minutes. How could I go about doing this? Recording the entire time with vidcap software would probably need a huge chunk of space, gotta be a more efficient way. Is there maybe a mod or something that can take screenshots at regular intervals? I know not-quite-nothing about video creating but I wanna see if I have the patience to make something lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
