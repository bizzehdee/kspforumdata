I know different people are busy and have different schedule but honestly it\u0027s just impossible to put down. I have lended my copy to 4 people. All of them read it in a day or less. All of them are extremely busy people and motored through it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027ve had these discissions before on this forum and I respect your opinion. But that doesn\u0027t change the fact that those two movies are highly polarizing. Some people really like them while plenty of others immediately think of them when the tooic of movies that are visually stunning but otherwise flawed is raised. I am looking forward to hearing what others think about The Martian when it is released. Hopefully it manages to live up to our high expectations.\n\nYea the opinions of Gravity and Interstellar are very polarizing. The problem is a difference in people. There are essentially three types. People who love story, people who love visuals and then the most annoying people in my opinion. The people who are incapable of suspension reality for a science fiction movie. So what the movies were touted as scientifically accurate! Whoops Hollywood is trying sell a movie! Even beyond on that there are people who want any movie that is based space to be realistic. Those are the people who you just can\u0027t argue with. It\u0027s a movie and it\u0027s meant to be entertaining. Even Andy Weir who went through painstaking efforts to ensure that the Martian feels realistic admitted he had to take dramatic license with the science just to make it entertaining. Lack of scientific accuracy doesn\u0027t bother me as long as it\u0027s not too insane. It needs to have a good story and it needs to look good. What else do you need in a motion picture. Here is the truth Gravity was visually stunning and the space infrastructure was gorgeous. However you watch it once and you really can watch it again. It\u0027s just not that entertaining. In many ways it\u0027s boring. At this point I would love to watch it on mute with a great sound track. Or even the soundtrack from interstellar. Interstellar again looked fantastic and actually had a great and compelling story. I even think most people would agree 3/4 of the movie is fantastic. I think the end however no spoilers is what throws people off. Again no spoilers but the power of love is boring.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFirst sign of product placement!! Is this ok?

One more thing, is that they wouldn\u0027t have to do 3 separate launches, since the rocket also carried some supplies with the Rangers(seen between the Rangers. So yeah, much easier to launch 2 Rangers \u002B some additional supplies for the trip on 1 rocket.\n\nLastly it was for dramatic effect and to keep us bound within the realm of familiar technology. That launch was very accurate and beautiful. Still remember the seats shaking in the cinema from the sound.\n\nOne thing I don\u0027t understand about the Hermes in the film is why they made it so unnecessarily big and complex, and how did they actually build it(say, the artificial gravity ring).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Apparently by people unfamiliar with basic astrophysics or good plots.\n\u003E ObMartian: I\u0027m less pleased about the mountainous terrain, though I understand their rationale(s) for doing so (artistic).

But love alters spacetime, so it\u0027s got that accuracy going for it?\n\u003E \n\u003E The Martian was written as a script I think. It was made to be a movie from the start (good business plan by the writer).\n\nI\u0027m sorry, but you are hyperbolizing what you are saying DRASTICALLY by comparing Interstellar\u0027s physics to that of Star Wars.\n\nHave you ever seen Star Wars ships dock realistically, have an RCS system, not-turn like fighter jets?\n\nWhat is unique about Interstellar is the amount of research they did, especially in the field of relativity and warped space time.\n\nApparently you never read into it, and are basing your judgements of it\u0027s accuracy on your own biased assumptions. \n\nEither you are too narrow minded, or you simply didn\u0027t pay any attention to the movie whatsoever.\n\nFor Hollywood, it set a very high bar, because apparently you\u0027ve never seen any other Hollywood space movie attempt. There will always be the good trio- Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian. \n\nAnyway, apparently Apple is advertising THe Martian and space now too.\n\n~\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlYC8gDvutc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T17:49:19Z","Content":"This is a great great great new clip from the movie!! \n\n[http://news.moviefone.com/2015/09/10/kristen-wiig-donald-glover-the-martian-clip/](http://news.moviefone.com/2015/09/10/kristen-wiig-donald-glover-the-martian-clip/)"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T18:01:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is a great great great new clip from the movie!! \n\u003E [http://news.moviefone.com/2015/09/10/kristen-wiig-donald-glover-the-martian-clip/](http://news.moviefone.com/2015/09/10/kristen-wiig-donald-glover-the-martian-clip/)\n\nIt is funny how that article says they are using big words, but it sounds like just another week day on this forum.
