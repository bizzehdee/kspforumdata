I can safely say that model rocketry may be the closest real world equivalent to KSP, besides actually joining a bona fide aerospace company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some tips for your first rocketry launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Build a kit.\u003C/strong\u003E Building from scratch on your first rocket is generally not a good idea unless you know basic rocket physics. Be sure to assemble the kit as per instructions, too. You can make modifications later, once you have a bit of a better understanding of rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Start off kinda small.\u003C/strong\u003E If your first rocket is a five-foot-tall four-inch-diameter behemoth and you don\u0027t have any experience in rocket-building, things can go very wrong, very quickly. Having your first rocket shred and send little bits from horizon to horizon is not a good way to get into rocketry. (This has actually happened, although fortunately not to me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Find a big field.\u003C/strong\u003E Even with the small kits, you generally want a field that\u0027s at least 300x300 feet to account for parachute drift. With bigger rockets, the field should generally be larger. Once you start building the big stuff, you want to go a long ways into the countryside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4) Join a club.\u003C/strong\u003E This is the best piece of advice I can give. Model rocketry clubs are a great place to talk about building rockets, and they generally have very large fields to launch rockets. You will be able to make friends and learn a whole, whole lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5) If at first you don\u0027t succeed...\u003C/strong\u003E Try again!

Rocketry clubs exist in all ex socialist countries and you don\u0027t have to be a member. There are limits, however, regarding the height and the mass of the propellant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for making this clear!

So I will be ordering my first kit and some motors and other miscellaneous parts. However I doubt this will quench my rocketry hunger for very long so I am already drawing up somce designs of my own using off the shelf motors. Its annoying that I will have to get some certifications to use the bigger stuff as I prefer working with aluminium and I dont think a b or c will quite cut the mustard for an aluminium rocket so balsa it is for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way the sooner I can get a k into my rocket the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing thats an interesting concept. If it burns...you can make fuel out of it. Cant remember where i read it but stuff like pvc and N2O can be made into a fuel. Also, as I\u0027m not making an explosive I am allowed to use it so further down the line i can design my own motors \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E V3trox is very happy.
