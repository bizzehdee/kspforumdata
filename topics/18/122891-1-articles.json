So I speak from first-hand experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re moving to another country you will spend a staggering amount of money. Plane tickets, shipping fees, housing costs, it will add up quickly.

Go figure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting a job can be problematic. All this furor you see about illegal aliens getting work in the United States? We\u0027re pussycats compared to most other places. Your best bet is to have a job lined up before you get there. If you\u0027re going as a student they\u0027ll probably want to know how you plan on paying for your education while you\u0027re there (without having a job). I was lucky, because South Africa was experiencing the Brain Drain at the time, so they were desperate for tech people. I got a Work Seekers permit, which meant that I could come down for 90 days to look for a job, and if I found one it was automatically converted to a one-year work visa. (I\u0027ll bet Denmark isn\u0027t that desperate.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find a job, and stayed there for two years. I went through one of the hardest periods of my life (which isn\u0027t really relevant to the conversation), but I made a lot of great friends and had an amazing experience. But by the end of two years I was ready to go home. By the time I paid all my bills off and bought my tickets, I arrived home with two suitcases of clothes and some change in my pocket. If I hadn\u0027t had a friend who let me sleep on his couch for six months I probably would have wound up on the street. But, I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. It was worth every penny, tear, and drop of blood. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\u0027re young, single, and unattached and looking for a wonderful experience to broaden your mind and horizons, I highly recommend moving to another country for a couple of years. If you think it\u0027s going to make you rich, I think you\u0027re smoking dope. If you want to get ahead in life, learn a marketable skill and move somewhere in the US where that skill is in demand. (If you want to get rich, learn a trade in the petroleum industry and move to North Dakota, quick, before the boom collapses.) No matter which way you fall politically there\u0027s somewhere for you in the US. If you fall one way, move to California. If you fall the other, move to Texas. Moving to Scandinavia is going to create a lot more problems than it solves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T23:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you should be glad you live in the US.

Granted, I\u0027m not walking in your shoes, but I still think there is room here for everyone. If you\u0027re in aerospace, you can find a job in Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, all kinds of nice, clean, cosmopolitan places with high standards of living. But, if you are set on your course, here are some additional pointers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s going to be really expensive. Yeah, I said this before, but I can\u0027t emphasize it enough. You think it\u0027s going to be just pack a backpack, throw your laptop in a carry-on, and hop on the plane. Nope. You have a lot of stuff here that you need to take care of one way or another. It\u0027s more stuff than you think it is, trust me. You either need to sell it, donate it, chuck it, store it, or ship it. Some stuff you won\u0027t be able to part with. Storing it here, if you\u0027re never coming back, is not an option. Shipping it is silly expensive. You\u0027ll find yourself doing nonsensical things like looking at random household items like dishes and bed sheets and thinking, \u0022How much do those cost per kilogram?\u0022 When you get there, you have to find a place to live. Once you find that place to live, you will need to buy all kinds of stuff that looks just like the stuff you sold or threw away a few short weeks ago. This will seem ridiculous to you, but in reality you\u0027re doing it because it is cheaper than trying to ship it. Second-hand stores will become like a second home to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All the pointers for finding a job in the States apply to finding a job overseas, just doubly so. You have to come up with a compelling reason why they should hire you instead of someone from their own country. Most of the time there will be a legal definition of what constitutes a compelling reason. You need to figure out what skills they need, learn them, then market yourself as a person who can provide those skills. Depending on what their immigration laws are like, you may have to have a job offer in hand before you even apply for a visa. And you may think that it\u0027s easier to apply as a student, but a lot of places will require you to show a plan for payment for your entire course of education before they will issue a student visa. If you\u0027re having trouble making ends meet in Oregon, my guess is that you won\u0027t be able to pull that off. And getting a student visa doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll get residency when you\u0027re done. You still have to find a job and get a work visa afterwards. In South Africa they were desperate for technical workers to come there and stay there, and I was still amazed at the hoops I had to jump through. I can\u0027t imagine what they\u0027re like in a place like Denmark or Sweden. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you get there, don\u0027t do anything crazy. Don\u0027t go marching into the U.S. Embassy on day 2 and renounce your citizenship. Don\u0027t burn your passport. Keep your options open. After living in South Africa for just a couple of months I realized that I knew nothing about South Africa. Everything I had learned or heard about it was biased one way or another. Now, after having lived there for two years, I hear people back here in the States talk about South Africa and they all sound like morons. (And then they, people who have never even set foot on the African continent, will argue with me and try to tell me what things were really like while I was living down there. Amazing hubris. But I digress.) Anyway, all that to say that you may think that Denmark (or wherever you end up) is the place for you, but you may get there and discover that it isn\u0027t the place you thought it was. Don\u0027t burn your bridges until you\u0027re sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speaking of your passport: When you are overseas, keep your passport on your person at all times. Maintaining possession of your passport is second only to maintaining your oxygen habit. It is more important than your wallet. (In fact, don\u0027t keep it with your wallet, keep it somewhere safer where a pickpocket won\u0027t look for it, like your front pocket, or your sock.) If something goes down and you find yourself in trouble, that passport is your Get Out of Jail Free card. It spells the difference between the most powerful nation on Earth doing everything it can to help you, and you just being another face in the crowd begging for the last seat on the helicopter. And you don\u0027t know when something is going to go down. So keep it with you. Always. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I can think of right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SUJETO","CreatedById":112755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T15:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei live in south america, lived in other country...
