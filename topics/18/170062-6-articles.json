Just for reference, we use\u00A0ceiba plywood pretty much exclusively for our layout, including for this part. Your pine may differ slightly, but I wouldn\u0027t expect major differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have three spirals on the layout. When we started working on the first one, we started from the level that goes from 10 cm below floor and slowly climbs to about 60 cm above floor where the spiral starts. In order to achieve compactness, the idea we had was to use two sheets of 4 mm ply cut in segments and glued and stacked like bricks, so the finished product would be one single piece. We would place one sheet, spread the glue, place the other sheet over it with half of the second sheet overhanging so it connects with the next segment on the lower layer. The sheets were stapled together to hold them until the glue dries. Everything went well so we prepared a whole lot of plywood, cut them to size and stacked them in a corner so we can just take the next piece without needing to stop the work to cut some more. We made various jigs for the\u00A0table saw and jigsaw and prepared enough plywood for roughly entire spiral that goes from 60 cm to about 320 cm (some 25 turns, each about 4,5 m in circumference, double track).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, place a sheet, spread the glue, place another sheet, staple, repeat. Sounds simple enough and it was, while we were working on the floor level. The horror story\u00A0starts as soon we started to climb above the floor. No amount of staples, clamps and\u00A0supports we could throw at the thing managed to keep it together. It was bending at the joints\u00A0and delaminating all around. It was too flimsy and bending horribly. The glue wasn\u0027t drying nearly fast enough and staples didn\u0027t hold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we ripped it all apart, and went back to 10 mm plywood. The first two spirals were done with it, no major\u00A0issues any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward 3 years, we still have a whole bunch of 4 mm plywood\u00A0precut into perfectly nice 90 degree circle segments sitting in the storage and the next project to do is the third and final spiral. So, in order to save some money on material, we\u0027ll use that plywood, but this time we\u0027ll be smarter and glue up the pieces before trying to install them and not even entertain the idea of one continuous piece made by gluing pieces in brick like formation. We\u0027ll just use the 90 degree segments glued in pairs for combined 8 mm and connect them with iron plates (the method we used on previous two spirals, but with single 10 mm ply). We glued all that up, let it dry for a week or so and went to work. We finished the entire spiral, 11 turns, if I remember correctly, did all the wiring (about 100 feedback sensors, some 20 turnouts and power wires on each turn). Each layer ended up being an oval composed of four 90 degree turns (two adjacent on\u00A0each end), and one\u00A030-ish cm long straight segment\u00A0in the middle\u00A0on two long sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was not good. The plywood was still too flexible and flimsy. Even with metal bracing vertically connecting all the layers every 30-50 cm it was not rigid enough. We\u0027ve spent about half a year fixing and mending the damned thing, adding additional reinforcements, but the trains kept on derailing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we decided to fix it once and for all. We bought 15 or so sheets of 15 mm plywood and disassembled the entire thing. Me and one colleague were working on disassembling, keeping track of all the wires and track pieces (very important XD), while three others were taking the disassembled layers, tracing them on new plywood sheets and cutting them out. For added rigidity, we cut out entire one turn from a single sheet, with all the exterior branches we could fit on each sheet. Once the entire old spiral was out, we started putting in the new wood. 15 mm proved to be bendable enough, we had no problem with it not cooperating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took us about two weeks,\u00A0but it was probably the best thing we decided to do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the 4 mm plywood, the pieces that were used on the spiral went to trash, but we still have a pile of unused precut segments. It\u0027s been about 6 years since we cut them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still hate them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t use thin plywood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-20T21:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223300236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519160608\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t use thin plywood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used thin plywood in a previous layout.
