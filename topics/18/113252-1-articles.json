A lot of people have debts of 100 to 200k before becoming a pilot. If there were an easy way around this, everyone would do that, as you do not lightly take out loans that could buy you a house. Also be aware that the pilot market currently is pretty bad. A lot of people do not have a job and still have to pay their debts, causing very harsh and painful issues. It is no fun doing the same unskilled labour everyone does, but with a 100k debt plus interest looming over your head and eating away at your options. The hole sometimes only gets deeper because of the interest being more than your spare income. Some airlines take advantage by actually asking pilot to pay for flying, since they need to make hours to keep their licences valid.\n\nNot to rain on your parade, because I love flying myself and very much understand the urge to do so. It is only fair to warn you of the rather dire situation pilots currently are in. Things might change over the next 10 years and if you are really committed you could certainly give is a go, but it is also important to be realistic about what to expect and which dangers you might face.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T21:01:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"jmiki8","CreatedById":94688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:48:15Z","Content":"\u002B1 to Camacha.\n\nI study at the Transportation Engineering branch of the Budapest University of Technology, therefore I have a lot of friends who already got the PPL, CPL or even the ATPL.

You\u0027ll have registering/medical/basic expenses to pay first - Don\u0027t be shy to ask difficult questions, it\u0027s your money!!\n\n2) Only register at a school/uni that has a minimum of 3x aircraft of the same type, that you intend to qualify on.\n\n This is necessary as there will be maintenance/repairs and other down-times, which will only extend you flying program, costing you more money.\n\n Also flying is a practised art, if you don\u0027t keep up, you lose touch.. further extending your flying time before qualification.\n\n3) Don\u0027t do it in *dribs and drabs*. Do it in one go, for reasons mentioned above.\n\nNOW this is the most important advise, while gaining hours to COM:\n\nOnce you\u0027ve obtained your PPL (50 - 75 hours), you\u0027ll have to complete 200 hours for Commercial license.\n\n1) Do your Instrument Rating (~10hours)\n\n2) Do your Night Rating (~10 hours)\n\n3) Do 100hours (min) night flying PIC (Pilot In Command) = Flying by yourself at night on navigation trips - This is an ATPL requirement.\n\n4) Get ratings on a further 3 or 4 aircraft - all single engine light aircraft\n\n5) Get an instructors rating - Companies want to know you can teach other pilots\n\nThis will set you up for the commercial route.\n\nAs far as possible stick with the light aircraft to about 1000 hours, then converting to twins and turbo-props around that stage, onto 1500-2000 hours.\n\nI say this as your real flying experience is gained on these aircraft. Moving direct onto too big an aircraft too soon... you don\u0027t have that important experience.\n\nIf necessary, pop along to small aviation operations, Skydiving clubs, Emergency services.. etc.. and let them know you\u0027re available.\n\nVolunteer to do the dirty work (ramp rat) at these places.. be patient, an opportunity will arise, as people move around.\n\nDon\u0027t expect too much payment.. you\u0027re still gaining experience and more importantly, hours.\n\nAlso When you\u0027re flying these aircraft, safety is paramount, and you\u0027re are the boss.\n\nIf maintenance is shoddy and/or you\u0027re not happy with something - DO NOT TAKE OFF!! - resolve these issues on the ground first.\n\nIf you\u0027re lucky enough to get a direct route into a good job... as far as possible, still do the things I\u0027ve mentioned - experience just talks:cool:\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T16:06:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ColKlonk**\n  \n..must lean two spel.. :)"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T09:22:43Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies.
