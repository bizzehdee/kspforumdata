You have probably all heard the fact that I am acting weird on the forums. The mud pictures and posts. And, to be honest, I don\u0027t really like mud that much. I just wanted to transform for a bit from the star we all know to someone obsessed with mud. I really just wanted to see how it feels to act a bit like someone who likes mud. So, here\u0027s the second part: what\u0027s next for my account. I am still going to post in the forum games. But it\u0027ll be way less mud-themed and way more KSP-themed. More stuff will start happening in my life 3 weeks from Monday. This means I\u0027ll have less time to work on a KSP mod project for a quantum vacuum plasma thruster which I just started making. Before the year is out, expect to see that engine\u0027s first alpha release. So, that\u0027s the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T05:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess there won\u0027t be any creepy mud posts from now on?
