There\u0027s nothing out there that does what it does (and if it tries, it doesnt do it well). While it has plenty of downsides, it\u0027s managed to pull me back for almost 550 hours combat time.\n\nI ended up quitting robocraft because the devs are trying to push it as a MOBA/E-sports game even though because of the way it works, the Esports scene won\u0027t ever pick it up. That and they refuse to address the glaring balance problem that is the SMGs, so take that for what you will.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T03:43:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T04:06:11Z","Content":"As people have already said, Planetside 2 is up there.
