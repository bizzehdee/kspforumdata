Is the rocket in those maps based on a real rocket (I was thinking it was reminiscent of a Dnepr) or just a bit of fiction? And has anyone replicated it in KSP?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo post any thoughts on that rocket. If anyone can post a screenshot of it I would appreciate it :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T10:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBumping because this needs to be done holy christ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll see if i can do it if i get the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T11:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks a bit like the British Black Arrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T20:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering the rockets go a glorious 250ft at most before falling back and destroying all, they aren\u0027t anything special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E replicate it if someone was interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
