Don\u0027t even worry about how \u0022bad\u0022 or \u0022awful\u0022 or \u0022terrible\u0022 your first draft of it is going to be, because the first draft is not going to be seen by anyone but you. Write it anyway, and when it\u0027s not what you wanted, go back and write it again! The sooner you write it out, the sooner you can rewrite it and do better. It\u0027s only a pain in the butt like that for your first, as well; after you\u0027ve gone through the arduous process the first time, you know what to look for and how to plan ahead for all of the changes that must be made. Even if your second book also takes a lot of editing, it will still be less of a monumental task than the first one given everything you will learn from your initial project\u0027s completion. Just like reaching orbit for the first time in KSP, it\u0027s an ordeal that in time will seem ever more trivial the more you master the technique.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
