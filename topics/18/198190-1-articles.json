I saw an image of clarity. I saw a comic strip... a three panel comic strip that, though simple as it seemed, changed me... changed my being, changed who I am... Made me who I am...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEnlightened me...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe strip, Garfield, the comic strip was new... no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since... since coming into existence... and there it was before me in print, I saw it... a comic strip... What was it called?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGarfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe story here is of a man, a plain man. He is Jon, but he is more than that... I will get to this later, but first let us say that he\u0027s Jon, a plain man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then there is a cat... Garfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is the nature of the world, here.

I clipped it, and every day, I looked at it, and I said \u0022Okay... let me look at this here. What is this doing to me? Why is this so powerful?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0Jon Arbuckle, he sits here, legs crossed... comfortable in his home, and he reads his newspaper... The news of the world, perhaps... and then he extends his fingers lightly, delicately... he taps his fingers on an end table, and he feels for something...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat is it? It is something he needs, but it is not there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then he looks up, slightly cockeyed, and he thinks...

I always come to this, because I was a young man... I\u0027m older now, and I still don\u0027t have the secrets, the answers, so this question still rings true, Jon looks up and he thinks...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow where could my pipe be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then it happens... You see it, you see... it\u0027s almost like divine intervention, suddenly it is there, and it overpowers you...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA cat is smoking a pipe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is the man\u0027s pipe, it\u0027s Jon\u0027s pipe, but the cat... this cat, Garfield, is smoking the pipe... and from afar, and someplace near, but not clear... near but not clear... The man calls out... Jon calls out, he is shocked. \u0022Garfield!\u0022 he shouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGarfield. The cat\u0027s name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut, let\u0027s take a step back... let us examine this from all sides, all perspectives... and when I first came across this comic strip, I was at my father\u0027s house... a newspaper had arrived, and I picked it up for him, and brought it inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI organized its sections for him and then, yes, the comic strip section fell out from somewhere in the middle, and landed on the kitchen floor... I picked up the paper pages and saw, up somewhere near the top of this strip... just like Jon, I was wearing an aquamarine shirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo I thought, \u0022Ah, interesting. I\u0027ll have to see this later.\u0022 I snipped out the little comic, and held on to it... and five days later, I reexamined it... and it gripped me, I needed to find out more about this. The information I had was minimal, but enough...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAn orange cat named Garfield...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOkay, that seemed to be the lynchpin of this whole operation, yes. Another clue... a signature in the bottom right corner, a man\u0027s name...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYes, I\u0027m on to it for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo... one: Garfield, orange cat, and two: Jim Davis, the creator of this cat...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd that curiously plain man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI did not know, at the time, that his name was Jon. This strip, you see, had no mention of this man\u0027s name, and I\u0027d never seen it before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut I had these clues; Jim Davis, Garfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then I saw more, I spotted the tiny copyright mark in the upper left corner. Copyright 1978 to... what is this? Copyright belongs to a... PAWS Incorporated...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI use the local library and mail services to track down the information I was looking for...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis, a cartoonist, had created a comic strip about a cat, Garfield... and a man, Jon Arbuckle. Well, from that point on, I made sure I read the Garfield comic strips, though as I read each one, as each day passed... the strips seemed to resonate with me less and less...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI sent letters to PAWS Incorporated, long letters, pages upon pages... asking if Mister Jim Davis could somehow publish just the one comic, over and over again... \u0022It would be meditative,\u0022 I wrote, \u0022the strength of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCould you imagine?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut... no response... The strips lost their power, and eventually I stopped reading, but... I did not want my perceptions diluted, so I vowed to read the pipe strip over and over again... That is what I call it, \u0022The Pipe Strip.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Pipe Strip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEverything about it is perfect. I can only describe it as a miracle creation, something came together... the elements aligned... It is like the comets, the cosmic orchestra that is up there over your head... The immense, enormous void is working all for one thing, to tell you one thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGas and rock, and purity, and nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI will say this... When I see the pipe strip... and I mean every single time I look at the lines, the colors, the shapes that make up the three panel comic...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI see perfection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nDo I find perfection in many things?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSome things, I would say... Some things are perfect... and this is one of them. I can look at the little tuft of hair on Jon Arbuckle\u0027s head... it is the perfect shade... The purple pipe in Garfield\u0027s mouth...\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow could a mere mortal even MAKE this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI have a theory, about Jim Davis...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter copious research and, yes, of course, now we have the internet, and this information is all readily available, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis, he used his life experiences to influence his comic...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLike I mentioned before, none of them seem to have the weight of the pipe strip... But you have to wonder about the man who is able to even, just once, create the perfect form, a literally flawless execution of art, brilliance! Just as in a ward... I think there is a spiritual element at work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen my share of bad times and... when you have something... Well, it\u0027s just... emotions, and neurons in your brain, but... something tells you that it\u0027s the truth...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTruth\u0027s radiant light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGarfield, the cat? Neurons in my brain, it\u0027s... it\u0027s harmony, you see? It... Jon and Garfield, it\u0027s truly harmony, like a... continuous, looping, everlasting harmony... The lavender chair, the brown end table, the salmon-colored wall, the fore\u0027s green carpeting, Garfield is hunched, perched... perhaps with the pipe stuck firmly between his jowls... His tail curls around. It\u0027s more than shapes too, because... I...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOkay, stay with me... I\u0027ve done this experiment several times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou take the strip. You trace only the basic elements. You can do anything, you can simplify the shapes down to just... blobs, just outlines, but it still makes sense...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou can replace the blobs with magazine cutouts of other things, replace Jon Arbuckle with a... car parked in a driveway sideways, cut that out of a magazine, stick it in... Replace him there in the second panel with a... a food processor... Okay, and then we put a picture of the planet in the third panel over Garfield...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt still works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThese are universal proportions. I don\u0027t know... how best to explain why it works, I\u0027ve studied the pipe strip, and analyzed Jon and Garfield\u0027s proportions against several universal mathematical constants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nE, Pi, the Golden Ratio, the Feigenbaum Constants, and so on... and it\u0027s surprising... scary even, how things align. You can take just... tiny pieces of the pipe strip, for instance, take Jon\u0027s elbow from the second panel... and take that, and project it back over Jon\u0027s entire shape in the second panel, and you\u0027ll see a near perfect Fibonacci sequence emerge...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt\u0027s eerie to me... and it makes you wonder if you\u0027re in the presence of a deity, if there is some larger hand at work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere\u0027s no doubt in my mind that Jim Davis is a smart man...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis is capable of anything to me... He is remarkable, but this is so far beyond that, I think we might see that... this work of art is revered and respected in years to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis is possibly a new master of the craft, a... a genius of the eye; they very well may say the same things about Jim Davis in five hundred years that we say about the great philosophical and artistic masters from centuries ago... Jim Davis is a modern day Socrates, or... Da Vinci... mixing both striking visual beauty with classical, daring, unheard-of intellect...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLook, he combines these things to make profoundly simple expressions...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis strip is his masterpiece... The Pipe Strip is his masterpiece... and it is a masterpiece and a marvel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI often look at Garfield\u0027s... particular pose, in this strip. He is poised, and statuesque... and his cat stare is reminiscent of the fiery gazes often found in religious iconography... But still, his eyes are playful, lying somewhere between the solemn father\u0027s expression in... Rembrandt\u0027s \u0022Return of the Prodigal Son,\u0022 and the coy smirk of Da Vinci\u0027s \u0022Saint John The Baptist\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHis ears stick up, signifying a peaked readiness... It\u0027s as if he could, at any moment, pounce; he is, after all, a close relative and descendant of the mighty jungle cats of Africa that could leap... after prey. You could see the power drawn into Garfield\u0027s hind quarters, powerful haunches indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe third panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd I\u0027m just saying this now, this is just coming to me now... The third panel of the pipe strip is essentially a microcosm for the entire strip itself... All the power dynamics, the struggle for superiority, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWHO has the pipe? WHERE is the pipe? All of that is drawn, built, layered into Garfield\u0027s iconic pose here. You can see it in the curl of his tail... Garfield\u0027s ear whiskers stick up, on end, the smoke billows, upward... drawing the eye upward... increasing the scope...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027m just... amazed... really, that after 33 years of reading, and analyzing the same comic strip, I\u0027m able to find new dimensions. It\u0027s a testament to the work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFor six years, I delved into tobacco research, because... can a cat smoke? This is a metaphysical question... Yes, can any cat smoke? Do we know? Can just Garfield smoke?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe research says no. Nicotine poisoning can kill animals, especially household pets. All it takes is the nicotine found in as little as a single cigarette.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[ *Okamoto M, Kita T, Okuda H, Tanaka T, Nakashima T (Jul 1994). \u0022Effects of aging on acute toxicity of nicotine in rats\u0022.

I was looking for any insight. A detective of a homicide case has to look at every angle, so I\u0027m always taking apart the pipe strip.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI focused on every minutiae, every detail of this strip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon Arbuckle\u0027s clothing... I have replicas. I\u0027m an expert in textiles... so, you see, this smoking thing was a hang-up for me... but it was the statement here... until...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is key, this is the breakthrough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe pipe is not a pipe, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nObviously there is symbolism at work here... I saw that from the beginning, and I looked at the literal aspects of the strip to gain insight into the metaphors at play... I worked at a newspaper printing press for eighteen months, in the late 1980\u0027s... I was learning the literal to inform the gestural... the subliteral, the in-between...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon reading this newspaper means so much more than just... Jon reading the newspaper... but how could you ever hope to decipher the puzzle without knowing everything there is to know about newspapers?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOkay... for example... Jon holds his newspaper up with his left hand, thumb gripping the interior. I learned that this particular grip here was the newspaper grip of nineteenth century aristocrats... and this aristocrat grip was a point of contention that influenced the decision to move forward with prohibition... in the United States, in the early twentieth century!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo Jon\u0027s hand position is much more than that, it... it is a comment on class war... and the resulting reactionary culture... but I didn\u0027t know about the aristocratic newspaper grip until I came across some microfiche archives at the printing press.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt\u0027s about information. You have to take it apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and the breakthrough on the smoking cat came late... just eight years ago, actually. \u0022Smoking cat\u0022 is an industry term. It\u0027s what the smoking industry calls a tattletale teenager who tells on his friends after they\u0027ve all tried smoking for the first time... and it is actually a foreign translation, stand-up guyization of the term \u0022smoking rat\u0022... But the phrase was confused when secret documents went back and forth between China and America...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThese documents are still secret, and the only reason I know about the term is because I know a man, my friend. Let\u0027s call him \u0022Timothy,\u0022 yeah... yes, it\u0027s a fake name, for his protection. Timothy worked for Phillip Morris for sixteen years, and he had seen the documents... and when he told me, it was an Aha moment... and he said, \u0022But how? How could this cartoonist, Jim Davis, know about this... obscure term from the mid-70\u0027s, used exclusively by a few cigarette companies!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is still a mystery to me... but I connect the dots by noting Jim Davis\u0027 childhood experiences on a farm. He must have seen something...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat could it be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nTimothy went on to tell me there was one particular smoking cat, a boy, from... yes, Indiana, a boy named Ernie Barguckle, who became a thorn in the side of the tobacco companies for a couple of years... He did more than tattle to his parents; he and his family took legal action, and they eventually received a huge settlement payout...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut that name is too similar... Ernie Barguckle...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon Arbuckle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis must have used this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere\u0027s more here. Ernie Barguckle spent nearly half of that settlement money on experimental medical procedures to cure his... impotence. He was impotent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo... he was a smoking cat with a... a metaphorical pipe, that did not work... Are you starting to see the layers here? This is exciting stuff, you start to get a whole picture here, and it informs the work! It\u0027s... it\u0027s just remarkable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis took these raw ideas, these... pieces, and he transformed them into smart social commentary that is... all so ravishingly beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI have cried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027ve cried, I\u0027ve cried...

It just... gets in my soul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI try to explain this to people, I have... the newspaper articles about Ernie Barguckle... People have fought me on this, they don\u0027t see it, or they\u0027re close-minded, \u0022How could a comic strip about a cat smoking a pipe mean any more than that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut it is more... and when I feel spiritual, or start to think existentially, I still see this comic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHere\u0027s something from 1981 that I wrote in thinking about the implications of this strip; this is just an excerpt here... there\u0027s more before and after, but this part is the essence to me... If a comic about a cat smoking a pipe can be the only thing in the universe... then maybe this is the strongest evidence for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Many of you say, \u0027Oh, but I am not blind. I have never been blind,\u0027... But when you truly see, you will understand just how truly blind you once were to even think it right to say you were not blind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat does a blind man see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBlackness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDarkness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBlankness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBlank darkness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDark blankness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe absence of things, quite literally NO thing.

It\u0027s kind of rough... Kind of an... early eighties feel... and I see that, but I\u0027m still... I\u0027m still proud of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSometimes I imagine that it is the editorial column in the newspaper Jon Arbuckle is reading. It\u0027s an exercise in recursion, it\u0027s like a vortex opens up... It\u0027s like you hold two mirrors up to each other, one is reality and the other is a cartoon strip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLet\u0027s see here... Oh yes, I must bring this up, because I think, surely, Jim Davis is again speaking on multiple levels by including the details set before us in the comic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNotice the glimpse of Jon Arbuckle\u0027s foot in the first panel. The size of the shoe would indicate that maybe the man just has small feet... but a deeper investigation takes us to the footbinding rituals of certain Asian cultures. Inflicted usually on women for the desire of men, this practice was incredibly painful and crippling...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAha! Mister Davis is, here, presenting us with a man, or rather... \u0022man\u0022, who engages in footbinding, a body modification for women, on top of \u0022being without his pipe\u0022... or impotent. This is a man facing extreme inner turmoil, the panels tell that story... subconsciously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNotice the background wall shading of the first panel points inward toward Jon in the second panel... and the sharp tapered end of the purple pipe in the third frame also points at John in the second panel, inward; the eye is drawn to the center panel. You can connect these points and draw a triangle across the panels, and this triangle will align with the reoriented points of Jon\u0027s collar! This, this is majestic artwork!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and to uncover this hidden order is... bliss like I\u0027ve never known.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nComforting, in an empty world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI can\u0027t help but read the thought bubble, over and over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow where could my pipe be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow where could my pipe be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is a profound question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhy am I here? What is my purpose? It is reflection and self-examination here. It is facing the dust, the misery of a cold, careless universe.

Thievery, death, destruction, desolation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThese are the things Garfield represents; HE stole the pipe, HE sits with his back to Jon, Garfield... Garfield, this chaos cat, Garfield has turned his back on everything, everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOne recalls the great existential forces in literature... Camus\u0027 Meursalt, Kafka\u0027s Gregor Samsa, or Sartre\u0027s Antoine Roquentin... Garfield the Cat sees the hopelessness of life, which...ah, yes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is why Jim Davis has chosen smoking. It represents a recklessness, a... a disregard for what some would define as the beauty of life. Garfield may die from the nicotine, he may not... He defies life; he sits defiant, saying nothing, but looking as if he could say... \u0022Then let me die... it does not matter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt does not matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and we are faced with this; Could Jon behave the same? Is Jon the glimmer of hope?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe seems to be unsure. Again, his question... \u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022 indicates that he is wrestling with his own existence. The center panel centers the issue, and again, this hearkens to many of the great religious works of art.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027m talking about the Pipe Strip in relation to religion. It\u0027s... it\u0027s interesting to assign the roles of God... and anti-God, or, as many know him to be, the devil... or on a much larger scale, simply the forces of... good and evil. Garfield, the thief-cat, evil and malicious... He is the devil, placed to the right... and note, the two forms of Jon; the Jon on the left, still innocent, still draped in the... delight, of the lack of knowledge. He is... the humans in the Garden of Eden. He feels for his pipe... but he has yet to eat from the tree... and Garfield, the sinister serpent... and notice, notice how Jim Davis has framed this... The center Jon is locked in a struggle, between his innocence, and his knowledge of the truth... knowledge of the existence of evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is stunning. The great struggle, the struggle that transcends time... and Jim Davis floats over all this, as creator... the God, of sorts, in his own right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n... and he presents this cautionary message to us all; it is as if he is speaking from high and... he is saying, unto our awaiting ears...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhere will you be, when the cat reveals himself?

You will have a choice; you can face endless suffering, and eternal misery... You can be forced and beaten down with barbarians, who claw at each other just for a view of salvation. They\u0027ll tear your eyeballs out, and rip your gizzards from end to end. They worship this cat, this... this false idol! This evil, horrible cat, do not be seduced by the cat and the pipe!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGarfield... thy name is a mark of the demons of hell. Something like this, and to those listening, it is a stark reminder to follow the path of the first panel Jon; be humble, be grateful, honor the law, and honor thyself. Be true, and be good, and no harm will come to you... Pray for salvation, and it will be granted unto you. Be like Jon Arbuckle, as he lowers his head. Be like Jon Arbuckle as he lowers his paper, as he turns his head. Bow with Jon Arbuckle, and praise unto the creator, Jim Davis... and banish demon Garfield from your life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, what is all this? What am I saying? Aha... hmm... What does all this mean? Why is this one comic strip so important to me... and why do I feel the need to share this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nObligation. I have an obligation to you all. This is a redemption, this is a belief in redemption, a sacrifice of all the obvious trappings of this false modern life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLook at the simplicity in this strip, in the pipe strip. Look at the simple clothes Jon wears, look at his simple, basic furniture... No adornments on the wall, even the very pipe his cat Garfield stole; it is a plain, modest pipe... and I have adapted this way of life, it speaks to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIn our times... well... you don\u0027t need me to point out the hyperbole of our times; you have children being born eight or nine at a time, you have more money being spent on a single Hollywood movie than some nations can spend... feeding their starving people. Torture, distrust...

Ages ago... but I was youthful, vibrant. For weeks, I didn\u0027t hide that a comic strip was having such a profound effect on me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI was much like Jon Arbuckle. In this middle panel, he says, \u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022... you could look into his eyes, his half-lowered eyes, and think to yourself... \u0022Now, surely, Jon... Surely, you cannot be this naive... This is nothing new for you...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd if you\u0027ve read more of the Garfield comic strips by Jim Davis, you understand what I am saying now; Garfield the cat does things like this all the time. He will take things from Jon; food, items, anything... This is his very nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo you see this, and you want to say, \u0022Jon Arbuckle, come now. You are lying to yourself. You are lying to yourself, and to all of us, if you pretend to have not... any idea of where your pipe has gone. Perhaps you think you\u0027ve left it somewhere else, but... hmph, you\u0027re not so forgetful. You are lying to yourself, ah... yes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou are lying to yourself, Jon Arbuckle. You know that Garfield has the pipe... somewhere, deep down, you know this. You don\u0027t even need to think the question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd that was me when I saw this strip. One week passed, and each morning I\u0027d open my drawer and slam it shut again. I would go to look at the comic... but I\u0027d pause, and think... \u0022Oh no, I don\u0027t need this comic, I don\u0027t n... I don\u0027t NEED to look at it...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut there I was, lying to myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI DID need to see it, and so I did, it\u0027s... cathartic. You give in, and that is the transition, from the second panel of life, to the third panel of life! It is a simple story structure, the passage from the second act to the third, the twilight of things. Jon gives into his suspicions; he knows the truth, he\u0027s ALWAYS known the truth, he yells out, \u0022GARFIELD! GARFIELD! GARFIELD!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is like... pressure from a steam valve, being released; the buildup is unbearable, and then... PSSHHWW, it\u0027s gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo it is like this... when I speak about the truth... the truth, the light, the radiance, this... this is the kind of thing I\u0027m talking about. This is the essence of this brilliant work of art, the practical mixing, meeting, agreeing with the spiritual, it is all HERE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...but spirituality is not an easy thing to confront. You might find yourself able to wrap your mind around a simple math problem, or a basic newspaper article, or... but intellect... is much less subjective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat is spirituality... and how have I found spiritual peace and serenity in Garfield?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA long time ago, after I encountered the Pipe Strip... I spent some time, as I mentioned before, soul-searching. When something impacts you, or alters your very perception so greatly, there is a long period of confusion, recovery time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt\u0027s as if you don\u0027t know who you are, and that can be a... a very scary prospect, especially if you thought you had a good grasp on that sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nImagine if Jim Davis did not know who he was. Would he be capable of shaping the cultural landscape as he\u0027s done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNo. No, of course he wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and how about his characters? Jon... what if Jim Davis suddenly woke up, and didn\u0027t know who Jon was? What if he couldn\u0027t make the informed decisions to accurately depict Garfield\u0027s personality, because of... he could no longer specify, or demarcate the boundaries of Garfield\u0027s behavior?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat kind of comic would THAT be? You see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo draw the parallel. I saw this comic and, yes, I was disoriented... and if I didn\u0027t reconcile this issue with myself, what kind of person would I be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUndoubtedly dire circumstances, but remember; this was not a math problem, this was not an article, this was not something I could just... figure out... and as skeptical as I was, I realized that faith and spirituality were avenues that... required exploring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAt first I tried... long nights, reading Garfield by candlelight, or... aromatic meditation settings, while thinking of Garfield, but... nothing snapped. Nothing clicked, I still felt lost... but I kept it up, I hired a shaman, and a young... personal Yogi Sikh Guru; Avram Dahb Singh Sahib. I pushed and pushed, determined to find myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnd then, a miracle happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nUpon retrieving my morning paper, to clip the Garfield comic... I noticed a young girl, selling lemonade two houses down. She sat, occupied at her stand. She had no customers in sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, I approached, and saw that she was coloring. I looked at her drawing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThree rectangular boxes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA man, in a blue shirt. An orange cat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI knew what this was. Even in her crude scribbles, I knew EXACTLY what this was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe was drawing a Garfield comic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI looked at her words, and I saw that, in her strip, Jon asked Garfield to retrieve a newspaper. Heh, funny... since I\u0027d done just that with myself... Garfield is sarcastic, but agrees to. He returns and calls Jon... \u0022Sahib\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon exclaims that the paper\u0027s all chewed up, but then Garfield says, and I quote, \u0022Sahib asks fish, paper is wet. Sahib asks cat, paper is holey.\u0022 I remember the words, and ran back to my house, and thought, \u0022How odd that Sahib shows up in the strip, and my spiritual advisor\u0027s name is Avram Dahb Singh Sahib!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCoincidence surely, but, nonetheless, I spent the next sixteen hours poring through my clipped Garfield comics, looking for the strip this young girl had been coloring... I couldn\u0027t find it... and I eventually fell asleep, right on my kitchen table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNext morning, I retrieved my paper again, and I clipped the Garfield comic. The date was July 12th, 1983.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Sahib Strip, in all its glory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe girl had been drawing the next day\u0027s strip!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, I ran right out of my house, I ran back to where she was... but she was gone, and in place of the lemonade stand was a \u0022For Sale\u0022 sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey\u0027d moved out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI rushed back to my house to call Avram, but... I was informed that he\u0027d moved away as well. I reeled, for several hours, and then it all connected for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was meant to be. It w... it was meant to be this way! Jim Davis... Jon, Garfield... It was always meant to be this way for me.... They move to the forefront, and everything else fades away, EVERYTHING else; the girl, the lemonade stand, Avram Dahb Singh Sahib, it all existed to show me the way, and when I\u0027d found the way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEverything else melted away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt was a beautiful miracle... and if July 27th, 1978, the day I first saw the pipe strip... was the first day of my life, then that day, July 12th, 1983, was the second day of my life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027ve never looked back. Garfield has transformed me... and I am a man, born anew, because of Garfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen I was in my mid-thirties, I was interviewed for a documentary... It was a documentary on the subject of cat behavior. Now, I\u0027ve had cats my whole life; I have three cats now, and at the time of this documentary interview, I had four cats. I sat down for the interview and was joined by a veterinarian who specialized in felines: Doctor Caroline Wellmitz was her name, I believe... and the doctor discussed colorblindness in animals, and how it affects their behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nShe specifically brought up the fact that cats are red-green colorblind; they can see colors, but they can\u0027t tell the difference between red and green ...and look at the color choice in this strip here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nGarfield sits on a green floor, behind a pinkish red wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI heard this, and I immediately pulled a copy of the comic from my wallet to show to the doctor... I moved so fast, I\u0027m sure I nearly scared her, I... pointed at the paper and said, \u0022Like this! Like this! Look, at this here! This cat, Garfield, he\u0027s colorblind, he must be! That must be the answer here... like this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAs over-excited as I was, I managed to take in her response; she said \u0022Yes, a cat in this room would have a hard time differentiating the wall from the floor. Add to that a cat\u0027s known spatial confusion, and you have the makings of a Cat Rage room.\u0022 Now, she informed me that this isn\u0027t exactly common knowledge among cat owners... but a seasoned cat owner, or someone particularly perceptive will have picked up on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo what\u0027s incredible here is not only is Garfield\u0027s behavior symbolic of the devil, and all the evil constructs in the world, but... but, but... but also, it is rooted in science and scientific fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLook at that. You cannot spell fact without \u0022cat\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHah, just a little joke there... just some wordplay, but getting back on track...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and you can\u0027t spell track without \u0022cat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOkay... I digress. I gotcha, I gotcha, enough... kidding around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is established here that Garfield is in a rage; an ultimate rage of fury and hatred, caused by colorblindness. We know the \u0022what\u0022, we know the \u0022why\u0022... but let us examine the \u0022how\u0022, the how of his rage is particularly interesting here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe\u0027ve looked at his posture and called it \u0022powerful\u0022, \u0022in control\u0022, \u0022statuesque\u0022, \u0022etc., etc.\u0022 Composed rage... It\u0027s peculiar, and I\u0027ve talked to a number of psychologists and psychiatrists, and even a couple of anger management therapists about this concept...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCould we see the same kind of behavior in a human? Is Garfield representative of something more specific than just chaos and rage? Deciphering this is going to take some perseverance. for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe psychologists pointed to a phenomenon in humans, and, yes, I believe one of the anger management counselors brought it up as well. The idea that people, oftentimes, will bottle their rage... Garfield the cat, here... well, he could be bottling his anger, inside, shoving it deep into his cat gut, to ignore and deal with at a later time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEh, well... No, that\u0027s not exactly right. Garfield has already acted out, he\u0027s already stolen the pipe... he\u0027s SMOKING the pipe, he\u0027s already dealt with his anger. He\u0027s already lashed out, so, psychologically, what is going on here? What is this cat doing, and how does it impact his owner, Jon Arbuckle... psychologically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWell, Garfield is angry. He is acting on his anger... but is this passive anger, or aggressive anger?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nPassive. It is passive because if Garfield has a problem with Jon specifically... he\u0027s choosing a passive way of dealing with that problem. He has not confronted Jon, and said, \u0022Jon, I have a problem with the way you\u0027ve decorated this room; as a cat, I am colorblind, and this room sends me into a rage... You\u0027ve created a rage room for me here, and I don\u0027t like it; I want you to change it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nInstead of that confrontational approach, though, Garfield has chosen to steal Jon\u0027s pipe... and that, in turn, angers Jon... but Jon decides to be aggressively angry, and yell at Garfield, so... now, instead of a calm conversation between two respectful parties, you have two... heated, angry individuals, each with a problem and no direct line to solving it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe layered emotions here tell a story with tight, focused brevity that would make Hemingway weep. This is an entire drama, in just three panels, people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...but let\u0027s not be remiss, and miss the humor of the situation, the... absurdity of it all... for certainly, there is a reason that the visual shorthand for drama includes both the crying mask AND a laughing mask. Comedy and tragedy complement each other, and meld together to create drama, tension, the height of humanity, the peak of art, that reflects back to us our own condition...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and here... in its basest form, we can laugh at this comic... yes, COMIC, in which a cat smokes a pipe... Hah... when was the last time you\u0027ve SEEN such a thing in your life?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNever, I presume... I certainly never have...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Greek muse, Thalia\u0027s presence is strong in this work of art, here. Comedy, it is COMEDY... and if you look at the structure again, you\u0027ll see this perfect form of thirds works magically for the transmission of, yes, YES, a JOKE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe joke.... is as old as time... even cavemen told jokes, and the joke here is that Jon has lost his pipe... or he thinks he has... but lo and behold, it is the cat, Garfield, who has the pipe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSurprise, surprise, the cat is smoking!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAgain, the transition, from set-up to punchline takes place between the second and third panels... but make no mistake, the comic is more than just a comic... Yes, it IS funny, of course it is... it is operating at the height of sophisticated humor, on par with any of Shakespeare\u0027s piercing wit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOn the one hand, Garfield the comic, with Jon the man, humor as art... the other hand, Garfield comic, with Jon the man, stirring... no, RIVETING drama... as with everything, it is tension, and release. TENSION... and RELEASE...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI keep returning to this idea, because it is so omnipresent. Yes, you could... and yes, I have done this, on more than one occasion... you could print this comic strip on a giant piece of paper. The dimensions would be something like... thirty-four inches by eleven inches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nNow, tape the ends together, with the comic facing inward. Stick your head in the middle of this Garfield comic loop and READ, start at the first panel; Jon is reading the newspaper... he feels for something on the end table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSecond panel; he sets the newspaper down, something is not right...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Where could my pipe be?\u0022 he thinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and then, the payoff; the third panel, Garfield has Jon\u0027s pipe, and is smoking it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut, aha! The paper is in a loop, around your head... so that you can see that, once again, Jon is in his seat, reading the paper... and so on, and so on, you can literally read the comic strip for an eternity!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI spent many a relaxing Sunday afternoon reading this strip, over and over... reminded of the Portuguese death carvings, which always begin and end with the same scrawled image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo, this idea of repetition, of the beginning being the end, and the end being the beginning... It\u0027s not new, it is an ageless tradition among the best storytellers humanity has ever offered... and I\u0027m not wrong to include cartoonist Jim Davis in that exalted set for this particular strip alone\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027m not foolish enough to deny that great art is subjective... divisive, even, and that some people see this Garfield comic and shrug with no real reaction... but I will say that I believe everyone in the world should see it; at the very least, see it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou should all see it. Read it. Spend some time with it. Spend an hour reading it... what\u0027s an hour? Yes, you could watch some television program, you could play some fast-paced video games or computer games, yes, you could do all those things...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut it\u0027s just an hour... and if you give this strip a chance, if you look into Jon Arbuckle\u0027s eyes... if you look into Jon Arbuckle\u0027s SOUL...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou might find that you\u0027ll really be looking into your own soul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is self discovery, that is what I\u0027m talking about here... YOU have the opportunity, the possibility... it could change you. Don\u0027t be afraid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou know, just last week, I was eating lunch near the Municipal Court... like I do every Thursday, and... there was a plumbing banner... a plumbing van, parked out in front, uh... and a man, a plumber, would step out from the court, and retrieve something from this every so often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA few times, this happened... I thought nothing of it; just a plumber, doing some work at the Municipal Court... but then he came out, and looked through his van, and it was clear...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe couldn\u0027t find something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI noticed, and thought, \u0022Well, that\u0027s sort of similar to the Garfield comic, in a way.

I can\u0027t find my pipe wrench, \u0022 and I said, \u0022No! No, no, say it... like how you just said it...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe scratched his head, and repeated, \u0022Now where could my pipe wrench be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI slapped him on the back and said, \u0022Garfield!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHe looked so confused, so I said it again... then, I said \u0022Your orange cat took it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHeh... ah, then I laughed and laughed... and he smiled, and went back into the courtroom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI walked away, knowing that the plumber and I, two complete strangers, bonded over this Garfield comic... You see, life imitates art, becomes a common ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI have a feeling that if I see this plumber again, we\u0027ll be sharing stories like two old friends... because we\u0027ve been united by art. We have a common love for Jim Davis and his characters, his writings... The humor, the drama, the... that rascal Garfield, the cat...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOh, and by the way, if you\u0027re wondering what I was having for lunch that day, it was a ham sandwich with an apple and potato chips... in a bag, I had a soda as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI think it\u0027s important to view the Pipe Strip in philosophical terms... We\u0027ve touched briefly on the notion of existentialism; that theme is very prevalent in this strip. Garfield is, in fact, a modern existential anti-hero... but if Garfield embodies the bewilderment in a meaningless life, what is Jon? What are the telltale signs that inform Jon\u0027s philosophical standpoint? His approach, what style of thinking he represents?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon is depicted as being grounded in the material world... a world of things; he is surrounded by objects, and he touches these objects, he interacts with them. The newspaper, the end table, the chair... his clothes, all these physical things make up Jon\u0027s world. In some sense, even his cat Garfield is an object to him, a thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe first ideology that comes to mind when thinking of objects in the tangible world... is pragmatism... Is Jon Arbuckle a pragmatist? His beliefs stem from a useful, coherent view of his environment... a sort of cause-and-effect understanding of his world helps him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA: Deduce that his pipe is missing... and B: Catches his cat, Garfield, using the pipe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis kind of empirical and logical thinking lends credence to the idea that Jon is, indeed, a pragmatist... Although, it is hard to entirely ignore the rest of the Garfield comic canon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhile Garfield is consistently anarchic, and embraces the chaos and absurdity of life... Jon Arbuckle exhibits an erratic, unpredictable mix of philosophical behaviors. At times, he is borderline; delusional, an idealist, an almost slap-happy version of Don Quixote. Other moments, he is rigid, nearly to the point of being obsessive... somewhat like a structuralist, and certainly has streaks of sarcasm and negativity that might classify him as a skeptic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...But isn\u0027t there some universal truth in this approach? How can any one man, how can Jon Arbuckle be just one thing? How can any of us be just one thing? We\u0027re... an amalgamation of ideas, of emotions... conducts and functions, thoughts and feelings... Jon Arbuckle may very well inhabit tenets of nearly every major philosophical tract known to man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWe all might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCharacters are reduced, to make them recognizable, definable; a story needs a good guy, a story needs a bad guy... but rarely is one person defined in such black and white terms. Even Garfield, with all his bad behavior, Machiavellian motivation and general ne\u0027er-do-well attitude, can be kind and thoughtful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou just have to find that rare strip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSpeaking philosophically about the entire Garfield franchise, it\u0027s an incredibly accurate depiction of life. Its bold lines and bright colors are merely a facade, a... a red herring, a lie. This cartoon is not a cartoon at all, it is not a... caricature. It is not caricature despite adopting caricature as its visual style and tone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...but I don\u0027t really like to speak in broad sweeping generalizations about Garfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe comic has been running for over thirty years, and to try and boil that all down is just, well... it\u0027s impossible. I think the only way that any historian worth his salt will agree with me is to look at individual moments... isolated instances, single comic strips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nCan I discuss this one strip in the context of the entire run of Garfield? Yes, I do that just as a film historian might analyze one movie in relation to the history of all movies, or a war enthusiast might look at a single battle\u0027s impact on an entire war.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Pipe Strip is just an instance in the lives of Jon and Garfield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nPerhaps Jon is not a pragmatist at all... let\u0027s look at this again. Maybe Jon is exhibiting the traits of a rationalist thinker; his question, \u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022 is a clue that his thought process stems from the early rationalist questions posed by Ren\u00E9 Descartes. The well-known quote, \u0022I think, therefore I am,\u0022 attributed to Descartes, is applicable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAnother close look at the strip, and we see that Jim Davis chose to draw Jon thinking his question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJon does not speak this question aloud, so Jim Davis is also exploring the mind/body duality... Jon\u0027s question operates on the level of a literal question... but it also examines the nature of reality. Jim Davis\u0027 epistemological approach tells us something about the human condition; Jon\u0027s thoughts remain the focal point of this strip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe comic is, quite literally, centered around his thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis is his reality, this is where cognition, and the power and function of the mind take over. As Plato believed, the body is just a shell for Jon Arbuckle; yes, he can use his physical body to read his paper or cross his legs, but these inputs of touch, sight, hearing, et cetera, these senses are the triggers of the mind, as we see here, the mind... is something greater. It is the originator of ideas, and ideas are forever. Immortal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nImmortality through thought, a... a major theme in literature and philosophy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and isn\u0027t that what Mister Jim Davis himself has achieved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWill he live forever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe universe will continue to spread, and spread outward, and... entropy will turn a chaotic infinity into a homogenous, controlled system. This will take billions of years, and in that time, humans will push technology to heights we can\u0027t imagine. We\u0027ll explore and inhabit space, and occupy more and more of the universe, just as time allowed our ancestors to... multiply in numbers, and populate more and more of the Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and as the specific people come and go, their physical bodies will be born, and grow, and die... but their thoughts will remain... and Jim Davis\u0027 comics, his glorious Garfield comics... are recorded ideas of his, that will still be here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nEven when the Earth is no longer inhabitable, and humanity has long since moved away to bigger planets, they\u0027ll carry with them a record, a record we all keep; mark my words... and look at what we\u0027ve started, what is... What is the internet? What is the online world, if not a record? Never-ending feed of ideas, immortal ideas... forever placed in the ether of dualism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat is an idea? Where does it live? How does it manifest itself? Can it live forever? Will it live forever, outside of these physical husks of ours, our bodies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and Jon Arbuckle, and Garfield, started merely as thoughts... but they\u0027ve become so much more. That old clich\u00E9 rings true, they\u0027ve taken on a life of their own... and life may not be what we think. Life brings to mind a beating heart, breathing lungs, blinking eyes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...but the real life is in our imaginations... and who better embodies the definition of imagination if not a simple man... a cartoonist, who puts his ideas to paper so that they may live on, so that our children, and our children\u0027s children, and their children\u0027s children\u0027s children can access the wealth of ideas that have accumulated thus far...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThey will plug themselves into an information grid, and they will have access... They will read every Garfield comic, 80,000 years from now, a child will see a simple Jon Arbuckle, reading a newspaper. He will feel around for something, but that something is not there... He will lift his head and think...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Now where could my pipe be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and Garfield will be smoking the pipe, and Jon will yell\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022GARFIELD!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n...and what then? 80,000 years from now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe child reading this comic will smile... and that smile will transcend space and time and the physical limitations of this existence, whatever they may be, however many dimensions exist...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere will always be Garfield... and there will always be its creator...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJim Davis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022It is through art, and through art only, that we can realize our perfection.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Oscar Wilde\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-18T21:15:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2020 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enow where could my pipe be\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-18T20:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, can\u0027t relate.
