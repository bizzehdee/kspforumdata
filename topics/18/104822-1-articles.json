Human lives can be thrown away or deemed priceless by various religions, or bought for 2 grand in some southeast asian countries. Revered as priceless by the media when its a celebrity, ignored by the media when its just a child in the inner-cities. \n\nHundreds of thousands Have died because one man wanted to rule an empire. Millions upon millions died because one man wanted to take over the world. The history of humankind is paved with slave labor, bodies dragged off when their use has expired.\n\nAs to your poll, no, I don\u0027t think all human life is valuable. All human life has the potential to become valuable, and some lives start with more value than others, but at the end of the road, some people have no value.\n\nAnd that all also depends on who is weighing the value? A plantation owner viewed human lives in dollars and cents. A teacher sees infinite value in front of them every morning.\n\nYour question is too broad for me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T06:55:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T08:44:13Z","Content":"Government regulatory bodies have actual literal values for this-basically showing what cost of safety measures is worth one fatality-but they disagree quite a bit.

We\u0027re just a sack of flesh, like any other animal on this planet; though, perhaps, we\u0027re the most arrogant.\n\nI think it should be interesting though to try a test: if you had the choice between one of your loved ones, and a group of \u0022valuable humans\u0022, who would you save?\n\nDoes it matter how \u0022valuable\u0022 these humans are? If it was, say, your ruler, would you trade the life of said person for that of your loved one? If it was leaders in business? Leaders of technology and development? Would having more of your loved ones\u0027 lives at stake change the value of these \u0022valuable\u0022 people?\n\nIf we find that value is indeed subjective; then can we also say that the only value we place on other people\u0027s lives is the value to prevent their deaths from impacting our own life? Do we value the person, or what the person does for us? Is this value an arrogance, borne from fear of being left alone?"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T10:12:48Z","Content":"As you can choose one thing from two, any thing in Universe is more or less valuable - relatively to the compared one.\n\nAs you can compose many pairs of many things to be compared, you can build (more or less precisely) a rated sequence of their valuabilities: from the most unexpendable things down to useless trash (from your POV).\n\nSo, any thing in the Universe has its own position in such rating, and you can call it \u0022a price\u0022 if you want.\n\nSo, any \u0022price\u0022 is:\n\n- Fuzzy (in terms of mathematics).\n\nAs you probably have no clear opinion which of two similar-looking stones is more preferable to you. And more of that you have no need to be sure. \n\nOr, say, it has a logarithmic-scale precision: you have no idea, does this stone cost $1 or $10, but sure not $100. So, you consider it as a \u0022few dollars stone\u0022.\n\n- Subjective (POV-related).\n\nAs a treasure for one person may be a piece of dung for his best friend.\n\n- Probabilistic.\n\nAs you rate the things according to their probable actuality in your life.\n\nSample 1.\n\nYou live near a road. Every day you buy some food. It costs: at \u0022your\u0022 side - $20, across the road - $10.\n\nYou can buy it either near your home - with no risk, or crossing the road with a 1:10 probability to be knocked over.\n\nProbably, you will choose the safe way.\n\nAnd if the risk is 1:100? No, still dangerous.\n\nLet the risk would be 1:1000000000. Probably you will risk.\n\nAnd what about 1:100000000. Still risk.\n\nAnd what about 1:10000000... Well, yet risking. And so on.\n\nSo, you get a rough delta of your life price. \n\nSay, keeping $10 per day with 1:100000..1:1000000 per day probability of game over.\n\nNow you can easily calculate a mathematical expectation of your total gain per, say, 50 years.\n\nYou can treat it as an estimated price of your life (better take a logarithm to reduce fuzziness).\n\nSample 2.\n\nYou own a house, say, of three rooms. Your salary is enough to eat, but not enough to buy another house if you loose this one.\n\nYou need to get money to save a life of some person known to you.\n\nDo you sell your house and buy a smaller one - of two rooms, paying a difference to save him/her? Say, yes.\n\nDo you sell it and buy a much smaller one - of one room? Well, maybe yes.\n\nDo you sell it and rent a room in a townhouse? If this person\u0027s life is very important for you.\n\nDo you sell all your property completely, staying a homeless beggar for the rest of your life? Wait, this is too much for you. Say, no.\n\nHow much money would you need to turn \u0022no\u0022 back to \u0022yes\u0022?\n\nProbably, the minimal cost of the appartment you are ready to live in to save this person.\n\nThat\u0027s the price of his/her life from your POV.\n\nMaybe that\u0027s cynic, but the question is too."},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:47:11Z","Content":"In my opinion, A humans worth is based on an individual\u0027s accomplishments or immediate potential."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:49:45Z","Content":"It\u0027s interesting, because even though I do believe life is valuable, I think saying otherwise is insulting.
