I have noticed that in situations where people can learn something through their own reasoning, rather than just having it dictated to them, the knowledge seems to root itself far more effectively. That\u0027s probably one of the reasons that science labs stick out in my mind more than anything else that went on in school. We\u0027re naturally curious creatures, and curiosity doesn\u0027t get many opportunities to come out anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
