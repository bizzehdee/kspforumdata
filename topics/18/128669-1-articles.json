She\u0027d like to have it, because she loves visiting her friends (especially now, when on maternity leave with plenty of time). The problem is that our budget is quite tight. Well... more than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve recently got myself a mortgage and bought us a nice new house in the countryside. Now even though I\u0027m a doctor, my salary is still fairly low (my attestation is not yet finished, which basically means that I\u0027m getting half the money for the same work), and the mortgage eats about 70% of my salary. It will (hopefully) get better in about nine months, when I finish my attestation, but until then there\u0027s only about $150-200\u00A0left from my salary every month. Which means that I only have about $2k (one year of lease) left for the car right now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do indeed know that in this price range, I\u0027m getting the absolute bottom of the barrel. I\u0027d buy that car for myself, since the car I have now is a\u00A0Skoda Fabia bought from my parents, which is way better than what one could possibly buy for $2k and thus more suitable for my wife.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the \u0022new\u0022 car, all I want is something that will get me from point A to point B. The thing is that all cars at this price range are either crashed or have well over 150 000 km (100 000 miles)\u00A0on them, which means that it probably won\u0027t be running for long.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is: will the car run for about a year or two without any major repairs? It will probably be driven to work and back, which is about 20 km (13 miles?) each trip, six to seven times a week, plus some shopping trips. According to the internet, car prices are slightly higher here in the Czech Republic than in the US. The sloppiest cars start at $1k here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor illustration, you can get something like\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aaaauto.cz/cz/skoda-octavia/car.html?id=96549753#pmin=20000\u0026amp;pmax=60000\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for just over $2k here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what should I pay attention to when picking that car?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T15:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*person who can\u0027t drive, and not that great in finances*, take this as a grain of salt, this is a stretch of memory of information I got 2nd hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith those things be very careful about rust, those older ~97-99 cars are pretty nice and reliable,\u00A0people get rid of them because of rust or other perpetual problems that are expensive.

Cable op clutches are notorious for stretched cables, these can feel like slipping clutches(And in fact cause slipping clutches). Hydraulic clutches can leak, had this happen on my F150 at one point. Mechanical clutches get linkage wear, and then of course the clutch itself is also to be looked at. Shift cables should also be checked, as they\u0027re the leading cause for floppy shifters in manual trans FWD cars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* If you\u0027re pondering something with an automatic, do the following test. 1: Put it in D. 2: Stand on the brakes as if panic stopping. 3: Give it a fair bit of throttle with your right foot. The engine should rev up to somewhere between 1400 and 1750RPM, then hold steady. The car shouldn\u0027t move, but it should feel like it wants to, and there should be no clunks. Slowly let off the gas, select reverse, repeat the same test. If there\u0027s a problem with the torque converter or the first/reverse planetaries/clutches you will discover it here, and if you do walk away as that stuff is EXPENSIVE to fix. Clunking would indicate worn motor mounts, worn halfshafts, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Inspect the tire tread more closely than just \u0027it has tread y/n\u0027. The tire tread will speak volumes as to the health of the suspension system. If they\u0027re wearing evenly, or if the only abnormal wear is under/over inflation, the suspension isn\u0027t gonna be badly worn. You can also glean a glimpse into the driving style of the previous owner if you know how to read the tires properly, as tire wear is affected by how aggressively the car is driven, how heavily loaded it is, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* With the engine OFF, but the key on, try to steer the car. Does the wheel move more than 5-6 degrees before you feel heavy resistance? If yes, steer clear, the steering rack is FUBAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Fire it up, try the above again. Does the power steering have any odd hard spots in it, does the assist feel like it\u0027s working properly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Bring a long, metal object. Crowbar, long screwdriver, long extension, something about arm\u0027s length. With the engine running, touch one end to the engine in various places and the other to your ear. There should be a very quiet tick in the top of the head where the tappets are, more quiet ticks from the fuel injectors on the intake ports, from the firing cycles on the exhaust ports. Everywhere else should be quiet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Never buy a car without test driving it. Some issues only crop up when it\u0027s going, like rear brakes that don\u0027t work, some overheating issues, on-throttle misfires, etc. Listen to the car, watch the gauges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-27T22:22:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kenobi McCormick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T20:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not for everyone, but a moped or a scooter is a good low-cost option.

It\u0027s a 1997 Toyota Camry. I haven\u0027t bought it yet, but I think it\u0027s decided. Waiting for a mechanic checkup to confirm my suspicion that it\u0027s a good buy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has 345 000 km on it (= about 200 000 mi), and I can have it for about $700. Outside, it looks quite nice, although the paint is slightly faded, but it seemed technically good. Tyres were worn out evenly, engine was running surprisingly silent and I didn\u0027t have to wrestle the steering wheel. I tried most of the things Kenobi McCormick suggested, except for listening to the engine with a crowbar. I am probably going to replace the timing belt right away, though, since it\u0027s approaching 130 000 km (80 000 mi) since last change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took it for a test drive, and it handled pretty nicely. It\u0027s a bit cumbersome when accelerating, the engine revs up immediately when I press the gas pedal, but it probably doesn\u0027t have a 0-100 time of 3 sec. It\u0027s the basic variant with 96kW engine, and the car is heavy. Suspension seems OK, nice and soft, probably softer than what I\u0027m used to, but nothing out of the norm.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I hate is the interior.
