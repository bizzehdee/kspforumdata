Or just goes wrong.

Its not the first time, smaller pieces with high surface areas will probably decay quickly along pieces that shot off in retrograde directions. I dont\u0027 know what the annual station keeping dV is for that spacecraft, but others at similar station have decayed. Could have been debris from the 2004 explosion that touched off the second, wouldn\u0027t it be strange if the 2004 caused a chain reaction that in 20 years takes all the sats out in the weather satellite belt."},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T02:30:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like an anti-satelite weapon.

From what I can tell about the sat, no one else would care to blow it up. Plus there is a lot that could cause a temperature spike. Perhaps a battery exploded, perhaps it was hit by something, perhaps something else happened. We may never know. But a laser seems like a silly conclusion to jump to without more evidence.\n\nAethon\u0027s article suggests it spun out of control prior to comming apart completeley, which to me sounds like something very well could have exploded and given the rest of the vehicle a spin. An impact could have elicited the same response."},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T07:10:35Z","Content":"[http://www.space.com/28709-military-weather-satellite-explodes-photo.html](http://www.space.com/28709-military-weather-satellite-explodes-photo.html)\n\nCoincidentally these Sats did not influence my username!\n\nWhy do you guys think it blew up?"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T07:59:47Z","Content":"Unless that temperature spike happened in the fuel tank there is no way it was an accident.\n\nIf it was the fuel tank it\u0027s possible that the heat shielding could have finally given up."},{"CreatedByName":"SubzeroSpartan7","CreatedById":100972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T13:00:05Z","Content":"A sudden temperature spike and then loss of control.
