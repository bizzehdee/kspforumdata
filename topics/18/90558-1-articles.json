Here are some of the more reliable indicators I\u0027ve found for quality, authentic burritos here in the United States:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Meats are cooked to-order, on a grill within line-of-sight of the waiting customer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Bottled sodas are the only available beverage, all of which were imported from Mexico. Bonus points if they serve Jarritos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Carnitas al pastor--it\u0027s your acid test, and when you\u0027ve had it cooked right, you\u0027ll never feel a need to try anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Their tortillas are a) gigantic (18 inches or more in diameter), and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E made daily. Look for a circular, rotating griddle. If you come in before eight o\u0027clock in the morning, the owner\u0027s mother, grandmother, and/or mother-in-law (minimum required age is seventy-three) should be working on that day\u0027s batch in a flour-dusted apron that\u0027s been handed down from the Mexican-American war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * The better the establishment, the fewer ingredients they can get away with putting in while still making an awesome meal. At the very best spots, this means a burrito has four things inside the tortilla: meat, beans, rice, and sauce. Lots of sauce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast comment: There are so many styles of Mexican food, all of which can be amazing. The above description applies to the \u0022hole-in-the-wall\u0022 style, which (when you can find a place that doesn\u0027t make you sick) is the best (IMHO) and most authentic. Other common styles here in the United States include family restaurant, Tito\u0027s Tacos (literally in a class all its own), street taco / taco truck, American gourmet (oh, Chipotle, you got me through both college and grad school), taquila \u0026amp; taco house (increasingly common), and your obligatory fast-food drive-through chains that don\u0027t really deserve the name.
