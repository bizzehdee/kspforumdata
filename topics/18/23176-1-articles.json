I figured I\u0027d try and outsource here too. Currently were at about 170 subs so its not much further to go. My channel is all gaming and I try to play a lot of different stuff, a lot of it is about trying to show off games people may not know about of play otherwise, I also play KSP and sometimes more common games. I pretty usually have a video every day. So give it a look and subscribe if you wanna support me, if you don\u0027t I wont cry, much. =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtube.com/zomoku\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYouTube Link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEther way, I appreciate the look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
