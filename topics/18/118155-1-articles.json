Since most are non-KSP related, I thought I\u0027d just post a thread here telling the fellow members of the community when I am live-streaming (and what games I am live-streaming).\n\nI tend to live-stream various games (usually whatever I feel like playing that day). I\u0027ve streamed X-Com EW Long War, KSP, From The Depths and Rocket League, though I do want to add Xenonauts and Spore to that list in the near future.\n\n[![Noname117Spore.png](http://streambadge.com/twitch/dark/Noname117Spore.png)](http://twitch.tv/Noname117Spore)\n\n\\*Mods, if this is the wrong section please move this. I\u0027m putting this in the space lounge because that is where Starwhip put his starmade stream (which I watched for a brief amount of time).\n\nThanks for stopping by, and I\u0027ll be posting regular announcements when streams start.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T00:41:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T22:22:34Z","Content":"Going to be streaming some live KSP right now for anyone interested."}]}
