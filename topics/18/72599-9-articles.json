For some, that was a non-issue as their worlds killed them on arrival (see: Miller\u0027s Planet). Others might have made their peace with it, but Mann clearly did not. He too had a \u003Cem\u003Escrew THAT, I want to live!\u003C/em\u003E moment, which led to his deception. He wanted to be rescued and taken to whatever planet that \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E had - or would - select as Our Future Home. Since he had to lie to do it, that meant covering up his lie, and doing away with anyone who would get in the way of his self-rescue plan. Cooper was in the way because he planned to take \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E back to Earth and to send a probe into the black hole just to give what few scientists are left back home a fighting chance to solve the gravity problem and thus evacuate everyone (an option that Mann considered to be madness). Brandt, et al, were in the way because Mann couldn\u0027t trust them to forgive his deception once they found out. As soon as the truth was known, there was a good chance they would have tossed him out an airlock sans suit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was desperate, and selfish, but perfectly sane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Minutiae of Colonization and the Mystery of the Tesseract\u003C/strong\u003E: The important information was relayed in the film: TARS had gathered the necessary data about the singularity. Cooper found a way (with some extra-dimensional help) to relay it to his daughter. Murph took that data and used it to solve the gravity problem. Everything after that was just engineering and time. Lots of time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know that Professor Brandt\u0027s Plan A involved mastering gravity and launching stations from Earth pre-built - he said so near the end of Act 1, and every time we went back to the NASA bunker we saw workers and robots building things in the background. Heavens, the bunker itself was intended to be the first such station. Murph was a young-to-middle aged woman by the time she had her breakthrough. We last see her as a very old woman, probably near or past her hundredth birthday. From this we can infer that humanity had a good 60 to 70 years to build those stations. The clues were all there, we just needed to connect the dots. Having the film spell them out any clearer would have meant lengthening the already very long film or cutting more important narrative elements to make room. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Brandt setting up her colony - again, the clues were there. We didn\u0027t need to see any more than what we did which was: despite the death of her boyfriend/fiance, and despite the fact that she believed she was the last human being alive, she was still plugging away on Plan B. Showing more, once again, would have meant a longer movie or more important material being cut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDitto with the Tesseract: we\u0027re not here for a future history lesson. All we needed to know was that Someone had built the Tesseract and used it to save the human race - the same Someones that built the wormhole and planted one end of it in our solar system. When they did it was irrelevant, same with how. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the causality issues, either the mysterious Someones were as Cooper believed - our distant descendants - and so had a detailed history to draw on, or they were aliens who, wonder of wonders, trusted Cooper to be a bright enough boy to do the responsible thing. Or perhaps not - they did close up the tesseract the moment Cooper had relayed the data and they knew that Earthbound humanity could take it from there without further help. Shutting down the tesseract once the primary goal was accomplished was their way of making sure Cooper didn\u0027t try to muck anything else up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that all of these details would no doubt be interesting - and might make for a very interesting book, assuming one is not already being written (\u0022The Science of Interstellar\u0022 does have a certain ring to it.) But that\u0027s all frosting on the cake, in my opinion. It might add to the experience of some, but not to the experience of all. Big budget films need to appeal to all, and that means that the needs of narrative supercede the needs of exposition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Unstoppable Blight\u003C/strong\u003E: If I read your comment correctly, you seem to be making the assumption that humanity was presented with an either-or choice with regards to the Blight. Either use biology and crop science to stop it, or leave the Earth. I submit that the first option had been tried... and had failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecall the PTA meeting scene: not only was history being rewritten to keep people focused on \u0022the here and now\u0022, but universities were no longer accepting people. The big focus of civilization outside of the NASA bunker was farming, farming, and more farming. Most of the farming was automated - implying a lack of unskilled labor, which implies a lack of people. Ditto with the fact that armies no longer existed - in a world where mere survival is the best you can hope for, you don\u0027t throw away something that can help with that survival (like defending from hostile neighbors that might want your food) unless that something is no longer necessary. This in turn implies that a significant fraction of humanity is dead. Perhaps Europe and Asia are abandoned entirely except for small enclaves. Perhaps all of humanity now fits into a subsection of North America. Who knows?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFaced with the loss of crops, I suspect every nation would have poured resources into fighting the Blight at first; a struggle that probably went on for years if not decades. But, once people started dying by the billions, it\u0027s a safe bet that the bulk of surviving humanity gave up hope of beating the Blight - especially since with the mass dying, the brainpower pool would have shrunk considerably. Research is still going on (again: the NASA bunker - note the greenhouses and Professor Brandt\u0027s statement that corn is next on the Blight\u0027s hit list), but it\u0027s more in the \u0022how much time do we have before the End\u0022 category. Only the discovery of the wormhole offered any option other than extinction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple options had not worked - leaving only the difficult and the desperate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final point: we need to remember that, no matter the genre, stories are about \u003Cstrong\u003Epeople\u003C/strong\u003E. Everything in a story has to serve the purpose of showing a person struggling to achieve something or to escape something and whether or not they succeed or fail. Any side-trip on that narrative journey has to still serve that narrative journey or it\u0027s a distraction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswering all your questions in the film might have been wonderful engineering and science - but terrible storytelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T05:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cannon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cannon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust watched the movie \u0022Interstellar\u0022 few days ago and..damn.\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me understand the movie better, i mean time dilation and these things, I\u0027ve been trying to find some good explanations on YouTube but failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was in a book store yesterday and I saw a book by Kip Thorne titled \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/The-Science-Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Science of Interstellar \u003C/a\u003E.
