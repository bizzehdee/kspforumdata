Or Earth, the formula should be the same. I have looked on the internet and found some formulas for exactly this, but the problem is that when I tried to calculate the formulas I always got results like 4.83318...x10^14. And that can\u0027t be true at all. Would you guys be so kind to help me? I would really want to calculate that, but I can\u0027t come to a correct result. And I am not really skilled in maths at all, so don\u0027t be angry with me when I don\u0027t understand something directly!![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nKartoffelkuchen"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:03:06Z","Content":"If the satellite is far smaller than the planet it\u0027s orbiting, the velocity is approximately sqrt(G\\*M/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the orbit (not the altitude!). Ensure that G is in the same units as M and r, and you should be good to go. For example, G in the MKS (meters-kilograms-seconds) system is 6.67384\\*10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, the mass of Earth is about 5.972\\*10^24 kg, and the radius of Earth is 6,378,140 m; if you plug-and-chug for a satellite 200 km up, you should get a velocity of about 7,784 m/s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T16:06:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nikolai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:42:42Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the simplest way in your situation:\n\nV=R\\*sqrt(G/(R\u002Bh))\n\nR is the radius of the planet, which for Kerbin is 600,000 meters. G is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface, which on Kerbin is 9.807 m/s^2 (the same as on Earth). \u0022h\u0022 is your height above Kerbin. So using a 100 km orbit as an example:\n\nv = 600,000 m \\* sqrt( 9.807 m/s^2 / ( 600,000 m \u002B 100,000 m ) = 2,245.8 m/s\n\n(Just keep in mind that this assumes a perfectly circular orbit, and a satellite of negligible mass compared to the planet.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T16:49:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jonboy**"}]}
