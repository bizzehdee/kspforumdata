In addition to the standard yaw motion (right foot forward, left backwards and vice versa) each pedal also has an independent \u0022toe brake\u0022 that can be bound to its own axis. There are few games that need this though. . .I\u0027ve tried binding this function to an \u0022on/off\u0022 command (for example, lower gear or cut throttle in KSP) but I find it doesn\u0027t work very well. The pedals can be locked in place so that only the toe brakes function, so you can use them for racing games. My issue with the pedals is that they have a \u0022hard stop\u0022 in the centered position-- they resist a sudden shift from right to left yaw. I\u0027ve been told that many aircraft are like this in real life, to help damp out unintended oscillations, but I find it annoying. On the plus side, it is very easy and natural to center the rudder. On the down side, the pedals will fight you a little bit if you want to rapidly reverse your yaw input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese things are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etough.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI had an \u003Cem\u003Eold\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0CH joystick that lasted from middle school, through high school and then all the way through college.

Each axis is independent, and the resistance to motion is very uniform, from the centered position all the way to full deflection. Consequently, the \u0022throw\u0022 on the stick is precise and smooth, something you won\u0027t get with a cheaper joystick that uses springs. There\u0027s the trigger, a \u0022reach up\u0022 button for the index finger, a \u0022reach down\u0022 button on the front of the stick for the little finger, a thumb button, and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thumb hats that each have six or so bindable directions. As previously mentioned, there is no \u0022twist\u0022 for the yaw axis.\u00A0I consider that to be a feature-- it\u0027s too easy to get accidental yaw input and it messes with my aim. There is a dial for throttle control if you need it.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe throttle moves back and forth in a straight line, as opposed to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://images10.newegg.com/BizIntell/item/26/280/26-280-021/7.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eswinging through an arc\u003C/a\u003E, and some people don\u0027t like that. It\u00A0has three finger buttons, three thumb hats and an index finger hat, each with six-ish bindable directions. It\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0has a fully analog thumb stick that doubles as a second joystick. I usually bind the camera to this stick, and it is fantastic, though TrackIR or something similar would make that unnecessary.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be honest-- I am not a fan of the rudder pedals. In addition to the standard yaw motion (right foot forward, left backwards and vice versa) each pedal also has an independent \u0022toe brake\u0022 that can be bound to its own axis. There are few games that need this though. . .I\u0027ve tried binding this function to an \u0022on/off\u0022 command (for example, lower gear or cut throttle in KSP) but I find it doesn\u0027t work very well. The pedals can be locked in place so that only the toe brakes function, so you can use them for racing games. My issue with the pedals is that they have a \u0022hard stop\u0022 in the centered position-- they resist a sudden shift from right to left yaw. I\u0027ve been told that many aircraft are like this in real life, to help damp out unintended oscillations, but I find it annoying. On the plus side, it is very easy and natural to center the rudder. On the down side, the pedals will fight you a little bit if you want to rapidly reverse your yaw input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese things are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etough.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI had an \u003Cem\u003Eold\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0CH joystick that lasted from middle school, through high school and then all the way through college.

It will \u0022merge\u0022 all three devices into a single virtual device, so you can use them with games that only support one analog input. I haven\u0027t had to dither with the software myself. . .the default settings work pretty well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne draw back is that these things are pretty big. They are great if you have giant hands, but I struggle to reach some of the keys. The throttle is almost twice as wide as my hand if I don\u0027t splay out my fingers. But the extra size means the bases are pretty stable.
