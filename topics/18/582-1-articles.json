Five RD-180 engines would have approximately the same combined mass and thrust as the five F-1 engines on the first stage of the Saturn V, and would get eighteen percent more impulse ( = increased payload capacity). The Saturn V was great, but we can do even better now, if we bothered to spend the same amount of effort and money that we spent to develop the Saturn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lieninstriker","CreatedById":3631,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-04T23:49:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a really cool video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hpearson","CreatedById":803,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-05T00:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eawesome video and awesome commentary!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[mod]Your not in any trouble or anything just please watch out for advertising[/mod]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat video, I didn\u0027t even know there was high speed footage of a Saturn launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
