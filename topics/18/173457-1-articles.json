studless though). i rarely get them out. getting too old to sit on the floor hunched over a bucket of bricks. but i recently found myself in need of a 3d scanner for a completely unrelated project. now normally when i want to scan an object in 3d i have to take literally hundreds of photos of it from every conceivable angle, feed them into visual sfm, and hope my point cloud is usable enough to generate a mesh. i wanted to automate this process, but i didn\u0027t want a long drawn out 3d printing project. i figured i could do it with lego instead and save some time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso over the last 2 days i build a scan rig (and yes i killed my back doing it), finished up the mechanical parts. first part was a turret. pretty basic, pretty much a direct worm to turret drive. except with a cam to hit a switch (from one of the old rcx mindstorms kits). i don\u0027t need precise positional data here, i just want a pulse every few degrees of rotation. i can use this to trigger the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni can also count pulses so i know when a full 360 rotation has passed. for visual sfm to work, i need photos from different height levels so i build a large\u00A0rack and pinon lift, it has a limit switch to find the lowest point. no positional feedback though, maybe il print me a lego-potentiometer adapter if i find i need it. i figure with the massive gear reduction on the lift i can just control the motor on time. if it over runs it will simply run out of rack and stop climbing. the requirement here is photos at different heights, no specific heighs are required, visual sfm will determine the orientation and position of the camera just using the image data, quite nifty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni made a camera holder, and i can just put a bolt though a lego frame into the tripod mount on the camera (an old point and shoot camera running chdk so i can have a remote trigger) to keep it in place. the frame is geared to the lift such that it pans down as the lift rises, keeping the turret in the shot all with one motor.\u00A0i thought about gearing the lift\u002Bpan\u00A0to the turret but opted for a second motor, i also had the option of using a servo, but then feedback on the lift would have been essential.\u00A0i could have used math to get the right angles, but i managed just fine on trial and error. i built it so i can very easily take a gear out of the drive train to adjust the centering should the need arise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow i could very well control the whole kitten caboodle with either the rcx or the nxt bricks i have (the nxt would have been much easier as both motors have encoders built in, and i could have had a nifty ui). but im going to use an arduino. first of all my lego wiring is ancient and is in pretty bad shape (the insulation was literally disintegrating\u00A0on me during tests.\u00A0second, i also need to control the camera. thats its own little hack in itself since my camera doesnt support remote shutter (fixable with a firmware mod and a diy cable). i think i can trigger the camera directly from an arduino pin. i could probibly stick a relay or transistor on the nxt or rcx and control it that way, but id rather just be able to plug it in and go (and not have to include another power supply). as for power im going to be running off a 12v wall wart, which i will split between the aruino and the motor controller, the arduino\u0027s regulator provides the 5v for the logic signals, and camera trigger. probably going to use hardware low pass filters for both switches, they are old and probably bounce a lot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nprogram is going to be something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 home the lift\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 activate the turret until i get

number of times depends on the gear ratio that i haven\u0027t determined yet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 raise the lift abit (gonna need to time it with a stop watch to determine a good height to time ratio)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 repeat 4 and 5 2 or 3 more times (im probibly going to fill my sd card too fast if i do too many vertical iterations)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7
