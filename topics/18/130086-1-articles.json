It\u0027s easy right now, since you are basically running a mars colonization program with unlimited funding and no pressure for result at the moment. You get a launch every 120 sol, and on each launch you get a limited amount of payload you can put on, which you must choose carefully. There are rovers to scan the area for resource and do SCIENCE!! , which should be on first launch so they can discover resources before your colonizations.\u00A0Then there are life support supplies such as food or water if your following launches include astronauts, and building supply so the astronauts can start building things. Eventually you can launch colonists and other more advanced things like satellites to support your new colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has quite a lot of potential.
