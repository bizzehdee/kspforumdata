That one hurt.\n\nMine came from an argument I had yesterday with one of my fellow students in physics class. We were building a egg drop. Simple, first project of the year. I noted that since ours was filled with pillow stuffing, was very lightweight, and not very dense, that it would not fall as fast as some of the others due to air resistance. \n\nHere\u0027s how it went from there:\n\nOther student: Dude, I already told you, everything falls at the same speed. It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s lighter.\n\nMe: They *would* fall at the same speed if there was no air. But there is air, which causes air resistance, or drag, which will cause it to fall slower than say if we filled it with lead or something.\n\nHim: No, everything falls at the same speed. Look \\*picks up the project and a roll of duct tape and drops them from roughly the same height in his hands\\* \\*they hit relatively close together, but there was a small separation\\* See! They hit at the same time!\n\nMe: That\u0027s because you dropped them from five feet, so they wouldn\u0027t have had time to reach a speed where the air resistance would make a difference. and because you couldn\u0027t have dropped them at the exact same time. Here, let me ask our **physics teacher.** Mrs. H, do all objects fall at the same speed on earth, where we have air?\n\nStudent: Don\u0027t ask her specific like that, just ask her regularly. Do things fall at the same speed? \n\nTeacher: In a perfect environment with no air, yes.\n\nstudent: See! I told you!\n\nMe: ...She just proved me right....\n\nStudent: Alright let me look this up to prove it to you again. \\*looks it up\\* ok, this is what it says. A feather and a ball will not fall at the same speed, but a bowling ball and a pen will fall at the same speed. \n\n(facepalm at this article in not explaining anything at all)\n\nStudent: See?\n\nMe: That was a very vague and confusing way to put that, but it still proves me right. The pen and bowling ball will have *somewhat* similar drag-mass ratios if the pen falls point first. But the feather falls slower because of air resistance.\n\nAnother student who everyone knows is one of the smartest kids in the class (besides me ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ) : Yeah, he\u0027s right, the air slows down less dense objects.\n\nStudent: No, it doesn\u0027t. All objects fall at the same speed. I\u0027m done arguing.\n\n**\\*facepalm\\* \\*facepalm\\* \\*facedesk\\***\n\nNot trying to be mean to him, but this guy isn\u0027t the smartest in the class, everyone knows that. He struggled in math and science classes before. I don\u0027t doubt he can do well in this class if he tries hard. Yet he was certain that he was right, and that two of the smarter people in the class were wrong. And he was also certain that the teacher proving me right was actually proving him right.\n\nI gave up because I knew there was no way to convince him, plus I know I\u0027m right so. Yeah. **\\*facepalm\\***\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T03:09:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T22:46:31Z","Content":"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CskJ6e-doms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CskJ6e-doms)\n\nYep.
