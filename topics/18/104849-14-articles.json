HUGE fan of the book and have looked very forward to the movie. I loved it!\n\nAndy Weir himself said that he would have made the same cuts for the sake of a movie that even at 2:15 is pretty darn long. \n\nAn example of something changed that I agree was a practical necessity as well as something that would have taken up a lot of time otherwise:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  Pathfinder not dying works fine for the movie, indeed pretty much a storytelling necessity. \n\u003E \n\u003E Keep in mind that SO MUCH of the information in the book was with Watney by himself, cut off from communications for so long, that the movie needed to be able to have the communications opened up for better storytelling. \n\nI mean, if you\u0027d not read the book it would make perfect sense that what I described above went the way it did in the movie. No point in obsessing that it\u0027s different from the book, for the sake of obsessing about things different from the book. Stuff had to be cut, condensed, or modified for the movie.\n\nI like the ending better than either of the two endings the books had (yes, the original ending in the book was changed for later editions. Perhaps when it went from self-published to being \u0022real published\u0022).\n\nSo, I understand why various things got cut or changed. Though I wish the moment of \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  Mindy Park\u0027s emotional reaction as she showed Kapoor the images on Mars, as he slowly realized what she was trying to show him, had not been cut. That was a great OMG emotional moment that was lost, not nearly as powerful as the later reveal to others as the movie showed. \n\n But again, the movie needed to have a lot of things shortened/cut. But I hope they shot that scene anyway (and a few others), in which case it might show up as a a DVD extra or even a Director\u0027s Cut as with \u0022The Abyss\u0022. \n\nAnyone who can\u0027t get over the movie being different from the book, try this: READ the book \u0022The Right Stuff\u0022 by Tom Wolfe. Which was said at the time to be impossible to turn into a movie. Then watch the movie. BOTH are great, but also many differences (massive parts of the book left out of the movie, and other things cut or condensed or changed). And even at THAT the movie was well over 3 hours long, contributing to its box office failure. But it was a great movie, regardless. \n\nThe Crew \u0022mutiny\u0022, of course was in the book (I\u0027m not going to spoiler this since it was included in several of the trailers and commercials). The movie emphasized more that aspect of aspect of the crew decision, while my take on it from the book was the \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  clash in on the ground about keeping the crew in the dark, first about Watney not being dead, then not letting the crew know about how they could save him. Until the Flight Director secretly sent them the information, so the crew could decide for themselves. Which when the Flight director secretly sent the crew that info, he knew it was pretty much 99% sure thing they would do exactly what they did. Literally an unspoken question if they wanted to try to save Watney themselves or not.....they did NOT think of this on their own.\n\nWhat human being worthy of being a trusted crew member on a mission to Mars and back would NOT choose to do what they did? In the military, there are situations where a mission is so dangerous, that rather than order them to do it, they ask for volunteers. I take this more as the crew \u0022volunteering\u0022 to do something that nobody on the ground was going to (or allowed to) officially ask them to consider doing. Now if this was a real world incident, one could get wrapped up in arguing legal technicalities. But also NASA and the military would look like idiots to press charges against crew members who did such a heroic thing for the sake of another crew member as opposed to non-heroic personal reasons as in the two real-world examples below. \n\nRead up on history about Apollo-7 and Skylab 4. I mean real NASA history, not movies. Apollo-7 had in a way, a crew mutiny against mission control, and Skylab-4\u0027s crew went \u0022on strike\u0022, both sparked over mission control loading them up with too much to do and reaching critical points (plus some general crankiness before even launching in the case of Apollo-7. Not wanting to do any TV broadcasts at all, which was a new thing greatly appreciated by the public). None of them ever flew again, though Schirra was already retiring after the mission anyway (which freed him up even more to be extra cranky, without any effect on his future as an astronaut. But his two other crew members paid for it).\n\nAnyway, back to the movie\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6. I give it 10 out of 10. Perfect? No. The last perfect movie I ever saw? Still waiting to see the first perfect movie. Top Ten movies I have ever seen..... yes this one makes my list.\n\nOnly disappointment is that I no longer am waiting to see it (Saw it at 10:15 PM Oct 1st in 3D). Well, not waiting to see it for the first time. I\u0027m now waiting to see the local $5 Tuesday showing, and will see it at least a third time while it\u0027s still in theaters. Eventually, will get the Blueray DVD (likely out in January).\n\n- GeorgeG\n\nYep, this is me..... the more handsome guy on the right.... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![wVAAcdX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wVAAcdX.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T09:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T08:41:11Z","Content":"I\u0027m watching the ads in the V Max showing of it now!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T09:57:59Z","Content":"[39158f3d47b89918e9466b3b6634f041](https://www.facebook.com/forumcinemaslv/videos/988361134536322/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cannon","CreatedById":109645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T15:56:38Z","Content":"What are your opinions about the movie, i saw it in cinema on 30th September in 3D, it was awesome!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T19:20:49Z","Content":"Merged in a duplicate thread."},{"CreatedByName":"Fingal","CreatedById":109326,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T20:37:42Z","Content":"Just back from seeing the film.

Very pleased, well worth the $8.50 price tag. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this, because it\u0027s the exact opposite of my usual complaint with book adaptations, but I actually think they may have kept in too much from the book. There were some parts, a lot of the stuff Earthside, for example, that just felt rushed. Even at two hours and twenty minutes, it felt like the pacing was a bit quick. \n\u003E \n\u003E One part I think totally misfired was Annie Montrose. That whole character was much better in the book than the film, she had a lot of great lines. I felt like Kristen Wiig was just window dressing for the most part. Which is odd, because she is a fairly big name, I\u0027m sure she wasn\u0027t inexpensive. I wonder if a lot of her part was left on the cutting room floor. Or, maybe it\u0027s just more of Hollywood\u0027s phobia of strong female characters. \n\u003E \n\u003E And I was a little disappointed with some of the censor cuts. I mean, come on guys, you\u0027re dropping F-bombs left and right, but you won\u0027t let Annie accuse the guys in Project Elrond of never having gotten laid in high school? And Watney\u0027s response when Kapoor asks him to clean up his language was much funnier in the book. \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, they pepped up the ending to make it more exciting and give Lewis more of a role in the conclusion. I\u0027m neither thrilled nor surprised by it. I like the ending in the book better, it feels more realistic to me. But I understand from a screenwriting perspective why they did what they did. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nBut these are nitpicks. Overall the movie was superb. Even having read the book I was still laughing out loud at all the right parts and tense at all the right parts.

Probably the best book to screen adaptation I\u0027ve ever seen. I was skeptical about Damon as Watney but he really pulled it out of the bag and there were a lot more laughs in the audience than there have been at some comedies films!\n\nI feel like this is the space movie we\u0027ve been waiting for and is sort of the culmination of those we\u0027ve had in the past few years. It has the beautiful visuals \u0026 thrills of Gravity coupled with a more complex plot, without getting bogged down in the self-importance or pseudo-science Macguffins of Interstellar. It was light without being superficial, delivered plenty of laughs, I felt attached to the characters (though probably less so than in the book considering how much faster paced the film had to be) and there were genuine emotional moments which never felt forced and almost managed to move me to tears. Overall a fantastic movie, not just for a space enthusiast but in its own right.\n\nI don\u0027t really believe in giving quantitative ratings to movies since my opinion of them can change so rapidly and it\u0027s such a subjective thing, but in this case I can\u0027t give anything other than a 10/10.
