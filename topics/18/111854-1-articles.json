How are we to decide worst? \n\nThe original release version of Rome: Total War wouldn\u0027t let you play anything else until you completed the tutorial, but would crash before you could finish the tutorial, and save/load was disabled in the tutorial, so every time it crashed, you\u0027d have to play the whole tutorial over again from the beginning. I had it for a week before I got through the tutorial by dumb luck and could actually play the game. Then I found that the game had a list of serious bugs as long as your arm. Years later when they finally put out a \u0022gold box\u0022 version, it still had dozens of quite serious glitches. Things like archers shooting at the wrong targets and hitting your own troops, and cavalry stopping pursuit for no reason and letting enemies get away. When it worked, it was a terrific game. But RTW just might be the buggiest \u0022finished\u0022 product I\u0027ve ever played. \n\nBut the worst game design I\u0027ve ever tried to play was Master of Orion 3. To \u0022help\u0022 you run your empire, it had an AI bureaucracy which would actually over-ride and un-do your own actions. There were limits on how you could spend your money. For example, when you increased a budget setting to hurry a build job, you could only select the *kind* of jobs that got increased funding. The AI decided *which* of that kind of jobs got the increased funding. You couldn\u0027t control the order in which your ships were fed into battles, so sometimes you fragile troop transports would charge the enemy ahead of your battleships. To move any ships, you had to group them into task forces. Once a task force was disbanded, all ships in it would be unavailable for several turns. But that meant that if you made a mistake and wanted to change the task force composition, your only option was to disband the whole thing, rendering ALL ships in it unavailable for several turns.

Uncle Francesco left Kevin and Kimberly because he \n\u003E cannot pay his bills anymore. Their poor uncle is ashamed of himself! There is only one \n\u003E \n\u003E chance to get their fat Uncle Francesco back - earn loads of money, within 24 hours, with the \n\u003E \n\u003E pizza restaurant! Earning money requires a lot of work. After taking an order by phone, they \n\u003E \n\u003E have to prepare the order in the kitchen, by preparing all the pizza-ingredients (cheese, \n\u003E \n\u003E pepperoni, tomato, ananas, onions, etc, etc) as well as some extra orders (fries, soda, salad). \n\u003E \n\u003E After finishing the pizza one of them has to drive in Kevin\u0027s supercharged quad to the \n\u003E \n\u003E customer: and here the difficult part starts! If a pizza is delivered too late, a customer will not \n\u003E \n\u003E pay for his pizza. Because of this \u0022golden rule\u0022, all pizza customers will try to make your \n\u003E \n\u003E delivery as hard as possible. Their loose (wild) dogs and many other obstacles will make you \n\u003E \n\u003E use your jump and run action to the max. Can you make a pizza and deliver it within time? \n\u003E \n\u003E Prove it!\n\nSeems weird. But let\u0027s run it. It can\u0027t be that bad, right?\n\nYou get a screen with two people who don\u0027t really look like people.\n\nYou click \u0022new game\u0022, you get a blackscreen. Apparently, it\u0027s the character selection. Select a character by just clicking randomly.\n\nYou get to see the game. Or at least, the intro. It\u0027s very long and very boring and you can\u0027t skip it, but that\u0027s not really a problem, because then you look at the textures that are made out of cardboard.\n\nIt\u0027s a city with a pizza restaurant.\n\nThe game starts. The phone rings. You pick up the phone, the phone hangs itself up, you then make a pizza, which you have infinite time for.\n\nHow do you do that? Well, just pressing space at the ingredients you need. The chicken is cut with a chainsaw, oddly.\n\nThen you made the pizza, and then suddenly an timer appears, and you need to get to the client within the time. You do that by food and by quad.\n\nOh, and did I mention if you accidentally bump a little you immediately crash and that the timer is always at a super low time which is almost impossible to beat? Well no money for me today.\n\nWell guess what, the game is over! You need to restart, go trough the whole intro again and then do it all over again but then with an different impossible mission! Every time, there are impossible goals. 20 seconds for a house a few blocks away, 2 minutes to get to somewhere in the air.\n\nSo what I did, is I never picked up the phone. It keeps ringing, but I don\u0027t care. I just drive around and study the whole environment. Oh, and you can get money instead by just picking them up while you\u0027re riding. On the money, you see some guys face with the text \u0022tyrannosaurus rex\u0022.\n\nThat\u0027s how bad it is.
