I regret that and would have sat through a longer movie. Its science is pretty good and technically the movie was done well. There was a lot to like about the teamwork and sacrifice exhibited by the characters in the show.\n\nAnother point about the movie is simply this: my favorite movies are those that can be enjoyed by the entire family. So, while this is a good movie for adults and others old enough not to be made uncomfortable by some expressions; if you haven\u0027t seen the movie and you don\u0027t like your kids being exposed to some occasional strong language, you might consider leaving your kids at home when you go see it. Its rated PG-13 for a reason. (I know, aren\u0027t ALL movies the same way?) The movie follows the book in this sense too, and thus the movie wouldn\u0027t be true to the book if were to have a G or PG rating.\n\nSo I\u0027m saying to those that haven\u0027t seen the movie yet: go see it if you want to see a movie that\u0027s fairly realistic in how people interact and how they communicate in the community at large. If you are squeamish about some occasional strong language, this might dampen your enjoyment of the movie, but keep in mind that its pretty true to the book."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T12:45:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So I\u0027m saying to those that haven\u0027t seen the movie yet: go see it if you want to see a movie that\u0027s fairly realistic in how people interact and how they communicate in the community at large.
