He was shocked when I showed him a university-level textbook explaining that Venus was hotter due to the greenhouse effect of its thick atmosphere\n\nI had something similar happen to me, but took a worse turn. A teacher believed that Pluto was always the farthest away. I shown the teach proof otherwise (the internet wasn\u0027t what it is now) and I got scolded for it. I was then told \u0022not to bring it up again\u0022 or I \u0022would be sent to another school for abusive youth\u0022 (Joke was on you pal, I had a clean record so that wouldn\u0027t happen) and that I\u0027m to adhere to what he said. \u0022Come back and prove me wrong when you have a PhD in your name.\u0022 He said a lot of other absurd crap as well where I could probably write a book. \u0022Uranus is blue because of oxygen\u0022, \u0022Mercury is the hottest planet\u0022, \u0022Granite is the hardest mineral\u0022, \u0022Iron rusts in space due to the water vapor in space\u0022... Plenty of other idioms too.\n\nDespite always being ahead in science, I barely passed (Earth Sciences) and I think it was because I didn\u0027t dumb down my work to his level. Thankfully the following year I had a biology teacher who was more knowledgeable and we would get into some really great conversations about space, some physics, to the point in which it would eat into class time. The great thing, when I took chemistry the following year, I had the same guy and found out the idiot in my first paragraph was no longer teaching at the school due to \u0022complaints \u0026 disputes with his techniques\u0022. I did lodge a complaint to the dean \u0026 to the school board. However, I was not able to complete his class because I ended up moving and had to change schools.\n\n**Edit**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022When Voyager 3 arrives there I can\u0027t wait to see what Pandora looks like.\u0022\n\u003E I gave him this look.\n\u003E \n\u003E Voyager *3*? *Pandora*?\n\nAvatar movie (with the blue cat/smurf people) reference."},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T19:38:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Education works when the person you seek to educate is curious about the subject and willing to learn. If they don\u0027t care, or if they stick to their plainly irrational view and refuse to even accept that the facts you present have merit, you might as well give up. It is almost impossible to reason somebody out of a position they were not reasoned into. They have to want to believe facts. In my view, it is better to prevent people from getting false ideas ingrained on them from the start, than to try to do attempt to cure it later in life.\n\nUsually I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s how you say it to them; if you calmly explain where they\u0027ve made the mistake using simple, understandable terms, even using their story as basis then changing the details so it\u0027s now correct, they will listen. You just have to make it seem like you\u0027re expanding their knowledge, not correcting them. If you directly state to them \u0022No, you\u0027re wrong\u0022, they\u0027re immediately gonna go on the defensive and fight against what you\u0027re saying, and then you\u0027re going no-where.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This approach doesn\u0027t always work, especially when you encounter the truly dumb person: \n\u003E I once got the good ol\u0027 \u0022there\u0027s no gravity in space\u0022 comment. \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried to correct her, but she immediately angered in response because \u0022there\u0027s no gravity in space \u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E This short exchange therefore automatically defaulted into an argument. Unfortunatley, she held onto this curious concept where \u0022I never argue, unless I\u0027m 100% sure that I\u0027m correct.\u0022\n\nTake this for example; while yes, she\u0027s not right, she\u0027s not exactly wrong either, she\u0027s just got her terms mixed up. While yes, there is definitely gravity in space, she\u0027s likely thinking because all the Astronauts/Cosmonauts on the ISS are floating, that there must not be. In-fact (as you know) it\u0027s because they\u0027re in constant free-fall due to being in orbit which means they \u0022float\u0022 about, not because a lack of gravity. If you word it right, it won\u0027t seem like you\u0027re \u0022proving her wrong\u0022, more proving her right, just with the correct terminology. Saying \u0022that\u0027s wrong\u0022 means she won\u0027t believe you, no matter how right you are...\n\nIf you turn it into an argument, you\u0027ve failed, give up now..."},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T19:40:07Z","Content":"![intelligence-fail-the-sun-is-a-star.jpg](http://pic.epicfail.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/intelligence-fail-the-sun-is-a-star.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Avatar movie (with the blue cat/smurf people) reference.\n\nIKR.\n\nBut really people.
