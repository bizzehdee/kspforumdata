I have dyspraxia but I don\\\u0027t think it can all be attributed to that.\n\nThis week my major acts of mass destruction have included; One glass of wine, one bottle of beer, several feet, one whole person, ripped pieces of paper (I think I\\\u0027m going to have to use scissors for that pad now), several Kerbal rockets (though I suppose that is normal ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) and (the one that made me start this thread) a toilet while attempting to fix it. Oh and and my pen, repeatedly being knocked of my desk.\n\nSo... Anyone else been incredibly clumsy this week?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T21:26:01Z","Content":"Well, this was several months ago...\n\nI spilled a glass of wine on my desk.\n\nThe wine spilled off my desk and onto my computer.\n\nThe computer tower has ventilation on the top side.\n\nThe wine fell directly into the vent and onto the circuit boards inside.\n\nThe computer screen went black.\n\nI immediately shut off the power. Luckily, after drying it off with a space heater fan, it started up normally and continues to work to this day. This event happened about a month after I got the brand new $1000 machine.\n\nMy official story is that I was experimenting with a new method of liquid-cooling the computer."},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T00:16:37Z","Content":"I did this a month ago:\n\nA cup of soda is directly next to my keyboard, I hit the cup with my mouse by accident, my keyboards top left sides keys are sticky.\n\nThey still are to this day...\n\nIt wore off on the shift key I use, though...\n\nOh yeah and my tablet falls off my bed, hits a needle that\\\u0027s on the floor(It fell from me pinning one of my drawings on the wall.) a medium size scratch goes into my screen, it\\\u0027s still there.\n\nOh yeah this was in November:\n\nMy sister goes to heat up her burger, it\\\u0027s wrapped in tin foil, she puts it in with the tin foil on, five seconds later BANG!\n\nWe went to check, a microwave fire, I got my parents, they put the fire out.\n\nThe microwave surprisingly still works...\n\nOh yeah this happend just recently.\n\nI go onto my computer play minecraft normally, all of the sudden my computer crashes.\n\nThat was due to me setting minecrafts priority high.\n\nI fixed it, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T15:39:08Z","Content":"Umm, I recently experimented with the thermoplastic properties of a tupperware box, which inadvertently ended in an oven... By the time I noticed there was something wrong, half of the box had melted down :-[\n\nI\\\u0027ve stopped eating/drinking near my laptop since that one time I spilled a glass of lemonade right next to it last year (no damage), and no food/drink has approached my new PC at all to prevent further mishaps."}]}
