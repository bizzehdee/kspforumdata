I have tried running as administrator and running directly from the application file, but I still get the same problem. Task manager isn\u0026#39;t showing anything. I have looked all over the steam forums but nothing I have found works. Any ideas on how I can fix this?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T03:17:47Z","Content":"\nStrange.
