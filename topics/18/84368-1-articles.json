I also recommend going to their site (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://facerig.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://facerig.com/\u003C/a\u003E) and/or looking at their steampage (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://store.steampowered.com/app/274920/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://store.steampowered.com/app/274920/\u003C/a\u003E) for a better description, but in short it\u0027s a program that allows webcam users to render their face (and it\u0027s motions/expressions) into a 3D model in realtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears that Facerig is willing to work with other companies to create specific models; they already have the character Octodad, and a Floran from Starbound. In addition, according to this thread on their forums (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://facerig.com/index.php/forum/posts/f7/t49/official-actor-suggestion-thread?hilit=kerbal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://facerig.com/index.php/forum/posts/f7/t49/official-actor-suggestion-thread?hilit=kerbal\u003C/a\u003E), they have already emailed KSP about exactly this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would love the ability to render the faces and expressions of different Kerbals, and it could be a useful tool for content creators.
