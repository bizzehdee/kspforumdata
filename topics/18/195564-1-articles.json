Heck, 73? Wow. If I\u0027m home by myself I keep the house at 67 in the winter and the sun is out. If it gets cloudy, then maybe we bump it to 69. When my wife is home, maybe rarely 70. Usually 60 overnight (house is adobe, so it tends to radiate some heat into the house til late, so it almost never gets as cold as 60, I just don\u0027t want the heat to come on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the summer? 74-76 in the daytime if people are home, if it gets cloudy on the warmer end.
