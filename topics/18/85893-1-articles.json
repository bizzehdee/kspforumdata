Meaning an intentional error Google Earth put into their database to catch people using it without paying. The only places I can see where it appears online are in Google Earth itself, and several lame-looking \u0022airport guide\u0022 sites, like this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.airportia.com/united-states/baltimore-greenbelt-t-airport/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.airportia.com/united-states/baltimore-greenbelt-t-airport/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those sites have the name \u0022Baltimore Greenbelt T\u0022, and the code \u0022GBO\u0022, but their actual coordinates point to the corner of BWI instead of where Google Earth points us. Reputable sites like Airnav don\u0027t show it at all, and I can\u0027t find any record of GBO ever being issued as an airport code. I also couldn\u0027t find it in Google Maps, only Google Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to what I could find, the nearest DC Metro stop to BWI is \u0022Greenbelt\u0022, so that\u0027s perhaps where the name came from. If we could dig deep enough, I bet we\u0027d discover the coords are for some Google database guy\u0027s grandparents house or something. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood catch, rpayne88!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
