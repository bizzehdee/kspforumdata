And it would\u0027ve been cheaper, because you would not have to have made the Zvezda, Zarya, Pirs, Poisk, and Rassvet modules, and it would\u0027ve made a larger Russian segment too. And it wasn\u0027t an orbital inclination problem, as the Shuttle-Mir flights show you. So why did they de-orbit Mir instead of making it into the ISS?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-29T18:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2014 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nicholander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI put MIR instead of Mir, derp.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T18:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, it was getting old. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#Safety_aspects\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#Safety_aspects\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T18:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESimply put, it was getting old. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#Safety_aspects\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#Safety_aspects\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it was more expensive to revamp and repair the existing space station then to make a new one?

It has rubber seals, tubes, lubricants, filters that have a limited life. It has tanks that have a limited number of tanking cycles. It has solar panels and batteries that need replacing. It has communication and data processing equipment that gets old and obsolete. External paint and insulation is bombarded with UV rays. It has consumable fluids and gasses that need replacing. And all of this hardware is running 24/7 in an extreme environment with vacuum and extreme temperature variations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt one point, it becomes cheaper to build a new module than to fix and upgrade the old one.
