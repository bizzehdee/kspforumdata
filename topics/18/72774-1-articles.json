After 2 seconds I start questioning the universe, thinking of paradoxes, all done super quickly, and sometimes hitting my own keyboard. I think extremely quick from my perspective, like in a half of a second I made up a story about time travel which included a paradox. I also might have discovered a way to travel in time. Might also be because its 4:32 Am and Im writting homework for today. Im pretty worried. I also slowly forget what I was thinking during the \u0022drift\u0022 (\u002B1 if you get the reference) or the period in which I was starring. A half of second later I start panicking and paranoia kicks in and I start thinking about being watched by aliens *adjusts tinfoil hat*.
