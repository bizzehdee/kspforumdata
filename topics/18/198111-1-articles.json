Much more...you can dominate the neighborhood\u00A0as top cat, fighting other cats to that end, \u00A0influence your owner not to neuter you, but also be forced to mate due to instinct (also if female you will die or bleed to injury you don\u0027t mate sooner or later). You can make your owner love you, \u00A0hate you, both, save their life or drive them to insanity. Your choice.
