I think it might have included a few more things). Also wait for flash savings, the rule is never buy something that will be on sale to the end unless it is already 75% off (and even then you should wait until at least the end in case it winds up in a nice bundle).\n\nAnother point: according to internet chatter, the steam FAQ on refunds claims that asking for a [standard] refund is fine to get a better sale (I\u0027d read the official document before trying this). This might help if it comes up in the \u0022curtain call\u0022 sales."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:49:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 15% are you kidding me? looks like I won\u0027t be playing this game for a long time ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nIf you\u0027re old enough to complain about how much something costs, you\u0027re old enough to go get a job and pay for it.\n\n$34 is not expensive, even if you work at McDonald\u0027s.
