With Samsung, 2 separate companies make the hardware and the OS, and this results in some terrible things like screen stretch, incompatibility, lag etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple was always and is still considered cool and premium. The design is elite(made from actual metal) unlike the cheap plastic Android tablets you see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple was the pioneer. Apple created the first smartphone with a capacitive multitouch screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple created the pinch zoom. Apple created the auto brightness. Apple created the worlds smallest and most eas to use MP3 player. Apple made the first computer with a UI for gods sake! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple created the famous iPad. Apple created the best editing software and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did Samsng invent? Only a massive screen on phones thanks to which you need a separate bag to carry the phone. Also you need surgery to get longer fingers to reach eac part of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung is known for ripping off Apple. Most recent example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApple makes the worlds first 64 bit smartphone, also with a fingerprint scanner. A few months later, Smasung makes a smartphone with a fingerprint scanner too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, Samsung can\u0027t make smartphones, or tablets.
