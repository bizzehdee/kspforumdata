Can\u0027t wait, we\u0027ve never been there, never been on a \u0022real\u0022 touristy vacation, never been that far south. I\u0027ve flown many times, but my kids haven\u0027t, so it\u0027ll be fun to see their reaction to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got my shirt for Disney:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zdSv02D.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zdSv02D.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022576\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, being a space geek, I have to drag my family on a pilgrimage to see OV-105 \u003Cem\u003EEndeavor\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eat the California Science Center, and I have a shirt for that trip too:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fW1xIrI.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fW1xIrI.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022576\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully when I\u0027m driving the rental car to/from CSC I\u0027ll find a way to drive past SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne.

However, I notice that SpaceX has an Iridium launch from Vandy penciled in for June with no actual date set yet. I realize the\u00A0chance\u00A0of it actually launching while I\u0027m there is remote, but if it does, then of course I\u0027d really want to go watch, but that just probably won\u0027t be in the cards, given the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question, for those familiar with the Anaheim/L.A. area, would a launch from Vandenberg (on the slim chance there\u0027ll be one) be visible from DisneyLand, or at least from the rooftop lounge of my hotel (Grand Legacy at the Park)?

I will reiterate what others have said here: Do not underestimate Los Angeles traffic. It was bad when I last lived there six years ago, and it has only gotten worse. Rush hour extends well outside of the hours you would normally associate with rush hour. In the morning it starts at about 6:00 and runs until 9:30-10:00. In the afternoon it starts sometime between 2:30-3:00 and runs until about 7:00. You will find that there is rush hour traffic on the weekends as well. For example: Disneyland to Universal Studios, 35 miles up the 5 freeway, you\u0027re looking at \u003Cu\u003Eat least\u003C/u\u003E an hour and a half during traffic.

I was raised on it. There was one within walking distance of my house growing up. The fact that the town we moved to in Arizona had an In-N-Out is really nice, I eat lunch there probably every other week. But, for destination eateries for tourists visiting Southern California, I actually put it pretty far down the list. It\u0027s a really good burger, but there isn\u0027t anything particularly unique about it. Most people can get a really good burger in their home towns, either at a regional chain or a local joint. The individual In-N-Out restaurants aren\u0027t particularly historic or noteworthy. Even the original Baldwin Park location is just another restaurant next to the corporate headquarters now. I don\u0027t think a trip there would be disappointing, the food is great. But I think that if someone is asking for a classic Southern California dining experience, especially if they have limited opportunities, there are lots of places I would send them before In-N-Out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone were to ask me for a unique Southern California fast-food burger experience I would send them to Tommy\u0027s, especially the original shack down at Beverly and Rampart. That\u0027s a burger that you can\u0027t get anywhere else, in a historic location that has been preserved. But that would be with lots of caveats, because I know that even in SoCal Tommy\u0027s can be polarizing. Everyone either loves it or hates it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-04T20:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the options guys.
