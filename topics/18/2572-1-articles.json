They\\\u0027re planning to shoot people into space on the tip of a can full of explosives. What they\\\u0027re doing is inherantly dangerous, and will likely be for a long time. They\\\u0027ve lost numerous rockets in the past to launch failures. The payloads of those were (as far as I know) unable to be recovered.

Buy from U.S. companies... we\\\u0027re one of them!) That old stick in the mud... they say we need seatbelts or something... Did the space shuttle even have seatbelts?
