Basically, for people who want PC power, but a more console like experience, if there were only 2 or 3 models of Steam Machine, released say, every two years, then it would be possible for developers to create graphical presets that cater specifically to that hardware. With 20 some odd designs, or whatever they are up to now, I don\u0027t think the idea works, except to cater to people who are willing to buy very expensive consoles if it means not building their own (which to be fair, is a market segment, though I don\u0027t know how big it is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a cool idea, but I think they failed to execute it in a way that gives people much of a reason to buy a steam machine instead of a normal PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T02:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222419843\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455929797\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156366\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AquaAlmond Productions\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn February 20, 2016 at 5:56 PM, AquaAlmond Productions said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious about what you think in the debate of steam machine vs console.
