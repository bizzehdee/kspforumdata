I\u0027d appreciate some feedback on the idea. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNow that may sound boring, but; the way I picture it is that it would be similar to something like Farmville, except instead of waiting for your crops to grow; you\u0027re waiting for your spacecraft to arrive at it\u0027s location. \n\nUnlike with KSP, this game would focus a lot on what happens prior to the mission beyond just designing the rocket. What I\u0027m thinking is designing missions, playing with simulators of space missions (with time accelerations) and training astronauts to fill in the gaps between your flights. (Note; the game would probably include futuristic yet realistic rocketry in order to shorten the gaps between flights to planets to months instead of years, although the technology would start as simple chemical rockets.)\n\nDoes the idea sound okay? Feel free to give constructive criticism. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T23:51:17Z","Content":"The only part that worries me is the real-time part. Even if you did manage to shorten the trips from years to months.... It\u0027s still going to be real-time? I think that you would indeed be better off to make it a FV-type game where missions could perhaps take at most a couple of days. Anything beyond 2 days is likely going to throw a huge audience off of a pretty slim audience anyway.\n\nThe rest of your ideas sound really good, though! Me gusta!

The planets would be visit-able, however, these planets would be the goals for the experienced players. I expect that most players of the game would go no further than the planets orbits and most of their goals would be to go to the moon. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nUnlike with KSP, there would be more of an insensitive to send up satellites and space stations rather than to explore the other planets because science on this game would actually be useful to the player beyond giving them science points; for example telescopes could be erected in space to spot asteroids. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks for the feedback though; I think that I\u0027m comfortable with most missions lasting a few days, but I don\u0027t like the idea of missions lasting longer than a month. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T19:08:49Z","Content":"maybe a star trek game with orbital mechanics... or star wars... or IXS simulator 2015"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:07:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I understand the issues related to the long periods it would take for missions, however, the way the game would be played differs from KSP in the respect that in KSP a few missions take place over a single play session, while on this game, single missions would take place over multiple play sessions.\n\nOuch ouch ouch. I\u0027m sorry, but I honestly believe that will hurt the game way more than it will make it interesting. Having one mission be the entire focus, especially on a mobile game, will not go well. I mean, please keep in mind that this is all opinion, but I believe the best way to do it would be to have a roster of multiple missions that could all happen simultaneously, allowing the player to get more done. This still allows players to gain expertise simply from trying to balance all the missions efficiently. \n\nAnd it\u0027s good that you\u0027re comfy with the days-long missions, but if doing such a mission takes away the ability to do anything else in the meantime, then people will become disinterested fast!\n\nAnd thanks for hearing our suggestions ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:21:45Z","Content":"Sounds interesting, as long as it\u0027s (as said above), multiple missions, and not just the one.\n\nA space program in your pocket, I like the idea. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T01:08:12Z","Content":"I like it!
