The trilogy includes The Broken God, The Wild, and The War in Heaven, and have been liken to Frank Herbert\u0027s Dune. These novels explore quite deep on philosophy and the boundary of science, of transhumanism and the vastness of space. Imagine a universe where gods are human beings uploading their consciousness to computers the size of a galaxy made up from nanobots, and pilots of lightships navigate through vast distance by using pure math to fold space into itself. It is not hard science fiction by any stretch, but it sure is a beautiful fiction of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have read them? I recommend you to read them if you haven\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T06:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBought them on amazon now.

While the whole trilogy has one main protagonist, Neverness is about the father of said protagonist and his exploit. You don\u0027t have to read Neverness to understand the trilogy, but it can help you understand the world around it and events that lead up to the main story.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
