In my more than 25 years of computer gaming (Intellivision FTW! ;D ), I think this is one of the few games I\u0027ve played that didn\u0027t require you to shoot anyone, blow something up etc to have fun. Simcity is the only other one that comes to mind, and that got boring real quick if you didn\u0027t introduce tornados or some disaster. I wish my kids were old enough to play (oldest is 5), this game would be a hoot for middle school and high school kids to learn about rockets, physics etc. My wife even thought it was a cool idea, and her idea of a fun game is Majjong. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I laugh just thinking about the Kermans and all of the crazy launch attempts.

Mirrors Edge is a example of publishers taking the risk (and turned out to be well worth it), pretty original and fun game. You also have Victoria 2, with a pretty epic story:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [**Development**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_II#Development)\n\u003E The decision to create Victoria II was influenced by voting on the Paradox Interactive forums and debate within the company. The CEO of Paradox Interactive, Fredrik Wester, publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as Johan Andersson were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum.[13] This belief stemmed from the first game\u0027s lackluster sales numbers. It was revealed in a German interview with Frederik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable.[14] On 17 June, Jessica Chobot from IGN shaved it off for him.[15]"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T23:25:42Z","Content":"Welcome to the business of gaming.

I remember a time when I walked into a game store, and I was forced to pick out but a few of the many great games, since I couldn\u0027t afford them all... now, it\u0027s a rare day when a game draws my attention... I think I buy around 1 or 2 games a year now... Back then it used to be dozens (and I had less cash).\n\nMaybe I\u0027ve grown picky as I got older, but I have a strong feeling that it was the games themselves that have gotten less interesting.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T00:14:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They pick proven concepts to avoid financial risks as much as possible.\n\nThis is why the gaming industry has slowly tanked over the years and why indies are able to survive by staying small.

People still love these generic copies of generic copies. They not only have a target safe zone, they also have a target audience willing to take it. There are large amounts of people that are still going crazy of Halo 4 and MW3. That\u0027s not only the state of companies, but the state of consumers right now. It\u0027s a symbiotic relationship.
