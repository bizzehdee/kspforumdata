They send a large fleet to investigate and find that the artifact is a massive archive of the collective knowledge of an alien race from many millions of years ago. The story goes into the details of the investigation and has a lot of specific detail about the aliens themselves, the state of their technology when the ship crashed and how the human society would cope with the repercussions of this discovery. The book didn\u0027t seem to be dominated by politics or war, more by a sense of exploration into the unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember it was a very long book (\u0026gt;1000 pages easily) and I must have raced through it in a week (when I should have been studying for my exams!). I was completely hooked by it and then consequently either lost or gave the book to a friend, never to see it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone recognise this story? Please let me know of some titles or authors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis book reminds me of the \u0022Halo\u0022 video game, the movies \u0022The Time Machine\u0022, \u0022Contact\u0022 and \u0022Mission to Mars\u0022, the book \u0022A for Andromeda\u0022, and somewhat of \u00222001: A Space Odyssey\u0022. But it is not related to any of those as far as I can recall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is driving me nuts! I think of this book often and crave a chance to re-read it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xorth Tanovar","CreatedById":71205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T13:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm. Plot sounds familiar, but then again it\u0027s probably been visited by many authors over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot what you\u0027re looking for, but in a similar vein is \u0022The Second Earth\u0022 by Patrick Woodroffe...he\u0027s primarily an artist (and the illustrations in the book are definitely interesting), and the story is a re-telling of an older musical piece by David Greenslade (was then titled \u0022The Pentateuch of the Cosmogony\u0022).
