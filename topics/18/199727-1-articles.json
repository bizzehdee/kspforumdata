But they go onto admit that the cause was not from the plant, but from down stream in the pipes because of a lack of anti corrosives added when they switched to the river.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since the news is not showing the entire document and being transparent.

Or it\u0027s simply stating the water source is not the problem. At which point that is a correct statement as the water itself is not the problem or poisonous. It\u0027s just the lack of stuff added to stop the pipes from rusting once in the pipes.(In other words was the guy just giving a technical explanation? Or was he required to do so?) The formatting of this news is way out of line of serious reporting and does not attempt to accurately reflect the information potentially(or at least thoroughly.). If this is taking this out of line. I hope they guy they are trying to put in jail is not someone who was just telling them what it was in a more technical manner. Especially, if he was required to by law or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere was all of this in the process of figuring out the issue? Were they already doing what they were supposed to? And was the water the problem or the lead in the pipes if it was already there. I think they were changing the pipes out later as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-20T20:24:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2021 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalMechanic","CreatedById":205096,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-29T14:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are others ways that dirty water can move around other than going downstream.
