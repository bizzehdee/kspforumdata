Did any of the ships in the class keep those guns and torpedo launchers?\n\nI am not sure of which theater they operated in so i am going to assume they operated in both theaters. Pretty much, ship weapons were modified based on need. Ships in the pacific theater had an increase in AA firepower and a decrease in other weapons. In the atlantic and baltic, they faced a submarine threat so most were given an increase in surface firepower and more depth charges."},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T01:14:26Z","Content":"You might be able to dig the info out of photos:\n\n[http://www.navsource.org/archives/04idx.htm](http://www.navsource.org/archives/04idx.htm)"}]}
