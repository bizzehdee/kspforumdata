I was very excited when I heard about it. I love Skylon. This programme is great for Skylon lovers and just if you have any interest in space/rockets/aerospace whatsoever. I believe it will next be shown on BBC 4, at 23:40 Saturday 15 Sep. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01mqv45/sign/The_Three_Rocketeers/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01mqv45/sign/The_Three_Rocketeers/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
