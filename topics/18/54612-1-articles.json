Sure they used to be bad, but they really aren\u0027t that bad nowadays. Back in the days of the Intel GMA (with the Intel Core 2) were useless, yes, but the current top of the range Intel IGP (HD4000) has worked quite well for me, and the Haswell generation looking to compete with Nvidia and AMD in the midrange market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy laptop has a Intel HD4000 with it\u0027s i7, that uses 1.6GB of RAM as VRAM and that\u0027s managed to pull 30fps for BF3; Source Engine games at max; Skyrim at medium high with a few beautification mods and draw distance upped; Fallout New Vegas at medium high (it\u0027s old but still rather tough); ARMA 2 at medium low (full draw distance); and basically it will make any cross platform game run like it\u0027s on a console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t get why people think they\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E terrible.

The newest integrated chips are admittedly pretty impressive when you look at what they can do and what they do it with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you want to run all your games on maximum settings with a high frame rate, you need way more computational power than integrated graphics can provide, and the graphical difference between playing a game at medium and playing it at max is often quite substantial, particularly when it comes to things like shadows, water/water reflection, and ambient occlusion, which are all things notorious for being extremely demanding to do well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T19:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt all depends on what you want to do with your computer. If all you need to do is watch a film, surf the web, and occasionally play some game, they\u0027ll do just fine. But even the best integrated chip can\u0027t come close to what a dedicated graphics card can do, and most people simply don\u0027t care for playing a game on medium or lower graphics and still not getting above something as low as 30fps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordlundar","CreatedById":81040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T22:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start with, Most laptops video systems (especially ones designed for gaming) don\u0027t technically qualify as \u0022Integrated\u0022.
