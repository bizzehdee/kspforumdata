However, what\u0027s most important is how much moisture is in Irma\u0027s path. Currently it\u0027s inching towards a rather dry area of the atmosphere, but it looks like the extratropical cyclone at 25N/53.5W may help provide much needed moisture for the system. In addition, while dry air is progressing further into the Caribbean, the Flash WV Satellite Loop shows that the moisture-rich clump of thunderstorms currently at about 27N/57.5W will continue to flare up and push into the area around Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. This is exactly where Irma is headed.

However, on September 10th, Irma will begin to turn north towards Florida and exit Cuba with a larger wind field. Still likely to be a Category 4 at that time. The next day, on 9/11, Irma will make landfall around Naples, FL with 180 mph winds. Like Tropical Storm Fay from 2008, Irma will continue vertically through the entire state of Florida as it continues to weaken. By September 12th, it will be over Georgia with 115 mph winds, mainly displaced to the north. Finally, on the 13th, Irma will have weakened to a 50-60 mph tropical storm with a HUGE wind field over Tennessee.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, that tropical wave given a 70% chance of development will develop into Tropical Storm Jose by September 6th, with winds of 40 to 50 mph. It will continue to move northwest, gaining strength as it goes. By the 7th it will reach 70 mph wind speeds (with the strongest winds displaced to the north), and by the 8th we should expect Hurricane Jose with 90 mph winds while a few hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles. At this time, Irma will be over Cuba and the Bahamas. Jose will start moving more north-northwest, get better organized, and possibly become a 105 mph Category 2 storm by the 9th. Jose will maintain Category 2 intensity until 9/11, when it may become a 120 mph Category 3 storm several hundred miles north of St. Martin Island. While it may seem like Jose will strike Bermuda, by the evening of the 11th or the morning of the 12th, it will make a sharp turn and instead travel east-northeast. It may be a 130 mph Category 4 hurricane at that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVentusky does not suggest any other tropical cyclone development during the next week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
