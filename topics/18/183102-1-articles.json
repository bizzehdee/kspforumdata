As it happens, it is also a game that greatly allows--and requires--creative skills to be applied directly to design and engineering tasks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know that all of you are great creators and engineers (yes, even if your education is not formally in engineering, you have to grasp some concepts to play KSP).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlong these ideas, I believe that the opinions and knowledge of KSP players are very valuable for my research.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have the time, please help me by completing this brief survey.

That said, if the change is really at hand (graduation, for example) by all means answer along that line instead of \u0022student\u0022 (also, congratulations!). This means that we could consider this as a \u0022transitional state\u0022 of sorts, so it\u0027s OK. However, it should be about present and immediate future (days) but not years. So, if you turn 20 tomorrow and graduate next week, I\u0027m fine with that. The survey reflects your opinions, and it\u0027s not like you are going to think radically differently today than tomorrow after receiving you diploma \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
