Well more like a new line of tablets... One will have windows RT, another will have windows 8 pro. They will almost be the same, the windows 8 pro will run a intel i5, it will weigh more than the windows RT and will be thicker. They each have a magnetic keyboard that acts as a smart cover as well, and a tablestand that slides out of the back. I might sell my tablet for it.(I\\\u0027ll also save extra money just incase it costs more.) \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T18:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei5 processor in a tablet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s play games better than my laptop. *drool*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T18:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDup topic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14671.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14671.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T18:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei5 processor in a tablet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s play games better than my laptop. *drool*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m pretty sure thats what the video said that.
