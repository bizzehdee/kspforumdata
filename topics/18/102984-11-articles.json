The dream SCARED me at the time. Also, it\u0027s much weirder than it seems\n\nOkay. I had the dream at my grandma\u0027s house back in third-ish grade. For some reason, I decided to go back to sleep and just flopped over onto the bed. [Start dream!] I was in the outskirts of the recess area at my school. It was foggy and I was just walking forward. There was a large knife on the ground and I picked it up for no apparent reason. I continued walking until I saw a small fox climbing a tree to get some eggs out of a birds nest. I took it down and stabbed it in the head and it ran away unharmed. I then stabbed the eggs and a bakugan came out of one of them. A subterra brontes to be exact. [End dream!]\n\nOkay... that was weird. I can explain! Firstly, the fox. I\u0027ve been in a special-ed program since the middle of first grade (I\u0027m a junior in HS now), and my parents were going to send me to a proper special-ed school (not that far away, like a mile or two) soon (middle of third grade year). My last name is Fox. The stabbing and running away symbolized me moving schools forcefully. I probably overheard my parents and/or teachers talking about it at one point.\n\nNow the simpler part; the eggs. The egg drop challenge was later that day. It\u0027s a thing where you build a device to protect an egg from a long fall. Most contraptions used a combination of garbage bag parachutes and cotton balls in a shoe box. Yeah. Lotsa eggs got smooshed. Also, I was really, REALLY into bakugan back then.\n\nSee?

Not to big of a deal, just not being able to move is a little scary. And if you\u0027ve experienced this before, you know that you will most likely hallucinate as well. This happened to be one of those nights.\n\nAfter about maybe 5 to 15 seconds later, I start hallucinating. I see countryballs. Weird. This sort of caught me off guard because maybe 10 seconds later the countryballs disappeared and I started to see creepy and extremely scary horror stuff that I though I tucked away in my mind for good.
