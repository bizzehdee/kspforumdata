I\u0027ve been playing KSP on my 2011 MacBook Pro for a while now, and in general I am impressed by the way this Apple laptop can handle mid-range KSP graphics so far. I know gaming on a Mac is not incredibly traditional but it\u0027s what I\u0027m doing so I have a few questions about performance on other Apple computers and I would love some input. I still receive a good amount of lag, and I\u0027d love to be able to have an additional few mods, but of course that can be stretching it a bit even for Windows computers with this game. Not only that, but it is sometimes uncomfortable to play on a laptop and I\u0027ve been contemplating getting a new desktop for a long while now, so here are my questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat types of specs should I look for specifically for better a KSP experience? (RAM, GPU, CPU, GHz, etc?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo Intel Iris Pro Graphics on the new iMacs work well compared to the Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB on my laptop?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lower end iMacs have fairly low GHz. What is an acceptable range for GHz if I wanted KSP to run well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have experience with KSP on the new iMacs, and if so, could you detail a bit of your pros and cons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn general, will KSP run noticeably better on any of the new iMacs compared to my 2011 MacBook Pro, and what specs should I look for most?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.apple.com/imac/specs/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.apple.com/imac/specs/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Note: These are merely theoretical computer/spec questions, and of course I don\u0027t intend on buying an entire iMac just to play KSP.

Ask the guys in the Computer Building Megathread (stickied in this subforum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, before telling you what to get, what will this computer be used for besides KSP? If you\u0027re accustomed to the Mac platform and do the type of things those are good for, go ahead with the iMac if you really want. But, for good performance I\u0027d get the highest end one you can afford. But, in practice, prioritize what the computer needs to do for you. Are you doing more light stuff and the type of apps Macs run, or is it for gaming? If gaming is a primary consideration, by all means built your own PC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T05:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe one overriding factor for KSP performance ATM (Come on Unity 5...) is \u003Cem\u003Esingle-threaded CPU performance\u003C/em\u003E, as such, go for the fastest Intel CPU you can find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel integrated graphics should be OK, but a mid-range discrete GPU will be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, yeah, Macs are shiny and all but you\u0027ll get better specs per $ building a PC... you can even run is as a hackintosh if you can\u0027t part with OSX \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T05:39:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T09:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played KSP mostly on my old iMac (i7-870, Radeon 5750).
