Today I was reading one of my astronomy books, and I noticed something! One of Saturn\u0027s moons, a small one called Enceladus, looks a lot like Minmus in this artist\u0027s impression! I\u0027m surprised I don\u0027t see Jeb, Bill, Bob or Valentina on there! I love the color of this picture and of Minmus in general, too! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![image1.jpg](http://s15.postimg.org/yk5krvagr/image1.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:20:35Z","Content":"Enceladus reflects 99.2% of light that touches its surface.
