Me personally? I have a Maus, three tier 9s, a few tier 8s, and far far too many other tanks.

There\u0027s also a third group of people who like WoT: those that have realized that the game is built in a way that makes every tier exactly as viable as the next. There is, simply put, nothing to \u0022win\u0022 by getting to tier 10. I think a lot of people subconsciously expect a sensation or event akin to \u0022winning\u0022 when they get there, because that\u0027s how video games usually work and we gamers are conditioned to expect it. But WoT doesn\u0027t give you that, and that turns a lot of people sour. They say: \u0022I spent all this time grinding, and for what? This is no different from any other tier, just with different vehicles!\u0022 And yes, that\u0027s the truth of the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying just to get to tier 10 is doing it completely wrong. You should play to unlock vehicles that interest you, and make note of those you meet along the way that sync surprisingly well with you. Thus, the longer you play, the more vehicles you will have in your garage that you truly enjoy. The tiers of those vehicles are largely irrelevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe personally, I had no particular goal in mind, I just played. And for some odd reason, I find that tier 7 really resonates well with me. Part of this is the German 8,8 cm KwK 43 L/71, as well as it\u0027s PaK variant. I don\u0027t know why, but no other gun in this game feels just so \u003Cem\u003Ereliable\u003C/em\u003E to me. There are guns on this tier with more penetration, and guns with more burst damage, but this particular one just gives me a hard to describe feeling of security. I know I will have a shell available when I need it, and I know it will strike true. For this reason, I did really well with the two Tigers (yes, even the paperthin Henschel Tiger is one of my highest scoring tanks), and the Jagdpanther... oh lord, the Jagdpanther. So good. And though I at first struggled with the Panther and its tiny needlegun, eventually it clicked there too and I had great fun. But it\u0027s not only Germans. Tier 7 also has great things from the other nations, such as the American T20 and T29, or the soviet T-43. And I also found great tanks on the two neighboring tiers, such as the KV-1S and KV-4, or the Hellcat and Pershing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that that is my personal sweetspot, where the vehicles I like are located. So when I play WoT, that\u0027s what I drive. I haven\u0027t unlocked tier 9 and 10, and I frankly don\u0027t feel like I have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther people may find their sweetspot elsewhere. I have met at least one person with more than 1000 games who never drove anything but tier 1. Ever. And he was obviously having fun enough to play over 1000 rounds, so why should he be grinding higher tiers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T08:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022I spent all this time grinding, and for what?
