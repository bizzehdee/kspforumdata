Now, I have a little experience in photo manipulation using a similar free program called Paint.net, so I am not going in completely blind, but Photoshop is an immensely more powerful tool, so I will need some crash course to guide me around and practice a bit. Google has been very helpful, and in fact, too helpful, as it gives me a ton of options and I have no idea which I should take to make most of my time. I still have like a month or so for handing in applications, but I could use that to practice other employable skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone, in their experience, know a good place to find resources for practical professional use of Photoshop? It doesn\u0027t have to be super high level manipulation, as I am not applying for a designer job, just a PR/Marketing Intern, and likely have to do at most basic\u00A0photo manipulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
