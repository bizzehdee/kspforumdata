With the new episode 8 teaser out, and Star Wars once again being talked about, I\u0027d like to know everyone\u0027s opinions and theories on Snoke\u0027s Identity. Here is my theory:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of episode three Vader is shown to have completely recovered in his new body. The film makes it seem like that happened in a few hours, but he was on the edge of dying, any operation like that would take a month at least. My theory is the emperor got scared of Vader dying midway through his \u0022resurrection\u0022 and had a clone of anakin/Vader grown for \u0022spare parts,\u0022 and that clone is snoke. That\u0027s why they have near identical injuries, snokes being worse, as the parts of Vaders tissue too damaged to regrow were replaced and\u00A0transplanted from an intact snoke, explaining why snokes injurys are missing parts of the tissue, while Vaders are oddly shallow\u00A0and\u00A0are a lighter colour of skin. You\u0027ll also notice that Vaders right cheek looks scarred, and slightly deformed, like it doesn\u0027t fit quite right,\u00A0and a different colour, while snoke IS MISSING HIS CHEEK ON THAT SIDE. explaining the injuries. After the operation, snoke was probably frozen in carbonite somewhere on Corscant, in case Vaders injuries got worse and he needed new tissue, but they never did. A frozen snoke would then have been forgotten about after the destruction of the second Death Star, and found by a young Ben Solo, who unfroze him and trained with him in secret, believing snoke could make him more powerful,\u00A0up until Kylo, under his influence destroyed the Jedi school and set the events of episode VII in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to rip this to shreds, the ending part with Ben finding him is a bit iffy especially. Please post your theories here, or comment on mine or other people\u0027s, but please don\u0027t get agressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor moderators, I checked everything under 2.2\u00A0In the rules, and I don\u0027t think this topic includes anything that would classify as something in that section, but please correct me if this is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T09:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit\u0027s nice i see that like usual maxx zorn , translucide brown ductape, scalpel and highlight from behind, copy past and copyright the wheel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiffedStarfish","CreatedById":175356,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T09:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmm.

The injuries would be due to tissues being transplanted to Vader to replace tissue, leaving snoke with similar injuries. As for the age, snoke, as a clone\u00A0would have had been grown at a highly accelerated rate, like the clone soldiers, to have similar ages of cells for transplanting, and would then have aged normally, until being frozen in carbonite, basically freezing his ageing up until being thawed, leaving him around 70-85ish biological age\u00A0I think.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T20:43:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by MiffedStarfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T20:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory is that Vader was always two people, Anakin, and Vader.
