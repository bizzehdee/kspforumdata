Most home internet service uses a dynamic IP which changes from time to time... I\u0027d recommend using a dynamic DNS (\u0022DDNS\u0022) service so that your friends can always connect no matter the IP. I\u0027ve always had good luck with the free service from no-ip.com\n\nBasically you register with whichever service and pick a name (something like sampaminecraft.nameofddns.com), then download a small program which goes on your computer. The program checks your IP every few minutes and updates the DDNS if anything changes. Some home routers actually have the ability to update a DDNS themselves without installing anything extra on your computer but they tend to only support services that \u0022partner\u0022 with the router\u0027s manufacturer.\n\nOnce you have it set up, your friends can then use your DDNS address no matter what your IP happens to be that day/week/month."}]}
