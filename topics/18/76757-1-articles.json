Except for the one game breaking bug that I am rather highly, HIGHLY ticked off about right now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas in a server, my PC disconeccted from the internet for around 5 minutes. I log back into the game and all my characters stuff is gone! Starting completly over now. I went to the nearby town to try and get some weapons and a random zombie appears and eats my brains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a really fun game it just needs the bugs worked out, the dev states multiple times that it is early alpha but honestly a few bugs needed to be worked out BEFORE the released an alpha version in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
