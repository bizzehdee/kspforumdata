I am unable to find any info on my situation and what to do, so I decided to ask here in case anybody knows (since many KSP members make videos) I make ski videos, somewhat inspirational, which means I want to choose the right song for the perfect effect. I am in the process of remixing a song for this purpose, making it so it will better suit the video and its mood. I do not plan to distribute the remix directly in any way (as in a direct download). The video will be on YouTube, with the edited song as background music, mixed in with occasional audio from the original ski recordings. I will also give credit to the original artists, saying that I do not take any credit for the original song or any of its parts. Also, I \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E purchase the original song (througj Google Play Music.) So, it it legal to post the video containing the edited song, the video being for a purpose other than sharing the music, also including a bit (probably in the description) giving all credits for the original to the creator? Or is there something else I have to do in addition to that? I\u0027m new in these \u0022fields\u0022 so any help is greatly appreciated .\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T04:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think remixes are protected in the eu, much the way parody is here in the us. the problem is the music and movie industry has a stranglehold on the democratic party through intense lobbying, and so can make anything it doesn\u0027t like illegal, including dj works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T05:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe look up \u0022transformative art.\u0022 Most examples cover visual designs, but I think it sums up remixes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T05:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way youtube operates is that if you use *ANY* copyrighted material you have to be able to show them that you have permission from whomever owns the rights to it, otherwise it\u0027s subject to being identified by their content id system.
