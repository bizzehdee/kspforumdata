I made ,including but not limited to, a large factory, a smeltery(?), an office building, my rail lines and a house. But then I thought about Mystcraft. That\u0027s the beginning of the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to do Mystcraft in survival mode, and use up my abundant resources, so I moved far away and played with it for a bit. Mind you, earlier I deleted my waypoints because I thought I wasn\u0027t going to go anywhere else. Needless to say, I was quite confused about the writing desk, lectern, and the book stand. Then I started spamming right click on the books. I was immediately teleported to a new age. I nearly died from a broken heart that my world was gone. After one or two Google searches later I discovered a command to teleport me to the Overworld. I immediately took advantage of it. My tears of joy quickly turned to tears of dread and I soon learned that I spawned most likely a couple 1000 blocks away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough my work is lost, I feel no anger, as is also felt when one loses his/her diamonds to a creeper. I feel much more peaceful, as if a huge load has been taken off my shoulders. I feel as if I had been given a new start, another chance to start anew. I feel no regret, nor anger, nor remorse. I feel better now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESehr, sehr, gut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
