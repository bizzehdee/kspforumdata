Too simple of an universe to sustain it?\n\nAlso, I\u0027m not sure if a Flatland could sustain intelligent life. Having one less spatial dimension certainly would severely limit the amount of neural connections in a certain \u0022space\u0022 (I want to say volume, but there is no such thing as volume in 2D), so its inhabitants would either have really big, inefficient brains or have some kind of different neural system.\n\nBut assuming that somehow intelligent life thrived there, how would their writing work? Binary, or something similar to Morse code, I\u0027m guessing?\n\nBeing a 4D being watching a 3D universe must be fun. Being able to see our insides and all. Certainly an interesting sight.

Once I touch and start to break I am hitting someone on the side with the wing. I got judged and forbid to fly anymore. Some time after while I am drinking at a bar terrace a man wearing dark glasses stop by me, said he know me and that he had a solution to my problem if I could fly with some others persons for some special reasons in conflict areas. I say \u0022yes\u0022 and then start to fly on an Antonov An-12 in Africa to deliver weapons to some groups, drugs or mercenaries and this for years. Then one day we have to extract the leader of a country in revolt, the guy embark onboard while we got shot by others in the destroyed terminal, we aligned and started the take-off roll. We keep on accelerating while still being fired at, we climbed slowly then after some seconds a MANPAD missile is hitting us, breaking the left wings.
