It\u0027s Kerbals\u0027 version of rocket science. They are silly, but still pseudo-silly, in the fact that they are capable of doing things. They can add more boosters, but they first plop a Kerbal Engineer chip on it to figure out if there\u0027s an increase in delta-v. If they find there is, they\u0027re fine, and launch it. They also add some more struts, that is if it keeps wobbling. A small, dampened wobbly oscillation is fun, but wobble, just plain \u003Cem\u003Ewobble\u003C/em\u003E, is not. If it does not benefit the delta-v enough, they\u0027ll launch it, or they don\u0027t. They choose what seems more fun. Jeb is brave, not that much of an idiot. He can find fun in strapping himself into a chair glued to a Rockomax BACC the first time, but once he dies a few times, he loses some interest and moves on to liquid fueled rockets. He can fly the Aeris 4A into orbit and back with fuel to spare, but he makes sure to modify the design to be slightly safer if his comrades are going to take his place, to benefit Kerbalkind. He builds a stock helicopter, then. He plays with it a little, but once he gets the hang of it more and makes it fun, easy, and even a little safe, the heroic Jeb jumps into his seat in the cockpit of his helicopter and flies off to the sunset to go rescue his good friend Bill, who was in a plane crash yesterday, and radioed him for help soon after!
