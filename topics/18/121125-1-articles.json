They were originally in an HTML file for personal use, but I soon wanted to have it online. Seeing as I couldn\u0027t find anywhere that I could host the file for free (I\u0027m a cheap SOB) I transferred it to google sites. It\u0027s basically a project to collect various useful, neat, and/or obscure NASA links, pages, and websites. I\u0027m just posting it here so that it gets some exposure and as a \u0022why not\u0022 sort of deal. I know self-advertisement is frowned upon but I figure that if devs of games on the forums make threads for their games and link to their site why can\u0027t I make a thread for my site? It\u0027s a bit smallish, but I hope to add links to it all the time. It\u0027s also my first venture into creating a website, so it might be a bit rough around the edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/nasalinksaktflyme/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sites.google.com/site/nasalinksaktflyme/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T23:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool!

This is my first attempt at a server, so it might take some time to get it all figured out. I already found a cheap url (Drozd.com.de, less than a dollar per month) and I am hosting it on the newest raspberry pi. My internet is very fast, but I am in Europe, so there might just be some speed decrease. The server has 32 gigs of total memory, and is going to be used for teamspeak (maybe), personal email, irc chat and websites. If it\u0027s not enough I could connect a decently fast drive to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
