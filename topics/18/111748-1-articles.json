Just go down to the local motorbike shop and get yourself a leather cap; it\u0027ll be cheaper and easier to chew!\n\n(The above may/may not have been a joke)\n\n--------------------------\n\nAs for me, I like meatloaf with a lot of ketchup. Any sort of pasta with a smooth \u0026 sweet tomato sauce is also a favorite. I also like a straight lettuce or lettuce, onion, and tomato salad with italian dressing or my own special dressing that uses Ken\u0027s Steak House Sweet Vidalia Onion dressing as a base. I\u0027ve loved Sub sandwiches for as long as I can remember. Vanilla ice cream in a bowl or a milkshake has also been a long-loved favorite. \n\nI also hate pancakes, or as you call them, flapjacks. I\u0027ve never been keen on any breakfast food now that I think of it; The only thing I\u0027ve ever liked in the breakfast category is toast, and that\u0027s good anytime, and can be used as part of a Canape, so it isn\u0027t strictly confined to breakfast."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T04:54:47Z","Content":"learn 2 grill. i hate it when people overcook their meat."},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T05:37:39Z","Content":"Never heard of it.\n\nMy favourite food is beefsteak with either cream pepper sauce or cream mushroom sauce, steak potatoes, green beans and bacon and some good vine.\n\nI also like sushi, fajitas and generally anything beef/pork(or boar)/turkey/fish that includes a piece of meat.\n\nUnfortunately, even though I\u0027ve been in many high class restaurants, nothing comes close to my father\u0027s cooking. Steaks especially are surgically prepared and cooked with \u002B- second precision but even his sushi is incomparably better than any I\u0027ve had in specialized sushi restaurants (which is not surprising as it takes him like 2 hours to prepare and then it needs to be left in the fridge for a few hours - not something most restaurants can do).\n\nWhat I do not like are various mashes like the haggis in the OP."}]}
