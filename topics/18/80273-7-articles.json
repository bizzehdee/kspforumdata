Ultimately, this tends to result in better, less expensive products and services. From what I can observe, each \u0022brand\u0022 sells a range of quality/ price options. We all benefit from these choices, whatever these may be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there is always someone out there that is the first to bring an innovation to market. Apple was not the first company to market a home computer and software. Remember the Radio Shack Tandy computer and Commodore (and Basic)? Sure, even these were not the first. But they paved the way for the masses. The mouse and the GUI were not invented by Apple or Microsoft or IBM (you may recall the Canadian Navy\u0027s Datar track wheel system, MIT\u0027s (OK, Sutherland\u0027s) sketchpad, Stanford\u0027s On-Line System and Xerox PARC), but the mouse and GUI were first popularized and brought to the masses by Apple. Of course the major market share of \u0022PCs\u0022 is currently held by Microsoft, whose Windows 1.0 OS relied on GUI elements licensed from Apple. The common element here to me is competition and recognizing and capitalizing upon innovation, as well as financial brawn and savvy. If you can innovate, do it. If you can\u0027t innovate, buy or license it. If you don\u0027t want to do that, copy it (if you can get away with it, apparently, \u003Cem\u003Eregardless of the company in question\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for smartphones with touch surfaces, the IBM Simon might be the first of those, but Apple popularized a much more advanced concept in its iPhone, along with \u0022the\u0022 app store. Actually one can see an evolution and derivative integration of Apple\u0027s Newton PDA and the iPod, along with OSX and mobile phone technology. \u003Cem\u003EThe One Plus is an attractive competing choice. On one hand, if not for Apple\u0027s iPhone, it probably would not exist. On the other hand, due to its existence, it will help keep Apple\u0027s prices in check.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022smart watches\u0022, one can argue that they were first rolled out in the \u002770s. Apple wants in on the action now, and will probably do well at it, with lots of happy customers in the process. After these latter prove to be successful (or not), Microsoft and other companies will follow suite (or not), regardless of Microsoft\u0027s SPOT watch \u003Cem\u003Eor the Linux Smartwatch\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the classic Apple vs. Microsoft vs. Linux vs. whoever/ whatever else \u003Cem\u003Eargument\u003C/em\u003E, I don\u0027t really care. Apple recognizes and encourages innovation (and for a long time actually lacked that capacity and was trying to follow and copy Microsoft and seems to have just given up its education market share, during the time that Jobs\u0027 was absent due to being fired), Microsoft is market savvy and has the capital to enter profitable markets (you may recall Microsoft Game Studios [before, during and after \u003Cem\u003EBungie\u0027s time there\u003C/em\u003E] and the XBox); Linux is open source, which balances the triad to a significant degree.
