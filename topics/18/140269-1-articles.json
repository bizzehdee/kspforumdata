That game was amazing, and still is if you can find a playable remake. Several exist out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on the Apple //c I really loved both Elite (The original wireframe. no polygons for me!) and Lode Runner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor IBM Clones (I could also get nostalgic about that phrase) the big winner was Rogue.

And it\u0027s still among my favorite types of game to this day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say \u0022DOS games\u0022 I think of 2 big ones: Doom 2 and Carmageddon.

Over a MODEM!) and Carmageddon was just amazing fun for hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows games I loved in the past include Stars! (Exclamation mark is part of the name), Unreal Tournament, Grand Theft Auto (Esp. Vice City), and of course Counterstrike. Stars! was my first (and last) love in the 4X genre. UT2K4 is the only game I\u0027ve bought 3 times for myself (Original, again when I lost the install disc, and again on Steam because it was dirt cheap). GTA was the first game I first pirated and then bought (I\u0027ve bought all of those except the most recent 2 twice since pirating the original. GTA4 I bought once, and 5 not at all. I\u0027m feeling a bit burned out on that genre. FTR I pirate nothing these days because I understand that if I like the game and don\u0027t pay for it, it\u0027s one less incentive for people to make those types of games). Counterstrike was nothing less than a phenomenon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNintendo? I\u0027m so nostalgic for Mario Kart that I still buy the current ones even though they\u0027re just remakes of the old tracks. Though the last one I bought was for the original Wii, as I gave up on the whole company when the Wii-U was announced. I also played a LOT of Tony Hawk games on that system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI consider the XBox 360 a bit too \u0022new\u0022 to be capable of nostalgia, so will refrain from anything I\u0027ve played from that point on.

A few of my friends had PCs but my Dad is an early adopter in the worst sense in that he actually never adopts anything, always waiting for the next thing to come out, \u0022We\u0027ll get a computer next year, when they release the *pentium* chip!\u0022, \u0022We\u0027ll get a computer next year, when they release the Pentium III!\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that this was not just\u00A0reverse-early-adoption, but also various \u0022adult\u0022 issues that they, being excellent parents,\u00A0naturally kept from me, me being single-figures years old at the time (who can tell exactly how old they are in their,\u00A0memories?\u00A0I can\u0027t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT my Dad did have a work laptop, a Compaq 286, with a 2MB harddisk and a whopping 640kb of RAM, greyscale screen and no mouse whatsoever. It also weighed about 40kg and I think it could stop a car if you left it in the road. It was a little smaller and a little thicker than a classic briefcase. And dense as all heck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually this laptop was retired and became \u0022my\u0022 computer, a massive revelation for little old me. Little did my parents know what was starting. They didn\u0027t know how to use a computer really, Dad just knew work stuff, Mum knew..,nothing I think. I also didn\u0027t know anything, but was entirely unhindered by the fear of pressing any buttons at all, and mostly was able to just tinker with this ancient laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t have windows, it had something called, IIRC, \u0022CONDUCTR\u0022. It didn\u0027t have any games, the only programs that it had was some \u0022Lotus\u0022 software of some kind, WordPerfect word processor and some kind of drawing program (equivalent of MS Paint). Mostly I would play with the drawing program, it was finicky, only having the arrow keys to control the cursor, but it was fun to pass the time, perhaps sketching some crude blobs using the circle tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually a few floppy disks from the cover of PC magazines from friends or wherever found\u00A0their way to me, sometimes I would have no idea what was on them as I had not yet figured out how to view the contents of a disk. I learned from trial and error a few DOS commands (like literally trial and error, do you know how long it took me to learn \u0022C:\\\u0022?) and eventually found that most floppy disks had a \u0022Setup.exe\u0022 and wouldn\u0027t you know it, that worked most of the time! I think the first game I unlocked in this way was something like \u0022Serious Sam\u0022? Was a bit like the early Duke Nukems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat early experience of having this strange and mysterious \u0022box from dads work\u0022 to fiddle with at random was the first seed of all of my computer related interests and abilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the years following, the internet finally arrived (although we were slow to hop on that wagon too), actually having to enter a phone number so that the 28.8kbps modem knew how to connect to AOL.

It may not always be the same computer (due to upgrades or replacements) but it is always *my computer*. Its like having another sense, its more than a gameplaying platform [though that is largely all I use it for] its one of the tools I use to interact with the world, even as I use it to escape from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T18:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been listening to 2000-2011\u0027s music recently, and I\u0027ve been drowning in nostalgia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack when music was good...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/650x300xits-now-safe-to-turn-off-your-computer-windows-953.jpg.pagespeed.gp\u002Bjp\u002Bjw\u002Bpj\u002Bjs\u002Brj\u002Brp\u002Brw\u002Bri\u002Bcp\u002Bmd.ic.hQbwUhL2J1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022650x300xits-now-safe-to-turn-off-your-co\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-22T18:06:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2016 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-23T02:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222597543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464027577\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002283406\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex Mechs Robot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn May 23, 2016 at 2:19 PM, Tex Mechs Robot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNostalgia for me is Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor.
