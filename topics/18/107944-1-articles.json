A jet starts of on a flying carrier with engines on full, the engines roaring, it accelerates to takeoff speed. With 2 mountain ranges, there\u0027s quite a thrill of maneuvering. (also created after 5 hours of hard labor by an 11 year old, a child developer is kinda important nowadays)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:51:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello kenbob5588!\n\u003E While I respect your commitment to making games, I think there are some things you should do if you want people to purchase \u0027Plane Evasion.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E **First off, I would love to see some pictures or a video.** Your only picture seems to be on your website, and even then it\u0027s tiny and not all that descriptive.

For instance, Air Brawl is still free and that has a lot of content, and it works very well. It is going paid, but the game and maps are well worth it\n\nAfter reading your post above, paid employees? I know you\u0027re young, but still, if you commit a month of good devloping and learn things such as making your own models, it will be hard, but still, then you will truly have a game if you work hard.\n\nNot having the best Wifi dosen\u0027t matter for video/pictures, take some, upload it to the website- let your computer upload it for the day if you have to, it will entice people to buy it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T20:54:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The Destroyer**"}]}
