For many months, a HypePlane was thought impossible, but we have evidence that this was a lie perpetrated by Gregox to make everyone ride his HypeTrain. Evidence that we can\u0027t show you right now. But I can answer a few common questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does the HypePlane work?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HypePlane runs not on refined Hype, like the HypeTrain, but on pure, crude Hype (sometimes referred to scientifically as \u003Cem\u003EHYPEOMGNEWUPDATEOMG!!1!!12ONE\u003C/em\u003E). This gives it a lot more speed and power than the HypeTrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat about safety?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere at Jedi Airlines, safety is our top priority. The pure Hype is not pumped into the ship directly, but in fact is absorbed, much like a solar panel absorbs the power of the sun. This ensures that the ship will not explode suddenly, as many users of crude hype often do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat about the HypeSuperluminar Drive?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HypeSuperluminar Drive is a highly experimental drive engine. It is not used in normal HypePlane operation, only when it becomes clear the update is releasing that day. Admittedly, the HypeSuperluminar Drive is somewhat dangerous in that if the prediction is wrong, it will overload and explode, disintegrating everything for five miles. Thus, we will make sure to be careful. Promise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow many people can the HypePlane fit?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproximately seven billion people. Yes, we can fit everyone on Earth. Any extra space is used for in-flight entertainment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow much does it cost to ride on the HypePlane?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, for today only, if you get a HypePlane ticket, we will pay you $100 billion. That\u0027s how awesome we are.

Coming up with a solid-state thermoelectric generator and reactor housing robust enough to handle the incredible temperatures and pressures of pure Hype plasma, yet light enough to fly on an aircraft, was certainly an imposing engineering challenge. Breakthroughs in the study of HypeDynamics via observation of HypeTrain activities and other Hype Events finally lit the way to what we\u0027ve chosen to call \u0022Hype Automoderation\u0022. An entirely distinct concept from the \u0022Moderator Thread-Lock\u0022 fail-safe mechanism mandated for all Hype constructs by Federal law, Hype Automoderation is an effect generated observationally when Hype is generated from a large number of sources simultaneously, serving as a restoring force which keeps the Hype laminar and directed, flattening out turbulences as they nucleate and keeping the Hype flow from becoming chaotic. We\u0027ve successfully manipulated this effect to contain all of the Hype brought in by the HypePlane\u0027s collection arrays to the reaction assembly, which powers the engines and HyperSuperluminar drive with direct HypeCharged particle streams and the rest of the plane\u0027s systems through a hefty thermo/photoelectric assembly. It\u0027s a relatively delicate balance and can be upset just as easily as any other system of its complexity, but you have my utmost confidence that it is as stable as it possibly can be, and in any case, it\u0027s hard to conceive of a failure of a magnitude too great to be shut down by the MTL fail-safe. Still, let us hope that never happens. I can\u0027t express how satisfied I am that this effort made it so far, and my team and I are proud to have contributed to this monumental project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EHighlight below:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EDisclaimer: This is not an attempt to jack the thread, nor is it endorsed by the original poster.
