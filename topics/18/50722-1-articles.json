This girl, named Precious, moved to South Africa from Malawi in hope to go to school and become a doctor to help many other people. For a better explanation, check this video: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmLhE4eRhM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmLhE4eRhM\u003C/a\u003E. Le Goldfish will be playing Kerbal Space Program and possibly a few other games for five hours, all in an effort to raise money, so, come along, enjoy the stream, and hopefully help out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
