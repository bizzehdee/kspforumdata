(physiologically/pathogenically; as in she is sick and is seeing a doctor; as in a human doctor, not a computer doctor)\n\nYou have until 11:30AM - 12:00PM (Eastern) to guess (that\\\u0027s her appointment time with the real doctor)\n\nSymptoms/medical history are as follows:\n\n2 Weeks prior she become very sick over the weekend. Saturday an unprofessional medical inspection from a semi-sort-ex-medical student (me) found white puss accumulating on her tonsils and back of the throat/Upper respiratory tract; streptococcus most likely.\n\nA low grade fever was present at the time of \u0027diagnosis\u0027 along with a swollen lymph node on the right side.\n\nAgainst my pleading/begging, her father googled names from random, old, antibiotics from the medicine cabinet until he found one that showed results for treating oral infections \u003E\\_\u003E\n\n1 recommended dose of this unknown \\\u0027antibiotic\\\u0027, mouth wash, and an allegra (anti-histamine) was administered.\n\nOvernight a mid/high-grade fever developed along with increased sense of \u0027I wish I was dead rather than sick\u0027 feelings.\n\nMonday a real doctor diagnosed her with strept. throat and prescribed Amoxicillin even though the quick strept. test came back negative (these tests aren\\\u0027t always accurate).\n\nA 2 week regiment was recommended and the infection and sense of malaise went away rapidly.\n\nOne day after the end of the 2 week regiment (2 days ago, thursday) she felt sick again.\n\nShe currently is sleeping, pale as a ghost (reportedly), swollen tonsils, but no puss is seen so far.\n\nA fever of about 99.7 F is present (her average body temp. is about 97.6, slightly lower than the average human (our whole family is like this actually))\n\nAll New York mandated and advised Vaccinations have been administered and maintained in this patient.\n\nSo!\n\nTake your guesses! What do you think she\\\u0027s is sick with, has been sick with, or was sick with and what she now is sick with!\n\nMy guess: Either some type of secondary infection, or perhaps the strept. went through an antigenic shift that her immune system hasn\\\u0027t recognized yet.\n\nI haven\\\u0027t seen her yet with this latest outbreak, but my mother didn\\\u0027t report any puss. With the swollen tonsils, it\\\u0027s possible the puss is out of sight though.\n\nPersonally I\\\u0027m guessing she\\\u0027s going to end up in a hospital and have her tonsils removed, or nominally treated for this infection.\n\nSeems kinda serious given how rapid it came back after leaving the antibiotics.\n\nTo me that tells me it\\\u0027s a different type of infection, or is at least expressing different antigens on it\\\u0027s surface because her immune system should have a very ready and active response to what was afflicting her 2 weeks ago."},{"CreatedByName":"LukeTim","CreatedById":4138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T15:31:33Z","Content":"If it\\\u0027s a Virus, why is she taking Antibiotics?\n\n![211115_177838428931396_1081493_n.jpg](https://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/211115_177838428931396_1081493_n.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T15:37:57Z","Content":"Influenza"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T15:52:03Z","Content":"You all fail!\n\nMainly because my mother fails.
