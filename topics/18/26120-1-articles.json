The city reminds me a lot of Minority Report and I Robot, and the helicopter screams Terminator 2. Most of the other stuff is not iconic enough in my mind to spark the memory of particular movies, though many of the actors seem to be filling similar roles (and I don\u0027t even know who they are). The plot is also pretty generic, to the point where between that, the blue tint, and the movies the trailer seems to be ripping off, I have a pretty solid grasp of the story arc, minus the romantic subplot I don\u0027t care about (I have a guess on that too though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for a Firefly reboot, I would be willing to take Matt Passmore (the Glades) instead of Nathan Fillion, but he is the only concession I think would work. Actually, when I first saw firefly, I actually thought it was Matt Passmore since I find the actors to look and sound a lot alike, and also because they are acting in the same way (the characters aren\u0027t really similar, but they carry themselves and interact with people in very much the same way).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T21:51:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
