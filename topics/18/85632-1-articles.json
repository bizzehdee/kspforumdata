And i decided to create a map of my school (which is big).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, so good, but when i tried to compile it for now, im getting an error. It says that it found a leak in my map, but i dont know where. Ive searched every spot in my map, tried to do everything i know, it doenst work. Can anybody help me? I want somebody to try and compile it, see what is wrong, fix it, compile it again. If it will work, then give me back the .map file.
