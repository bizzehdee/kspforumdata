Parkour is moving through a complex environment as fast an efficient as possible. Freerunning is a type of parkour that is more expressive, usually including acrobatic movements not found in parkour because of the lack of efficiency. The terminology usually isn\u0027t that important however, as usually a traceur isn\u0027t concerned about what he/she is doing being called the wrong name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt started as military training, to help soldiers be able to traverse difficult environments full of obstacles, but quickly people learned how much fun it can be, and the advantages a practitioner of parkour has in extreme situations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am an intermediate traceur, I do both parkour and freerunning, depending on the environment.

Typically the average teenager to mid 20 year old is in good enough shape to start. The more important thing is balance. I cannot stress enough the importance of balance. Practically everything in parkour and freerunning involves balance. Vaults, for example, require you to balance your whole body on the hand/hands you are using to vault over an obstacle. Anything that involves jumping into the air requires balance, if you intend on hitting the ground with your feet anyways. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest watching tutorial videos for beginners.
