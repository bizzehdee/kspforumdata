Here is the topic, why in the world (for lack of cleaner phrases) does the welfare program cost annually a trillion dollars a year (based on this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.budget.senate.gov/republican/public/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=34919307-6286-47ab-b114-2fd5bcedfeb5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epage\u003C/a\u003E) when the budget for just NASA is only 13 billion dollars? My main question is, why do we pay so much for a pretty much unproductive system, in place of a revolutionary space science division that with a trillion dollars, could go to the moon, create a new settlement, mine helium 3, and send human to mars within 10 years? If you have any more information on this subject let me know, as soon as I researched this topic I became infuriated, I would much like some water now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do realize that much of the budget is directed to HIV and AIDS, or other research and health care, which is understandable, but most of our taxpayer money is going towards people who don\u0027t work at all! Most people even don\u0027t look for jobs which also makes me angry.
