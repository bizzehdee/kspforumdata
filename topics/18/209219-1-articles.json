I\u0027m working as a tech writer and going to church. And the church building is 50 years old, it\u0027s a wreck. And the guy the church has put in charge of maintaining the building is a guy by the name of Mike. He was a licensed contractor, did a lot of remodeling work. Really great guy, I liked Mike. So I volunteered to help out maintaining the building, even though I knew nothing about maintaining buildings (at the time). So I remember this particular work day, Mike put me to work doing some drywall work in the basement. Before this day, I couldn\u0027t even spell drywall, now I was installing it. I totally kluged it. It was all messed up. The spackle was all uneven, you could see the screws, it was a mess. Mike comes down to look at what I\u0027ve done, and I\u0027m really upset, practically in tears. Mike looks over the wall, and says, \u0022Honestly, if I could call in ten guys like you, I wouldn\u0027t be living hand-to-mouth.\u0022 I was shocked. He goes on. \u0022This isn\u0027t the best, but you did what I told you to do. And you showed up when you were supposed to this morning. That\u0027s all I really need.
