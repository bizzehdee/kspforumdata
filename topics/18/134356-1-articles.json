I need this because i\u0027ll often forget to press the record button to turn recording off, so i\u0027ll record a bunch of boring stuff, and then when i record something interesting i end up turning off recording when i mean to turn it on (since it was already on) so i wont record what i actually want to. It\u0027s frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, if there\u0027s some way for fraps to display wether or not i am recording something, i would like to know.
