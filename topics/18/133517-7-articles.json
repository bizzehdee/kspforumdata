Travel distances even at 0.99c are great, few of them would be suitable for human occupation without some modification. So essentially at 0.99c you are talking about 4 years (or whatever the transform is) for 400 light years to the first planet with complex life, probably not sentient, and immediately hostile and unfacilitative to humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I heard from one gamer, its not worth a half-cheeks hack effort.
