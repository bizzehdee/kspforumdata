These numbers should be close to equal. To figure out how much I need to adjust my additional withholding, I take M\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0 - additional withholding = unadjusted tax amount (U). Here\u0027s where it gets tricky, and it took three years to understand how it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take the tax return\u0027s tax schedule (T\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E; how much taxes you must pay on your income)/12 = will equal the exact amount you needed to pay each month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare this number to the number to the original tax amount, and the difference will give you an \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eestimate\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E on how much difference there is between your actual withholding and how much you should adjust it. And I always round up to the nearest $5. So, this year, when I did my estimates, one came out to $21.00, so I changed it to $20.00 and my third job came to $27.00, and that gets rounded up to $30.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T02:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223356580\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523953176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d set it to 0 if I was allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt used to be, I used to do it... but they really complained about it... they \u003Cu\u003Edo not\u003C/u\u003E like having to give you money, just take it from you.
