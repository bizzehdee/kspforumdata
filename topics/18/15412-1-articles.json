So it\\\u0027s hard to give advice without knowing anything about those things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the people whom I find to be savviest and best-informed on the subject are almost unanimous in their opinion that most of what both Skullcandy and Beats put out is overpriced crap, plain and simple\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you might be considering in-ear monitors, I can tell you I\\\u0027ve been very pleased with the offerings from MEElectronics (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.meelec.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.meelec.com/\u003C/a\u003E). Their M9/M9P model offers excellent bang for the buck; towards the other end of their price scale, I adore my new A161Ps, though my guess is their sound would be much too neutral for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor over-ear/closed headphones, the Sennheiser HD201 punches way above its weight when it comes to price-performance ratio. A bit pricier--but still nowhere near the insane heights that some high-end equipment can reach--is the classic Sony MDR-V6, widely used and respected as a sensibly-priced reference headphone for over 20 years now.
