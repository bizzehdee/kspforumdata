Its quite solid, folds, is adjustable and has served me well for about two years now.\n\nIt was about \u00C2\u00A335 if I remember correctly ($55.69 ish). Slightly higher than your requested budget but it stood up to my dad trying to fly a plane with it (Basically he tried to show-off on x-plane, lost altitude, tried to pull up by attempting to push the joystick beyond its normal limits)."},{"CreatedByName":"TerranCmdr","CreatedById":23552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T00:19:19Z","Content":"I have a Saitek Av8r (version 1) and I love it, all the toggles make it fun, and the cover over the \u0027go\u0027 button makes me feel like a real pilot. 8)\n\nYou can find them for around $40.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![IMGP3320.jpg](http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u253/TerranCmdr/IMGP3320.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-06T06:14:08Z","Content":"The thing about joysticks that bugs me is that they all work pretty well when new, but after a couple of months of use they get a little loose around the centerpoint and then you can never exactly zero the thing again.
