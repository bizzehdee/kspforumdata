They stay biologically immortal (never aging past prime\u00A0adulthood) and pass that on to their children.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Their maker has no vested interest in keeping control over them and just really wants to watch and see what happens. He gives them three commands:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Multiply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Do not by action or inaction\u00A0destroy yourself or your offspring...unless necessary for command 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Create/engineer to ensure that the universe itself is not totally destroyed along with all life in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis heavily implies that in the future they will have the tech power to prevent that one day if they survive long enough. This also implies that one day the very existence of the universe will be threatened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that their maker lets them do their thing...zero interference on an Earth-like world with wildlife that is like Earth\u0027s, in that some can be domesticated but others are wild and will kill for food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrange conclusion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Conflict with kids is inevitable: The first parents will initially rule over a large family of children. As the children grow up and begin to have children of their own due to mating with each other, soon they will develop clans of their own apart from their All-Father and All-Mother. Sooner or later someone will want to rule themselves intead of letting All-Father and All-Mother tell them what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. War is VERY likely although not necessarily inevitable: It would no doubt pain the original parents to go to war with their own descendants, but at some point that is the kind of thing that happens when talks break down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. How Long Would The Original Parents Even Survive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes...big question. Since they would have to survive their own offspring, tech advances, any natural disasters that occur over millennia...and finally when they make contact with OTHER scifi races across the stars (they do exist). Space colonization is ABSOLUTELY essential given immortality and having babies. Too many would mess up planet resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would you play it if you were an original biologically immortal parent who would pass that on to your kids and fill the planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you try and rule? Or keep a low profile and just support any tech advances you could to help get your race spacebound as colonists one day?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: Other scifi races across the stars were given commands slightly different than your own, so do not be suprised if that becomes a point of conflict unless you can engender peace somehow nonetheless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus Question: What is the likelihood the original couple would stay together as a couple rather than break up and seek mates among their descendants?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow to impossible? I think the ONLY way they stay together as a couple is if they have the same main goals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-19T01:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2020 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-19T17:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should read \u003Ci\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFall; or, Dodge in Hell\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/i\u003E by Neal Stephenson.
