Our knowledge is stored as patterns of connected neurons in the brain. These grouped patterns will respond to a similar input, with the level of similarity determining the strength of the response. The key advantages to this process is first, that it requires a very small sample of the stored information to actually work. The second is that it doesn\u0027t require a precise match, which allows us to deal with novel information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I could show a picture that is a partial silhouette of something like a dog or a mouse, and as long as it includes some defining characteristics, it shouldn\u0027t be hard for most people to guess at what the outline is. That\u0027s minimal information. You could also show someone a picture of a dog that is a breed they have never seen before, and that person will be able to tell you that it is indeed a picture of a dog. They don\u0027t need to have seen that breed or that specific dog before, because their brain has built up a definition of what a dog looks like, and can match that to new information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe caveat to this approach is that\u00A0even though computers are bad at this particular kind of information processing, they can still do it through brute force and clever programming, ultimately culminating in the simulation of the same neural networks our brains use. Yes, a conventional computer simulating a neural network has to put considerably more \u0027effort\u0027 into the same process vs a human, but it ultimately grants the computer all our abilities once the hardware is powerful enough.\u00A0Ultimately, with enough advances in computer hardware, we should be able to create computers that can marry all the advantages of conventional computing to the advantages of neural networks that rival or exceed our own in capability and speed.
