If you bought a new game for 75 euro and handed it back immediately they would probably give you 30 at best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T01:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think they give you very good prices. You can get more money on eBay - provided you\u0027re an established seller with good feedback, buyers will be wary when you\u0027re a new seller. But you get less hassle with Gamestop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
