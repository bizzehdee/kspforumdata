I am planning and designing a game, this game will be a turn based micro/macro management game for a fictional space program. The game is similar to Buzz Aldrin\u0027s race to space (good game\u002Bit\u0027s free go play it!) where you must research and manage your missions except this game will feature much more, going into deep micro and large macro management. The point of the game is to gain points through missions, you be versus against 2 other entities (AI, other players), at the end of the game the one with the most points wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the actual questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.In the game you play as a fictional country which you can customise, the question is should the other two countries in the game be US/USSR or fictional as well? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Should the countries follow a set development plan (historical for US/USSR, my own one for the fictional) or should it be random AI deviating from history and being more unpredictable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.The game is turn based, it starts in 1945 and ends in 2020, should the turns be 4 quarters/turns each year, 2 halfs/turns or 1 turn for 1 year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for answering \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T04:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
