Been a while since I\\\u0027ve posted in the OT forums. I figured it was time to unveil a project my friend and I have been working on. Both of us are long time fans of KSP, and HarvesteR is doing an excellent job with it. We were, however, craving something that allowed for a taste of space combat with a KSP-style feel, but rather than mod new parts for the game, we decided to create a whole new one!\n\nFor now, the aim of the game is simple. Kill. We do not have mission objectives yet, or multiple game modes, but what we do have are epic space battles between both player and computer controlled fighters.\n\nThat\\\u0027s right. We\\\u0027re multiplayer!\n\nThere are two teams, currently denoted by red and blue. Each team has a mothership that acts as a spawn point, and one team wins by destroying the other team\\\u0027s mothership. There are currently not many ways to do that, but eventually we\\\u0027re hoping to provide players many tools necessary to the task!\n\nThe game is far from complete. Our marketing campaign is brand new, and it will be a long time before we actually start charging for the game. We\\\u0027re going for a KSP style release that involves a free demo that will expose the public to the game, and help us catch any early bugs while we\\\u0027re still building the core gameplay mechanics.\n\nIn the meantime, [here are some screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/kORnD) to keep your interest piqued! Feel free to ask me any questions about it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nKeep in mind that all screenshots at this point are developmental and not necessarily representative of the initial release.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T23:01:19Z","Content":"Wow!
