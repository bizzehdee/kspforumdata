It doesn\u0027t mean that anyone was any less able to handle college, but that something came along and a hard choice had to be made. In my experiences, there are times those hard choices teach us more about ourselves than we could have ever learned from traditional educational means, such as higher education.

Instead, everyone takes (mostly) the same final exams (a student has to participate in at least 4 exams, one of which has to be Finnish. For the other three, they can choose between Swedish, a foreign language, math and any other subject). Once a student graduates, they will receive a diploma and can then apply for universities and polytechnics.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E** \u0022Information technology\u0022 in Finland is what Americans would call \u0022computer science\u0022 - mostly programming.
