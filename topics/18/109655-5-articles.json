It\u0027s probably sturdier now than it was when it was manufactured, although it\u0027s kind of stiff because of it. Still. It\u0027s a book again. Corrugated cardboard with the corrugations aligned perpendicularly to the spine, and then the whole thing was saturated with glue before it was allowed to dry. It\u0027s completely solid.  \n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/tS05p8W.jpg[/img]  \n\nFor the next step, I need three things:  \n\n1. A ribbon (for a ribbon bookmark, can\u0027t not have a ribbon bookmark when making a book)  \n\n2. Colored paper to later affix to the cover  \n\n3. Cardstock to affix the colored paper to the splint  \n\nPossibly four things, if I include some sort of patch to cover the ugly ends of the splint... After that I need to get some faux leather or something with which I can wrap the cover boards with.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T18:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T19:20:42Z","Content":"My sister buys used books all the time to the point where she could stock a store for years."},{"CreatedByName":"Korizan","CreatedById":142032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T19:44:05Z","Content":"Umm well...
