I\u0027m not entirely sure why, but what about the series on cartoon network/Netflix? I have not seen the whole of the movie clone wars but from what I\u0027ve seen, I like that Anakin isn\u0027t a wuss, and the show being animated In pure CGI lends better to spacebattles and combat because you don\u0027t have to deal with RL/CGI blending. Which If I\u0027m not mistaken, was one of the major complaints of the first three movies(chronologically). I also like how because it is a television series, can focus on some of the more minor characters and expand the universe like the clones, jedi, CP30 \u0026amp; R2-D2, even some villains. I\u0027m guessing though some people will be angry at some of the interpretations of characters and how they are not perfect clones of their movie counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T21:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the show does take place between Episodes 2-3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T21:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really liked seasons 1 and 2.
