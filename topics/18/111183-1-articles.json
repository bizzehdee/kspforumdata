Has anyone built any fan ships? I myself named my latest mothership \u0022Kidonia\u0022, but it\u0027s only loosely based on the Sidonia at best and lacks an asteroid core in favor of a habitat ring and giant wings."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:42:52Z","Content":"Its on my list to watch, I have a few other series in front of it however.\n\nI presume you recommend it?\n\nTo the poster below: thats why I\u0027ve been bumping it back in my list, the artstyle just seems...not good?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T21:12:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:09:37Z","Content":"I tried to watch it but i just can\u0027t get over the artstyle.

Admittedly the fact that it\u0027s entirely CG was a bit of a surprise, but I got used to it within the first episode.\n\nWhile it is an anime and unsurprisingly has a lot of \u0022fantasy\u0022 sci-fi in it, now and again I\u0027m pleasantly surprised by the science that does show up - for instance, with the exception of giant robot fights (which are necessarily close-quarters for entertainment reasons), most of the space combat occurs over massive distances and is based on detection and long-range interception rather than the old-fashioned cannonade fights common in Star Wars-like franchises."},{"CreatedByName":"TavishThomas","CreatedById":115945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:51:39Z","Content":"you get over the 3d in 2 or 3 episodes. honestly they did it really well compared to previous attempts, enough to give me hope that 3d anime can indeed be done right.\n\nalso the plot is fairly great, as well as the author\u0027s attention to physics and how stuff actually works in space(aside from a few plot necessary loopholes)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:58:06Z","Content":"Is the ship named after the place or something?"},{"CreatedByName":"TavishThomas","CreatedById":115945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:29:21Z","Content":"it\u0027s never stated, but it\u0027s likely that the ship itself was built into the asteroid of the same name [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/579_Sidonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/579_Sidonia)"}]}
