Everybody called it \u0022The Moon\u0022, but it clearly wasn\u0027t our Moon. It had a very thin but oxygen rich atmosphere and lots of vegetation. I was doing experiments on how long a human could be outside of our domes, breathing the thin atmosphere and I was surprised on how well It worked. I actually felt the decompression (never had such a realistic dream).\u00A0There wasn\u0027t enough oxygen to do lots of sports, but enough to go for a hike or swimming a bit. The others were surprised, they thought I\u0027d go unconscious after a couple of minutes. They decompressed too and we all were very cheerfull.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was hard to get me back inside. After a long time outsides, I\u00A0had some negative effects from the hypoxia. I got in a chamber to raise the pressure again and it was very uncomfortable. I was so used to the thin air that breathing such a thick atmosphere again felt weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-24T11:44:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2017 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Physics Student\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T08:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI once dreamt i went to a world\u00A0that was\u00A0dominated by caterpillar-like creatures and every species had their own \u0022texture\u0022 \u00A0or \u0022camouflage\u0022\u00A0that resembles an Earthling Animal.
