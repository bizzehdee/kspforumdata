A curse condemned him to aimlessly cruise along European highways in his rusty vehicle, never to arrive anywhere until Judgment Day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELegend\u0027s Origin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was about the year 1962 when the driver of a Dutch mobile home - who, even for a Dutchman, had a neck-breaking driving style and an exquisite vocabulary of swear words - tried to pass the scene of an accident on the German autobahn A2 near Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00FCck, even though the road had temporarily been cordoned off. He narrated what happened himself, according to the following traditional record:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI am not dead, nor am I yet alive. I hover between this world and the world of Spirits. Mark me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor seven hours did I try to force a passage through this accursed traffic jam, but without success; and I swore terribly. For seven more hours did I change lanes, sound my horn, flash my head lights, and shout the living soul out of my body, and yet could gain no ground; and then I blasphemed, - ay, terribly blasphemed. Yet still I persevered. The family, worn out with arduous fatigue, would have had me leave the highway at some service area or exit; but I refused; nay, more, I became a tyrant, - unintentionally, it is true, but still a tyrant. My wife opposed me, and persuaded the children to pee in the car if they absolutely had to. In the excess of my fury, I threw the doors open and kicked the children out onto the road. Even their wailing and crying did not restrain me; and I swore by the fragment of the Holy Cross, preserved in that relic now hanging round your neck, that I would gain my point in defiance of traffic jam and road closure, of fog and ice, of heaven and hell, even if I should beat about until the Day of Judgment. My oath was registered in thunder, and in streams of sulfurous fire. The car jumped forward as if it were chased by furies and slid through other cars like the unearthly shadow that it now was, and in the centre of a deep o\u0027erhanging cloud, which shrouded all in utter darkness, were written in letters of livid flame, these words - \u003Cstrong\u003EUNTIL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELegends and Stories about the Driving Dutchman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe legendary ghost car is said to have incredible abilities. In case of a traffic jam it is said to be able to run at 120 kph on the emergency lane. It is also believed it can turn invisible whenever a radar control is near. Some narratives say that it also suddenly appears somewhere driving in the wrong direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEncounters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the Driving Dutchman appears next to another vehicle this is a terribly ominous sign. It augurs an accident in the near future or at least a hefty fine for speeding.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDrivers who reported meeting the ghost car said that the camper was either empty or manned with dead people or ghosts. Some mentioned they heard desperate calls for \u00AB Lekker Boderbrodjes ! Lekker Boderbrodjes ! (Please, let us eat our delicious herring sandwiches!) \u00BB from the empty cabin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany stories also mention a ragged figure on a bicycle passing cars in service areas and trying to sell smuggled cigarettes. An unsuspecting buyer will inevitably fall victim to a customs inspection a short time later, unless he immediately nails the contraband to the glove compartment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Missing Operator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nService area personnel tell stories of haggardly, trembling figures stumbling out of the camper in the middle of the night and using the toilets without charge. Afterwards, the sanitary equipment is in terrible shape - toilet paper is missing, as well as saltshakers, glasses and newspapers. Then the vehicle disappears again into the foggy night.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne restaurant operator who stood up to the car and demanded payment was never heard of again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Bewitched Automobile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn unsuspecting traveller approached a rusty camping trailer on the Grebser Heide parking lot. He knocked and politely asked if this was the Temnitz exit. A scruffy man with a strong Dutch accent opened and invited him for a \u003Cem\u003Elekker Genever\u003C/em\u003E. When the tourist left the camper a short time later, he found himself on the G\u00FCtersloh service area some 350 km away.

Through the open window someone shouted \u0022Over board mit de Blagens!

But regardless of how much he accelerated, the vehicle stayed right at his side, while a mocking voice could be heard jeering \u0022Lame car, lame car!\u0022 all the time through the window.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe affair ended with a ticket for 200% speeding beside a construction site.

After he agreed to buy some, the supplier dropped huge amounts of tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers out of his camper.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the cook wanted to take the vegetables out of cold storage the next morning, he only found piles of plastic packaging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Soccer Fans\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerman hooligans late at night sang a song about how they would go to the World Cup without the Netherlands. Suddenly a damned skinny guy showed up and told them they were wrong, that they would go WITH the Netherlands, but that they were going not to the world cup but directly to hell for their godless boozing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDeeply moved by this incident, the men immediately renounced alcohol and joined the Catholic church.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Driving Dutchman in literature\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInspired by the legend, the poet Walter of the Hubcap composed the following lines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOne single hope shall remain with me,\u003Cbr\u003E\nit alone shall stand unshaken:\u003Cbr\u003E\nlong though the car may follow the road,\u003Cbr\u003E\nit yet must rust and rot and perish.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay of Judgment!
