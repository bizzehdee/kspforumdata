I\\\u0027d love to see some excellent recommendations for any space or space flight related movies, documentaries, or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the ball rolling first of all, as far as documentaries go I highly recommend the When We Left Earth series, I know its on Netflix streaming but I am sure you can probably find it otherwise. While not really a documentary, as it\\\u0027s all based on fact is Apollo 13, if you haven\\\u0027t seen it in awhile it is definitely worth watching again. I also enjoy campy and sci-fi stuff, I am sure it\\\u0027s the type of movies Jeb likes too. One awesome movie I just discovered and watched via youtube is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_Moon_%28film%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDestination Moon\u003C/a\u003E. It is notable for being one of the first \u0027realistic\u0027 science fiction depictions of a manned moonshot. And while it is super campy it is really cool for being from 1950, the scenes where the guy drifts away during the repair and the epic makeshift rescue using the oxygen tank is total Kerbal. And the Woody the Wood Pecker clip in the beginning does a great job of describing how the mission will work. Might not be everyone\\\u0027s cup of tea but I found it pretty fun to watch: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsisGSBlQqo#noexternalembed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDestination Moon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
