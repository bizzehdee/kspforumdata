I was in really good shape, running twenty miles a week, going scuba diving every other week. My wife and I decided to get life insurance. I got a $750,000 term policy, with a fixed table until I was 65. I actually got a preferred table because when they gave me my physical I was in above average shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was in 2003, twenty years ago. Since then, I have had three children, changed jobs four times, died on the operating table for eleven minutes, stopped working because of long COVID, and am now in the early stages of heart failure. At this point, the odds of me making it to 65 are slim to none, and Slim just left town. Am I glad that I locked in a term life insurance policy when I was in good health twenty years ago?
