We hiked about about 7 km total, and had amazing views of the snow covered mountain tops from the ridge we climbed up to. There were a number of ice-covered stretches on the path, but with our trusty walking sticks we navigated those, as well as dealing with the inevitable mud because the ice was turning to slush very quickly. The dogs acted like they hadn\u0027t had a *real* walk in months.\n\nI still can\u0027t believe we hiked in the foothills in March. I once again renewed my appreciation for some of the relatively unspoilt beauty which I am fortunate is near to where I live. I didn\u0027t even think about rockets or space until just before Squadcast. The dogs have only moved to eat and go outside a couple of times since we got back.\n\nMy sympathies to all those dealing with terrible weather, wherever they may live.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T16:27:54Z","Content":"Wisconsin got about one week of nice weather, which was amazing.

On the plus side, though I HAVE been finding some neat things to do with my camera inside. This isn\u0027t an edit, just a TV in a pitch black room, although I DID edit it to get rid of something that I forgot to turn off and that screwed up the shot. Still the TV effect isn\u0027t an edit.:\n\n![IMG_2175.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q8xRueVwH8g/VRbj1f-nhXI/AAAAAAAAAmE/u86N7-tt-PA/s800/IMG_2175.jpg)"}]}
