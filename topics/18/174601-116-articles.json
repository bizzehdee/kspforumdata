Going global adds little to the fixed costs of production, and although the marketing costs (that are usually hidden) would be more proportional to geography, the earnings still skyrocketed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has caused the initial wave of costs bloat. No, the Rock is probably not worth $50 mln/movie. The leads now seem to walk away with half of a $200 mln production budget, or even more for smaller but star-studded films.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, there were flops. Someone more into the topic than me could probably identify when this became an industry trend, I only have more local observations (e.g. it\u0027s clear alarm bells sounded after the backlash to \u003Cem\u003EThe Last Jedi,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand also affected the two \u003Cem\u003EA Star Wars Story\u003C/em\u003E spinoffs). This caused increased management meddling to mitigate risks. However, this had two direct consequences for costs. One, on-set oversight in the form of various seconds and thirds and assistants also collects a paycheck*. Two, reshoots, reshoots, reshoots - for some reason these are all the rage, these cost a fortune, and they\u0027re much of the reason for shoddy, slapdash CGI all over the place, which really \u003Cstrong\u003Ewas\u003C/strong\u003E made at the last minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E* the seconds and thirds are also often needed to babysit the directors that were picked based on their trendiness and are completely out of their depth on a major production\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s the problem: we\u0027re probably headed into leaner times (streaming \u002B multiple box office bombs \u002B general economic instability), and Hollywood doesn\u0027t have a good mechnism for cutting costs. In fact, as times get leaner, the meddling will \u003Cstrong\u003Eincrease\u003C/strong\u003E, and so will risk mitigation through reliance on star power, and those guys and gals definitely aren\u0027t downshifting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no real way for Hollywood as it currently is to avoid crashing and burning. \u003Cstrong\u003EExpect another few years of bombs.\u003C/strong\u003E Worse yet, the streaming services are already largely entangled into the same production culture, so I don\u0027t see indies having a good platform to make bank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-13T02:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224389264\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715554993\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DDE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, DDE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s the problem: we\u0027re probably headed into leaner times (streaming \u002B multiple box office bombs \u002B general economic instability), and Hollywood doesn\u0027t have a good mechnism for cutting costs.

And systems of belief are vulnerable to abuse, and thus science may end up destroying itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way Mitchell talks of the universe being made out of information is jarringly similar to Philip K. Dick\u2019s Gnostic inspired ruminations, in which he arrived at the same conclusion independently, without scientific observation, after having a mystical experience in 1974.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMitchell claims all six lunar module pilots had the same mystical experience he did at some point during their flight, and were changed by it in their own unique way.

Quantum physicists may be on the forefront of creative theorization right now, but will they be in 1000 or 2000 years?

It\u2019s okay to think the universe is cold and unthinking or that intelligent chi/ki surrounds us in the form of the energies that make up the universe. But let people decide that for themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMitchell is wrong, when in the NASA oral history in which he is interviewed he states that science needs to help craft \u201Ca new story\u201D to help \u201Chave a better value system that\u2019s in tune with the processes of the universe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArthur C.

Just look at how more or less\u2026 human\u2026 humans of 10000 years ago were recast as dumb savages by Thomas Hobbes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 humans gradually learned through experimentation how to cultivate crops. But the memory of exactly when a certain group first did it was \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E distant no one remembered. So it was mythologized. The lesson of agriculture was given by gods. Today, very few people know how to grow food on a scale necessary to sustain a decent population. It\u2019s a relatively rare art.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what if we forget who the Wright Brothers were, and who Einstein was, and we attribute these successes to supernatural forces. Not in the same way the first farmers were forgotten and replaced by gods, but rather by turning them into \u201Csupermen\u201D and assuming they had \u201Chelp\u201D from\u2026 oh, I don\u2019t know, Martians. That idea already exists now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then the names of the people get less important. Because all technology was given by the Martians, so it doesn\u2019t matter what the humans\u2019 names were. Eventually they are then forgotten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we have a sort of zombie civilization, which doesn\u2019t remember where it came from and likely doesn\u2019t have much of an idea of where it wants to go- not unlike how the majority of people in the 21st century are focused on the present rather than future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe people aren\u2019t interested in making new things because they\u2019re infatuated with existing technology. Or maybe those who claim to have their own ideas without the help of Martians are accused of blasphemy and burned at the stake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience becomes a lost art, practiced by a few or none at all. Doctors become indistinguishable from medicine men. Quantum physicists become virtually identical to shamans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople start talking of \u201Cbad\u201D and \u201Cgood\u201D magic.

To some extent this conflict already exists in the form of debate on ethical and unethical science experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience and philosophy complement each other in some ways, but trying to integrate them is flawed, IMO. The police and fire department are more effective as independent branches than a single institution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I wonder\u2026 is science truly unique?

Tsiolkovsky believed in ethereal beings that transferred knowledge to humans, while a lot of the impetus for the Space Race came from communism vs. capitalism, which entailed atheism vs. religion in the eyes of the American politicians who funded NASA. Perhaps these achievements wouldn\u0027t have happened without the religious backgrounds involved (although IMO, the type of \u0022religiousness\u0022 present in the four I namedropped is more akin to some sort of spiritualism: being touched by mystical curiosity almost constantly throughout daily life, than the average \u0022religiousness\u0022: go to the place of worship once every week but otherwise not think about it too much).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow of course there are atheists and agnostics who make discoveries too. I think I would guess that the answer to the question \u0022was religion required to get science going\u0022 is more likely to be revealed by statistical analysis as being that there is no apparent prerequisite of either atheism or religiosity to be capable of making scientific discoveries. If that is the case I would say that the current world we live in was not precipitated by tales of gods but would look like this either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think there is a degree of \u0022temporal entrapment\u0022 one has to examine when asking that question. People may appear to be worse off in all sorts of ways, but what about 200 or 400 years from now? If it\u0027s all peachy, won\u0027t that make the problems we sometimes wish never got brought up (like nuclear weapons and the Internet) worth it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716484019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost any Soviet/Russian family had its kitchen-garden, some\u00A0 were feeding from it in 1990s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUseful info about local agriculture is in magazines, and basically occupies from zero to a copybook (to be a local professor of agronomy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven when I hate doing agriculture myself (except in Minecraft), I have visual memories about how it was organized at several places of our family.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a rocket science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was gonna say \u0022Russia is ahead of the US in that regard\u0022 but it seems 1 in 3 households grow their own produce in the US.
