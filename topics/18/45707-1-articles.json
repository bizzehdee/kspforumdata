It was free on steam and I was kinda expecting an atrocity. But I thoroughly enjoy the game. It splits battles into 3 modes: Arcade mode, where you can point the mouse where you want to go, and the plane will steer there, and fight any nation against any nation, just two teams. Historical battles, which I think are more strategic mission based modes. \u0027Full Real Battles\u0027(Stupid Name), in which you pretty much need a joystick unless you have vectors and 3 dimensional angles embedded in your brain. It uses the \u0027Realistic\u0027 control mode, and your wings rip off when you go too fast and stuff. Unfortunately my joystick isn\u0027t here right now so I haven\u0027t tried this mode yet. The reason I like it is the more realistic damage, where if somebody puts many holes in your wing, said wing will lose lift and you will tilt and veer. They seem to have all this drag-lift stuff worked out. So it is quite fun to shoot an enemy\u0027s wing off and watch them plummet uncontrollably to the ground. Includes the usual MMO thing of bazillions of planes unlockable as well. Also the graphics are PRETTY good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T12:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to like it, then they changed the DM and now I can\u0027t find any fun in it.
