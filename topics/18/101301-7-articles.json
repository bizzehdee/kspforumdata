Yes, you only get 5 buildings, two artbooks and the sound track, but the game is dirt cheap to begin with. I view buying the Deluxe edition as a token of appreciation for the good work, allowing future updates and expansions to be more readily available for all the players.\n\nIf they charged 60 dollars or euros for the game I would not think about spending more, but since the Deluxe Edition can be had for under 30 euros I would encourage everyone to spend the money they would have otherwise spent anyway.

Fiddling with the wrong highway connection can really tank certain areas or demands. The same goes for zoning or changing road directions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T01:16:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:31:55Z","Content":"Nice RocketPilot!
