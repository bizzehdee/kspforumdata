To start off, these are my opinions, nothing but opinions. Your opinions may be different. And probably are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to business. You may have heard of the series called Age of Empires. Age of Empires 2 was great. Age of Empires 3 was awesome. And Age of Mythology is my favorite game of all time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then along came the new game. Age of Empires: Castle Siege. It wasn\u0027t an AOE game. It was a free-to-play Windows 8 and Windows Phone exclusive that was riddled with micro-transactions and a clone of Clash of Clans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying there is anything wrong with Clash of Clans, but Clash of Clans is certainly not an AOE game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is riddled with micro-transactions that are nearly imperative to gameplay if you want to progress in a sane amount of time. If you don\u0027t pay, you face ridiculous loading times to wait for. I quote a review that expresses this clearly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The only question about Age of Empires: Castle Siege is whether to waste your time or your money.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tomsguide.com/us/age-of-empires-castle-siege,review-2381.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.tomsguide.com/us/age-of-empires-castle-siege,review-2381.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the worst part of it was that we saw it coming. We saw this kind of thing in Dungeon Keeper from EA, and in Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 from Atari, both games that had great games previous to their new releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a longtime player of Age of Empires, but Age of Empires: Castle Siege broke something no other crappy game has done before. It broke my heart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never played 1,3, or Castle Siege, but 2 is awesome.
