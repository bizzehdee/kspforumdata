So my question is simple: What is one thing that you could do that would help the environment in some way? (like carpooling once a week, recycling, or, yes, even reducing the amount of time you play KSP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I am not necessarily asking you to actually DO what you say(but it would be nice), but just think about how you could help the beloved Earth. Imagine if everyone in New York carpooled or took the bus/subway once a week, instead of driving their own cars or using a taxi. That, along with helping traffic, would nearly chop car emissions in half.
