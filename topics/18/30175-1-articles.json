G\u0026amp;K is worth getting. Religion adds a lot more depth, with some powerful bonuses for the cities that follow it, like (my favorites) 15% population growth, and \u002B30 healing when fortified next to a friendly city. And that\u0027s just from the first tier of bonuses! Espionage is nice, but... less than it could be. It lets you steal technology from other civilizations or influence elections in city-states for an Influence bonus. I had hoped it would be a bit more passive, particularly end-game, where, even in Quick games, spies can take hundreds of turns to successfully steal a tech (if the defender has the right buildings), but it still allows less technologically advanced civs to keep up. G\u0026amp;K also has some tweaks in the tech tree which make things more interesting. There\u0027s a whole WWI set of units and technologies before you get to the WW2 stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, too, am excited for Brave New World. So many cool features.
