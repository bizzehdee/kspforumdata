Buying 40k retail is really tough on the pocketbook (thats not a secret) but there are other ways to catch huge deals on minis. Ebay will work if you keep an eye out, but my habit was made easier when I discovered Bartertown (.net I think). Its a trading site where people basically trade the minis they don\u0027t want for the minis they do want.

For me, having miniatures which look the part was always an important part of the WH40k experience. The reason why GW has the \u0022only use official miniatures\u0022 rule is clearly so they can push the bootlegs off the market, but I wouldn\u0027t have wanted to play against a lego army in a tournament either, as it would have really broken my immersion in the game. On the other hand, I wouldn\u0027t have anything against playing against an army which is in the style of the game, even when it came out of a 3d printer and not from Citadel. When the 3d printer and the models are good enough, you could even get your army through a superficial check by the judges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative to Citadel miniatures would have been those model kits from other companies.
