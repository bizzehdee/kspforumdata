Hopefully we got common water restored after 2 weeks and full electricity after a months for everybody.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy dad gives me a lot of picture from this time, he actually was a rescue-diver of the French National Gendarmerie (we did not have Coast Guards equivalents here)\u00A0and was sent to multiple ships trapped and sinking out of the island. He also took shots of the U.S logistic intervention. They sent Lockheed\u00A0C-130s from Florida and Puerto-Rico air bases ASAP\u00A0to carry medicines and foods and even one of the McDonnell Douglas C-17 prototypes (the aircraft entered in service the same year) two times. It probably was an occasion to test it in a particular condition.

By far the worst in my memory... the b*stard formed \u003Cu\u003Ein\u003C/u\u003E the Caribbean Sea. Nearly\u00A0all of the depressions sticking us used to form out of the Western African coast but not here, it just arrived from the East this time and jump from the Category 1 to 4 in less than two\u00A0days. Its proximity gives way less time to the islands to prepare themselves. Also the weather estimations of the time (from the U.S NOAA like the French National Service) were all \u003Cu\u003Eerroneous\u003C/u\u003E, and it took years for them to admit their failures. But the worst probably was that Lenny, instead of keeping on its way to the West, like any other depression would have done, just slowed down once over Saba/Anguilla, St-Martin/Maarten/St-Barths islands and started to depict a full circle over them. We stayed under rains and winds of 200 km/h (120-25\u00A0mph) during a day, 866,6 mm (approx 34.11 inches) were recorded at the Gendarmerie office of Marigot... we never get more than this since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe loop it made also trapped a lot of peoples navigating at this time. Most of them used to leave the island main bay and go northern to protect their boats as usual but Lenny was so different that it got them way before... more personally we lost a man and most of its crew when\u00A0they we were struck by the hurricane. Their boat simply\u00A0was destructed and they disappeared north of the island, near the British and U.S Virgin Islands. The only survivor of the crew was found three days after while he was\u00A0drifting on a piece of wood coming from the hull. It\u0027s actually a British \u003Cem\u003ENimrod\u003C/em\u003E crew which\u00A0patrolled over purely by chance who found him and who guided a ship towards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image25.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/antilles/pack-public/cyclone/saison1999/cr_tech/Image25.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese really are the most important\u00A0we ever have since (without forgetting \u003Cem\u003EHugo\u003C/em\u003E). Many others struck us since, but what I remember the most is that, just like for all the others natural disaster the scales used for them still can\u0027t reflect their destructive potential. Most of the time the deadliest for us were from Category 3 and 4. The 5 are too fast to stay over us enough, while the Cat 3 use to be the worst being slower and less powerful we could imagine that it will not be as destructive than the 5, but being slower is its main weapon... it will stay over you more longer and drop a more important quantity of water at the same occasion. When we are on the land their winds gust are not the deadliest, but their rain and the flood or landslides they are creating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The CanineCraver","CreatedById":173583,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T21:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while(like AWHILE) back,an earthquake woke me up during the night(BTW I live in VA USA),I know it wasn\u0027t a dream because things had fallen off of the shelfs when I got up in the morning,but more recently,there was an earthquake that made the fridge dance \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"munlander1","CreatedById":168560,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T22:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last earthquake that hit me, I slept right through\u00A0it.
