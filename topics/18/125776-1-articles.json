I was up in Pasadena with a buddy of mine at a Christian book store. I was all set to check out with some CDs when the power went out. Suddenly they were cash-only, and I had no cash. I waited about ten minutes to see if the power was going to come back on, but it didn\u0026#39;t so we decided to take off. Out in the parking lot we saw that the power was out as far as we could see. There was a fire in a basement electrical room a couple of buildings over, either because of the outage or just coincidentally, and the whole street was filling up with fire trucks, so we decided to just sit tight and not try to go anywhere until things calmed down a bit. While we were waiting, we found out that there was a lady with her kids in the parking lot who had locked her keys in her car in all the commotion. I was a AAA member, so I went back into the store and called them to come out and help her out. (Back then you got four free AAA uses per year, and I hadn\u0026#39;t used any of them.) We waited around for the tow truck to show up, chatting in the parking lot. When he got there he slim-jimmed her door open and she was good to go. By that point the fire was out and the fire trucks were starting to break up, so my buddy and I hopped in the car and left. By time we got back to my place the power was back on. Just a weird day, very memorable.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T08:15:55Z","Content":"\nHow is the night sky? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI remember in 1999, one night entire Serbia was without power, and I went out in the yard, and was positively impressed with the sky! \u003Cbr\u003E\nSo many stars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI never saw anything like it ever again.
