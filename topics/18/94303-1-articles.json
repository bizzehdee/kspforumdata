I get to see a whole array of assets, on a regular basis... tankers, transports, F-15/16/18\u0027s and numerous helicopters (gunships included). There\u0027s also a gunnery range nearby (associated with the base), and when they open up with the 105\u0027s and such, the whole house shakes lol. Also a weather spotter (SkyWarn). And yes, I also enjoy FIFA World Cup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
