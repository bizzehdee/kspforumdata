Once the bullet has left the muzzle and the zone of gas interference (Ex: \u0027Muzzleblast\u0027) it does not gain any more velocity.

There is still pressure differential between the interior of the silencer and the environment, you will just get a greatly reduced difference -\u0026gt; Less loud report. There are other tricks where the flow of gas can be used to induce resonance and work in the manner of \u0027noise cancellation\u0027 but gunshots are typically broad spectrum compared to cancelling out specific frequencies.
