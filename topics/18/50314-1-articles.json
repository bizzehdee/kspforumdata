Within about 2 minutes of looking I quickly discovered that there is a whole slew of clearances and authorizations you need, which is unfortunate because for that reason I\u0027ll probably never actually get into rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess what I\u0027m asking is why there are so many clearances and authorizations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean of course there is the whole aircraft thing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the fact that it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E, which could be misused for a whole bunch of things...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the other fact that rockets can be dangerous if you don\u0027t know what your doing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd probably a whole bunch more things I\u0027m missing...
