Shes a domestic Short Hair in a calico coat. Shes current 6 years old. I adopted her in June 2016 when she was but 3 months old. My first kitty Pumpkin who was a domestic Long Hair in the orange tabby coat with white socks and a white bib who was just 60 days shy of 20 when she passed a week before I adopted Pixie. When I met Pixie I thought she was cute and picked her up. I had no idea I was going to adopt her. She told me I was her human. How? As I held her I was talking with my mother and the attendant in the kitten room Pixie began licking my beard. That was it. I knew then and there Pixie was to come home with me. 6 years later and shes just as cute and just as loving. Shes such a wonderful companion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, now, its your turn \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E143708083022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zozaf Kerman","CreatedById":219910,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-08T22:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will give my kitties plenty of love and treat them to some yummy treats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
