I\u0027ve wound 1000\u002B winding coils for crystal radios from 32 gauge enameled copper wire. From the picture, it looks like you used 18-22 gauge rubber insulated wire, which is FAR easier to work with. The high-gauge enameled stuff will break like a thread if you pull it too hard, so you have to be careful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T03:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:22:36Z","Content":"It is 26 gauge enamel coated wire.\n\nOne reason it spins so fast is because it has neodymium magnets in the two little side holders... four in either slot, stuck together, each about 1cm x 3cm x 5cm."},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:24:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is 26 gauge enamel coated wire.\n\u003E One reason it spins so fast is because it has neodymium magnets in the two little side holders... four in either slot, stuck together, each about 1cm x 3cm x 5cm.\n\nWow!
