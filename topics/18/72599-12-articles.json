Thank you for posting the link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt must be said, though, that something smells fishy about this rating. What is IMDB\u0027s criteria? Can it be manipulated? Why has it dropped by one point in as little as a few hours between when SpaceXray and you checked it? Interstellar is the only recent movie in that list. Could it be there only as a result of some campaign to vote it up? I will make it a point to check back in a year or so. If it is still in the top 20 then, I\u0027ll have my crow barbecued.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
