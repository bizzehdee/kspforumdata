The thing is, in modern sci-fi stories (and many outside sci-fi, as well), you\u0027re not permitted to \u0022think\u0022. There are conclusions you\u0027re required to reach, or you\u0027re considered a religious nut or a right-winger or a fascist or a whatever else they call politically incorrect people these days. Avatar, Elysium, District 9, and every Resident Evil movie make good examples; it\u0027s obvious which side is the Bad Guys, and that side is almost always the side that\u0027s racist, corporate, a branch of government, and/or destroying the environment. And the good guys are not permitted to do any of the following: make a profit from their escapades (the good guy usually ends up having to return The Treasure or gets deprived of it via some lame course of events the writers pull out of thin air), kill one person to save a billion, do the opposite of that and exterminate an entire race of evil dirtbags on the off chance that one member of that race of evil dirtbags might only be 99% evil, or receive significant power over people, governments, or the fabric of space and time (the old \u0022power corrupts\u0022 trope).

It\u0027s providing answers. There\u0027s very little actual \u0022thinking\u0022. And the problem with this problem is, it obviously works and produces films that are commercial successes, which is ironic whenever a film that preaches against corporate greed makes a billion dollar profit for a corporation.

Not provoking thought or imagination because the audience has seen the same themes a billion times already. Changes need to be made so that the audience doesn\u0027t know what to expect going in, and has significant imagination and hope as they wait to discover what the Federation explorers are going to find on the other side of the force-fielded doorway. That\u0027s why DS9 and Voyager flopped--too dark, and dark \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E the time.

The sense of exploration and discovery was largely absent, just as in DS9 and Voyager--but since \u0022Enterprise\u0022 was decades before either, the fact that the mood was very similar killed the sense of the Federation just getting started. It made it feel as if the human race was merely running in circles, from scary and dreadful in \u0022Enterprise\u0022 to inspired exploration in TOS and TNG, then running back home and hiding under your bed in DS9 and Voyager for fear of bumping into a deactivated superweapon that\u0027s one button push away from going kaboom.

If you look at the core stories behind every sci-fi book and movie out there, you\u0027ll notice there are actually very few stories; it\u0027s the same old stories told in different ways. Star Wars is the same as Star Crash is the same as Battle Beyond The Stars. The difference between these three is, one of them was a cheesy story told well. The other two were the same cheesy story--told badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
