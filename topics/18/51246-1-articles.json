It\u0027s very different to SimpleRocket(which I also got) It allows you launch using real life launch stages and they have a reentry heat system with docking and a launch counter with the sparks it\u0027s just amazing! So if you want a game like KSP for IOS device there ya go!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBadAstronomer","CreatedById":89508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T00:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had it for a while, and it is pretty fun.

It\u0027s not nearly as awesome as KSP or even another game, Simple Rockets, for the iOS devices and Android. It\u0027s missions make no sense, it\u0027s unrealistic, and it is not close to a sandbox of any kind, it\u0027s not open ended at all. Simple Rockets is different. check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xzxvrx","CreatedById":57321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T01:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHah, I got space agency for free on Android.
