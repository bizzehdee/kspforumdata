Tactical nukes can fulfil a number of useful roles in warfare, and IMO a limited exchange is possible. Well defended high value targets such as airfields, very deep bunkers and concentrations of enemy troops such as tanks massing for an attack, air or bridgeheads, and carrier battle groups are all perfectly sensible targets for a tactical nuclear strike. These weapons have a pretty low radiological impact, so contamination of the battlefield isn\u0027t an issue that prohibits their use. Tanks and mechanised infantry are trained and equipped to operate effectively on a nuclear battlefield. Use by navies in blue water would generally have no real impact on civilians at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh intensity conflict with conventional weapons contaminates battlefields with all sorts of toxic crud anyway.
