Calling it a flat pancake is another way of putting it. Playing orbiter out of the box is like playing ksp 0.15 without mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlthough the comparison is not completely accurate since ksp 0.15 had no other planets. You get my point, hopefully.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want to enjoy Orbiter you will have to download stuff. There are however alot of good looking real life replicas. There are other stock orbiter inspired spaceplanes that are similar to the stock Delta glider. I think they\u0027re from a place called Alteaaerospace or something. These are deltaglider inspired craft but can do more or go further.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNavigation can be expanded with futuristic MFD\u0027s that suit the cockpit of your Deltaglider.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut most of your Orbiter simulatons will be that, \u0022simulations\u0022 and there will be little flying. Because these will be real life replicas with automated launch programs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbiter is much more oriented at the simulation of spaceflight. Atleast it goes as far as to replicate spaceflight simulations, that targets especially the piloting part of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd when I mean simulation I mean that thouroughly. There is for example a dedicated Apollo 11 install called \u0022NASSP\u0022 which comes clean with all the 100\u002B missions steps from launch to splash down that the crew had to follow during the actual mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a pure gameplay perspective KSP wins hands down. But Orbiter can be fun to if you know what kinda game it is and how to use it. KSP is a fun game, and orbiter can be but isn\u0027t after a fresh install. It is obvious why KSP is more popular then orbiter if you ask me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-23T15:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2017 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Razorforce7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NorthernDevo","CreatedById":161219,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T21:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the obvious and cheerful rivalry between the two simulations, but Orbiter and KSP are very different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely adore KSP, but it is extremely restrictive in its approach to space; there\u0027s never a time when I feel that \u0022I\u0022 am in space - that is one of the things Orbiter offers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no maneuver gizmos, no fun graphics, no little green guys giggling insanely - Orbiter is as realistic as Dr. Schwiegert could make it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy a very wide margin, the most realism I\u0027ve ever experienced in Space-sim comes from the AMSO Project; a French add-on for Orbiter: The Apollo Mission Simulator (for Orbiter). It is graphically wonderful, technically difficult and overwhelmingly immersive. The skill in AMSO is designing and carrying out your Apollo mission so that the radio messages - the actual recording of the flights, which are replayed at the correct MET - properly reflect what your ship is actually doing. It takes a little math, a LOT of patience and a rather large sense of wonder. The moment Earth rises above the moon\u0027s horizon for the first time...IF you have\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0properly aligned...is heart-stopping in its power and beauty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t dismiss Orbiter because it\u0027s not as joyful as KSP - they are very different and serve different needs.
