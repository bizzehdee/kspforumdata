Double Check. \n\nSkyrim comes a close second, but only because of the first patch. Orbital dragons? Check. Dragons flying backwards and breathing fire out of their arse? Check.

Developers *had* to get the game right first time, or free of serious bugs at the very least, even if that meant adding a lot to the development schedule.\nNowadays developers know they can patch any issues after the fact, so it\u0027s a lot easier for them to cut short the testing if they want to rush the release out so they can start getting revenue sooner. And then once they have the money in the bank they might feel that it\u0027s less profitable to make bugfixes than to get on with the next game."}]}
