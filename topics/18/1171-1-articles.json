You could actually go down and walk around on the planets. The graphics were pretty crap, but it was fun. Hoping somebody else remembers this- I remember playing this for a bit as a kid and being really enamored- if confused- with it."},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T19:16:55Z","Content":"Nyan in Space?"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropy","CreatedById":577,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T19:40:15Z","Content":"No, not quite. This is from five years ago, easy- maybe seven or eight.\n\nOh, also, it wasn\u0027t a browser game- you downloaded the executable."},{"CreatedByName":"Lolipop","CreatedById":2003,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T20:24:23Z","Content":"I believe you are talking about Noctis. Although, I don\u0027t think that you are a cat. But the game is old ,you can land on planets and the graphics are bad so it might be worth checking out."},{"CreatedByName":"Entropy","CreatedById":577,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T20:34:59Z","Content":"Yeah, it\u0027s Noctis- but unfortunately, it won\u0027t run on 64-bit systems.\n\nWonder if a 32-bit OS running in a virtual machine on a 64-bit OS would work, though...\n\nStill, many thanks.
