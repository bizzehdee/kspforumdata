My main card is an RX 480, and I was running it alongside an HD 7950 as an independant second card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first problem is graphics drivers. Windows 10 (and I think Windows 8) don\u0027t allow you to install more than one set of graphics drivers. I discovered this when I tried to use an HD 6770 instead of the 7950. AMD drivers are sequential releases, each of which supports some range of cards. In the case of the 6770 and 480, there is no AMD graphics driver that supports both cards, so they cannot be used together in Windows 10. The 7950 though is one of the HD 7xxx cards that was rebranded for the R9 2xx series of cards, which makes it recent enough to still be supported in the most current drivers. Problem solved, though once support for the 7950 ends I would be forced to use an older driver to run the cards together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond problem is\u00A0how windows works. Windows will allow you to designate either graphics card as the Primary Graphics Adapter\u00A0The primary graphics adaptor will, by default, do 100% of the rendering for every screen connected to the computer regardless of which GPU the monitor is actually plugged into, and there is a serious penalty for cross rendering (when one GPU renders the screen and sends it to another for display). Some programs, mostly games, allow you to select which graphics card to use. For all other programs, you have to set the desired GPU as primary before launch the program. The same situation exists for audio devices if you wanted to play background music over speakers while listening to game audio through headphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as performance gains go...to my knowledge no DX 12 title exists that takes advantage of asyncronous GPU\u0027s. BUT, if like me you say, like to watch LP\u0027s on Twitch or Youtube while playing something like Euro Truck simulator then you can boost performance by having a different GPU take on each task. I could set my 7950 as primary, open Chrome, then set the 480 as primary and open up a game. Chrome is now using my weaker card, and whatever rendering it does will have no impact on my 480, which is now free to dedicate 100% of it\u0027s efforts towards my game of choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real terms though, video rendering was about all that ever got offloaded, and both of the cards I am using are more than strong enough to render videos while gaming. It was just a complicated way to use more power and interfere with airflow into my gaming card. There is also a small performance hit to both cards, the 480 in particular, since my CPU only has 16 PCIe 3 lanes (so installing a second GPU cuts both down to 8 lanes. It\u0027s enough to potentially shave 3-4 fps off the 480).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
