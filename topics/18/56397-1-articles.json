My personal theory on Alpha/Pre-alpha is so that the developers don\u0027t have to have a massive testing team, they just have a few in-house and they let their buyers be a free test team. I\u0027m sick of Alphas/Pre-Alphas as well. It\u0027s one thing to have a complete game and have patches for it be released every few months, but it\u0027s another thing to have an incomplete game slowly get built. I like to use the metaphor of a house, it\u0027s one thing to have a finished house and have the siding or roof repaired or have an addition built onto it every once in a while, but it\u0027s another things to have a wooden frame having thing added onto it to become a house.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T21:19:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar/Clarifications\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T21:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people like to watch a game they love grow and be a part of it.

Alpha funding basically allows them to quit their job and focus on the game and that alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Indie studios this is the same, they don\u0027t have a ton of money to start out with, and they need to promote interest in the game, get people to test for bugs on multiple platforms bugs, and pay the rent while they do this. Large game developers such as EA, Nintendo, or Sony don\u0027t need to Alpha fund because they\u0027ve made so much money on previous games and other markets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally love Alpha funded games, i get to see it progress and change with my input sometimes helping change it. Many of these games such as Kerbal space program, Rust, Prison architect, Rimworld ect. Wouldn\u0027t exist without alpha funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Major game developers rarely risk stepping out of a highly successful franchise and take a risk doing sometime new, a game like KSP might not happen, or at least not be anywhere near the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
