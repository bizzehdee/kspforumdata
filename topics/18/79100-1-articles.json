The Apollo 11 anniversary has always caught my attention, but what\u0027s weird is, it seems to be catching a lot of attention this year. I\u0027ve seen folks on my social networks (who are not Kerbs, some of them I\u0027ve had for years) posting about the anniversary. One of my local radio stations has been doing a whole week of lunar landing trivia. In the past month or two, I\u0027ve seen numerous articles being published that suggest it\u0027s time for a new space race (what us space nerds have been whining about for years) and listing the reasons why. Resource harvesting has been brought up a lot too. And just as I was typing this, I got news about Buzz and Michael visiting President Obama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027s just a lot of freak coincidences. This is only 45, I\u0027d be expecting a lot more hype at the 50th year. There just seems to be some space enthusiasm coming from places where I would never expect to see it. I just can\u0027t help but wonder if somebody out there is trying to give America\u0027s People a little nudge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T01:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETBH, there does to be a subtle raise in intrest for space, it seems.
