Figured if any others are at work, seemingly bored and trolling the net. Feel free to post here. \n\nMainly just a rant.\n\nI myself am having a hard time motivating. Good job isn\u0027t the issue, just the work itself isnt what i want to be doing. And the fact I was out for a month due to concussion. Makes it hard to get excited about going back when you did not like it to begin with. \n\nTitle: EMR Sys Training Specialist \n\nWorking on a Labeling project at the moment, attempting to implement an SOP across all of our Clinics in regards to labeling Patient Lab Specimens at time of visit with certain variables. \n\nI keep running into issues with the EMR we use and the print drivers.... SMH. Like 6 months later. Almost ready to launch. After my first launch got scrubbed because of a bug. \n\nAm simply bored as heck. And I get paid way below the market average for this position. The Fringe perks are through the roof, but that don\u0027t pay the bills. Title is nice I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"hawkinator","CreatedById":57569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T17:33:20Z","Content":"Well I assemble grills at a Lowe\u0027s .

It is the Gov standard now for organizing and tracking all patient data from point of care to payment. \n\nMan. I must say. Stress sucks. It is either Stress from working a hard job or Stress from not making enough money. Or both. \n\nI miss working retail many days, I remember just droning out and getting through the day. Especially in a Home improvement setting, all the fresh smells of wood and dirt would be refreshing to me.\n\nHonestly after many jobs across many areas. From Cooking, to retail to manual labor. It is about what makes you happy and knowing what makes you happy. And trying to find a balance. \n\nThat is the most difficult part.

ICD10 \n\nMany many more codes compared to ICD9.\n\nFor people who don\u0027t know---- Everything from a splinter in the foot to the finger to having a headache to a broken bone to any illness or ailment. Has its own specific billing code. This is what the ICD10 and ICD9 happen to be. ICD9 is being phased out as it is a smaller list of codes. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Electronic Medical Records.
