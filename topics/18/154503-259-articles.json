At take off my 77W weighed 407,600 pounds with 39,700 pounds being fuel. KDFW has noise abatement in place and that meant i needed to use a derated take off. From a standing start to lift off was under 35 seconds, weight off wheels to 39,000 in less than 13 minutes. I am always impressed by the sheer power of the 77W and its twin GE90-115BL turbofans.

I am an AV geek that uses flightradar24 nearly everyday (free version) to see what is flying around my location. I live on an approach/departure path for an international airport as well as a major USAF flight training base and can confirm that the aircraft that it (FR24 using an abbreviation cuz y not) says will pass any location I am at will be that exact aircraft. Again, I have tracked and photographed highly specific aircraft that cannot be mistaken for other aircraft in an airlines fleet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221-american-boeing-737-823-n915nn-phoenix\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u0022900\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/1-american-boeing-737-823-n915nn-phoenix-sky-harbor-january-11-2015-brian-lockett.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 registration N915NN is a SINGULAR version of this livery. It is 1 of 1. Ive tracked this aircraft coming to my city on 5 distinct occasions and successfully photographed it. A feat made possible by accurate position reporting via FR24 and even Flightaware. If it (FR24) was on a delay as you insist then plane spotters such as myself would be incapable of imaging specific aircraft on limited time frames. Beyond that I say again, I have tracked flights with family members on them coming into my city. One prime example of FR24 being dead on accurate was a flight my father was on. I drew up a copy of his flights EXACT flight plan based off information found on 2 different sites that show planned routes. I drew up my copy of that flight plan using a program called Simbrief. It is a flight planning service we simpilots use to fly in MSFS. It is spot on accurate. Publicly available data and my own flight plan showed identical flight times, routing and approaches and runway for landing. However while his flight was enroute weather delayed the flight and the airport shut the targeted runway down and they required an alternate runway. I saw his flight change course slightly on FR24 to accommodate this change. Just as FR24 was showing me the flights position on approach, namely 60 seconds out, I started watching for his aircraft. And just as FR24 showed his aircraft should be crossing the fence of the airport an aircraft popped out of the clouds. The exact spot, the exact time and the EXACT AIRCRAFT. How do I know it was the correct aircraft? It was 130am and aside from 1 twin engine turbo prop his was the ONLY A321 landing or even close to the airport. That and just as his flight crew were turning off the runway i got a text saying he just landed and was taxiing to the gate. So 10 minute delay? Nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n062407152024\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-15T15:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt finally got cool enough that I can go running again.
