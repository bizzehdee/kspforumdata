I am an AV geek that uses flightradar24 nearly everyday (free version) to see what is flying around my location. I live on an approach/departure path for an international airport as well as a major USAF flight training base and can confirm that the aircraft that it (FR24 using an abbreviation cuz y not) says will pass any location I am at will be that exact aircraft. Again, I have tracked and photographed highly specific aircraft that cannot be mistaken for other aircraft in an airlines fleet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221-american-boeing-737-823-n915nn-phoenix\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u0022900\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/1-american-boeing-737-823-n915nn-phoenix-sky-harbor-january-11-2015-brian-lockett.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 registration N915NN is a SINGULAR version of this livery. It is 1 of 1. Ive tracked this aircraft coming to my city on 5 distinct occasions and successfully photographed it. A feat made possible by accurate position reporting via FR24 and even Flightaware. If it (FR24) was on a delay as you insist then plane spotters such as myself would be incapable of imaging specific aircraft on limited time frames. Beyond that I say again, I have tracked flights with family members on them coming into my city. One prime example of FR24 being dead on accurate was a flight my father was on. I drew up a copy of his flights EXACT flight plan based off information found on 2 different sites that show planned routes. I drew up my copy of that flight plan using a program called Simbrief. It is a flight planning service we simpilots use to fly in MSFS. It is spot on accurate. Publicly available data and my own flight plan showed identical flight times, routing and approaches and runway for landing. However while his flight was enroute weather delayed the flight and the airport shut the targeted runway down and they required an alternate runway. I saw his flight change course slightly on FR24 to accommodate this change. Just as FR24 was showing me the flights position on approach, namely 60 seconds out, I started watching for his aircraft. And just as FR24 showed his aircraft should be crossing the fence of the airport an aircraft popped out of the clouds. The exact spot, the exact time and the EXACT AIRCRAFT. How do I know it was the correct aircraft? It was 130am and aside from 1 twin engine turbo prop his was the ONLY A321 landing or even close to the airport. That and just as his flight crew were turning off the runway i got a text saying he just landed and was taxiing to the gate. So 10 minute delay?

I ticked a setting in the KLM (it manifested on the AAL 777) by mistake and this was 14-16 hours ago, and only now found out. I requested pushback from the gate to start my taxi to runway 27L. I wanted to turn the aircraft to the right to join the taxiway but my aircraft failed to turn. I stopped my aircraft and ran a personal check of settings. Control binds looked correct in the sims settings, rudder pedals moved. Then i hit my storm light (its a switch that brings all lights on the flight deck to max brightness instantly) and moved my rudder again. My tiller handle remained static. I use the X56 Rhino HOTAS so i need a combined tiller and rudder as I do not have a boeing yoke setup. The instant I saw my tiller as static I opened my aircrafts settings. Guess what setting I ticked. If you said Rudder AND Tiller you win! The setting I need is Rudder. Counter intuitive I know but in the PMDG code its a blended rudder tiller.

On the way back though it was weird. We never got an announcement the climb phase was over, although the seatbelt light did go off.

Thinner and cooler air. Im over Ireland about to go over the Atlantic and its -19c out there. As for turbulence? Without seeing the flight path or weather charts for your flight, I can only go on what I know/experience. If there is significant weather in the way most pilots will request a side step of a mile to up to 20nm if its passable laterally, ie a small-ish cell of storms or something. Sometimes the weather (storms and turbulence) is simply too wide and tall ie a storm from is 30-60 miles wide and tops out at 70,000 feet and goes far lower than your flight. In that case pilots will quickly check their weather radar and confer with ATC to get a vertical change to an altitude that is less trouble. If the RVSM (reduced vertical separation minimum) allows your flight at 34000 to descend if my flight at 35000 is on the same jetway (highway in the sky) then a descent for you and i would likely get a climb command to keep us apart and is both safely out of the rougher air. Its more complicated than that (pilots ((as in non simmers (((im just a sim pilot but fly with real weather and study level sircraft))) can better explain it that do this for real) but the tldr: most weather avoidance is lateral but sometimes a vertical change is the only option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope i made sense\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n032407242024\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2h43m into the flight and ive discovered a problem.

However I just experienced a patch of clear air turbulence about 40nm east of a bit of weather and my flight dropped 1400 feet in less than 3 seconds.
