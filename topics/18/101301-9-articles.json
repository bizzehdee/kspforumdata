The overpass led to a high density residential and a high density commercial section, and the main access led to the regional connection and the oil and timber industry with the low density residential sector on the other end. Plenty of roadway for my population.\n\nAbout 10 mins after plopping, I\u0027m seeing long lines of traffic at the off ramp. Apparently everyone who lived in the low density residential thought that the drive home from work would be improved by taking the off ramp, waiting at the intersection, then crossing to the onramp to resume their journey south...even though there were 2 empty lanes of traffic right next to them."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T00:20:26Z","Content":"I have found that left handed (or right handed, for those of you who drive on the left side of the road) exits make things SO much better on freeways.
