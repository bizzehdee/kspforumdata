Pretty normal sci-fi game so far right? But what makes this game different is that you are not a space marine, or space miner, or whatever hands on job they tend to put you into. Instead, you are a salvage drone operator. Your interface is mostly based on what you have on the drones\u00A0- camera, motion sensors, probes, all of which can be damaged and failed while you have to adapt -\u00A0and most uniquely, you control\u00A0all your drones using t\u003Cem\u003Eext commands\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0only! If you ever enjoy those hacking game where you rapid fire commands on keyboard, you will find the feeling here, only even more exciting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZCTP9dueng?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T13:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nzomg, its zork IN SPACE!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
