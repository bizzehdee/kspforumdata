I\\\u0027m launching one of these babies tomorrow morning. Suspended from a 1200-gram weather-balloon (filled with hydrogen), she\\\u0027ll have a 1.5 pound payload consisting of an RPC Electronics RTRAK-HAB radio tracker, a GoPro running at 720p, and a Canon Powershot still camera. In addition, the payload will have homemade li-po battery packs to extend the life of the electronics well beyond the 3.5 hour long flight. If all goes well, the whole assembly will be taken to over 30 kilometers altitude; well above the majority of the atmosphere (or at least the lower parts of). There, the two cameras will capture pictures of the earth and of the black sky above. At altitude, the balloon will burst, and the payload will descend at aprox. 5 m/s via parachute. Hopefully, it will be recovered, and I\\\u0027ll post the pictures here. Wish me luck! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T04:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t wait to see the results.
