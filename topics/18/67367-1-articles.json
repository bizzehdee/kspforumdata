A game like this doesn\u0027t belong in 32-bit area (meaning it can only use 2GB) and 2GB? With a game like this, I would be pleased if they upgraded to 64-bit, because at the moment KSP lags quite a lot (I know there are some people who have found ways to counteract this, or have super computers) for me.

Does that mean that Unity will make another version of the engine that will include a stable build of 64-bit?
