The closer ones cause glare and make it harder for your eyes to adjust to the dark."},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:04:34Z","Content":"Well one of the criteria for selecting astronauts is their problem solving abilities........."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:19:05Z","Content":"Won\u0027t be so funny if a dog or pedestrian gets run over in the dark spot left by the light. *Don\u0027t try this at home*."},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:23:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Won\u0027t be so funny if a dog or pedestrian gets run over in the dark spot left by the light. *Don\u0027t try this at home*.\n\nOdds of that are pretty low, particularly if he only does it while observing.

One streetlight out is **not** going to hurt things.
