Here\u0027s the thing. My physics teacher suggested me to do a short presentation about a rocket launch, ascend and other stuff. I decided to create one about space shuttle as its the most known rocket in my opinion (and i really love it). But there are so many things to say, the ignition sequence, the piloting, the shuttle itself, i cant even decide what should i start from. I wont make a yet another boring power point slideshow full of text, i have ability to make an animation of it. Any suggestions? I don\u0027t have very much experience in presentations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Everyone who will really help, will get a reputation point from me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T20:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would use a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://prezi.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrezi\u003C/a\u003E for this, as you can move around from slide to slide. I would move from the VAB to the launch site, up to space, and back to the KSC runway. Just my two cents. I would also give a more general view of a Shuttle mission. This would be structured as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E Everything before launch. The stacking in the VAB, the crawler roll-out, the launch tower. You don\u0027t have to go into too much detail, just be sure that you include this, as it is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E The launch itself. You can include the major events (SRB and liquid-fuel tank separation) as well as things that could go wrong (Challenger disaster, Abort-to-Orbit of STS-51F \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E[look it up if you haven\u0027t heard of it, a very tense moment in the Space Shuttle program]\u003C/span\u003E.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3)\u003C/strong\u003E SPAA\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAAA\u003C/span\u003EAACE! Take a view of some of the best things to have happened up there. (Examples: Building the ISS, launching various space probes, and even returning stuff from orbit!)

Atmospheric reentry, coming down to landing. Emphasize that you\u0027re trying to go from tens of thousands of mph to zero in a very short period of time. One thing that I always say here is that the Shuttle is the \u0022World\u0027s Fattest Glider,\u0022 and that it\u0027s amazing that the astronauts can get the Shuttle back to the runway at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, include anecdotes, use loads of pictures, and try to have fun through all stages of the presentation process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upsilon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T21:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead Richard Feinmann\u0027s report on reliability of Shuttle.
