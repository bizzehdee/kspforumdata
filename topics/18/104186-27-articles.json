It is like asking whether you are in the matrix or not. It is entirely possible that you are just a brain hooked up to a machine, with all your memory programmed and your sensations simulated. There is no way to prove that is not possible. Of course, there is also no way to prove that it is possible. That doesn\u0027t mean it is a useless question, however, since it provoke you to think deeply about the way you see the world, and find your own answers of what make up your subjective reality, and point out the differences that we see.\n\nBut you can always facepalm it instead of thinking about it if you like."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T07:59:46Z","Content":"Asking \u0022what make you facepalm\u0022, would be easier to ask what making you not ..."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T09:22:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Asking \u0022what make you facepalm\u0022\u0027 date=\u0027 would be easier to ask what making you not ...[/quote\u0027]\n\u003E Whoa whoa whoa, I actually understood what WinkAllKerb said!\n\u003E \n\u003E Hooray!\n\u003E \n\u003E (Also, that\u0027s quite philosophical, dude.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T15:47:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by windows\\_x\\_seven**"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T09:36:13Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t this topic getting slightly... actually, wildly off topic?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T10:25:51Z","Content":"As long as someone doing the facepalm to what have been posted, I would argue it is on topic.
