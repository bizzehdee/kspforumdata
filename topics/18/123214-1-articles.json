What kind of game is it? Don\u0027t fear to reference other games. Is it real-time, turn based? How is interaction with the player done, direct with \u0022orders\u0022 or indirect with \u0022area designations\u0022 (difference between sim-city where you just designate areas and transport tycoon, where you micro manage the schedule and roads for trains)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd some \u0022wireframes\u0022/sketches how you think the game will look. Really helps in grasping the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, if you actually are going to create a game with someone, someday, prepare for a lot of time investment, and do learn one of the \u0022skills\u0022 needed. Which can be programming, art (2D or 3D), sound design, music design, level-design. People don\u0027t really like working with someone who is just an \u0022idea guy\u0022, as ideas are usually cheap and easy compared to the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a fun hobby however! So don\u0027t hold back!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
