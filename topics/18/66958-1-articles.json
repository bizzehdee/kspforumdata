At least I hope they do. I can understand why though. It\u0027s easier to get an idea of what the worst-case scenario for memory use is if you do that, and what\u0027s more, optimizing software before it\u0027s finished, in an alpha no less, is the wrong way to go about things. Well usually. It\u0027s not so bad if you know you aren\u0027t going to change whatever you\u0027re optimizing ever again but who can say that? If it\u0027s not done, you\u0027ll inevitably just go back and change the code you optimized so that it needs to be optimized again for the changes. Big time waster right there. Even with a simply Python script, doing that could waste many hours. Expand that to a game like KSP and...yeah. Lots of time potentially wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance boosts from multiple cores are usually quite small for games. You can thread it all you want, but as almost everything needs to be done in realtime, you\u0027ll still only be as fast as your slowest thread. Everything else could be finished to render a frame but hanging for a bit waiting for, I dunno, some physics calculation to process. Most processors today run so blisteringly fast too that really all you need for a game is two cores, one if it will launch with just one available. If you want performance gains for single applications, you need to get into overclocking and custom cooling to give yourself more room to overclock with stability. Multi-cores are for multi-tasking, not for gaming. When building a gaming PC, you\u0027re better off getting the fastest clock speeds you can get on the most recent architecture, with a modest number of cores so that the game and system/background processes don\u0027t step on each other\u0027s feet, as it were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big benefit we\u0027ll likely see if Squad upadtes KSP to 64-bit the memory addressing issue being...addressed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Loading-up a pile of mods without out-of-memory errors would be nice. (I regularly get these. Running KSP I\u0027m on the brink of CTD pretty much all the time at an average 3.1GB memory use. Quicksaves are my friend. Lots, and lots, and lots of quicksaves.) And it does have practical application for the devs and the stock game too. I don\u0027t know how affected Squad has been by the 32-bit editor but plenty of devs designing large projects have reported the Unity 4 editor as being intolerably unresponsive. The new editor should fix that, and any less headache for Squad when using Unity is always good news for KSP. That, and planets and other systems, all that, could be hugely expanded without that 3.4GB ceiling. Just think about Krag\u0027s Planet Factory. That thing only added what I\u0027d call a rather modest number of new celestial bodies, but it eats RAM like mad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-14T04:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2014 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sakata","CreatedById":95648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T14:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThreading is also a damned headache when it comes to coding.
