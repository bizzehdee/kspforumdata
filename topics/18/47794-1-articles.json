The pressure on the members as the train goes across is color coded, so one can see where stress builds, and how it\u0027s transferred. This knowledge is crucial for strut placement. And it\u0027s actually pretty similar to the VAB, where you can pick different structural parts and place them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe there are actually a few games that do this, but I think the one I played was just called \u0022bridge builder.\u0022 It looks like the following picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/35000/35617/bridgebuilder-8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bridgebuilder-8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt taught be a lot about thinking how stress is transferred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now KSP is a combination of bridge builder, and Orbiter. .22 sounds like they\u0027re including Sid Meir\u0027s Civilization.
