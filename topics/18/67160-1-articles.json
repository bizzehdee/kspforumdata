Really I\u0027d like to be able to show the game off to people without necessarily bringing them all the way back to my place and sitting them in front of my desktop. Carrying around KSP in my bag would be a great alternative (plus it just sounds really fun to be able to play it while out and about).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m leaning towards Lenovo Thinkpads because I hear those are decently solid and have good keyboards (which is important if I want to use this in class to take notes). I would rather not get one with a discrete card because that usually makes the laptop more expensive and in my experience kills the battery much faster. So that would leave me with either Intel HD graphics or an AMD APU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is off of the wiki:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.0Ghz Dual Core CPU or higher (preferably higher)\u003Cp\u003E4GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E512MB Video Card, Shader Model 3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1GB Free HD space* Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 or higher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Debian based Linux distro\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, how would an Haswell Core i3 with Intel HD 4600 handle the game?

As long as the texture settings are kept low and you don\u0027t try to build large bases that float on the ocean, it will run OK. That being said, OK means different things to different people. My idea of acceptable is framerates of 10 FPS or more. Less than 10 really starts to become unplayable because you start to lose control of the action. Many of the users here who are used to using higher quality desktops will scoff at that. Also, mods like Time Control can help you play with higher texture settings by sacrificing game play speed, or playing in slow motion. It all comes down to your preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as one final piece of advice, I think your money would be better spent by buying 2 machines. One small portable cheapo laptop for carrying around to class, and another home based desktop for gaming. Buy the desktop one peice at a time and build it yourself. You will get more bang for your buck this way. And as a side effect, if you happen to get caught in a thunderstorm, or maybe just have a clutz moment and drop the laptop, resulting in damages, all you\u0027ve lost is your laptop. The gaming rig is safe inside at home. Just food for thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T20:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaptop?
