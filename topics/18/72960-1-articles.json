Another unit we got into way more interesting stuff, learning how our universe was created, and how stars lived and died. I often filled holes that were related to spaceflight, from saying that there is more than ONE type of rocket fuels out there, to explaining what the unoperational computer on the ISS did. But this only goes through the science aspect of spaceflight, and not spaceflight history itself. Even though people know about how stars are created, say what was project gemini, and they would say \u0022wut\u0022. All the schools teach what apollo and the space shuttle was as they were very recent and important in U.S. history, but they skip mercury, gemini, skylab, ASTP, and every important unmanned mission (only voyager 1 gained significance after news articles detailed how it was the first man made object in the solar system, and possibly its appearance in the reimagining of the cosmos. Also ISEE-3 might come into the spotlight). I find it disrespectful for people not knowing how we experienced space for the first time, how we learned how to go to the moon, how 3 brave men stepped into a capsule, never to come out alive, and how 2 nations that were normally hostile to each other, worked together above our heads. It\u0027s apart of our history, not only as a nation, but to all man-kind.
