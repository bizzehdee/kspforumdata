While it is true that you only hear one \u0022boom\u0022 (sonic booms from high altitude aircraft actually sound a lot like thunder) as a supersonic aircraft goes by, the guy a few dozen kilometers down the road will hear it too. He\u0027ll just hear it a minute or so later than you did as the aircraft passes his location. Much like the bow wave of a boat, the shock travels with the aircraft as it flies along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have experienced this personally. About a dozen years ago, while sailing a northern route across the Atlantic, we heard the Concorde\u0027s sonic boom many times. Sometimes more than once a day. This despite being thousands of kilometers from where the Concorde would transition to/from supersonic flight. You could recognize it as a sonic boom by the clap of thunder coming out of the clear blue sky, followed by the sound of far-off jet engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, as Nibb pointed out, a vapor cone can form while an aircraft is flying below supersonic speeds (TAS). Here\u0027s a video of an F18 developing a vapor cone during a high speed pass at an airshow in the US. Notice that there\u0027s no sonic boom associated with the pass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Q9pzC0Y8nc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-30T17:03:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2014 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed a spelling mistake.
