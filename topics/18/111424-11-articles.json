Home bases are protected, right? They weren\u0027t docked at the faction home?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:38:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Was that where you got the idea for the aurerrian star?\n\nNo, not really. That ship was called *Kalzoria Star*, though mostly because it was convenient to name it after something like that. Note that Aurerra and all related to it was from WAY before I started playing StarMade or doing that RP.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How\u0027d you lose them? Home bases are protected, right? They weren\u0027t docked at the faction home?\n\nNo, I\u0027d made a refinery outpost (it had four of each type of factory, and could produce in multiples of 1, 10, 100, or 1000) and docked my ships there. It relieved the stress on my computer, loading up all the ships docked at home base was starting to kill it. XD\n\nI got my standard mining ship back a while ago (AUS-1 Miner), it was docked at the faction base the last time I logged on. 10,000 salvagers arranged in groups of 20, two groups thick. Ate through asteroids like a hot knife through butter, had 170,000 shield hitpoints, and a 2-second-charge jump drive. At one point it also had 4 point defense cannons (Before I stripped the original down to make the megaminer. I forget which one I spawned in from the blueprints I had)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:53:08Z","Content":"Starwhip or someone, when i start playing, someone is going to have to,teach me this game.
