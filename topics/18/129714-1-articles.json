This was the beginning of Yogur Kerman\u0027s efforts to figure out what Mystery Goo is and where it came from. His next step was to attempt a material analysis on the goo itself. While none of the KSC staff would let him near any equipment that could be used to open up a mystery goo container, he was able to find some old spacecraft wreckage in Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company that seemed to have some mysterious residue on it. He scraped some up and compared it to his own Mystery Goo Jr. Novelty Science Kit, and found that it was in fact reacting more or less the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was finally able to use a Material Analysis Computatron to find out what the stuff was made from. Yogur was surprised to find that it seems to be made of the same stuff as living things. While he had seen no proof the material was alive, it seemed to move. Perhaps a large scale virus? He continued his study. He tried feeding it some food. The mystery goo seemed to attempt to eat the food, but spat it out. \u0022Perhaps\u0022 said Yogur, \u0022It can\u0027t eat snacks.\u0022 He then reached for some sugar. \u0022If you can not digest this stuff, then you can digest nothing!\u0022 He yelled at the goo.

Bob Kerman, one of his colleagues whenever he was on the ground, entered the lab. \u0022Still trying to figure out the mystery goo mystery, eh?\u0022 He asked. \u0022Yeah. Not really getting anywhere.\u0022 Bob poked the goo. It attached to his finger. Bob stood in a trance, unable to move. He collapsed, with the goo on his finger. The goo turned green, and then dripped off of Bob\u0027s finger. \u0022Oh what pain!\u0022 Bob cried. \u0022What suffering they go through!\u0022 He yelled. \u0022What absolute torment!\u0022 He blubbered. \u0022What terrifying agony!\u0022 He weeped. \u0022What--\u0022 He collapsed onto the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Bob woke up, he was in the hospital with Yogur, Jebediah, Valentina, and Bill surrounding him. \u0022The goo.\u0022 Bob said. \u0022We have to let the goo go!\u0022 Bob tried to sit up, but he couldn\u0027t. \u0022Listen, Bob.\u0022 A nurse said. \u0022That fluid-like-material\u00A0has damaged your nervous system. You can\u0027t move until the damage has healed.\u0022 She said. Another nurse held up a jar containing the now very green mystery goo. \u0022In here\u0022 he said \u0022Is the contaminant that has poisioned you.\u0022 Bob shook his head. \u0022No!\u0022 He said. \u0022That\u0027s no contaminant. It\u0027s alive! It talked to me!\u0022 Valentina leaned over\u00A0to Jeb \u0022He\u0027s insane!\u0022 She said quitely. \u0022I\u0027m not insane!\u0022 Bob corrected. \u0022It\u0027s telepathic. They don\u0027t want us to touch the goo because then it will talk! I found out what the goo is!\u0022 He said. \u0022It\u0027s a sapient race of creatures from intergalactic space. They travel in the mystery goo containers and try to explore new worlds. When their fleet landed on Kerbin, they were unable to safely exit their containers.\u0022 Bill said. \u0022That is the very definition of insanity!\u0022 Said Bill. \u0022No, it\u0027s not. Think about it. Why are the containers already space grade? Why are we unable to open them properly? Why do they behave alive? Why do they react to their situation?\u0022 Yogur dropped his pencil and slapped his face \u0022Of course!\u0022 He said \u0022It makes perfect sense.\u0022 He swiped the mystery goo jar away from the nurse and touched the material. He shortly passed out. After enough people caught on that this was no insanity, Kerbalkind eventually had to pass legislature enabling the goo legal rights. Some of them even liked Kerbin enough to call it home, and so were granted citizenship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that, little Billy-Bobfred, is why you can\u0027t say mean things to the blue goo in the swimming pool at your school.
