Having bought a pair of binoculars to see space with, I got them out. The Half-Moon was the only thing worth seeing (Binos not too powerful, 10x50\u0027s), and boy was there some neat things to see. I only viewed it when it was full, but I was surprised to see the peaks of the mountain ranges; they jumped out at me like nothing other. I thought \u0022Hmmm... Maybe I could try to take some pictures\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got my digital camera, a 12 Megapixel point-and-shoot that really didn\u0027t have any business doing any sort of astrophotography, and proceeded to make a setup. I rolled up one of the eyecups on the bincos to make it easier for the camera to butt up against the eyepiece, and then carefully balanced the binos on the edge of a 5*5 inch post so that the Moon was somewhere in the view. I tried to take pictures using just the camera, but my hands were too shaky to even get close to getting a decent picture without ruining the balance of the binos. Not owning a full-sized tripod, I proceeded to get an old neck lanyard meant for ID badges. I then clipped it into the camera\u0027s wriststrap hole. I pulled the lanyard taut to make it harder for my hands to shake and then positioned my body so that the camera would look into the eyepiece. It worked for stabilization in the past, but it wasn\u0027t good enough for astrophotos. The picture got better, but it was still too uncontrollable to take a good picture. I then proceeded to find an old miniature tripod meant for tabletop shooting, and holding it\u0027s folded legs in my hand while at the same time stretching the lanyard to a medium tightness, but not too tight. Success! I had finally gotten control! I finally got some well-framed shots, but they weren\u0027t the best quality. I fiddled around with some settings and got the best quality I could, and then I proceeded to take some shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got them back to the computer, they didn\u0027t look too great. But, y\u0027know what? They seemed pretty good. I didn\u0027t really mind the low-quality. Nor did I get my blood pressure up over the Moon not being exactly in the centre. I didn\u0027t mind the blurry appearance, either. I honestly thought that the shots looked better because of the blur. That\u0027s when I realized that I finally learned to love the blur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KHyLVgDl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KHyLVgDl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YhaBE1Kl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YhaBE1Kl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGQL1YWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WGQL1YWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tN1kZbrl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tN1kZbrl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OVkCmewl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OVkCmewl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BErCpIul.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BErCpIul.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R8LGW8Pl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R8LGW8Pl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T05:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsolidated into the existing space pictures thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T22:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgh, September was the last post here?
