Found a nice, safe spot to stop that was both legal and off the road, and camped out for a couple hours.\u00A0A coal train drifted past just as I entered totality... which was exactly what I wanted, and what I had the camera set up for. Then I realized \u0022Hey, self, swivel the camera up and take some pictures of the Moon.\u0022 So I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy camera was in no way set up correctly for those shots, but I think it did well enough.

I didn\u0027t really pay it much attention, but apparently the rest of the herd decided to shrug off the leader and\u00A0follow that one cow.\u00A0After the totality was over I looked down to see a whole herd of cattle standing at the fenceline\u00A0staring at me, all dead-silent.

The travel is going to be the harshest factor. The 2023 one is actually a near-hybrid - some part of the extreme paths\u00A0of the eclipse (so those close to sunrise/sunset) are actually annulars, which then turns into total eclipses closer to the center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223154444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161011\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503374381\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA coal train drifted past just as I entered totality... which was exactly what I wanted, and what I had the camera set up for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.
