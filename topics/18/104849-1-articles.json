Now yes it is science fiction in the sense that it takes place in the not so distant future and it has not actually happened. However for anyone who has read it Andy Weir has gone through painstaking effort to ensure the realism of this book. The ships, the infrastructure, the characters, the situation are all very possible and stay well within reality while at the same time being extremely compelling. \n\nNow since it is such a great story hollywood has sunk its ravenous teeth into this story. Obviously they are interested in it because it is a unique story and the ability to create a film that isn\u0027t a remake or derivative is an exciting prospect. It is or was directed by Ridley Scott and will star Matt Damon as Mark Watney, basically the exact opposite of his character in Interstellar \\*spoiler\\*. So I guess this is a book club discussion page? What are your thoughts? Have you read the book? Do you want to read the book? Are you excited about the movie? What do you think of the cast? I will post production pictures from the movie as they come out and more thoughts as the film gets closer. Anyway......discuss.\n\nEverything so far...[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3025060/First-look-Matt-Damon-Jessica-Chastain-astronauts-set-Ridley-Scott-s-film-Martian.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3025060/First-look-Matt-Damon-Jessica-Chastain-astronauts-set-Ridley-Scott-s-film-Martian.html)\n\n\\*Warning\\* this is a discussion thread so spoilers are allowed and should be expected below.

I hope it doesn\u0027t look too futuristic. I pictured the infrastructure to look similar to the planned mars mission infrastructure. The SLS for example. Also I wonder what the resupply ship looks like. In the book they try sending him supply\u0027s and because of the haste it explodes after takeoff. Wouldn\u0027t it be cool to see an SLS blow up?

He\u0027s a good actor when playing his strengths, but I don\u0027t see cocky and cynical astronaut being one of them.\n\nIn fact, one of the best examples of how a poorly-selected lead actor can ruin what otherwise would have been an amazing film is another Scott work, Kingdom of Heaven. Everything about that film was amazing, from the music to the cinematography to the support actors--really world-class, once-in-a-generation epic material. But then Orlando Bloom would open his mouth and suddenly each scene became impossible to take seriously. His \u0022right before the big battle\u0022 pep speech in particular goes down as one of the most truely painful dialogues in quality AAA film-making.\n\nIn case you couldn\u0027t tell, I\u0027m really worried that the same thing is going to happen here. Take a talented guy like Sean Patrick Flanery with his wise-guy persona and let him flourish under Scott\u0027s direction.
