In the fall I will be going very far north for college, and from visits know that it is easy to get away from all light pollution and get an amazing view of space. Because of this, I\u0027m interested in purchasing a telescope for myself, and was wondering if the KSP community had any recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECriteria:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECost less than $200\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAble to withstand below freezing temperatures for short periods of time\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETripod so I can easily use (6\u0027 2\u0022 is my height)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMagnification so that I can at least view the red spot on Jupiter\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESmaller size it better, but not if it violates the previous criteria\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading and any advice you can give.

I guess for planetary observations, refractors are better,, while for deep sky observations reflectors are better (at least if we compare telescopes of equivalent diameter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get the biggest diameter for your money, I guess a Newtonian is the way to go (with other words, the simplest type of reflector telescopes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
