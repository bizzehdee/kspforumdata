You could stock up some pretty big advantages in Creature Mode. Your tribe automatically got a domesticated animal for each other species you ended Creature Stage allied with, for instance, and that automatic protectable food source was a huge benefit. Beyond that, you just basically had to avoid fighting two other tribes simultaneously.\n\nIf you did it right, Civilization could be a cakewalk. You only had one type of land vehicle, one type of air vehicle, and one type of sea vehicle at any one time, so the one key strategy was to build ridiculously fast fragile vehicles, and claim all the spice fountains within reach, then obliterate enemy cities one at a time, by producing a large number of speedy vehicles, racing them over to the enemy city, and transforming them into nearly-immobile tanks for free until you were unstoppable (assuming your civilizaton was Millitary or Religious, anyway) and could inexorably roll over the rest of the planet with your unconquerable blimpswarm.\n\nSpace... Well, I do have to admit, once you can basically obliterate an enemy civilization at will, can make milk runs to the galactic center through thousands of parsecs of Grox did get repetetive. A few times that an alien race demanded that I help them stop a virulent disease that endangered the biosphere on one of their colony worlds, I sterilized the planet. But that did get repetetive.\n\nGalactic Adventures held my interest for awhile because the adventure designer, while pretty cumbersome, did make for some interesting setups"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T05:40:44Z","Content":"[mod]Too unrelated to the roleplay, moved to Off-Topic.[/mod]"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T06:47:14Z","Content":"What\\\u0027s so bad about spore?

She\\\u0027s a genius Spore creature creator. She\\\u0027s managed to create creatures which look pretty damned close to humans, or at least some fictional characters. You can find her work scattered around there. She may enjoy having a new project to work on after so long.\n\nIf she feels like doing it, the result will be pretty damn good. I guarantee it.\n\nEither send Amber a PM over there or just make a topic in one of the Spore sections; it\\\u0027s likely she\\\u0027ll see it within a few days, despite the forum being largely abandoned by many of its users.\n\nGood luck.

Again, boring.\n\nTribal stage - Like Civ stage only more boring.\n\nCivilisation stage - This is the stage I like most. Whilst I wish you could actually build cities like in Real Life rather than just jacking other factions\\\u0027 cities, the strategy involved is fun. I like building HSD land/water/aircraft, so that I can use them here. I also never do the speedercar\u003Edisband\u003Eslowtank tactic, because I\\\u0027d prefer my vehicles be balanced. Makes it that much more interesting, like raising the difficulty level by some.\n\nSpace stage - Has potential, but there\\\u0027s no actual space travel, and you can\\\u0027t have space dogfights. Plus, it crashes all of the time, and there is no autosave feature. That problem has lost me many strong alliances and huuuge... tracts \\\u0027o\\\u0027 land."},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-07T17:54:30Z","Content":"Spore was pretty fun.
