That got me wondering which other nation-related games the KSP community plays. Poll time!\n\nStop reading now if you don\u0027t care about my pointless opinion-speech-rant-thing\n\nPersonally, NationStates is the oldest one but it seems like the most interesting one. It gets boring fast though. If you don\u0027t like RP, and I don\u0027t particularly like it, then the only thing to do is vote on resolutions and enjoy the burning satire in the daily issues.\n\nCyberNations is a newer game that I briefly checked out to see if it was any better (Reddit seems to prefer it), and it did seem interesting at first, but then I actually looked into some of the community game guides... and got disappointed fast. The only way to grow your nation is to grind, do math, and wait. Everything involves number-tweaking, and everything has a percentage attached to it. Successful players are the ones that switch out their buildings on a regular basis, and honestly, the whole thing feels way too artificial.\n\nSo, there\u0027s my opinion.

And there\u0027s also eRepublik, where you play as a citizen of a country, have a virtual job and participate in your country\u0027s/international politics. [http://www.erepublik.com/en](http://www.erepublik.com/en)\n\nDefinitely feel you on NationStates. Mostly I have an account there to write a factbook about my country - for world building purposes - I might go into international RP but I\u0027m not sure. They rolled out NationStates 2 for a time, which was supposed to be all the issues and roleplay plus actual economics and war mechanics, but they rolled it back for some reason and I\u0027ve never heard a peep about it again.
