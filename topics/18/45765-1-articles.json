The government initially set in place a 4-stage evacuation process: a prohibited access area out to 3 km from the plant, an on-alert area 3\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015320 km from the plant, and an evacuation prepared area 20\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015330 km from the plant. These evacuation areas were based on radioactivity levels above 20 mSv. On day one of the disaster nearly 134,000 people who lived between 3\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015320 km from the plant were evacuated. 4 days later an additional 354,000 who lived between 20\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015330 km from the plant were evacuated. Later, Prime Minister Naoto Kan issued instructions that people within a 20 km (12 mi) zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant must leave, and urged that those living between 20 km and 30 km from the site to stay indoors.[182][183] The latter groups were also urged to evacuate on 25 March 2011.[184] . . .\u003Cp\u003EOn 22 August 2011, a spokesman of the Japanese Government mentioned the possibility, that some areas of the evacuation zone around the nuclear plant for \u0022could stay for some decades a forbidden zone\u0022. According to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun the Japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store radioactive waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents.[193][194] Chiaki Takahashi, Japan\u0027s foreign minister, criticized foreign medias reports over accidents in Fukushima Daichii as overdone and excessive. But Takahashi added that \u0022he can understand the concerns of foreign countries over recent developments at the nuclear plant, including the radioactive contamination of seawater\u0022.[195]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo . . .
