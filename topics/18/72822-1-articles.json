Since I can\u0027t afford having a computer for work AND a gaming platform, I need to carefully balance work \u0026amp; fun. I\u0027m about to buy a new laptop because my old HP mini-tower is getting old (Intel Core 2 duo @2,6 Ghz, 4 Gb memory and on-board crappy video card). My work requires Windows and CPU/memory-intensive software (I work with heavy databases and perform data analysis tasks as a consultant), so I guess it\u0027ll be okay for gaming as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering what kind of performance I could expect running KSP on, say, a Lenovo T440s (Intel i7-4600u @3.30 Ghz, 8 Gb memory) or a Lenovo W540 (Intel i7-4700mq @3.40 Ghz, 8 Gb memory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone running KSP on laptops with comparable specs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T19:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you go with a desktop computer you could afford having both for sure.
