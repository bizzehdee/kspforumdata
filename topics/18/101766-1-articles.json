There is a free downloadable demo available, supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nThis is an educational recreation of the Apollo 11 mission in virtual reality. They\u0027ve used archived footage and audio, and built detailed models of the command and lunar modules for you to ride in. The demo is the first few minutes of the mission, plus some extra stuff to lead you into it, including part of JFK\u0027s 1961 speech asking Congress to initiate the Apollo project.\n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1436197736/the-apollo-11-virtual-reality-experience-education?wecandoit](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1436197736/the-apollo-11-virtual-reality-experience-education?wecandoit)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T17:08:56Z","Content":"If I had a credit card, I would DEFINITELY support this!
