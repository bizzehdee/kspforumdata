All this post does is make you look elitist, not to mention that the way it\u0027s worded invites drama instead of avoiding it. Are you sure that drama follows you around because of \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E people\u0027s actions...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA community is made a good community by the mature behavior of \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of its members. This includes being mature enough not to point at others and laugh about how much those kiddie noobs suck, haha, look how I am blocking them all. I\u0027d like to think that the KSP community, if it is as good as its members claim, would be above this kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for judging a community from interaction experiences, there\u0027s a few tidbits to consider from a social sciences perspective:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinecraft is a multiplayer game, KSP is not. That is a pretty major difference. It\u0027s incredibly easy to happily agree with each other from the safety of your very own protected playing sandbox, which so conveniently shields you from the simple truth that the internet is a zero consequence, total anonymity club (at least as far as the common user is concerned). If KSP was a multiplayer game from the get-go, and there were public servers open to anyone, our experiences might be quite a bit different. You\u0027d see people with admin rights and people without, you\u0027d see people use these powers and you\u0027d see people abuse these powers, you\u0027d see contention over who deserves having them, and you\u0027d see people socially engineer (or buy) themselves on the right side of that power difference. You\u0027d also see people join a server for the sole purpose of launching a rocket into someone\u0027s space station, and if they get banned, who cares? They weren\u0027t planning to stay anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be hard to accept when looking the largely good behavior of the forum population we have here, but there\u0027s another statistic to consider: less than 5% of people who play a game will ever visit that game\u0027s forum, and of those who do, less than 5% will sign up, and of those that do, less than a third actually post more than once or twice. What you consider \u0022the KSP community\u0022 is actually just a tiny subsection of all KSP players. Less than half a percent, probably. Once multiplayer is stock, that will lead to quite a few surprises and incensed forum posting, I guarantee it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good takeaway is, be wary of public servers. In Minecraft, in KSP, in \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E online game. Instead, it can help tremendously if you can find yourself some friends in the parts of the community that you enjoy interacting with, and play together with them. For example, I\u0027ve hosted Minecraft servers for my online friends for almost three years now. These servers have exactly one rule: \u0022be excellent to each other\u0022. And I\u0027ve not had a single problematic player incident in all this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottomline: a community is as good as every single member makes it. No single person is exempt from the responsibility of acting mature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belphegor","CreatedById":118918,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T15:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epf that game lasted 5 minutes here. reminded me of childhood.. brother breaks my lego tower, i push over his. both cry. moderator mommy bans us both from legoland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enever understood the minecraft hype anyways. and i agree, ksp community is awesome. all the old-timers here should be proud. btw, if you want a glimpse of the worst community ever, play rust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LexiSilva","CreatedById":85488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T15:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, okay!

Currently I\u0027m very fond of the Electrical Age mod, which is, at least to my knowledge, the most realistic electrical circuit simulator in which in contrast with programs like TINA, and Edison Multimedia Lab, you can actually wire up a simulated 3D environment with electrical circuits. While it simplifies some things (eg. there is no AC and DC electricity, just a mixture that takes the best from both worlds) I\u0027ve always wanted a simulator where you can build a house/village/building etc. and then can wire it up realistically with electricity. With the help of this mod, I\u0027ve built a hydroelectric power plant transmitting electricity to three NPC villages, which all have streetlights and electrical supply in every house. You have to account for voltage drop, generating enough current to not have lights flicker when you turn on an electric furnace, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LexiSilva","CreatedById":85488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T16:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Special Agent Sigvan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Special Agent Sigvan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat doesn\u0027t make Minecraft a bad game though.\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s face it, there is far more creativity available in MC then there is in KSP, quite a bit more freedom to do whatever you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that doesn\u0027t make the community any better, I still love the KSP community, I\u0027ve stopped playing KSP though after the move to curse ruining my ability to get my mods effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m not attacking the game in any way.
