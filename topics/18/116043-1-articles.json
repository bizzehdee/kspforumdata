The prototype had the equivalent wingspan of a current day B-52 bomber. However it was crashed and destroyed during its third (?) test flight with a seventh engine installed between the tail boom (At the time Russian engines had very little power), the crash was caused by the vibrations caused by the seventh engine breaking part of the tail boom, locking elevator control during a shallow dive as part of a speed test."},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T19:35:42Z","Content":"Wow.

Far from shore, shearwaters often closely follow the contours of the waves, and gaggles of auklets fly rapidly just above the water. Skimming permits the birds to take advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as \u0022ground effect.\u0022 The patterns of airflow around a wing that is operating close to a surface are modified by that surface in a manner that reduces drag, the resistance of the air to the progress of the wing. Sometimes overloaded airplanes are sometimes incapable of climbing out of the ground effect even though they can maintain flight close to the ground.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Thus, everything else being equal, it is more efficient to fly close to a surface than far from it. But things are rarely equal, which is why birds most often tend to take advantage of the ground effect when the \u0022ground\u0022 is water. The ground effect only occurs when the flying object is much less than a wingspan from the surface -- and at such an altitude over land a bird would be continually flying among obstacles, through grass, and so on. Only water is sufficiently uncluttered to permit such close safe passage.\n\nLearn tricks from nature\u0027s toolbox."}]}
