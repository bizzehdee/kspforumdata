The game was very popular, and many fans of the game, including myself, were heartbroken when they stated that is was to be discontinued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game was surprisingly intricate despite its simple graphics. It was primarily block-based. You could build your own warships, ranging from early World War II styles to more modern styles, down to the smallest detail. You could then take your vessels into combat in specific player vs AI missions or multiplayer battles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a free game, which may explain why it was discontinued. However, perhaps Squad could pick it up from where Phyzios left off.
