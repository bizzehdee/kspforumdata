What would be best is a phone with Android 5.0 and higher but with the same size of the screen. The problem is that doesn\u0027t leave me with much options, so I also thought about buying something like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-blackview-bv6000\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.

In 2 month it fell on a soft surface, however the screen was broken. Sony doesn\u0027t use gorrila screens so my entire touchscreen didn\u0027t work too.. When I got it repaired the frame was slight in an angle, so there was always a little pressure on the screen and back, resulting in a really short life..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter using the phone for a year, because I really really like how sony works, I decided to put away the phone and bought a huawei P7.. Just a cheap, at that time not the most populair phones. at the beginning it was all fine, but in a short time you can really experience why those phones are cheaper.. The phone just got slower and slower, and yes I\u0027m know the tricks and tools to keep a phone fast. It was not that the phone was lagging all the time, but it just took som time to open whatsapp or youtube. When streaming a video from youtube on another app, it jsut didn\u0027t work how it had to work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what you seek in a phone, but most phone have there quality spread over all there specs. As for the phone you mentioned, I don\u0027t expect it will run everything smooth for long when using it much and I think it won\u0027t get 2 years old. But that just depends on where you\u0027re using your phone for.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment I pay \u20AC32,- p/m (for 2 years) for the Sony Xperia Z5 premium. I know it\u0027s a expensive high-end phone with a 4k screen you don\u0027t need, but I like the overall specs a lot. I use my phone a lot, for work, emails etc.. To be sure that the screen won\u0027t break this time, I\u0027ve put a hard-class screenprotect on it. And I think after 2 years of use, I can still sell it for atleast \u20AC150,-..\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make a point: if you\u0027ve ever used a phones that works almost perfect, other phones, especially low budget, can be big disappointment. I think the most important thing is to search for a phone that can handle your style. You don\u0027t need to walk around with the newest high-end phone of the world all the time when you are 14 years old. But I would recommend to look at the \u0027populair\u0027 componies for cheap phones. What you also can do is buy a phone second hand (but please be carefull). For instance: you can get the sony xperia z3 for \u20AC200,- now in the my country, but that phone is still one of the phones that runs everything smooth till this day, and much better specs comparising to your suggestion.\u00A0(same for samsungs, Iphones, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo keep a look out on ebay or other little markets. Maybe a friend of yours have a phone he used a few years, but he wants the newest one, you can often get it cheap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T08:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuying cheap phones can work out wonderfully. I have used my previous smart phone for 4 years, which is a really long time for a smart phone. It was a phone you could buy for around a 100 dollars.
