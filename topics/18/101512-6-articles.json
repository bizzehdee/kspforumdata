Heat itself isn\u0027t so much the issue, insulation is.\n\nIt\u0027s a sad fact that we had developed and deployed the technology to prevent this happening in the 60\u0027s (controlled nuclear fission(\\*)), but ironically the greenies \u0022save the earth - no to nukes\u0022 movement has now doomed us to large-scale environmental changes.\n\n(\\*)Not saying this technology is the bee\u0027s knees, there are definite issues, but overall it\u0027s the best and cleanest that we have Right Now for large-scale industrial power generation."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T11:29:12Z","Content":"\u003E The greenhouse effect has then caused enough warming to start melting tundra areas that contained a lot of methane in the form of permafrost. There are similar effects at play with melting glaciers interfering with warm and cold ocean currents. These are called positive feedback loops and explain why the whole climate is getting out of control. Some of those effects are indeed natural, and much stronger than any man made direct influence, but they were triggered by human activity.\n\nThis. \n\n The natural sources of greenhouse gases are now much larger than the man- made sources, and so it is impossible for changes in human behavior to have any effect on it (positive or negative).

Half of the timber cut down is used for fuel, and for the people who are doing it it is their only possible source of income.\n\n This means that stopping the activity will likely create a major humanitarian crisis unless it\u0027s replaced with something else.\n\n Certainly not condoning chopping down rainforests for fun \u0027n\u0027 profit, mind you.

It was on the order of something like 6% (or 6 ppm) reduction.\n\nMy view is that if we were \\*that\\* close to an ice age, mini or otherwise, then it is just sensible to have a little more CO2 than that (like 50-100 ppm) to act as a buffer so we as a planet are not quite so close to having a 400 year winter, which is a lot worse than a 400 year period where temperatures are a degree or two higher than an arbitrary baseline.\n\nIf you look at geological timescales then we have regular periods of the planet trying to kill all the life crawling about on it using the mechanism of ice. We are overdue for one.\n\nUnlike some I don\u0027t see that as a desirable situation. \n\nOn another note :\n\nI forget which report it was but a report from the IPCC about arable land and food production that I read stated that the overall capacity of the planet to produce food would not change (with increased temperatures in the range predicted by the IPCC) but the places that were best to grow food would move.\n\nIn the report it also said that if we keep our ability to move food around the planet at the current rate then there would be no food crisis of any sort except one due to a Malthusian catastrophe...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Even if you\u0027re driving off a cliff, it\u0027s still worth hitting the brakes.
