Then again, the slower hardware was running Linux as the host OS instead of Windows 7.\n\nWin10 still looks like a toy OS, with a lot of GUI design principles learned over the years tossed out by a new group of visual design artists. And takes 10GB to install. 10GB!! Ok, that may not be much when compared to the size of modern hard-drives, but SSD\u0027s are -still- expensive-ish. I seriously don\u0027t see why a brand-new OS install should take that much space which I would much rather use for applications and data. Especially given the incredibly primitive (and surprisingly slow) graphical interface. How bleeding hard is it to render flat shaded rectangles?\n\nSo yeah, thanks but no thanks; they will prise Win7 (for when I do have to use Windows) out of my cold dead hands, unless MS wakes up and releases an OS worthy of the name of \u0022upgrade\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T10:39:07Z","Content":"hmm... when is Win10 becoming available?
