Furthermore, the materials required to build anything space-related are quite hard to obtain for a country that is hostile, due to trade sanctions and the like, and even if they are obtained they will most likely be wasted in early testing (see North Korea\\\u0027s recent space exploration attempts). A more realistic prediction would be that we see rises in insurgency, due to sub-standard quality of life, in countries with a low GDP which might lead to more events like the \\\u0027Arab Spring\\\u0027/civil wars (although, how much of Arab Spring was an independent uprising is another matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t imagine that any developed countries will go to war any time soon, we just no longer have that \\\u0027enemy mentality\\\u0027 where we feel disdain for the other country, technology like the Internet has made us realise that we are not that different.
