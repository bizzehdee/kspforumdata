Many apologies if this is too personal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally have no friends/family affected(because i live on top of a hill beside the Bow River), but my parents have friends affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide-note: They cancelled finals for the Catholic schools due to teachers not being able to get to school. Which i kinda good i guess. Really sucks what it cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you live in High River, I hope your safe and sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry if this is a little heavy-hearted.

Amazingly my house was untouched (though the bank did collapse even more). I just spent all day cleaning the mud out of someone\u0027s basement.

Looks like itll be a week or two before i can go home. Warning went out by twitter and facebook, neither of which i use, so i saw first hand how quickly it happened. My first warning was water too high for my matrix to drive through and rapidly rising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think i am one of the more fortunate in high river as my home nearly avoided flooding, the water level doesnt appear to have gotten high enough to flood the main floor, though it did flood my basement. Having recently moved in(not even two weeks) with plans to renovate the basement, it was empty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
