I get to go to the movies at 9:00AM and eat popcorn and snowcaps before lunch. The fact that I have off from work and the martian comes out next friday is simply fate. I might just have to stay there all day and watch the movie 5 times. It also gets me really excited that I have not seen one bad review for this movie. Every single review praises it. The only bad opinion I heard was that it was too optimistic. Which is exactly what many critiques of the book where so.......HYPE!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T20:05:33Z","Content":"Real conversation I had with my wife yesterday:\n\n\u0022We need to get a sitter so we can go out for dinner and a movie next weekend.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\n\u0022Because Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Oh, is that next weekend?
