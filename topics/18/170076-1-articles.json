Which is great, but would probably need a new computer to get the most from, also it will be expensive. But it might drive down the price of the original model. I have also heard that the kit that made the Acer version possible, might spawn several other 3rd party models, which might be a better price-point too.

With 3D immersion, its more like \u0022AHH WHAT THE $%\u0026amp;^\u0026amp;* WAS THAT?!?!?\u0022 because something just flew right past your ear.

But they are quite efficient and only one needs to be able to see you at any one time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanding or \u0022room-scale\u0022 VR is exhausting. Before you know it you\u0027ve been on your feet for 3 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Room scale\u0022 VR needs a LOT of room, mostly its not an option. (And frankly, even with the largest room scale setups, you still cant walk all that far.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere arent actually that many decent games yet for VR, one or two AAA titles and a few pretty good bespoke VR games, but a lot of quite simplistic, casual or just trashy games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan, the big fat wire is a pain, but mostly you dont notice it (until you do) but the wireless addon is like, another \u00A3500. Thats a lot for a minor quality of life upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the vive controllers were bulky and ugly, but guess what? It\u00A0doesnt matter because you cant see them lol!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a little while after using it, after removing the goggles, you are still careful try\u00A0not to bump into objects that you cannot see, and try to reach for things without walking too far. Its weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say you cant \u0022see\u0022 the controllers, but you can, because most time they (or a version of them) are simulated for you exactly where they are in real space. Its accurate enough to be able to find and press buttons by seeing where they are in VR. Its very cool. For example, when you put the goggles on, obviously you cant see anything real. Except the controllers are like, right there! And they are real and you pick them up and well, did I say that immersion was \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal\u003C/strong\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResolution. Probably the weakpoint of the tech. You are staring at the screens from an inch distance, you\u0027d need an absolute TON of pixels to bring that up to HD or 4K density of detail. Even with the Vive Pro\u0027s enhanced resolution, you can still perceive a little fuzziness, still see the pixels if you squint. There\u0027s a lot of room for improvement here, but having said that, resolution is not bad and the size of the virtual display is of course massive compared to the slice of vision that even a very large 2D monitor fills. Thats what all those pixels (1440*1600 per eye) are used to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nField of view is nothing to worry about. It is quoted I think as 110degrees, and what you see when you wear the goggs is a large circular aperture whcih fills almost your entire field. Only the very edge of peripheral vision is blacked out. Basically you hardly\u00A0notice the deficit, it is effectively your entire field of vision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunnyStory\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E: My fiance tried it. But something weird happened. She didnt seem to have the natural knack of hand-eye coordination between visual input and controller. When using the controllers in 3D space, she used them more like a keyboard and mouse attached to a PC rather than using them as her actual hands. There seemed to be a disconnect between being \u0022in\u0022 a simulation and \u0022operating\u0022 a simulation using fancy tools. I think if she plays around with it for a few hours, it will \u0022click\u0022 into place and she will suddenly become much more proficient, but watching her trying to manipulate menus was painful! And surprising, actually I had assumed that everyone would take instantly to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr - I had a nice windfall and bought an HTC Vive Pro. It lives up to the hype. This is the future. Even a true, goggle-less 3D monitor would not supercede this level of immersion, I cannot think of a device that would make this obsolete (apart from 100-year away tech like every surface [like, including the kettle, doorhandles etc.]\u00A0\u00A0in your house is part of an active display), only improvements in resolution and ease of use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and one last thing - I have an \u003Cstrong\u003EnVidia GTX 970\u003C/strong\u003E GPU, the minimum spec listed on the HTC website and it runs perfectly smooth with everything I have gotten around to doing so far. Im sure I will find things to do that will tax the graphics harder, but there was certainly no massive FPS drain caused by powering the double-displays in the goggles, even with the Pro\u0027s resolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as you are above a certain - apparently reasonably low - threshhold, you definitely do not need huge graphics power to drive these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-31T10:37:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2019 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
