You may want to play games less competitively, and play more against the improving AIs where you are free to set the difficulty of the opponent and care less about the results of the match. Civilization, for example, may get old after a while, and people generally find one strategy that they like and stick with it. You might have more fun choosing different leaders and using strange, unique techniques just to see how they work to extend the lifetime of the game and minimize memorization of tactics. In KSP, certain rocket designs are common and work well, but that doesn\u0027t stop players from making outlandish craft for poops and giggles. Try playing a noncompetitive game of Starcraft with a build mainly of roaches and corrupters, or play chess using pieces only on one side of the board. When games with too much choice end up being too restrictive, use self-imposed challenges to break free of the meta."},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T03:05:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have heard many of the same complaints from people I know who have played it...Just another in the current series of \u0022Look at the pretty lights!\u0022 games, I suppose...\n\u003E This particular example aside, the gaming industry really depresses me right now; if it were not from KSP, I would just have washed my hands of it completely...Almost every studio I know of, from indie to AAA, has run its games into the ground in recent years.
