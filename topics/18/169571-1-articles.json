With school in less that ten days, I decided to get used to a PC again (as I had been playing games such as GTA V, Star Wars Battlefront II, Star Trek Online, AND Kerbal Space Program - mentioned later) on my Xbox One. You can imagine running a game such as KSP on a laptop, and go, \u0022okay, what about it?\u0022 Well you see, I have so many mods in my game, that when I played it after school, I would go and have my shower and by the time I had put on my pyjamas, it had just finished loading. Roughly around 15 mins.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy average frame rate is 35, the graphics have to be turned on to \u0027Low\u0027, but I don\u0027t care.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECause I have some new wireless headphones, that project audio clearly.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHave you ever heard the beauty of the main theme in surround sound headphones while your parents and sister argue over rights to Netflix usage? I can\u0027t even hear them, as these block incoming noise very effectively.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso over the holidays, I celebrated my\u00A0birthday. And I got the best gift of all: The LEGO Saturn V kit. I had to stand on my chair to put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E in place, my cat knocked it over (resulting in a very miserable Thursday night having to rebuild it, with Ally sitting on the box just watching me, laughing as I have to build it again after her crazy chasing around the house), and I just spent nearly a day building a custom launch tower for it, as I\u0027m putting it on display at the local library with my dad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for those who were saying \u0022\u003Cem\u003EHow do you have KSP for Xbox, if it\u0027s not in the store?\u0022\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EWell you see, I kinda have it just sitting in \u0027My Games \u0026amp; App\u0027s\u0027, ready to be played. I know it\u0027s glitchy, there\u0027s no debug menu or mod support (yet), but it was fun seeing my mum and dad try to complete the Kerbal X tutorial mission. Mum got off the launch pad, only to crash, but dad actually got into orbit!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with school fast approaching, I shall be preparing to sit outside my locker for 90 minutes\u00A0a day, looking at the various stories on the \u0027Mission Reports\u0027 section, and downloading more mods to further push my available RAM size to dwindling proportions (until it gets deleted by the IT department for the quarterly computer check. Many people have said to delete System32 to hide their games, one actually did it).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that, hello again!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-14T19:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm currently saving for my Lego Saturn V!
