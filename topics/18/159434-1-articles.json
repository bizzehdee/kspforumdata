The orbital mechanics and physical properties, as well as aerodynamic forces, of vessels in game are pretty darn close to real life, but while Kerbin and Mun are no doubt modeled after our own planet, it in no way meant to be a scaled-down version of our system. Kerbin is Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T02:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Kerbin-Mun distance never changes, rather than IRL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new scientific definition of \u00221 meter\u0022 should be: \u00221 meter = 1 / 12 000 000 of distance between Kerbin and Mun\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T15:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find KSP to be 1/10th real scale in planet sizes. That would make Kerbin about 0.94 Earth radii (with a higher density than Earth), or 6,000 km in radius. Eve, by comparison, in real life would be scaled to 7,000 km (1.09873 Re). It would have an incredible density of 8.532 g/cm^3, making it an iron planet and explaining those weird seas of liquid metals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass is something different. Kerbal-scale mass is 1/100th real-scale mass. I found this out when making the Trappist-1 system for Interstellar Adventure Revived. Eve would have 2.0523 Earth masses, while Kerbin would only have 0.887 Me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe Kerbin\u0027s semi-major axis is real scale. However, Kerbol should be a red dwarf star of about 0.376 solar radii. I will do some calculations later to see how massive Kerbol must be, and also how hot it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-21T16:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, the Kerbin is just loosely a 10x smaller version of the Real Solar System - there\u0027s a lot of discrepancies, like the Sun being quite large, the Mun being quite close, and strange bodies like Tylo and Minmus.
