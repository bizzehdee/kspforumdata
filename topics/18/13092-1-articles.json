Imperial measurements are really only any good when talking about rough measurements. Like saying this place is about a mile away, or I need a cable which is a few inches longer.

In other words, I know exactly how much 500 pounds of force does, how far a mile is, and how fast 200 MPH is, because I have a sense for those units. Not so much for metric.

Despite 4 years of physics, I still prefer imperial units, and approximate one meter to one yard and one kilogram to 2.2 pounds to get a sense of how far or how heavy stuff are (yes, kilogram is mass, pound is weight, but that\\\u0027s how my mind gets a sense of how much mass there are).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, I don\\\u0027t mind the imperial system option NOT to be added because having two scales will really throw off people, especially when people are teaching others (tutorials or otherwise).

The game could still use metric to carry out calculations, and you put in a preference for imperial and all it does is converts the values stated in game in to imperial. So it still carries out calculations with the masses in kg but when you mouse over a component it converts the mass in kgs to pounds on the gui but not in the calculations\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T20:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\\\u0027m opposed to having other measurement systems is the same reason that metric was adopted by most countries - we need a standard. Some claim that it is easier to comprehend certain measurements; I prefer the imperial system myself. But remember, in KSP these notions hardly mean anything. The scale of the celestial bodies and rockets are skewed considerably from real life counterparts. It\\\u0027s a matter of which system is easiest to use, and that happens to be metric.
