It was tiny, though. But if\u00A0the US\u00A0didn\u0027t fight, especially later in full combat, eventually the Axis Powers would have triumphed at over most of the world. But the giant was woken, and since that resulted in the Axis\u0027 defeat, I\u0027m grateful for their sacrifice, and for\u00A0those who were on\u00A0the front.
