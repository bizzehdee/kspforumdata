Sure, there are some things that it does right... but there are some really notable physics errors that uninformed players will also \u0022learn.\u0022 I was disappointed when the game was first released, and seriously irritated when I learned that NASA had an Angry Birds exhibit in their museum. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(sigh)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a really good way of teaching about rocket science, although the learning curve is definitely steeper and some people would find it less fun. Still, though, there\u0027s no reason why NASA can\u0027t back KSP the way it has backed Angry Birds. KSP is more accurate, has more achievements, and most importantly, \u003Cem\u003Ethe aim of KSP is to build physically correct contraptions, not to kill ovoid green pigs.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo quote Marja Kottinen (at the bottom of the original post\u0027s article):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our partnership [with NASA] has blended entertainment and \u003Cem\u003Eeducation\u003C/em\u003E, which has been enjoyed by millions of people worldwide ...
