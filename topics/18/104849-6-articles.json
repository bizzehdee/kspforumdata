AND it looks beautiful. So I am very optimistic, also they must be doing something right because it\u0027s now been bumped up to an October 2nd release. It\u0027s being released two months early! So now no competition with Star Wars, bond, and mockingjay.\n\nI agree. I haven\u0027t yet read the book but I will pick it up the next time I go by a library or book store (I am old enough that I prefer my books \u0022analog\u0022). I am hopeful that the movie will be faithful to what is by all accounts a great story. If they do at least as good a job at staying faithful to the plot (within the restrictions of a screenplay) as they did with Ender\u0027s game, it will probably be brilliant. Orson Scott Card was heavily involved in the production of Ender\u0027s Game and it showed. Hopefully Andy Weir\u0027s involvement in the production of The Martian will pay similar dividends."},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T02:02:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree.

They should be floating around, or have to be buckled in.\n\nFurther niggle - the hab seems huge! And really super heavy! I got the opinion in the book that it was basically just a tent, hence why the hab material came in so handy. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the look of the Hab in the trailer, but everyone else was raising problems so I thought I\u0027d pile on!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T17:01:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deserdi Verimas**"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T17:32:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nOr we could sit back and enjoy the portrayal of a good story for once, and try not to dwell on the allowances that they had to make for the story to work as a movie?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T17:41:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or we could sit back and enjoy the portrayal of a good story for once, and try not to dwell on the allowances that they had to make for the story to work as a movie?\n\nThank you for saying this! !!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T17:50:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the allowances that they **had to** make for the story to work as a movie?\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nThey didn\u0027t have to make any allowances!"},{"CreatedByName":"Deserdi Verimas","CreatedById":100022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T18:26:21Z","Content":"Not saying I\u0027m not going to enjoy it!
