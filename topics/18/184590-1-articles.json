It works by sending\u00A0out an FTL ping\u00A0signal that reflects back to your vessel the distance and location of only objects that have as much mass as your spaceship or less. The smallest mass it can detect is\u00A0a kilogram. The FTL ping travels a light year per minute, and takes equally long on the return ping reflected back to you. So for Alpha Centauri, supposing you pinged the various multitude of asteroids\u00A0over there which would take\u00A0about four minutes, you could get a return ping in about eight minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJumping radius: A ship can only jump near an object\u00A0at a 30 kliometer radius. Likewise to jump out a ship must be past the 30 kilometer radius of only\u00A0objects that have the same mass or less down to a kilogram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: It is wise to ping at least\u00A0twice, as that gives some indication of whether or not the object you are juming toward has a predictable orbit as well as it\u0027s velocity, which can be ascertained by the distance traveled between pings. That way when you do jump you won\u0027t have the object crashing into you at orbital speeds, as you can adjust\u00A0your heading\u00A0before you jump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvantages: Great at detecting objects in space, has a max range of 7 LY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisadvantages: You only know the mass, distance, and travel heading of a detected object, you have no way knowing what it is until you jump. Only that it has either the exact mass of your vessel or lower down to a kilogram. It also cannot detect planets or stars (unless you really do have a ship that massive LOL). Yet a planet might be inferred by a lot of orbting objects relatively close to one another. So you could jump and look. Especially with planets like Earth with a lot of orbital junk. Or Saturn, which has MUCH more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow your turn!\u00A0You can make an FTL drive made with the specific\u00A0purpose of either trade, war, or exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Universe-Live-Wallpaper-For-Pc-9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.wallpapers4k.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Universe-Live-Wallpaper-For-Pc-9.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-19T08:28:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2019 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T09:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConvoluted and oddly specific arbitrary limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFTL drive should not be designed around the role of the vessel.

Not to say some haven\u0027t done it the other way around, \u0022The Void Captain\u0027s Tale\u0022 springs to mind. I think the drive in that one came after the plot. The danger of allowing multiple drive physics with only societal constraints is that they can and will be violated. I\u0027ve only read it once, Brin\u0027s \u0022Uplift\u0022 \u0027verse.

It generates a field that reduces the effects of general relativity. The field size is relative to the cube root of the mass of the phlebotinum. The strength of the effect is inversely related to the square of the curvature of space, logarithmic to the amount of power applied, and linear to the mass. Generally larger ships increase the mass of phlebotinum. It is possible to synchronize multiple fields to allow for larger ships. However, the equipment required generally move expensive than just increasing the amount of\u00A0phlebotinum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means is that a ship can go as fast as it wants as long as it has power available to pump into the field. The speed though is limited as well by how deep it is in a gravity well. Apply more power and you can hold a given speed deeper, but the amount of power goes up quickly the deeper you go. Generally commercial and civilian ships take the hit on speed rather than increase the mass or devote uneconomic amounts of volume to power generation. Of course military, certain policing, and some of questionable ethics vessels don\u0027t have to worry about such constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-21T10:52:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2019 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-20T11:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing on from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/77368-steuben/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002277368\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/77368-steuben/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@steuben\u003C/a\u003E\u2018s post, without knowing anything else about his worldbuilding (so this might be completely wrong), it looks like his drive would be pretty good for an interstellar trader, or an exploration vessel but probably less good for a combat vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, it\u2019ll work well for any application where you\u2019re either not spending a high percentage of your flight time in a substantial gravity well, or if the stuff you\u2019re doing in that gravity well isn\u2019t time critical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA trading vessel might be slower than molasses near a planet but most of its time is spent in interstellar space where its speed is far less restricted.

It generates a field that reduces the effects of general relativity. The field size is relative to the cube root of the mass of the phlebotinum. The strength of the effect is inversely related to the square of the curvature of space, logarithmic to the amount of power applied, and linear to the mass. Generally larger ships increase the mass of phlebotinum. It is possible to synchronize multiple fields to allow for larger ships. However, the equipment required generally move expensive than just increasing the amount of\u00A0phlebotinum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means is that a ship can go as fast as it wants as long as it has power available to pump into the field. The speed though is limited as well by how deep it is in a gravity well. Apply more power and you can hold a given speed deeper, but the amount of power goes up quickly the deeper you go. Generally commercial and civilian ships take the hit on speed rather than increase the mass or devote uneconomic amounts of volume to power generation. Of course military, certain policing, and some of questionable ethics vessels don\u0027t have to worry about such constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n??????

But I tend to like Scott Manley much more since he does not come off as arrogant, making assiming a lot about his viewers and readers like Winchell or whoever writes the text on his website does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeed is not too important. Usually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, the logical thing to do for an exploratory mission is to send a scout ship and lay out some satelites to serve as jump points later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do not send a crewed ship to unexplored regions, it just makes no sense. First you send the scout, seed the solar system at strategic orbits of interest, THEN send a trader drive ship to jump in and explore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince sublight engines have limited delta v, this would conserve it. Before jumping back home or near a jump recharging station, a ship will auto calculate how much charge it needs to reach the nearest recharging station in a reasonable amount (hours or less) of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship will request to jump back before it crosses into the red (the charge it needs to reach the nearest recharging station).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo ship captains have to be judicious about how they thrust, even though fuel us unlimited so long they recharge at a station. Stations get their power from the sun, but they use exotic matter fields on the charge given to ship engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate, stations have a breaking in period of 300 earth\u00A0days before the exotic matter fields finish properly synching with the solar converters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce turned on it can not be turned off, only destroyed, and the 300 day wait is a given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-22T02:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2019 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
