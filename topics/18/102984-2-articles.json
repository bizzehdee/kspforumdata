Get out of house\n\n2. Go inside a hut.\n\n3. Turn off a light switch\n\n4. Get out of hut and walk towards house\n\n5. Notice that the light is still on\n\n6. Go to step 2, repeat.\n\nI was having that dream relatively often, until I noticed I could use it in order to induce lucid dreams. I don\u0027t think I have had it again ever since.\n\nOh, another weird dream:\n\nI had died and became a soul. I began to wander around a somewhat crowded city that for some reason had a lot of parks. I then saw my physics teacher\u0027s soul, ran over to him and gave him a hug, asking he how\u0027d he die. I then saw his real counterpart getting into a fight with a classmate of mine in the middle of the street, with both eventually being ran over by a bus. I then went to continue wandering and I noticed that there was always a guy that looked like the Fallout 4 Vault-Tec rep around me (I never played Fallout 4, by the way), but kept on going.\n\nEventually, I reached the school where I studied at for about 11 years and went inside it. Inside the last classroom I studied at there, there was a boy being scolded by two teachers, one I do not know and one that works at my current school. I then talked to some other soul and decided to troll the people inside. I went through the door and kept running and jumping around in a gravity defying-fashion.\n\nThe teacher I know then scolded me. I had no idea that they could see me, so I poked my right hand\u0027s index finger into my left hand and asked her if she could see that, which she said she could. I then ran away from the school and reached a park, where the \u0022Vault-Tec rep\u0022 was sitting down. I asked him what was his name, and he told me it was \u0022Polyester\u0022 (Kinda admired him, he was acting like he was some kind of guard or something in the dream).\n\nAt the park, I wondered to myself (was semi-lucid) if I could build a rocket. My view then went into the sky and through a cloud, after which I saw **vikings inside hot air balloons floating up**. My view then went to space, where I could see a red version of the world map, which then focused into Japan.\n\nI teleported to the same farm I mentioned above and saw two cats, a large and a small one (this all felt like a cutscene). The small one was very playful, and the large one was trying to rest. I then spawned at the house. Interestingly, this time there was a car parked in front of the hut. I kept on doing the cycle for about 3 times, until I heard a lot of dogs barking. I ran to the house but the door wouldn\u0027t open.\n\nI saw the first dog running at me, so I ran to the car (it was a hatchback), opened its trunk and got in. It was somewhat hard to close the trunk\u0027s door, and when I finally managed to close it a dog managed to open the driver\u0027s door and charge at me, which made me wake up.\n\nI think my brain doesn\u0027t want me having lucid dreams. You know, the farm dream thing kinda seems like a dream prison, and I found it really weird that when I noticed that I could use it to get lucid I stopped dreaming about it.\n\nSome days after having the last \u0022farm\u0022 dream, I managed to induce a very vivid lucid dream. I managed to do some stuff, but after a while I got teleported into darkness, where I could hear my mind kind of talk to another being:\n\n\u0022He shouldn\u0027t be doing this. He shouldn\u0027t know.\u0022\n\nI remember that it said a lot of philosophical stuff, but I don\u0027t remember what it was.\n\nBrains are weird.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-07T18:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2016 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**"},{"CreatedByName":"CAKE99","CreatedById":150099,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T01:23:43Z","Content":"*In a dream,* I robbed a store, with a gun.  \n\n***It was just a dream.***"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T03:02:05Z","Content":"I remember when I was a kid I used to have this dream, exactly the same, several times.

I had a gun. I guess I knew how to fire it because I killed a bunch of them. But there was more. The fat kid and the girl got shot, and I was in a building. I used my gun to kill a bunch of them. As they overwhelmed me, I went into the next dream (or scene 2).\n\nIt was me, alone in a city square. It was sorta like Half-Life 2. Big posters with the dude on it, and a bunch of cops walking around, always keeping an eye on everyone. I ran into a group of teenagers in an alley. I got beaten up, but we all became friends. Apparently, the teenagers had a plan. The plan was to take down the CEO of the world. He was in a grey suit, and was always followed by two smaller men, wearing the exact same suit. The plan was to figure out a way to become extremely tall, and to punch him just in the right place to where he would die. After a few days, the \u0022drink\u0022 was perfected. They gave me the job of ending this world of business once and for all. I grew about 20-50 ft tall (forgot that part). I readied my fists. Somehow, the CEO found out., and he grew to around my size. I got beat up pretty badly. I managed to hit him at the right place at the right second. He fell, never waking up. I shrunk, nose bleeding, black eye, and 3 missing teeth. I got swarmed by the group. We all cheered. As we were walking back to the hideout, the two men next to the CEO grew, and we ran. There was a second batch of \u0022drink\u0022. I tried to hit them.
