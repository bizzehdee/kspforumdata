If there\u0027s one kind of tree on one side of the planet, it\u0027s also on the other side of the planet. The terrain is considerably more diverse, though, and geological formations vary fairly considerably across a planet\u0027s surface. There isn\u0027t a supreme amount of variation on each planet, but there are large variances between planets, (if not in the terrain, then in the flora, fauna, and resources).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at screenshots of different planets, you\u0027ll see some similarities, but the differences are unsubtle enough to distinguish one desert-and-red-crystal planet from another desert-and-red-crystal planet. It also seems like Hello Games is taking care to make sure that each planet offers a slightly different gameplay experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother note on variety: The planets that have been shown so far are from the outer edge of the universe; they get considerably weirder\u00A0and considerably more varied the closer you get to the center of the universe. Hello Games, despite having announced the game\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eearly, is keeping the awesomer (a word I do not use lightly) stuff under wraps so it\u0027s a surprise (and a genuine discovery)\u00A0when players encounter something really cool that they didn\u0027t know was possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to point out, after this text-brick hype-rant, that I\u0027m a total skeptic where video games are concerned.

There\u0027s a good chance that there\u0027ll be two or three planets that look almost identical, but there\u0027s a very small chance that you\u0027ll encounter both of them. There are eighteen quintillion\u00A0[18,446,744,073,709,551,616, actually] planets in No Man\u0027s Sky. It\u0027s a pointless number, but it has a purpose; no matter how much people play, there\u0027ll always be something new for \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E to discover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve mentioned before, there are a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eton\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof variables that go into planet generation. While there might be two planets that differ by only one percent, you aren\u0027t going to find them both. Also as mentioned before, planets are generated to be more surreal (and more awesome, and more dangerous)\u00A0the closer you get to the center of the universe, which throws another layer of variation into the mix. If things start looking similar (and I\u0027m not even sure that they will) then it\u0027s time to move on towards the center.
