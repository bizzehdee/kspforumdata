Would I rather they\u0027re different? Of course. Is the game unplayably terrible because of them? Not really.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI made a scant few graphical changes in line with common suggestions (turned off Vsync, went to windowed mode. That may have been it but I may be forgetting something) and kept FPS at 30 (I\u0027m not one of those \u0022Anything less than 120fps is a child\u0027s toy\u0022 people) and other than pop-in, I\u0027ve been very happy with both the visual quality and the performance in general.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlying a ship in atmosphere with a mouse and keyboard can be frustrating as all get out. As far as I can tell, \u0022Roll\u0022 isn\u0027t a thing in this game and if your ship\u0027s upside down, well it\u0027s just going to be that way until you turn enough in the correct direction (which is likely not the way you want to go) to get it upright. I spent a lot of time upside-down, and a similar amount of time with my ship flying happily along at a 45 degree angle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is not one single decent map function, and many things are totally lacking maps. There is no map of planets you can refer to and mark waypoints. There is similarly no map of the system you are in. The little map of things around you in the ship\u0027s cockpit is - as far as I can tell - completely useless except to show you were planets are (which isn\u0027t that important as most of them can fill the field of view). The only map that serves any purpose at all is the star map and it\u0027s so frustrating to control that I find myself just jumping to the first star I manage to highlight that it tells me I can reach. Following the story, I had to plot a course to a specific star that was not marked (it was between me and the destination) and I managed it, but it was not enjoyable to do so at all.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI seem to have broken the storyline, or am missing something. I suspect the game told me something that I didn\u0027t notice and now I can find no record of in-game text, and no list of current goals (though that does exist in the very early game). I have a space station marked on my HUD but I can find nothing there to interact with, that I\u0027ve not interacted with already. I\u0027m on the verge of Googling my way through the mission. If you\u0027re curious, I\u0027m in that aforementioned system, one jump from an Atlas waypoint star, with no hyperdrive fuel and no way (that I\u0027ve found) to buy or make it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr, I like the game. If it was $30 I\u0027d say it was an insta-buy. For $60 you have to really like the genre and feel (as I do) that multiplayer is not just \u0022not a big deal\u0022 but actually undesirable.
