Pull up a chair if you don\u0027t already have one.\n\n~~~\n\nOnce upon a time, I had a *really* awesome friend named Logan. Logan was an incredible person and a great friend to hang around with. He was, in many ways, your stereotypical comic-book nerd: he had a pretty impressive paunch and didn\u0027t care too much about his physical appearance, he liked wearing t-shirts emblazoned with rather obscure comic books, and he hung around with fellow comic-book enthusiasts pretty regularly. And yet, he was empathetic and great at talking about almost anything. (He had even heard of Kerbal Space Program, and this was back in 0.23 days, before the game was quite as well-known.)\n\nSo we got along famously for an entire semester (we were taking a college class together). On the very last day of class, right before finals, I take a look at the four or five tiny pins on the side of his backpack. I had known they were there for the entire semester, but they didn\u0027t seem to have much on them. With a bit of a start, I realize that the pins have MLP \u0027cutie marks\u0027 on them (the little cutesy symbols located on the ponies\u0027 flanks).\n\nI pointed it out, and he sheepishly declared that he was one of those guys who likes the show. He then talked briefly about how there\u0027s a quiet majority of people in most of the major fandoms, and then there is the very loud minority who ruins it all. He did not want to be part of that minority. If people recognized the symbols on the little pins, he could talk with them about My Little Pony. If not, well, they didn\u0027t do anyone any harm.\n\nLogan was a wonderful person. Unfortunately, I\u0027ve only vaguely been keeping in touch with him. Maybe I should shoot him an e-mail.\n\n~~~\n\nI suppose my point here is that every fandom seems to have a load of quiet supporters who are perfectly respectable members of society. They also seem to have a small but incredibly vocal faction that is dedicated to making everybody know that ***they are a member of this fandom and you should be too.*** It\u0027s not really accurate to judge the fandom based on that minority, as tempting as it may be.\n\nFor the record, while I\u0027m really not a part of any fandom, I\u0027m strongly sympathetic to the \u0027brony\u0027 community and have several friends that enjoy the show. I can see why they like it, though it\u0027s personally not my cup of tea.\n\n~~~\n\nBack to the drawing. It\u0027s really good. It looks suspiciously like it\u0027s based on KSP, especially with the rocket augered into the ground at an angle in the distance. I wonder why the pony on the left has Kerbal-esque head lamps while the other two don\u0027t...?\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketfeline","CreatedById":137938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:58:39Z","Content":"Aw dingus.
