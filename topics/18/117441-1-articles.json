So now I am running my laptop on AC power with unplugged battery until I can find a replacement.\n\n But for some reason, sometimes the laptop just flat out power off on its own (no set time, sometimes 30 seconds after power on, sometimes a few minutes), and refuse to turn back on, which require me to unplug it from AC power, hold power button for a bit to use up residual charge, then plug it back in, at which point it automatically power back up ( note I did not press the power button again, it just power back up right when I plug it back to AC power). It will then run for a bit and then power itself off again, and the cycle begins a few more times.\n\nSometimes I luck out and it works fine, even for a week or two, and I can just shut down through window and using the laptop normally. But occasionally, especially after power blackout (which happen around here sometimes) the cycle begins again.\n\nAlso, sometimes it will power up by itself if it suddenly power off earlier. Kind of like it is throwing a tantrum being used without a battery.\n\nAnyone knows if this is normal or not? Is there a way to make sure it stays powered on reliably instead of me going through cycles and hope it sticks?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T05:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:21:30Z","Content":"I have not mucked about with a laptop in a long time, so this may be out of date: IME, many laptops use(ed) the battery as a kind of power filter / buffer, as such some machines will not power up at all without some battery (even a dead-ish one) installed.\n\nIf this is the case with yours, weird things may happen without a battery, and if you have particularly unreliable mains you could even do damage to the machine. The only solution I see here is the obvious one: get a new battery.\n\nIf you must run without one, at least plug it into a surge protector.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T15:23:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**\n  \nmore \u0027n\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T18:58:13Z","Content":"Which type battery ...
