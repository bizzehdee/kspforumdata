No offense.\n\nWhile I\u0027m in agreement that we need maintain respect for all people (see #4 below), I want to make a few points in defense of this thread:\n\n1) We are sharing humorous anecdotes while simultaneously relating to one another our shared concern about the state of modern education. Examples of the failure of said education systems are inherently sad and potentially hilarious. There\u0027s nothing wrong with sharing these responses on a forum of like-minded people.\n\n2) There is no bullying involved whatsoever. We are anonymous Kerbals on an internet forum and the people being discussed are in no way being harassed.\n\n3) We did not put the words into the mouths of the people who said them. Whether borne from ignorance or stubbornness, there are consequences for speaking lies or misinformation. I believe EVERYONE should expect ridicule if their actions deserve it or they are maintaining a contrary argument. (Including me, bring it! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) )\n\n4) Despite what I say above, I, and it seems most in this thread, wouldn\u0027t rub mistakes into the faces of the people making them. Calmly explaining and correcting is a more mature response, and we all seem to maintain that knowing and teaching the truth is the priority, with laughing about misconceptions coming second. Sometimes attacks on people\u0027s intelligence are made (hey, we\u0027re human here, after all), but I think the majority opinion here is that misinformation is the enemy and not people.\n\nIn summary (TL/DR), I believe this thread is harmless and I feel that the community continues to prove it\u0027s maturity because, even in a thread about \u0022how stupid people outside of it are\u0022, members can be found elaborating how they tried to improve things and discussing the root causes of \u0022stupidity\u0022 rather than just bashing people. Although some bashing does happen, because it is funny and we can\u0027t all be high-brows all the time."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T15:12:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Remove the fuel from the boosters?
