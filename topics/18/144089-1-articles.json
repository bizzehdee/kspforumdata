Steam tells me I\u0027m 150 or so hours into it, feels like more.\u00A0I really haven\u0027t entirely figured the game out, and it doesn\u0027t help that the rules change every time I come back to it. Do I like it? Maybe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really have a favorite country. The Ottomans are one of the more interesting early-game countries in my opinion, and far less annoying than any of the Western\u00A0powers or anybody in that God-forsaken Holy Roman Empire. I\u0027ve also found the American tribes to be a welcome change of pace, especially the Aztecs with their Doom system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a bit of success as Moscow, Denmark and Spain, and once turned Scotland into a colonial powerhouse after losing most of the homeland to the English. England is also interesting, and incredibly stable (like, 200 years of peace and no Wars of the Roses stable)\u00A0if you sell all the continental provinces to Spain/France/Brittany/Flanders and focus on the conquest of Ireland and the colonization of Africa/America.\u00A0I\u0027ve yet to find a way to survive as France, and always get curb-stomped by Austria/Portugal/England when playing as them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably my most successful run was an American \u0022western\u0022 custom nation where I ultimately built the Panama Canal in 1799\u00A0or so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere lately I\u0027ve been focusing more on random New World maps, which get interesting at times. Especially when there\u0027s only a handful of islands and no large landmasses, as in my last game. (And what landmass it had was already\u00A0occupied by the Knights Templar, who were none too happy about being expelled from Europe.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThaZeus","CreatedById":148344,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T01:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269224\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/69224-cydonian-monk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cydonian Monk\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Cool, my best success is playing as Canada via the Extended Timeline mod.
