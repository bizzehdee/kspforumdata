they are cute at 6 weeks and its easy to find homes for them. ive heard more reputable cat breeders prefer closer to 4 months. i once acquired an entire litter of week old kittens from a mother that died and i had to bottle feed them. its one of those things thats cute for the first couple days before the sleep deprivation kicks in. but because i could control their interactions with humans they turned out to be pretty good pets. the worst ones are the ones that haven\u0027t been socialized by humans. when picking a kitten out of a free kittens box, try to find one that melts into you. if they seem tense or fearful in any way, you might have problems later on down the line. its back to that spay/neuter thing, because you could be up to your eyeballs in kittens if you let it get out of hand. you can (and should) get a shelter cat, but sometimes they are so bureaucratic and it takes forever to get approved for a kitty when the pet store will just hand one to you for a nominal fee, and there are always free kittens that end up in the shelter system anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy old kitty is gross and will never not be gross. he is in the process of deteriorating, literally rotting from the inside out and i dont think he can reach anymore. i should give him a bath but i think that might kill him hes so frail. but he can still chase a dog out of his territory so i dont want to put him down. i also have a fat cat that has difficulty sometimes. water makes the fur mat up, so i just tend to use the clippers periodically to keep the fur under control. i suspect feline diabetes, though i dont think i can afford the treatment for that.\u00A0will probibly restrict her diet more when the old kitty kicks the bucket. if i tried to do that now the other kitties
