Tell it a specific set of sites to pull information from\n\n2. From those sites, have it pull the Headline, Author, Date, Link for articles posted as they post\n\n3. Display this information in a manner similar to how CKAN displays\n\n4. Allow me to categorize these links\n\n5. Create HTML coding for these categories to copy/paste or auto-post to a website\n\n6. Create peace in the Middle East\n\nSo:\n\n1. Is there something like this out there\n\n2. If there isn\u0027t or I do decide to go a custom route, how long would this take to code/test (for the purpose of calling BS on programmers as necessary)\n\nThe reason why I post this here:\n\n1. KSP has an amazing collection of modders so it seems there are a number of experts (or maybe even someone willing to do it)\n\n2. I tried Reddit and I hate posting to most of the subs on there\n\n3.

A bit of googling should throw up any number of examples that you could try adapting. Stack Exchange is probably a good place to start - I\u0027d certainly look there before reddit.\n\nYour major hurdle is wanting to do this for a number of sites, it\u0027s easy enough to write a script to scrape a single site, not so easy when you\u0027re trying to do a one-size-fits-all script.
