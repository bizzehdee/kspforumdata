Though I cannot agree with such a blatant copy of someone else\u0027s work, the SimCity IP has been so brutally mauled and murdered by EA that it was in dire need of a fix. Maybe it would have been better if they decided to make their own game a little more, but either way, the city builder community is served. This seems to be exactly what SimCity needed to be, and what people paid for.

Unfortunately that is all they did and since the original game was never designed to be properly multi-threaded, the result is pretty much the same. Performance is still horrible, even on truly powerful systems. \n\nAs much as I would love to see different, it all screams *lazy port*. Absolutely nothing shows they put any real effort into this. They just republished the game with the minimum effort required.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I doubt it will improve but if that company ever wants to sell another title they really need to.\n\nThe new owners manage to fool people every time. First it was Platinum, now it is XXL. They just come up with some fancy story and cash on the people that fall for it again. A lot of people see the potential that is there and get scammed out of their money because of their hopes.\n\nI would not be surprised if the exact same thing happens again a year or two from now, though if *Cities: skylines* turns out any good, that will become a lot harder for them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T19:12:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T19:06:48Z","Content":"I\u0027m not gonna preorder it, it looks cool and possibly better than simcity.

The only time I was unable to play a game I bough, it was because Steam was belly up. There\u0027s no reason for that, a single player game shouldn\u0027t need an Internet connection (or a client you can setup to be in offline mode). Period. Cards? Library? What the hell is that and why would I care about it?! I want to play the game, not exchange cards or whatever you do with them. I spent 20 years gaming with out a library of games in the cloud, I certainly don\u0027t need one now.\n\nAnyways, the fact remains that the game looks cool and I can wait 5 years until it goes on sale at gog.com for 9.95. I have plenty of other games. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
