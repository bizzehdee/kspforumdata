{"TopicId":153004,"ForumId":18,"TopicTitle":"My Idea for a Free Roam Star Wars Game","CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T22:42:22Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T22:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the last month of two now I\u0027ve come up with a decent idea for an open world (or technically, open galaxy), free roaming RPG type game that could be made for the Star Wars universe. Now that being said, I\u0027ll try to explain my vision and idea for this, but before I get too deep into the game I would like to take a step back and explain my history in designing \u0022games\u0022 for the Star Wars universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo explain a bit of my background on the idea, about a decade ago (2006 or 2007) I decided that for no particular reason, I wanted to create my own entire Star Wars RP system. I also designed by own Star Wars storyline to go with it (which should be noted, in 2007, the best we had as far as \u0022story\u0022 were video games. The VII movie was barely even an idea, so remember that as we continue on). The story being what a follow up to the VI movie would be; the empire has taken a massive blow by the rebellion and in all technicality was defeated, however they slowly reformed on outlying planets (might sound familiar) that were unoccupied by the rebels. As such, the empire would slowly begin guerrilla tactics doing precise hit and runs on the rebellion in an attempt to cause them to collapse. The player in all this, could choose many paths. They could be a Jedi, a Sith, an Imperial, aid the Rebels, be a pirate, a smuggler and so on much in the style of the first movie (by first I mean part IV as we know it now, but it will always be the first movie to me). If the player played normally, they would experience worlds from all the episodes, such as Tatooine, Hoth, Yavin Four, and a few prequel planets too, like Naboo, Geonosis, Courscant and so on. The idea being a sort of view by view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if your wondering, what did I have as far as gameplay at this time when I was learning? Well the only games I had to go off of at the time, was Rogue Squadron II and III\u00A0for Gamecube, and Star Wars Battlefront I and II on the PlayStation 2, with Battlefront 2 likely being the cause for my desire to expand what players can do. In Star Wars Battlefront II, players can lead a \u0022Galactic Conquest\u0022 where they can lead their fleets across the galaxy to conquer planets. Along the way they earn money which can be spent on bonuses or unlocking more units. This is bare bones RP technically but it was enough for me to long for \u0022more\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said; now I will explain the idea behind my idea for a free roaming, open world/galaxy RPG Star Wars game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base idea would be that you\u0027d be a generic player like any RPG. Explain just enough backstory for the player to understand the circumstances, then you\u0027d let them go. From there they can unlock quests, make money and also a way for themselves. As they explore, they can either make positive ties to known forces or negative ones. If the player pursues the latter option, the player will gain a \u0022wanted\u0022 level, very similar to the ones seen in Grand Theft Auto. The \u0022wanted\u0022 status would increase as the player continues a more damaging streak against said faction. As far as I see it, there would be 3 factions the player would impact; The Empire, The Rebellion, and generic space thugs and pirates. As players gain more wanted status, the more relentless they are in pursuing you, as well as the greater firepower they will bring. Eventually, there would have to be a cap on the maximum level a player can raise, and I would imagine that being of extreme resort (as in, something along the lines of being Luke Skywalker to the Empire, or Han Solo to pirates), where the result would be rather extreme (noting that getting to this level of heat would require many hours of effort to achieve), such as having the Death Star destroying whatever planet you land on, or the Rebels sending their entire armada and ground forces to destroy you and so on. Of course the flip side being that you can gain allegiance from these factions. This can be from allied assistance, participating in these factions, bribing them, and so on. So when you become attacked, you can have allies to help, and possibly even, cause your own Battle Of Endor, if you put in enough effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside of the wanted aspect, there would also be skills and traits players could increase over time. I wouldn\u0027t want this to become too excessive as far as making it into a fully fledged RPG with numeric stats, but rather again go with the Grand Theft Auto idea of having skill \u0022bars\u0022. Something more visual for players to see their progress rather than using numbers. These skills can be things like piloting, engineering, accuracy, speed, strength, health, force, and so on. As players increase them, the better they become at performing more difficult tasks and also taking on greater odds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to go back and mention the \u0022free roaming\u0022 aspect. As this is something we haven\u0027t seen fully fleshed out in a Star Wars game yet (although was put into the works by LucasArts before funding being cut). The idea being, that if a player has means of transport, they can explore whole worlds (whether they be new, or old to the series). As well as travel to others. The point being that there is no fixed objective until a player takes on a mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow a lot of this may harken back to other games which have attempted this before (Grand Theft Auto V being the most common), but other notable games might be games like Mass Effect, or Spore. The idea being that these ideas have worked, if not extremely well in the past, and that the Star Wars universe is ultimately dying for expanding upon this very very VERY rich idea. Maybe there\u0027s more to be added to this, maybe there\u0027s some stuff that needs trimming, but I see it, \u0022as a bold step into a much larger world\u0022 for the Star Wars franchise as far as gaming goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant of an idea. Most of these never go anywhere. But maybe this will. Of course Star Wars is Disney\u0027s product and therefore independent development is impossible, but maybe someone here on the forum knows the software development leader of Disney? Maybe not. All I ask is that if you share it, please at least let me know how the idea fares. I\u0027m not even asking for credit, just let me know how my insane idea went.
