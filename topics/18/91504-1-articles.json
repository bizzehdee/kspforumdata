I got on Steam today to play Kerbal Space Program, and to my completely surprise and shock, my Kerbal Space Program installation was completely deleted from my install, with all mods, game saves, and other data removed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days ago, I installed Linux Ubuntu on a separate hard drive on my desktop. I specifically and only installed it\u003Cstrong\u003E just for KSP\u003C/strong\u003E. I play this game enough where I was fed up with the memory restrictions on Windows and thought I would try Linux out. Not to my surprise, I\u0027ve had nothing but absolute problems when working with linux in general. Before I move on, I have been in the IT industry for nearly 10 years. I\u0027ve had official training and college education specifically on UNIX. I took over a years worth of college courses just on working with terminal alone. This is but a growing list of annoying problems I\u0027ve had with linux desktop over the past five years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite all my knowledge of this OS, I am officially declaring that I hate linux for traditional desktop use. It works great for web servers, but it is absolutely pointless, stupid, and annoying to use as a regular consumer desktop user! Even as a developer, I have no reason/advantages to using linux for everything. I have windows and mac which I find both superior to linux. In fact, Mac OSX is unix/linux is a facelift, and in my opinion it is everything linux wishes it could be. A huge lack of quality software, bugged drivers, annoying and time consuming terminal commands for everything make me hate this OS. Heck, even at my old college where I learned UNIX (all the machines had Debian installed), I would say at least 5-6 computers in that college were not working with debian on any given day. They even gave us flash drives with Debian and none of the flash drives worked in our whole class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love linux/unix and web server usage, but I am freaking done with this POS operating system. Luckily, my KSP is backed up, and I\u0027ve only lost a mere days worth of playing which was mostly spent trying to fix a number of issues on linux. Despite the increased memory limitations, KSP did not work well on linux for me. The camera stuttered, the GPU drivers are buggy, my steam overlay never worked right, and I had several other issues with the game. This one with the game completely disappearing tops the freaking list!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet this be a warning to others. If you are thinking about installing linux just for KSP, don\u0027t do it. Use less mods on the Windows version and enjoy the game for what it is. Linux is not the magic wand to fix the issues this game has on Windows. This is especially true if you\u0027ve never worked with any linux OS before. I will say, Ubuntu is highly polished, it\u0027s made a lot of progress over the years. But it\u0027s still mediocre compared to what you will get on Windows and Mac in general. I\u0027m going back to KSP on Windows, screw this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T22:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eunix /= linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022time consuming terminal commands for everything\u0022 Which OS are you using?
