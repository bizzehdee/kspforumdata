I had a slightly different way to do it.

What was amazing about the ai was that they sometimes where able to outsmart the camping tactic somewhat by just continually rushing my guys until one alien could launch a missile or toss a grenade into one of the lines of agents.

It just creates busywork. \u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, RPGs used to be three-quarter view looking down on a party of characters. Now you can look out through your character\u0027s eyes and get a more immersive experience, but what did we lose in that change? You can\u0027t run a party of characters anymore. You have to trust additional party members to idiot AI that constantly mis-uses their skills and/or gets them killed. Also, if you only have one character, no lock can be very difficult to pick because your party no longer has a dedicated thief. Your party no longer has a healer casting restorative spells, so you have to take time out to do that to yourself or drink potions. Etc., etc. Personally, I would love to a see a come-back of party-based RPGs because they were so much richer in terms of gameplay. But, as always, the gaming field tends ever towards dumber and more action-oriented games. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T15:38:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BjornKerbannigan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BjornKerbannigan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Hunt for Red October\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh dear, thanks for the memories.
