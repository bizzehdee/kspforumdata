A kid in my class, my class of only ten people, died. It is a hard blow, because in a class with only ten people, everyone is your friend. The worst part: He died just one day away from summer vacation. I got alerted via an email to my account. As i saw and read it, i started to cry and fell down onto the computer screen, which pulled up \u0022My Fav Websites!\u0022 KSP forums popped up. A challenge there got my attention. \u0022Kerbal Cannon Challenge!\u0022 I looked at the several photos and challenge entries, some serious (with safety harnesses, capsules, etc..) and some completely ridiculous ones.\u00A0I started to laugh at the variety, at the types of entries. That is what i love about Kerbal Space Program. All the different people, all the different styles, all playing the same game. All controlling the odd, space-obsessed (like me!) race of green, bug-eyed aliens (Ok not the green bugeyed part..). The hilarity of the challenge just finished it off. I fell down laughing. So I want to thank the Kerbal Space Program team, most especially Felipe\u00A0Falanghe, NathanKell, and Porkjet for this amazing, beautiful, interesting, diverse game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-LordOfMinecraft\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T21:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeath is always tragic. What gets me even more sad is that when some people die in a big event, and it gets publicized, people care then. But they also forget the little deaths. So many of them. And a good number were preventable... Truly a society wide tragedy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T03:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP can be so much more than a fun little space game! I am learning this more and more through my own experiences in it, through what other people have made in it, and through touching stories like yours of its influence on people\u0027s real lives.
