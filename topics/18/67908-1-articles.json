You can pick a Seal, Delta, SaS, or Ranger team and go through various maps. You select your teammates and level them up. For a tablet game, it\u0027s outstanding. I had to replace my tablet so I don\u0027t have it installed and I can\u0027t remember the name of it either. It\u0027s not free, but the content with the paid game is good. There are two DLC packs consisting of new missions with new maps. It can be very difficult to score well because you have to clear maps, clear objectives, and do so with time considerations. Excellent graphics, very good controls. RPG style leveling, weapon and armor variety is very good, also weapon customization including attachments. Think Jagged Alliance 2 in a Rainbow Six setting.
