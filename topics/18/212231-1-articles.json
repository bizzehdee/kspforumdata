try taking the fork back, your fingers will be immediately covered with fat from the sharp end, but even the handle will not be better.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, you will stain the end of the fork with is put in mouth with dirt from the hands.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, any hygiene just gives up here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have filled the empty can with

fork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, you would stir the tea not with handle, but with the sharp end.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, with the sharp end you can hold some rusk to soak it in water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy overturn the fork, make it all sticky, and grab the mouth end with dirty hands?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, it\u0027s again better to put it back in the can

and you even don\u0027t know, what was he doing with that hand previously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s again more safe to keep the handle

fence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s again more prudent to keep the handle up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n7.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSay, you are

interested in the rusk, but would better be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou quickly grab the fork from the can... and scream because you had put it with pointy end up, and no it stuck in your palm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s again more safe to keep the handle up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSay, you don\u0027t have the can anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSay, used it as an alarm bell at your camp, or a trap for the river crawdads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill you stick the fork into a piece of wood with handle?
