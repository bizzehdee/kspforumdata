She plans to destroy all she can - herself included - to rid the Universe of life. Currently it is unknown what the cause for her motives are, though it is assumed she suffered some form of dangerous or unhappy or possibly tortured childhood, likely surrounded by people who would have displayed similarly evil actions. It is known that Sekhmet has the ability to manipulate Humans, though for some reason only those with clear minds are satisfactory. It is thought that Sekhmet has been using this ability to retrieve all she would need to complete her goal.\n\nNote: Sekmet is around twelve metres tall.\n\nColour version is WIP."},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T21:50:31Z","Content":"Is that supposed to be scary?
