Sunlight at Saturn\u0027s distance is like 1% as intense as at Earth. That\u0027s why NASA used RTGs to power the Voyagers, and they weren\u0027t trying to run an ion drive. So, if you want to be realistic, we\u0027re talking a huge wall of thin-foil solar panels with a tiny space probe in the middle, like a spider in her web. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe leave that part in orbit, as communications relays for the landers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, how about a small nuclear reactor? An ion drive\u0027s too big a job for most power options, including RTGs. It may actually be too much for solar power that far out from the sun. Hard to be sure; I saw an article just the other day where they\u0027d made a solar cell that was only a few molecules thick. So you could get pretty crazy with light/thin solar cells and still be plausible. Maybe 3d-printed in space, over a cyanoacrylate spider web also deposited in space by a different robot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s the rover powered? RTGs do sound practical there, and have the advantage of keeping rover\u0027s electronics warm enough to operate. That would be a big problem on Titan. I\u0027m guessing multiple RTGs, since they can only be made in a very limited range of sizes. (What do you call an extra-large RTG? Critical mass) -180C is going to be hard on all the moving parts, too, particularly wheels. I really have no idea how one would build wheels and a suspension that worked longterm in that environment, or what they\u0027d look like. Just don\u0027t give it inflated rubber tires. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T15:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ion drive is only used near 1AU-2AU; after burning the correct delta V the craft cruises out to Saturn, so the solar panels are really only needed where the sunlight is the strongest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rovers would be powered by RTG(s), although you\u0027re right about the material they are made of - it can\u0027t be aluminum or steel because those would be brittle and break at such low temperatures.
