It\u0027s called the \u0027pistola concaricatoji\u0027, is chambered in browning 6.35mm (0.25 cal) and loads\\unloads via an 18 shot speed loader, that is left inside the revolver when firing and then removed taking the spent shells with it. It is an amazing piece of firearms history and shows how creative people can be... I want one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
