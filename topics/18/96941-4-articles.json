Dating is *precisely* the same for nerds/geeks/gamers as it is for everybody else? Are you \u0022socially awkward\u0022? Big news, almost everyone is a little bit. Bite the bullet. Realise its ok to be yourself no matter what. If they respond badly to you seeming \u0022awkward\u0022 in any way, then they have done you a favour by writing themselves off. The one who responds well (however that might be) might just have some potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus titbit: dating websites (reputable ones) are pretty good, had several good experiences (and some \u0022interesting ones\u0022 - my favorite story, the one about the girl who thought \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EHitler had the right idea\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 [thats an exact quote], gets alot of mileage...). Looking for someone in this way does help you to sift through people quite well, it is (unromantic as it sounds, but it makes perfect sense) a numbers game, and you can scroll through a lot of people. Don\u0027t feel bad just clicking on people you find attractive, this IS important after all, but realise that the wider you cast your net, the more fish you catch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and be aware that guys are [redacted] on dating websites, so if you are at least semi-decent you already have a huge advantage. The disadvantage is having to make yourself visibly not one of the *other* type.
