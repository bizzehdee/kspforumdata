I\u0027m currently running an Athlon 64 X2 6000\u002B (3.1GHz dual-core), which is almost the fastest CPU supported by my socket type - as you know, this is when an upgrade gets expensive - I\u0027ve just installed a new GPU, and found I need a new PSU, and I\u0027ve only got 3GB ram so I\u0027ll need more of that...\n\nThus the budget for the CPU itself is about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3100 ($150 US Dollars).\n\nThe reason I\u0027m asking for advice is that I don\u0027t know much about multi-cores and KSP. A lot of the CPUs in my price range have much better multi-threaded performance but only marginally better single-thread performance.\n\nI think KSP is multi-threaded, but the physics are single-threaded? It\u0027s the physics that are slowing it down, so do I need better single-thread performance? If so I don\u0027t think my budget will produce the results I want."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:22:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think KSP is multi-threaded, but the physics are single-threaded?

Unity 5 may improve this, but I suspect the multi-core performance will still be so-so."},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:50:14Z","Content":"For KSP Intel is way better than AMD, so i would choose one of them.

The comparison site I\u0027ve been using says a CPU with double my multithreaded performance only yields 16% better single-thread performance, so I guess I\u0027m waiting for the Unity update and see what happens...\n\nElthy, thank you. I live in the UK, and our media often calls us \u0022rip-off Britain\u0022. I just checked out an Intel i3 4160 which is \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A390. [Here\u0027s the comparison.](http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/67/AMD_Athlon_64_X2_6000\u002B_%283_GHz__125W%29_vs_Intel_Core_i3_i3-4160.html). The reduced power requirements might even mean I can get away without buying a new PSU.\n\nDoes that look like a significant upgrade? I get physics lag (yellow timer) at about 100 parts on the launchpad."},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:12:33Z","Content":"I use a AMD FX-6200 OC to 4 GHz and AMD R9 280 and it works great for FPS and such, not so much KSP where I get lag with aerodynamic effects. The problem is AMD processors have a lot less performance per core then Intel, which is fine if you have more cores and multi-thread support, but Unity 4x does not do multiple threading in API, in even Unity 5 will probably be limited in its multiple threading support. As for my graphics problems that may be because I\u0027m running linux and AMD Catalyst drivers for linux are sub-par, heck it still thinks I have a Radeon HD 7900 in there!~"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:49:39Z","Content":"An i3 would also be much faster and good enough if you want to play only KSP in the future. An i5 isnt that much more expensive (you need a new mainboard/ram combo anyway) but it would enable you to play anything from the current console generation (so propably for about 6 years). If you are sure you dont want to play recent games in the next year the i3 would be a good choice..."},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:37:36Z","Content":"I run a i5-4670K 3.40 Ghz and she cranks through KSP and most other games without a problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:41:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I run a i5-4670K 3.40 Ghz and she cranks through KSP and most other games without a problem.\n\nThat is pretty much the fastest you can go, so that is pretty obvious ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"icecreamberni","CreatedById":130223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T05:58:39Z","Content":"An i5 4460 would be nice.
