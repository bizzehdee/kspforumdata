Otherwise the DLR put out a pretty neat Mars 3D flyover video, I am not sure where you would get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time, I would suggest watching good films, with stories that interest you, or that are recommended on their merit as good, thoughtful stories, not on the merit of their special effects and filming styles. I recommended some of those, most I doubt highly are 3D, and the rest I am not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T09:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was in am electronics shop in Paris on Champs de \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0lys\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9es, and there was a huge LG 3D TV. I never owned a 3D tv, so I tried it out. By coincidence, it was also playing Gravity (Blu-Ray 3D) and it was on the ISS scene. Those were the best 5 min of my life. The 3D was just phenomenal, even better than in the cinema. I am saving money for a TV like that, then I\u0027m never going to the cinema ever again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
