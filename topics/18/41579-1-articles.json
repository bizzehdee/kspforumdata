Mars landings use past Rover and Lander data combined with satellite recon to pick a good landing spot (like Gale or Victoria crater) rather than just deciding to land somewhere random. Also, the fact there are only limited tasks to perform in each mission is partly true, goals are pre-defined for each working Sol the rover is operated and they often do just boil down to drive there, photo that, probe the soil there, analyse that rock. As you get to more advanced rovers it gets more fun because you can take multiple anasis tools like ChemCam and the Rock Drill and perform more than one test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I don\u0027t like so much is the missions are 100% scripted (although there are hints that some goals activate other goals but I\u0027ve not looked into that).
