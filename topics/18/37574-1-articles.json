I recommend going out and reading the article, because it links to a previous version of a similar yet different video from a different producer. The other one uses music instead of \u0022practical sound effects\u0022 and has a more theatrical quality to it. Both are stunning, and now I can\u0027t stop watching them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also see the original footage as released by NASA, which was only actually recorded at about 4 frames per second. These guys basically tweaked the original to be smoother and upsampled them to higher quality.
