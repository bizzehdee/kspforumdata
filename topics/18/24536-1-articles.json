My history teacher (a left activist) hammered it into our skulls how bad nazis are...that actually had an opposite effect. now, i dont glorify them, but my view on them isnt that much different. It\u0027s just that ive been left with some kind of paranoia everytime someone brings up 3rd reich things they really like and i can only think of them aiming for a \u0022lol u nazi\u0022 joke. My family completely missed WWII (and the Anschluss of Austria) because they were too old / too young. weve got history as being handy with technology, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T20:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou guys expect a detailed diagram for my Hyper-V, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo dice.

The amount of exposure depends on when the pellet is meant to go off. The power levels in the pellet towards countdown are exponential, so extreme precision is needed here. This is all assuming that there is enough power in the pellet to sustain the small reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The activated pellet is driven through by a series of donut-shaped magnets identical to the ones in the LHC to get some serious speed out of this.
