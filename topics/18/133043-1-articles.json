Although I am told that NASA apparently updated and continued to use the clip for public education. A shame that the movie itself lost out to a movie like Rocketship X-M, but that\u0027s the movie for you. I initially heard of Destination Moon mostly through a some writing in one of Robert Heinlien\u0027s book of collected works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T20:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving watched this clip I checked and found the full movie on youtube.
