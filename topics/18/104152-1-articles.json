I did figure out what was causing it though. This guide is for Windows 8 only. For some reason, McAfee didn\u0027t find it, but you need to go to Control Panel and delete the program it is in (I\u0027m pretty sure it was called You are awesome), as well as any other programs that you have downloaded recently. Then, open Google Chrome (which still had the ads on it for me), and go to the menu (the button with three lines on top of each other). Once you open the menu, click on More Tools, then Extensions. Delete the You are awesome plugin (you may or may not see this, the only data I have is from my computer), which will be enabled for both regular and Incognito mode. Delete any other plugins that you have installed recently. I hope that this helps. Bye!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T02:38:05Z","Content":"Getting stuff like that off your computer can get maddening.\n\nIt took me three days to figure out how to get that Bing search engine from hijacking my browser settings and home page.\n\nSome of Bing\u0027s distribution methods are just legalized virus programs.\n\nHave you ever tried Spybot Search and Destroy?"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T02:41:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Spybot Search and Destroy\n\nNever tried it but that name makes it sound *reeeallly* satisfying when dealing with these programs.

I started using it after I got some particularly tenacious adware got onto my system, and this program did a lot of heavy lifting to help out (it was a team effort in conjunction with I think malwarebytes and good old fashioned googling with manual searching).\n\nThe program I linked to is also kind of nice in that it doesn\u0027t install to your system at all. It\u0027s a simple executable.\n\nYou will also find that certain programs have other programs that exist specifically to remove them. Off the top of my head, one actually exists for the Norton Antivirus program, which is somewhat infamous for it\u0027s absolute refusal to properly uninstall itself. Where these programs exist, they tend to be extremely effective.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T08:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T08:42:57Z","Content":"I have AdwCleaner booked marked but never got around to trying it.\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll run it tomorrow and see what comes up."}]}
