Beginning in the movie \u003Cem\u003E2001\u003C/em\u003E, HAL kills off the crew in hibernation at the very first moments we encounter the Discovery entering Jupiter\u0027s sphere of influence. It is not until the last third of the movie that Stanley Kubrick allows HAL and Bowman to have a brief conversation about \u0022finishing the mission...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I did enjoy both movies, the movie 2010 hints at various issues with HAL. Although there are three brief conversations with Dr. Chandra and HAL, there are two main conversations between Dr. Chandra and Dr. Floyd where the audience is informed of two things: HAL\u0027s basic programming was to allow him (or it) to perform a series of duties and to function as a member of the crew, with David Bowman being the ultimate commander of both machine and crew. The problem was the programming (secret orders) Chandra eluded to; the mission must be completed at all costs. The original programming of HAL was to continue the mission at all costs - and that mission was to study Jupiter and the Monolith discovered in Jovian orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always believed, according to the explanation offered in the movies and the books, that HAL regarded the need for a return trip to Earth as a threat to his mission. The Discovery, with HAL having the ability to run the entire ship, would have no need for refueling (Clarke suggests a type of nuclear or ion propulsion in addition to the engines in the movie) and would simply have to return to Earth for the benefit of its human crew compliment. For HAL\u0027s programming, how can it learn all there is to learn about the second Monolith if it has to return to Earth before all could be learned? Remember, there was never a defined \u0022this is what we want to accomplish\u0022 goal in Discovery\u0027s mission, just the \u0022go and learn all you can...\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an interesting side-note, 1he 3 rules, based off of a set of laws found in the novels of the two series \u003Cem\u003EI, Robot\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EFoundation\u003C/em\u003E by Isaac Asimov are (for those not familiar with them): 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. Later, in officially licensed sequels by Roger MacBride Allen, who had the official sanction of a dying Isaac Asimov, added/adopted/modified the \u0022zeroth law\u0022 which states: A robot may not harm sentience or, through inaction, allow sentience to come to harm. All in all, even the three original laws can create a similar loop as experienced by HAL; add the zeroth law and you\u0027re sure to create a homicidal robot - at one point in the novels it is suggested that a robot can kill, according to the three laws, if the death of one person could save or have a positive impact on the rest of humanity... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, the crew of Discovery were sure to be gonners!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E--- updated ---\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETechnically it was not homicide, because HAL is not human, but that\u0027s just side stepping the issue.
