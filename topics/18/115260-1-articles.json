You can skip a collision at a high timewarp value, but the coordinates are functions of orbital parameters and time only and can be evaluated accurately regardless of timewarp.\n\nIn *n*-body physics, the coordinates of bodies depend on their previous values. During timewarp, you have to increase the distance between time samples so the accuracy degrades.\n\nSo timewarp becomes risky in *n*-body physics. While orbiting nicely at 1\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D, your satellite can suddenly fly away or collide with the planet when you switch to 1000\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D.\n\nPlease correct me if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not right.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T05:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teilnehmer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:03:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Squad has said that they have no desire to try to make a transition to N-body.
