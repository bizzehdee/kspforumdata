Then they start taking cards from the decks in turn, trying to assemble enough parts with enough dV to complete their mission (larger space craft will makes all part giving less dV), all the while when other players can pull out action cards representing real life actions such as national priority (allowing the player who holds it to swipe a part from another player), or government shut down (allow the one who holds it to choose one person to lose a turn), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a great game to teach kids (both in age and in mind) about rocket science. Like explaining to them what dV means, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T14:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be cool, but I don\u0027t have money to fund it.
