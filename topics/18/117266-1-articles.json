In short, he said that if we do encounter life in space, it will be much more technologically advanced, would probably seek to conquer us, but we should seek it out nonetheless. I found his statement to be presumptuous at best for a few reasons:\n\n1. What about if us - on earth - are the most technologically advanced? Yes, I know the earth is not that old but what if...? Surely there is room in the scientific community to inquire into this possibility. \n\n2. What if we are actually the descendants of a space-faring species, much like is written in Issac Asimov\u0027s *Foundation* series? What *if* human life did begin on another world, much like the prelude on the original *Battlestar Galactica* series from 1979... If this is the case, then it is possible that the advanced life out there would not see us as a species to be conquered, but as a colony to be refined to its fullest potential. The question would then become \u0022what is our true purpose.\u0022\n\n3. Hawking places the teachings of Charles Darwin in the driver\u0027s seat; the idea that a superior organism would use its abilities to conquer lesser organisms is a part of the natural world BUT... any advanced organism would have similar traits of curiosity, compassion, etc. Not all would be ALIEN-like predators or bent on the enslavement of humanity. \n\nThere are more possibilities than what Dr. Hawking proposes; what I want to know is how does he become a xeno-species expert?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:35:23Z","Content":"All your assumptions are equally valid to dr.

[http://waitbutwhy.com/es/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html](http://waitbutwhy.com/es/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html) - Basically, the age of the universe vs the age of the human race means that the odds of us finding a nearby alien species roughly at our own level of development is extremely low. Odds are that we would either find a planet with single-celled life or a civilization millions of years ahead of us. And if there is a species millions of years ahead of us, if interstellar travel was at all possible they would have probably colonised earth when our shrew-like ancestors were still hiding from the dinosaurs in tiny holes in the ground, so the question is where are they?\n\n2. We are closely genetically related to ALL life on Earth, from the smallest bacteria to the blue whale. If WE are the descendants of a space faring species, than all life on earth is and that space faring species came here as a primitive single cell organism a few billion years ago - AKA panspermia...\n\n3. [http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/aliens.php](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/aliens.php) (The bolded bits)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The great silence (i.e. absence of SETI signals from alien civilizations) is perhaps the strongest indicator of all that high relativistic velocities are attainable and that everybody out there knows it.\n\u003E The sobering truth is that relativistic civilizations are a potential nightmare to anyone living within range of them. The problem is that objects traveling at an appreciable fraction of light speed are never where you see them when you see them (i.e., light-speed lag). Relativistic rockets, if their owners turn out to be less than benevolent, are both totally unstoppable and totally destructive. A starship weighing in at 1,500 tons (approximately the weight of a fully fueled space shuttle sitting on the launchpad) impacting an earthlike planet at \u0022only\u0022 30 percent of lightspeed will release 1.5 million megatons of energy -- an explosive force equivalent to 150 times today\u0027s global nuclear arsenal...\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not going to talk about ideas. I\u0027m going to talk about reality. It will probably not be good for us ever to build and fire up an antimatter engine. According to Powell, given the proper detecting devices, a Valkyrie engine burn could be seen out to a radius of several light-years and may draw us into a game we\u0027d rather not play, a game in which, if we appear to be even the vaguest threat to another civilization and if the resources are available to eliminate us, then it is logical to do so.\n\u003E \n\u003E The game plan is, in its simplest terms, the relativistic inverse to the golden rule: \u0022Do unto the other fellow as he would do unto you and do it first.\u0022...\n\u003E \n\u003E **When we put our heads together and tried to list everything we could say with certainty about other civilizations, without having actually met them, all that we knew boiled down to three simple laws of alien behavior:**\n\u003E \n\u003E **THEIR SURVIVAL WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR SURVIVAL.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **If an alien species has to choose between them and us, they won\u0027t choose us. It is difficult to imagine a contrary case; species don\u0027t survive by being self-sacrificing.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **WIMPS DON\u0027T BECOME TOP DOGS.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **No species makes it to the top by being passive. The species in charge of any given planet will be highly intelligent, alert, aggressive, and ruthless when necessary.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **THEY WILL ASSUME THAT THE FIRST TWO LAWS APPLY TO US.**\n\u003E \n\u003E **...**\n\u003E \n\u003E Your thinking still seems a bit narrow. Consider several broadening ideas:\n\u003E \n\u003E Sure, relativistic bombs are powerful because the antagonist has already invested huge energies in them that can be released quickly, and they\u0027re hard to hit. But they are costly investments and necessarily reduce other activities the species could explore. For example:\n\u003E \n\u003E Dispersal of the species into many small, hard-to-see targets, such as asteroids, buried civilizations, cometary nuclei, various space habitats. These are hard to wipe out.\n\u003E \n\u003E But wait -- while relativistic bombs are readily visible to us in foresight, they hardly represent the end point in foreseeable technology. What will humans of, say, two centuries hence think of as the \u0022obvious\u0022 lethal effect? Five centuries? A hundred? Personally I\u0027d pick some rampaging self-reproducing thingy (mechanical or organic), then sneak it into all the biospheres I wanted to destroy. My point here is that no particular physical effect -- with its pluses, minuses, and trade-offs -- is likely to dominate the thinking of the galaxy.\n\u003E \n\u003E So what might really aged civilizations do? Disperse, of course, and also not attack new arrivals in the galaxy, for fear that they might not get them all. Why? Because revenge is probably selected for in surviving species, and anybody truly looking out for long-term interests will not want to leave a youthful species with a grudge, sneaking around behind its back...\n\u003E \n\u003E I agree with most parts of points 2, 3, and 4. As for point 1, it is cheaper than you think. You mention self-replicating machines in point 3, and while it is true that relativistic rockets require planetary power supplies, it is also true that we can power the whole Earth with a field of solar cells adding up to barely more than 200-by-200 kilometers, drawn out into a narrow band around the Moon\u0027s equator. Self-replicating robots could accomplish this task with only the cost of developing the first twenty or thirty machines. And once we\u0027re powering the Earth practically free of charge, why not let the robots keep building panels on the Lunar far side? Add a few self-replicating linear accelerator-building factories, and plug the accelerators into the panels, and you could produce enough anti-hydrogen to launch a starship every year. But why stop at the Moon? Have you looked at Mercury lately? ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Dr. Wells has obviously bought into the view of a friendly galaxy. This view is based upon the argument that unless we humans conquer our self-destructive warlike tendencies, we will wipe out our species and no longer be a threat to extrasolar civilizations. All well and good up to this point.\n\u003E \n\u003E But then these optimists make the jump: If we are wise enough to survive and not wipe ourselves out, we will be peaceful -- so peaceful that we will not wipe anybody else out, and as we are below on Earth, so other people will be above.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a non sequitur, because there is no guarantee that one follows the other, and for a very important reason: \u0022They\u0022 are not part of our species.\n\u003E \n\u003E Before we proceed any further, try the following thought experiment: watch the films Platoon and Aliens together and ask yourself if the plot lines don\u0027t quickly blur and become indistinguishable. You\u0027ll recall that in Vietnam, American troops were taught to regard the enemy as \u0022Charlie\u0022 or \u0022Gook,\u0022 dehumanizing words that made \u0022them\u0022 easier to kill. In like manner, the British, Spanish, and French conquests of the discovery period were made easier by declaring dark- or red- or yellow-skinned people as something less than human, as a godless, faceless \u0022them,\u0022 as literally another species.\n\u003E \n\u003E Presumably there is some sort of inhibition against killing another member of our own species, because we have to work to overcome it...\n\u003E \n\u003E But the rules do not apply to other species. Both humans and wolves lack inhibitions against killing chickens.\n\u003E \n\u003E Humans kill other species all the time, even those with which we share the common bond of high intelligence. As you read this, hundreds of dolphins are being killed by tuna fishermen and drift netters. The killing goes on and on, and dolphins are not even a threat to us.\n\u003E \n\u003E As near as we can tell, there is no inhibition against killing another species simply because it displays a high intelligence. So, as much as we love him, Carl Sagan\u0027s theory that if a species makes it to the top and does not blow itself apart, then it will be nice to other intelligent species is probably wrong. Once you admit interstellar species will not necessarily be nice to one another simply by virtue of having survived, then you open up this whole nightmare of relativistic civilizations exterminating one another.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s an entirely new situation, emerging from the physical possibilities that will face any species that can overcome the natural interstellar quarantine of its solar system. The choices seem unforgiving, and the mind struggles to imagine circumstances under which an interstellar species might make contact without triggering the realization that it can\u0027t afford to be proven wrong in its fears.\n\u003E \n\u003E Got that? We can\u0027t afford to wait to be proven wrong.\n\u003E \n\u003E They won\u0027t come to get our resources or our knowledge or our women or even because they\u0027re just mean and want power over us. They\u0027ll come to destroy us to insure their survival, even if we\u0027re no apparent threat, because species death is just too much to risk, however remote the risk...\n\u003E \n\u003E The most humbling feature of the relativistic bomb is that even if you happen to see it coming, its exact motion and position can never be determined; and given a technology even a hundred orders of magnitude above our own, you cannot hope to intercept one of these weapons. It often happens, in these discussions, that an expression from the old west arises: \u0022God made some men bigger and stronger than others, but Mr. Colt made all men equal.\u0022 Variations on Mr. Colt\u0027s weapon are still popular today, even in a society that possesses hydrogen bombs. Similarly, no matter how advanced civilizations grow, the relativistic bomb is not likely to go away...\n\u003E \n\u003E We ask that you try just one more thought experiment. Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That\u0027s when the monsters come out. There\u0027s always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings, and occasional homicides.\n\u003E \n\u003E It is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and the weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can\u0027t read minds.\n\u003E \n\u003E Stay in the dark long enough and you may hear an occasional distance shriek or blunder across a body.\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, \u0022I\u0027m here!\u0022 The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, \u0022I\u0027m a friend!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E What you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don\u0027t want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out.\n\u003E \n\u003E There are, of course, a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe.\n\u003E \n\u003E There is no policeman.\n\u003E \n\u003E There is no way out.\n\u003E \n\u003E And the night never ends.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T17:50:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Awaras**"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T17:53:23Z","Content":"I suggest that we make first policy trying to kill it if it attacks us."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:05:33Z","Content":"But dude, Stephen Hawking *is* an alien.

Any dominant species is most likely descendent from a predatory species. A prey species will almost never dominate its environment. We can only hope a more developed species has the emotional maturity to have overcome their predatory instincts.\n\nActually, I\u0027ve been pondering this since I first became interested in astronomy and related sciences since I was eight. The problem I have with the media focus on Hawking is that yes, the man is smart; however, there are many theories out there that deserve equal attention if we are truly going to have an academic discussion on the possibility of intelligent alien life. I proposed the current topic as a means to generate such discussion here in this forum, where I believe it could truly be an interesting and challenging discussion...\n\n1. In the defense of humanity, most of our technological advancements happens in great spurts (for lack of a better term), the most recent being the miniaturization of technology we are currently witnessing and the increased micro-processing power of computers (we are nearing a stall point in computer technology according to some experts). These spurts are normally the outcropping of our volatile nature (even here in KSP, how long was it before the various armed mods began creeping into the game? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ). Even if we just take the American Civil War, there were great advancements made in medicine, weaponry (Gatling Gun, Dirigibles as combat vehicles, submarines, ironclads, brass cartridges, and the repeating rifle), photography, and transportation. I would suspect if we did come into contact with a superior species through radio communications (such as SETI), we would undoubtedly begin to contemplate newer technologies and tactics to neutralize any perceived threat.\n\n2. Not necessarily - one thing that the colonization of the New World has taught us is that genetics contains the key. There have been great strides in figuring out where various populations of peoples originated from based on the human genome. Now, I will admit I mainly threw out this point for the sole purpose of trying to generate discussion... but it does have some interesting ideas. What if xeno-human settlement occurred where a native humanoid species already existed and interbreeding occurred for a number of reasons (biological diversity for future generations to be able to survive within the biological conditions of the new home being one of these) as suggested in the SyFy Channel remake of *Battlestar Galactica*? Do not get me wrong, I am not saying the SyFy Channel is going to promote strong science (Sharknado, yeah, historical documentary on global climate change?![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) however, the idea that a superior or advanced form of life would forsake technology as a means of ensuring survival is a common sci-fi theme for those, such as Issac Asimov, who saw the dangers of rampant technology usage.\n\n3. I agree with you with the consideration of Darwinism into the alien life equation - but would throw out the possibility of a prey species forced to become technologically advanced. As is witnessed in Earth\u0027s biodiversity, there are creatures that have evolved defensive mechanisms (coloration, horns, chemical smells/poisons) to deter attacks by predators. Imagine if a planet had the development of a sentient organism that had been historically prey (I kind of think Kerbals here ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ). At some point, it would allow for the development of technology for a totally different purpose than for conquest (but would still be able to use such technology for an offensive purpose). One of the reasons I enjoyed Star Trek Voyager was because there were a few episodes that actually dealt with this sort of idea. Ideally, it would be one of these types of alien civilizations we would want to come into contact with...otherwise..."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:41:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A few days ago, while reading an article on [Space.com](http://www.space.com), there was an article about Dr. Stephen Hawking\u0027s latest statement regarding the possibility of alien life.

You raise a couple of great points...\n\nAt one point in early space exploration history, the thought was that water was rare. We now know it is literally everywhere and in every form all through the universe. There is now speculation that the so called \u0022rare earth metals\u0022 may not be so rare outside of Earth. This is one thought driving the current commercial interest in the harvesting/mining of asteroids. I imagine that any advanced space traveling civilization would possess the means to gather the basic elements while on the fly...\n\nI imagine that we would probably see the use of technology in almost every conceivable area of manual work - UNLESS they subscribe to the current theory that some of our enlightened thinkers, again conjuring Stephen Hawking, on the innate fear of technology replacing biology. Ray Kurzweil theorized about the idea of technology actually ruling over us (not to mention being incorporated within our biology) as one of the great next developments of human evolution. He calls it the \u0022great singularity\u0022 and he is not the only one that has speculated about this. Some sci-fi writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke focused on the idea of humans becoming subservient to technology... \n\nDepends on what their version of \u0022evil\u0022 is.

The more intelligent, the more likely for them to check before eating the other animal (\u0022dumb\u0022 fish just gobble up anything near them ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ).\n\nYes, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve been saying. Stephen Hawking does not have all the answers and there are plenty out there that could be just as viable as his.

If you find a nice house to settle in that happens to be infested with rats what do you do? You sweep out the rats.\n\nExcept they most likely have the resources to build in space colonies.\n\nIf there are rats there, go somewhere else.\n\nMaybe we\u0027re a threat, and they want to not kill off the other species on Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T07:43:47Z","Content":"Space is big.

What about if us - on earth - are the most technologically advanced? Yes, I know the earth is not that old but what if...? Surely there is room in the scientific community to inquire into this possibility.\n\nWithin our galaxy, I favor the idea that we are contenders for the most advanced civilization, as an answer to the fermi paradox.\n\nSomeone has to be first, and with 1 million years being a reasonable timeframe to colonie the entire galaxy after development of fusion powered spacecraft, considering the age of the Earth... if there was anyone out there (in our galaxy) more advanced... our area should have been colonized before the cambrian explosion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. What if we are actually the descendants of a space-faring species, much like is written in Issac Asimov\u0027s *Foundation* series? What *if* human life did begin on another world, much like the prelude on the original *Battlestar Galactica* series from 1979... If this is the case, then it is possible that the advanced life out there would not see us as a species to be conquered, but as a colony to be refined to its fullest potential. The question would then become \u0022what is our true purpose.\u0022\n\nFossils and molecular biology say no.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Hawking places the teachings of Charles Darwin in the driver\u0027s seat; the idea that a superior organism would use its abilities to conquer lesser organisms is a part of the natural world BUT... any advanced organism would have similar traits of curiosity, compassion, etc. Not all would be ALIEN-like predators or bent on the enslavement of humanity.\n\nWell, I have a different view... life which propagates the most will become the most common. We will meet those that want to expand, and not meet those that don\u0027t.\n\nHowever, evolution has many cases of symbiosis. The aliens could use us to their advantage without actually attacking us.\n\nEarth shouldn\u0027t be that interesting to them for colonization.\n\nIts a huge biohazard, an interesting place to study, and its got a ~9km/sec dV requirement to lift things from orbit. And its atmosphere presents huge design constraints.\n\nWhat if they come and want to strip mine Ceres/Vesta/ 16 psyche.... there\u0027s a lot of resources for the taking with small gravity wells and no biohazard.\n\nIf they have high Isp and high thrust drives taht make the 9km/sec to lift off from earth easy.... and they want such huge quantities of material that asteroids \u002B mars \u002B gas giant moons aren\u0027t enough... then doesn\u0027t Earth look less desirable than nepture/Uranus/Saturn, even Jupiter if mass is really what they want?\n\nWhy should they \\*care\\* about Earth (from a military or economic point of view).\n\nWhat Earth does have, is rather large manufacturing capabilities that may dwarf those of an alien expedition.\n\nI\u0027d like to see a Sci-Fi story where aliens come, and lay claim to mars, the asteroids, jovian moons, etc... then because its a colony ship with limited manufacturing capability, they open relations with earth... they give us technology, but we have to build stuff for them.\n\nSlowly, they exploit us through trade, much like european powers did in past centuries.\n\nHumanity is given cheap clean power... regular access to space, high speed transit, etc... but our future is bleak and hopeless... the aliens have claimed everything in our solar system except Earth and the moon, despite the advanced technology... we have nothing to invent, the aliens have patented everything (and manipulated the system, signed treaties where they retain the IP forever, not 20 years)- they merely liscence us the rights to use the technology... in fact the contract stipulates that they actually own everything built with their technology, and we\u0027re just allowed to use it.\n\nThen they use their amassed wealth to control the money supply, they get paid interest in addition to liscencing fees.\n\nThey soon influence events on Earth as the 0.01% do today... and if anyone questions the fairness of it, they call us stupid humans, cite the massive research and development costs that the alien civilization paid for to develop the technology, and then say they are not just \u0022job creators\u0022 but \u0022world savers\u0022, as most civilizations like ours (so they may claim) collapse due to nuclear warfare or environmental destruction - their fusion power plant technology saved us from global warming, and the aliens actively guard us from asteroid impacts. etc...\n\nThey control the highest levels of government, without a shot being fired, or setting foot on our planet.\n\nWe have nowhere to go, because the aliens have spread all around us - and we helped speed their spread by diverting Earth\u0027s industrial output towards their expansion in return for their technology).\n\nThe aliens monitor us, and would KEW us if we started a militarization program to try and expand.\n\nMaybe they are nice enough to find us a new planet if something happens to ours(like the sun expands to a red giant).... but if we cause it ourselves, they\u0027ll probably leave us to die.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T11:29:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 11:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T22:12:27Z","Content":"Lets face it....
