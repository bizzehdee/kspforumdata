Here\\\u0027s the premise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There\\\u0027s a new pony in Ponyville, a white pegasus with a blue, hollow six-pointed star as his Cutie Mark. He always wears a strange circle of fabric on his head, and never flies on Saturdays. He is often found inside a small abandoned adorned with a seven-branched candelabra with a fringed scarf over his face, where he can be heard singing loudly in a language none of the girls have ever heard of (Hebrew). A regular customer to Sugarcube, he suddenly stops for eight days, often seen eating a large cracker of sorts. One day, \u0027Kol Titzrih Itai Veifsach\u0027 (All who are needy come and celebrate the Passover) comes into play, and the girls learn a huge lesson in Judaism. When the new pony begins to sing the prayers, a quiet humming to the melody can be heard, and when he is finished, an \u0027Amen\u0027 is barely audible. The voice is unmistakeable - Fluttershy is Jewish. Why has she been hiding this secret all this time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
