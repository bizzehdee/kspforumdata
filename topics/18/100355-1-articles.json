But... where should I go to school? Right now, I\u0027m not looking at colleges based on anything other than engineering programs.\n\nHere\u0027s where you come in: if you\u0027re in aerospace (or other fields in) engineering, where did you go to school? Where do you work now? What are other tips you have regarding schools to go to?\n\nIf you\u0027re not an aerospace engineer, what are your suggestions? What did you find helpful?\n\nI\u0027m in 11th grade, so this is a considerable part of my college search.

The best are Stanford and Harvard, and Stanford has a lot of connections to the technology industry for out of college recruiting.\n\nYou could also go to Pomona College and take half your classes at Pomona and the other half at Harvey Mudd.\n\nThose premier schools will demand at least a 4.0 GPA, an excellent attitude and charisma for your interview, excellent SAT scores of at least 2300, a lot of extracurriculars that clearly show your passions and also shows your dedication to a program or a cause, internships at engineering companies, good scores on your SAT 2\u0027s, subject tests, and AP tests, some good teacher recommendations, a sense of empathy, and much more.\n\nFor Asian Americans, the bar\u0027s even higher due to Affirmative Action limiting the number of slots available to them in premier schools. Not fair, but we deal with the hand we\u0027re dealt.\n\nAnd the landscape for admissions to top schools has changed dramatically in the last few years. A lot of supposedly second rate colleges, even USC, have become some of the hardest to get into engineering and medical schools.\n\nYou also have to see how the school treats graduates vs undergrads. Often times, schools will focus their resources and staff time to the graduates in the top research schools while the top liberal arts usually only accept under grad students in order to giver them the most attention.\n\nGetting into a top school can help with your career opportunities. At top companies like Qualcomm and Apple, unless you graduated from a top school or an ivy league, most people can kiss their chances of becoming director good bye.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T20:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T20:23:20Z","Content":"Look for nearby colleges and don\u0027t go overboard.
