(and decrease the rate in which the fuel is consumed.....please.....I can\u0027t explore when I\u0027m looking for plutonium half the time)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Connect the players\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook, no matter how you look at it, NMS is kinda like minecraft. \u00A0No real goal, find resources, build bases. \u00A0But there\u0027s a reason why minecraft has more...for lack of a better term: \u0022replay-ability.\u0022 \u00A0It\u0027s the multiplayer. \u00A0Minecraft is fun by yourself for the first few hours you download it but after you\u0027ve built a house, found diamond, and claimed the tears from that endless whining flying cubical beast inside the hell termed \u0022nether,\u0022 it gets pretty boring. \u00A0But bring your friends along with you in minecraft and maybe ruthlessly end the lives of an opposing faction because your diamond enchanted sword hath no mercy, then it gets kinda interesting. \u00A0Please Hello Games, connect me with my friends somehow. \u00A0I get you want me to feel lonely in the massive game...but sometimes lonely isn\u0027t fun. \u00A0Any 11 year old girl going through her existential crisis knows this, and I don\u0027t think they want to re-live it again.\u00A0 I\u0027m not saying let my friends have the ability to go through my journey with me, but perhaps there\u0027s another game mode you can make, or maybe give me and my buddy the chance to roam the world I claimed my\u00A0base in and we can explore the solar system it\u0027s in, but limit us to only that star system; make us unable to explore together\u00A0any star system my home base isn\u0027t in. \u00A0(oh, and let me be able to see him as well, we don\u0027t want another incident that happened at launch day now do we hello games...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-International relations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve looked into the lore of NMS, it says that the Gek and the Vy\u0027Keen had a war a loooooong long long long looong time ago. \u00A0So perhaps there\u0027s a way we can make this interesting. \u00A0Say a Vy\u0027Keen freighter is being attacked by Gek, I can choose a side to fight with. \u00A0I can partner with the Gek and take the loot, or I can protect the Vy\u0027Keen. \u00A0And whoever\u0027s side I pick, it will lower the relations I have with the opposing side. \u00A0This can lead to strong alliances. \u00A0If I then enter a Gek system, the frequency at which I get attacked by pirates is increased, but I can call on my allies to warp to me and fight with me. \u00A0Freighters will fight freighters, and starships will fight starships in the colossal battles we\u0027ve been wanting to see. \u00A0Which leads me to my next point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Starships\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk look, I made it my mission in NMS to get the largest starship I could get. \u00A0Not in terms of cargo space, but of just strait up scale of the vehicle. \u00A0And I have succeeded. \u00A0I got a cool looking freighter ship with the two rectangle boxes on each side of it. \u00A0It\u0027s pretty great. \u00A0But I warped to another system and I saw a sweet looking, small and nimble-appearing starship. \u00A0So what if each ship had it\u0027s own innate ability. \u00A0Ok ok, hear me out. \u00A0Instead of letting every ship in NMS max out to a 48 cargo slot, reserve\u00A0that only for the cargo-looking ships. \u00A0But limit the cargo ships in their weapons, speed, and maneuverability aspects. \u00A0So smaller fighter-looking ships would be faster, would have stronger weapons, and have more maneuverability but be limited to say a 35 space cargo slot max and have less health once their shields are down, and larger cargo ships would be slower and have weaker weapon capabilities, but they have that extra cargo. \u00A0And expand this idea with the freighters and give us the ability to have multiple ships parked inside the freighter so that we could choose between which one we want to fly. \u00A0If we enter a system that is controlled by the Gek we made mad earlier, then perhaps it\u0027s in our best interest to take the fighter ship encase we get some trouble. \u00A0But if we\u0027re in the Vy\u0027Keen system, then we wouldn\u0027t have to worry about pirates as much so we can afford to take the cargo ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just my ideas, let me know what you guys think and what you want to see \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T21:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is what you were looking for: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nmscommunityforums.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nmscommunityforums.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
