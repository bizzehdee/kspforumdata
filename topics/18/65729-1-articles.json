It\u0027s nothing new - I\u0027ve been working on it since April of 2009 - but a series of events (a very long story) has led to me going public with it in several different places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working with three people from around the world to help put together what I\u0027d like to call Project Thoth. The goal is simple: Put a man on the moon and bring him safely back to the Earth. The big catch, though, is that it\u0027d be the product of non-governmental work and use largely existing architecture (namely Soyuz, Proton, Atlas V Heavy, Centaur, and Fregat-SB. Possibly Dragon, Falcon Heavy, and Falcon 9, too). Only the lander would need to be developed. I\u0027ve been carving out the plan with an associate from France (who I will not name at the moment, because I\u0027d like to ensure that I have his approval in naming him in general). To be completely honest, he\u0027s done almost all of the work. I\u0027m just the spokesperson. It looks something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Launch 1: Crew to ISS. Either Soyuz or Dragon could pull this off - likely Dragon, as Soyuz will be involved later. The crew will wait at the ISS for the rest of the spacecraft to be assembled in low Earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B Launch 2: Soyuz/Fregat-SB to ISS, unmanned. Proton is the go-to launch vehicle for this one. This will serve as the command module for the lunar expedition, and I have christened it \u0022Phoenix\u0022 (or \u00C3\u00C2\u00A4\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA\u00C3\u2018\u00C2, if you want to go with the Russian name). It will hang out at the ISS and wait for launch number 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BLaunch 3: Lunar module/LOI stage/Centaur tug to trans-lunar injection, unmanned. Atlas V Heavy is likely the launch vehicle to go with for this launch, as it is the heaviest-lift launch vehicle that is closest to operational status. The lunar module, the only new hardware in the plan, will be named \u0022Taiga\u0022 (\u00C3\u00C2\u00A2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u00C2\u00B9\u00C3\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0). It will wait in low Lunar orbit in a 27 degree frozen orbit for Phoenix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BLaunch 4: KTVK/docking hardware, unmanned. Second Proton launch. The space tug for Phoenix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost immediately after launch 4 is confirmed to be in a stable orbit, the three Thoth astronauts/cosmonauts will board Phoenix, power it up, and undock from the ISS. Phoenix will then dock to the KTVK, which will burn for the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoenix, after LOI, would then rendezvous and dock with Taiga. Taiga would be powered up in preparation for landing. The surface stay would last for about thirty-six hours, including a four-hour EVA, and then the ascent stage would launch to rendezvous and dock with Phoenix. TEI would occur twelve hours after discarding Taiga\u0027s ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding would take place in Kazakhstan. A standard mission, taking into account the ISS stay, would last about two months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my big plan. How does it sound? Anyone have anything to contribute?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T03:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

That\u0027s enough for a decent sized satellite (or several thousand CubeSats) and thus acts as another source of funding. There\u0027s also a small amount of room aboard Taiga for an experiments package (think ALSEP) that could be deployed on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal cost is projected to be $426.5 million, so on paper, the launch could be paid for by charging $143,333 per kilogram of additional payload. This is just over twice the cost for a standard CubeSat. Frankly, I don\u0027t feel that 144k is an unfair cost for universities/countries around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISS usage could probably be fiddled with through the Russians, as Phoenix would technically be a Russian spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T16:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like you\u0027ve accomplished more in four hours than NASA has in 45 years. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T16:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome points I\u0027m wondering about\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Charging double doesn\u0027t usually give you much clientele, unless I\u0027m missing something?
