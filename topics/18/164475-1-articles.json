Now you may be asking \u201Cwhat are you talking about?!\u201D I\u0060ll tell you! So! Project Icarus, sending an anti-matter rocket to alpha centauri-b, sounds fun, right? Well, for the most part, yes, very fun. Until your life relies on you finding enough water to sustain 5 people for fifteen years, make a colony, and have enough to get home. Yeah, now our life is a desperate struggle to find water. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003ENow, in my fevered imagination you will probably be asking \u201Cbut, what about bringing it with you?!\u201D well, my answer to that is a simple one; no, just no. Turns out, that amount water weighs more than a freaking super Walmart, and has the certain problem of boiling off into space, forcing us to store it inside the spacecraft eating up our precious living space (so you know, we don\u0060t kill each other?). Now, we did have water, because, you know, we aren\u0060t camels or something, but just enough to get us to alpha centauri-b, and set up a rudimentary drill rig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0026lt;historical note: the following pages are based off of audio logs, video logs and, with the rest of the crew\u0060s permission, crew logs.

Eventually we started to hear some guitar or something, everyone looked over to jonathan; the ships engineer, now that I think about it, I have no idea what his role on the mission is, except for being some strange engineering merchant (no, really, I pay him sometimes to fix things). Yup, his smile says it all, he thought it would be a great time to play david bowie\u0060s space oddity\u2026. Right after an anti-matter burn; let me mention that in space oddity, major tom has some pretty interesting problems with his ship.
