But no one is doing anything about it. Currently, with our energy production, there is [10 billion](http://co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Now/global-carbon-emissions.html) metric tons of CO2 being released by humans each year, and it\u0027s rising. If we don\u0027t stop it, this generation can be the last. So I propose a simple way to change this.\n\nIf a mass of people want to change something, they usually protest, and try to bring change. But none of that is working, so it seems. But I think if there is a mass of hand written letters to your government, there can be a change. So I propose is that we, as a community of well informed people, write letters to the governments. Tell them that their children won\u0027t have children at this rate, that when they die we have to clean up, and tell them how to change it. Tell them different ways to produce clean energy, such as solar, nuclear, hydro, or wind power. It\u0027s a large investment, but it will pay off by them living through history.\n\nThat was my rant, and personally I think we as a mass can change. Or at least bring more attention to. The governments can\u0027t deny that the climate is changing, through the rain during winter, and it snowing in central USA. We HAVE to change something, or the children of today won\u0027t have kids.\n\ninb4 \u0022Governments don\u0027t care\u0022, \u0022We can\u0027t change anything\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T07:26:27Z","Content":"NO, we don\u0027t need to stop climate change!
