Following orders a recipe is quite boring, so I rather like to start with some ingredients I think would fit together. It usually turns out edible or okay-ish, but the weeks after I make the same dish again and again, each time adjusting and experimenting to make gradual improvements. After a while you get something that is actually a pretty palatable meal.\n\nThe latest one is a somewhat Carbonara inspired dish with minced meat and bacon bits, a union, cream, green beans and potatoes. If you do manual work or sports it is very nutritional and it has plenty of proper carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals too."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:33:30Z","Content":"I do most of the cooking, from following recipes, to extemporaneous.

It\u0027s not just something to do because you\u0027re hungry, but rather an expression the mind. A lot can be told about you simply based on the foods you eat.\n\nYour cooking can never truly be divine if you never put your soul into it. Enjoy what you do! Have fun with the procedures, be creative, don\u0027t listen to the recipe books! Do what you want; experiment, and evaluate your work on your own.\n\nBread is a very versatile substance. It is both self sufficient, and can be part of a greater whole; something I cannot say about many other foods. Even if you think cooking as just a supplemental function in life, some people think that way about paintings. It\u0027s always the intention put behind the meal that truly makes it worth eating."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T09:03:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cooking is an art.
