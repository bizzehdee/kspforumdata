There is one village shop, home of the \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A31 banana, and around it a lot of grumpy residents who refuse to pick up their dog poo. Local news never reports anything more interesting than the worryingly frequent suicides. There is nothing to do within 20 minutes by car, and because of the pathetic excuse for public transport no easy way to escape to the real world:\n\n1 bus a day to every destination, at 7 in the morning. This is going to become a real issue for me next year because not only would it make me late for college (that\u0027s the english 6th-form-y college, not university-y college) but there would be no way to get home afterwards.\n\n1 train station within sane walking distance, but it\u0027s far enough away that if you were to walk there you\u0027d be taking a lot of time out of the day to the extent it\u0027s not really worth it, and the train is impractically expensive anyway. I would get a job to be able to pay for it, but there is of course nowhere to get a job at.\n\nAgain, there is nowhere worthwhile near enough to walk or cycle without losing most of the day to travel.\n\nI am 10 months too young to even start learning to drive legally, and when I can I\u0027d be spending twice as much on insurance each year as on the car, simply because of age reasons. A motorbike would be far more affordable and super-cool, but my parents insist that motorbike\u0027s are a sure-fire way to do a 70mph somersault into a brick wall while on fire.\n\nSo, my question is, anyone else have this problem? And if so, how do/did you cope? And is it the same in other countries? I know in America the driving age tends to be younger, does that help?\n\nAnd people who live in big cities and have the means to actually do things without fighting for transport, what\u0027s that like? Is there an equivelant problem?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T16:35:27Z","Content":"If it makes you feel better, a friend of mine lives in a mining \u0022town\u0022 in Nevada.

Don\u0027t do it.\n\nWhat a totally ........ thing to say. You will definitely die no matter what you do. Dying of a motorbike-related incident does raise your chances of dying earlier than otherwise, but that depends largely on yourself and to a lesser extent those around you.\n\nI\u0027ve been riding motorbikes for nearly 20 years now (initially Australia, now UK), although I did get onto them a lot later than most (mid-twenties). Haven\u0027t had a major incident yet, although there were some close shaves. To be fair some of my mates haven\u0027t been so lucky, and usually the fault was not with them but with the other party involved. So the point about being more vulnerable is not one to take lightly.\n\nI think what aided me in keeping out of trouble (apart from a good dose of luck) was that I was well-versed in general street craft by the time I got onto one, and I got a totally underpowered one to start off with, which meant I couldn\u0027t really do anything too silly even if I had wanted to. By the time I got onto a more powerful bike I had learned some additional respect.\n\nBikes can be a heck of a lot of fun, but you really need to develop a sixth sense to watch out for all the numpties on the roads, and there is very little room for error.\n\nBut you have to also ask yourself, apart from getting to/from school, where would you go, and would wherever you go be better than where you are (for now)? Developing a fun local hobby definitely has benefits, and you have far more opportunities for that than people a few years ago did. Just having access to the Internet and all of its information is HUGE. Pretty much anything you want to pursue you can find out so much information about, specialists only a few decades ago would have given their right arms for.\n\nI also grew up in a smallish village and had a 10km ride (pushbike) to school. One way. Against the wind. Uphill both ways. In torrential rain. Yaddayaddayadda.. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Apart from that I had a local library and took up various hobbies (flying kites, astronomy, reading,...) until technology (and my savings) progressed to home computers. Never looked back after that! Learn to code. Addons for KSP, since you\u0027re already here. Creative and potentially job-creating in the future.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can get a provisional moped license at 16, so I could do that. The thing is though I would want to upgrade to a car or motorbike as soon as I could, seeing as mopeds are meant to be limited to 28mph and so I\u0027m assuming pretty useless for travelling on big roads or over any kind of distance, so I\u0027m not sure it\u0027d be worth the time and cost for the amount of time I\u0027d use it. What do you think?\n\nStarting on a moped (as opposed to a full bike) would definitely be a Good Thing IMHO.\n\nA) you\u0027re properly part of the traffic, unlike on a pushbike, so you\u0027d be getting used to road rules etc.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) It\u0027s too slow for you to do anything stupid on, so you\u0027ll get the hang of handling yourself in traffic without the temptation (or better, the ability) to drag-race or do any number of other silly things. While that might sound prejudiced, it\u0027s what (most) young people will (want to) do. I know I did..\n\nC) You\u0027ll find out whether motorbiking is your kinda thing or not without spending huge amounts of money on it\n\nWhether you then move on to a car or a bike is up to you and your experiences on the moped. It\u0027ll extend your range a bit over a pushbike, but yeah, if you really want to go a bit further afield it\u0027s only a stop-gap. Although you can get mopeds which do over 60mph these days too... not sure of the license requirements though."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T20:44:14Z","Content":"Well, I live in a small village.... about 1100 residents... more than one shop!
