The game involved pilotting a Mech-device around what looked like an airbase. I never really made it past the airbase/military base part so... However, I do remember the fact there was a key that dangled from it that had to be inserting into a keyhole and turned to relase the lock on a little flip-up hatch that contained a big red \\\u0027EJECT\\\u0027 button. If anyone knows what this game was and hwere I could buy another copy, that\\\u0027d be useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T02:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot familiar with any external control panels, but it might have been a Mech Warrior game, or an Armored Core game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the only ones I can remember that have you pilot giant mechs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T02:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Battalion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESteel Battalion\u003C/a\u003E.
