I don\u0027t know why you would consider such a thing. Like others have said, if you have a legitimate copy of the game you got through their website or steam, chances are these two events are completely unrelated.\n\nNumber two - as a computer enthusiast with a water cooled computer who is also an IT professional maybe I can offer some help. Let\u0027s start with something very blatantly obvious. How old is your computer? Is this a desktop? If it\u0027s been several years, there is a chance that your CMOS battery on your motherboard. It is that round quartz battery that saves your BIOS settings and other basic start up settings of a computer. They do go dead after a while and need replaced. I would start there. Also have you cleaned the computer in a while? Dust and cobwebs can\u0027t do you any good for basic problems.\n\nAlso you noted the \u0022CPU\u0022 tries to turn on. Maybe you should try replacing the thermal paste on your CPU and possibly getting a new CPU fan. Bad RAM (probably the LEAST like thing) could cause start up issues as well, especially with BIOS.

Fault: cpu tries to turn on and shuts down before operating system \u0022boots up\u0022.\n\nNo really, it is *not* too much coincidence, it\u0027s just that the human brain is a pattern matching engine; we love to see cause and effect chains, and when the actual effect is invisible, we believe it was the last thing we did with religious fervour. It kept us alive for millions of years (e.g. \u0027Ug\u0027s stomach hurts. Ug ate red mushrooms recently. Ug shall not eat red mushrooms again.\u0027) but isn\u0027t really applicable to modern technology. \n\nI wouldn\u0027t blame my location on a road if my car engine kersploded one day when I put my foot down.

I have already pointed out there is a bias in human thinking against coincidences, we don\u0027t like them. Someone above already pointed out why that is. The hard part is not knowing there is a bias, it is having confidence that that is what is getting you.\n\nI am a computer person, I went to school for programming, and I am a system building hobbyist. It is hard to wreck a system in the way you described. You can\u0027t do it accidentally. Think of all the amateur programmers out there. NONE of them have every fried their BIOS. It just doesn\u0027t happen. It is something you have to do deliberately. \n\nSo if KSP did do it, it wasn\u0027t accidental because that would be hundreds of times harder to believe than the coincidence.\n\nEven deliberately is hard. Even if you are targeting just one kind of BIOS, say American Megatrends, that BIOS is still custom to the motherboard and manufacturer. They have protections on them. If I wanted to wreck a system, I would just write a bunch of 0\u0027s on the hard drive. Done, easy, simple, reliable. \n\nBut what if it wasn\u0027t your BIOS, what if it was something else and you were just too specific in your first post? That is hard to believe as well...\n\nYou see malware is a business. Malware isn\u0027t out to annoy you. The best malware is malware that is silent. It doesn\u0027t slow your computer down more than it has to. It doesn\u0027t annoy you. It doesn\u0027t want you to take it to an IT to get rid of it. It wants to use your computer to send spam for profit, or some other method of making money. Now we all know malware fails in this, it does slow your system down for example. But it isn\u0027t out to wreck your stuff for no point. Frying your system would be just that. Pointless and unprofitable.\n\nLets not forget you are the only victim. \n\nIn summery, it is nigh on unthinkable that KSP caused your issue accidentally. It makes no sense that it was done on purpose. The possibility that it was a coincidence is just about 99.999999999999% of the total causality space.\n\nLet me finish with a parable. You might remember Star Force, it was a copy protection scheme that had some serious issues. Many people blamed it for wrecking their computer, or their disk drive. These accusations are false. It had real verifiable issues but hardware failure wasn\u0027t one of them. I once pointed out to someone that my drive failed within 1 week of getting Star Force installed. (It came with Silent Hunter III) They wondered how I could possibly rail against those that argue against Star Force when I myself had been a victim. I then revealed that my drive failed a week before I got the game and not after. Had it been the other way around, even knowing what I know about software, it would have been difficult even for me to dismiss the coincidence. Knowing the bias doesn\u0027t make it easy to ignore the bias, but it is still bias.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T08:40:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:53:12Z","Content":"[![correlation.png](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)](http://xkcd.com/552/)"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:30:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No it is not.
