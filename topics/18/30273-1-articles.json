But the question is, what do these REALLY add into immersion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifesupport is a few variables that add on some mass, resources add in a end-game challenge... even nitpicks about rocket engine performance / aerodynamics / physically impossible solar systems doesn\u0027t change that the reality of the game. The advent of television created a \u0022physical impossibility\u0022 for the populous, yet they came to accept the technology even though it violated principles that they thought they knew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core of all our technology, our science, relies on assumptions (models, if you will) that happen to fit the observable data. If these assumptions were proven wrong, we\u0027d have another technology / science boom as we establish different assumptions / models to fit the newly observed data. The discovery of the new model does not \u0022break immersion\u0022, people don\u0027t claim \u0022Hey, I must be dreaming.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are we actually talking about Roleplaying here? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, what are we really looking for... the game to be a more stringent Dungeon Master, or for us to stop exploiting the \u0022game\u0027s kindness\u0022? There is a disease called \u0022perfectionitus\u0022 that causes people to press F5 and F9 like crazy. There is another disease called \u0022Cheateritus\u0022 that causes people to press F5 to \u0022luck\u0022 their way through difficult segments of a game (essentially using \u0022god mode\u0022 without actually turning it on). As such, should we remove quicksave to \u0022increase immersion?\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESo what is the REALITY of what people want when people specify \u0022Immersion,\u0022\u003C/span\u003E just more actions for the Dungeon Master to allow?
