It\u0027s hard to \u0022walk it off\u0022, when walking itself is difficult. She had a gastric bypass, just to try to maintain rather than gain. It\u0027s a genetic thing in out family too... She has a garden, raises her own greens, fruits and veggies... and still, she can\u0027t hardly shed a pound, even with the gastric bypass. That compounds, and means the arthritis in her ankles, knees, and hips gets worse yet... It really is a no win situation. That\u0027s part of why she still walks around the store, rather than use the little scooter carts to get around. It\u0027s why she still goes out and tends her own garden... Anything to get some movement into her life, even if it hurts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I\u0027m not mistaken, I think her ankle has a range of motion that\u0027s less than 20\u00B0. Walking is very painful for her if she has to do it for extended periods of time, but she still does walk. I do try to park close for her, but more often than not, rather than use the handicapped parking spaces and dig for the card,\u00A0I usually\u00A0just let her off at the door, find a place to park, and then catch up with her...

I doubt I\u0027ll get close to a job that cushy again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also quite annoyed at how slowly they moved... I applied back in March for an April application deadline. Early june\u00A0they told me that I was 1 of 15 selected (out of ~300)\u00A0to to a written exercise (but it was short, a 200 word limit). I was\u00A0selected for an interview (6 people made it to this step) which was scheduled in mid/early July. I nailed that interview which was on technical aspects of the job, scientific knowledge, and reasoning skills. I was the 3rd of 6 to interview, and I\u0027m 95% sure that I did better than anyone else. They started with a logic problem, which I solved correctly, and they commented that it was \u0022fast\u0022 (I don\u0027t know if it was fastest, but they weren\u0027t sitting there with a stop watch... so...). They asked me to explain some science stuff in the next 2 questions, I did and they said I gave the best explanations \u0022so far\u0022 (I was #3 of 6). Then they showed me some technical documents, and asked why something was phrased a certain way - I answered correctly, and then added the specific article number of\u00A0the convention that specified the rule... which garnered a surprised look on the face of the boss (there were 3 interviewing), who commented \u0022exactly right!\u0022. I\u0027m sure that none of the others cited article 53 of that convention in their answer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they scheduled the 2nd interview for mid-August. It was an all day interview. It started with another written exercise, but then changed to interviews with groups of 2 people at a time from different groups in the company, all asking questions about \u0022soft skills\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrud like: \u0022tell me about a time when you had to keep a secret\u0022, \u0022tell me about a time when you were pushing hard for results\u0022, \u0022tell me about a time when you had to publicly admit a mistake\u0022, \u0022tell me about an unusual or novel idea that you\u0027ve had\u0022, \u0022tell me about a time that you collaborated on something\u0022, \u0022tell me about a time when you were brain storming\u0022. I tried to give academic/professional answers to all of them. Sometimes they asked for more personal answers, and I gave them when asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen 2 weeks later, they tell me that I didn\u0027t get the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne guy was willing to talk with me about why I didn\u0027t/what my weaknesses were. He said that it was very close, and that maybe if it had been a different day, or different people from the groups had been chosen to interview, that I may have got the job. He started off saying\u00A0a lot of positive things. He also said he was surprised at how differently the opinions were of me from the various interviewers. Apparently the meeting to select a candidate lasted 2 hours, and people were \u0022butting heads\u0022, and it was the \u0022most difficult decision\u0022 they\u0027ve had to make since they started the program some years ago... but concerns that were brought up about me were that I seemed inauthentic/I was trying to give them the answer that I thought they wanted instead of a genuine answer/ that I tried to shift the conversation to technical rather* than personal aspects (I\u0027ll give them this one, but isn\u0027t that called being professional???)/ that they had concerns that maybe I had too strong of a personality (but they couldn\u0027t really tell) - so much for trying to appear confident: by the way, the success and failure of the position depends on being able to argue and defend one\u0027s point of view, and many in the field regard this as an asset.**\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe said ultimately they couldn\u0027t really judge my personality, and weren\u0027t sure how I\u0027d fit with the team or the multicultural/international atmosphere - maybe if they\u0027d bothered to ask questions about that, they\u0027d know. As far as multicultural/international atmosphere... it should be obvious that I would do fine. I\u0027m from a very diverse part of California, my mother is a Jamaican immigrant to the US. I spent the last 10 years of my life living in Switzerland, both the german speaking and french speaking parts of it. My fiancee is Italian - the job is in Switzerland... I think I do fine in an international setting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interview format was determined by HR... some of the interviewers seemed like they didn\u0027t like it, and sort of began with almost a sigh and some statement that they\u0027re supposed to conduct the interview in this format.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, they say they\u0027d like to hire 2 people instead of just one, and if they have it in the budget they\u0027ll open a 2nd position with an accelerated hiring process and I could reapply and possibly skip the 1st/2nd selection round to start before march of next year, but they won\u0027t know if they get the budget for the 2nd position until the end of next month... so all hope isn\u0027t lost, but its still damn depressing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* The guy cited, as an example of a technical rather than personal answer that was perhaps inauthentic, my response to his question about an unusual or novel idea that I had. I have him not 1, but 2 \u00A0scientific ideas... I really can\u0027t think of any other answers that I could have given him. That\u0027s the kind of person I am, what did he expect some idea for a costume party?! I could not have given a more authentic answer, and it was cited as an example of an answer that made me come across as inauthentic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n** In the letter of recommendation that I supplied them with, it said: \u0022[KerikBalm]\u00A0has an assertive personality, and forms strong opinions which he is able to argue in a sincere and non-confrontational manner. \u00A0I found this a positive asset. \u00A0He is equally able to respect and accept other views when these gain a consensus and are not aligned with his.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my opinion, [KerikBalm] has appropriate personal and professional characteristics to pursue a career in [this field]\u00A0and I would have no hesitation in recommending him for a position within the field.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about an \u0022assertive personality\u0022 and \u0022strong opinions\u0022, I\u0027m actually pretty reserved. I do like to debate technical and intellectual stuff, but as far as personal stuff and social events, I\u0027m very reserved. Apparently this section of the letter gave them concerns which I didn\u0027t assuage during the interview.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-22T13:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess who has just got freaking\u00A0cold!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-22T19:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223177816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506086112\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171449\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cratercracker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, cratercracker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess who has just got freaking\u00A0cold!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame here!\u00A0Suddenly everyone i know gets a cold?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t even smell and breathe properly\u00A0with my nose anymore, its clogged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeltaDizzy","CreatedById":150755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-22T20:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthough I did have a cough\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tom Morvolo Riddle","CreatedById":181597,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T00:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was a big fan of Transformers franchise until \u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u00221\u0022 height=\u002250\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022 width=\u002297\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 transformers the last knight movie so just want this to be short and concise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpoiler Alert - It\u0027s a $200 million worth piece [snip]\u00A0with some old nuggets on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you still want to watch it, here you go: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://whereyouwatch.com/movies/transformers-the-last-knight/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETransformers The Last Knight\u00A0 \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-24T01:54:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2017 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMind the language, please.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-24T22:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy headphone jack broke and is stuck inside my Ipad.
