Using such logic (though it is not necessary to the rest of this argument) any number divided by 0 could arguably equal infinity. This is simply back story, the rest goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere \u0027X\u0027 can equal any finite number:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX*10^-infinity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resulting number (for simplicity sake X=1) is a 1 with an infinite number of zeros in front of it. This is a technically finite number that is larger than 0 while at the same time being infinitely small. Practically speaking this number is 0 while in fact it is actually slightly higher than 0 by an infinitely small mount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we divide \u0027Y\u0027 (any finite number which for simplicity sake is also 1) by the number that was just made then using the logic at the top of this post, since the previous number is infinitely small without being 0; by dividing by it we get another number that is infinitely large while still technically being a finite (not infinity) number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is that we have two numbers that are functionally identical to \u00270\u0027 and \u0027infinity\u0027 without actually being either of them. They are also both technically finite numbers yet they cannot be written down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to: Discuss, point out holes in my logic, base new forms of propulsion on this logic\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T23:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe limit of 1/x as x approaches 0 from the positive side is infinity.

In your sequence, if you look at any individual step n - no matter how large - n will be finite, so the result will be finite. There is no step where n=infinity.
