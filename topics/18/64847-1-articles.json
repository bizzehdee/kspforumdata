Personally, I fell in love with a small distro called MANJARO LINUX. It uses very (!!) little resources compared to Ubuntu (or anything else for that matter) and is super easy to update. Great community forum too, so if you\u0027re stuck, they will help you. My 72 year old dad is now using Manjaro, and just a year ago he asked me what a \u0022double-click\u0022 is...just to put things in perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get a cheap external hard disk...they aren\u0027t expensive and totally worth it.

Manjaro installed everything automatically for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Check out those hundreds of Youtube tutorial videos or simply pick a distro with a great (helpful) community. In my experience, the larger distros like Ubuntu have a larger community which can be good...but a small dedicated community will often get you more accurate help. Never pay for Linux training, all the info is on the net for free. Manjaro is based on Arch Linux which has the largest Linux wiki on the net...and Manjaro has one too: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EManjaro Wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind Manjaro is slightly different to Ubuntu...not much though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUbuntu is the best-known distro...but imo it\u0027s bloated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this website if you\u0027re considering alternative Linux distros: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=manjaro\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDistro Watch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run Manjaro on a Macbook Pro 15 Retina...works like a charm.

We also aren\u0027t very well supported by the graphics card manufacturers.

Just make sure you do your homework and definitely keep Windows around in a dual-boot setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for hardware, I agree with both sides of the discussion above. If you have well-supported hardware (eg: Intel chipsets, non-Optimus Nvidia graphics) then Linux is actually a lot easier than Windows. If you have oddball or unsupported hardware then it can be a bit of a nightmare, especially as the solution to obscure config problems is indeed to drop to the command line.

Once you get the hang of it, you may find yourself writing lots of little shell scripts to help automate routine tasks. If you want more power/expressiveness than bash, pick your favorite out of perl, python, ruby, etc - they\u0027re all right there for you.

I went out and picked up a cheap external hard drive yesterday so I could back up the stuff I didn\u0027t want to lose, and I did a clean install of Windows 7 to clean out my computer before I went ahead with anything else. I also played around with Linux a bit before I started the install process and I think I\u0027ll like it once I get used to using it. I don\u0027t play many AAA games, mainly because this computer just can\u0027t manage running most of them, so 90% of the games I play are Indie and as far as I know the ones I play support Linux.
