It\u0027s that time again and I need me some gratuitous, mainstreamy space battles and explosions. Think something along the lines of Nexus: The jupiter incident or a more hands on space/fighter/sim like the X series. I\u0027m currently playing Endless Space, a fairly good if somewhat bland 4x game. I\u0027ve seen something-something-pegasus, but it didn\u0027t appeal. Any tips for me? Something new-ish (released 2010 on) I want most, but some oldies I might\u0027ve missed are welcome too.
