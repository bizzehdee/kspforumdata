in the original elite i could have a ship turn a sizable profit in a few runs and you would be fast on your way to having a ship that could explore other avenues of play. subsequent games i had to scrape by on hair thin margins. games like this really need a grind slider in the difficulty section, kerbal has one, and its nice to be able to shut down the grind on subsequent playthroughs to save time. games should not feel like work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe op\u0027s point about \u0027respect for time\u0027 is highly valid. the old standard of 40-60 hours of gameplay which was a common rule of thumb in 90s games. its a good rule because it suits both developers and players alike. if you give a gamer a game that never ends, they arent going to have time to play new games and that hurts sales and the industry as a whole. its also bad for the gamer because you burn out long before experiencing everything the game has to offer. the developer can get around their half of the problem by going f2p to make up for fewer titles by more nickel and dime payments. f2p really isnt new. in the 90s we had shareware and demos, it was so ubiquitous that i think 75% of my cd collection was purchased because i liked the demo/shareware version. dlc isnt new either, in that we had official (and in some cases 3rd party) expansion packs filling the same role. what f2p usually does differently is intentionally make games grindy to improve the bottom line at the expense of the gamer. its gone from number of games you buy to how long you play our game. after my first experience with f2p (mechwarrior online, which i still play out of sunk cost fallacy) i have decided that i will not play any more f2p games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother huge problems modern games have is the lack of diversity. too many established genres and conformity to other games. adoption of systems that have become standard issue (achievements for example) which can be exploited to cover up bad/lazy\u00A0core game mechanics. abundant asset reuse and use of stock assets make games look the same. games on a handful of game engines that all seem to share a similar look and feel to other sibling games on the same engine. niche genres are not taken seriously at all, and if you are a fan of those you are\u00A0lucky you get a 3rd rate f2p or maybe an indie game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\none final problem id like to touch on is the politicising of games, which i wont go into in any detail because of this forum\u0027s policy on the subject. like all media games have become another mouthpiece for various forms of ideological extremists. this has been a problem with tv and movies too, but its exceptionally alarming in games because of the appeal of younger audiences. id like to name some examples but im leaving them out because i dont want to start a forum war.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

Hasn\u0027t been my experience of older titles at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot exclusive to older games. Look at games like \u003Cem\u003EPapers, Please\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EFactorio\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003EReturn of the Obra Dinn\u003C/em\u003E. Especially\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EReturn of the Obra Dinn\u003C/em\u003E. All very high quality, and all with rather low graphical quality compared to modern tripe-A games. Or KSP, even. Sure, it\u0027s better than any game you\u0027d find 30 years ago, but by modern standards it doesn\u0027t look particularly good. This is especially true if you go back a few versions, before the recent part/texture overhauling. Or heck, if you go way back to the pre-.18 look. Didn\u0027t stop people from picking up the game. Plenty of indie games have gone for the retro aesthetic have made it big... and plenty that have tried for that aesthetic have flopped. Graphical quality is not negatively correlated with quality of mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee above. Already been done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour gripe with \u003Cem\u003EElite: Dangerous\u003C/em\u003E seems to be that it didn\u0027t do the one thing it sets out to do well, and your solution is to have it try and do more stuff?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not sufficient to say that such games are fun, since they\u0027re typically hard to develop. It\u0027s hard enough to make a good game that only tries to do one thing. It\u0027s an entirely different level of difficult to have a game that does several radically different things without any of said things feeling out of place or notably worse-designed than the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, I think, is not that games have been getting worse over the years. Rather, it\u0027s that there are simply a lot more games on the market, which makes it harder to separate the wheat from the chaff, as well as giving the impression of a flood of terrible titles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Also, why do you use the word \u0022dangerous\u0022? You seem to be arguing that they\u0027re worse, but a bad game isn\u0027t necessarily dangerous (and a dangerous game isn\u0027t necessarily badly made).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe games that I am referring to that I admire are the console games of the 90\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original 2-D Sonic series\u00A0I think is a prime example of a game that is good that does not take too long to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther games of notable mention that had mutiple modes of play were the Star Wars series for the SNES. Unfortunately that series took a long time to actually beat. But it was notable for having\u00A02-D platforming and 3-D flight in one game, albeit was just airplanes in space... but still it was a rare feature for\u00A0it\u0027s time and still is as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe danger of video games nowadays is the theft of valuable time. I used to play Oolite, which is a modernized clone of the original elite with many upgrades. But I grew to dislike it since it is basically a huge grind. You can spend hours and still not get paid well enough. And even if you enable massive cheats then all you have left to do is kill stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for game redesign in general, I think it would be a simple thing to include mutiple modes of play in a a game, \u00A0since even old games did it in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Star Trek TNG Sega Genesis game of the 90\u0027s (much better than the SNES clone) had\u00A0RPG elements that allowed you to make choices that had some effect on the player\u0027s game. Basically, you had the option to at least talk your way out of starship scuffles, and if you chose to blast away every Romulan Warbird you ever encountered, you would run out of torpedoes sooner or later, your ship would accumulate damage, and you would pay by having to wait for repairs. On top of that, hostile vessels can warp in withput warning and fire on you during repairs... assuming your not orbiting a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game rewards being diplomatic, since then enemies at least give you the choice to talk things out. Be hostile and they will shoot you on sight, no talking at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest thing to add\u00A0in any game is a choice tree/rpg element. All it is is still screen pics with choices, which effect what level you go to. Simple. Or beyond that it could effect NPC behavior, which\u00A0may be a bit harder to implement, but surely doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven TNG on the Sega Genesis did that... albeit in a very limited way. Be nice and enemies can be talked out of shooting you. Have a regular pattern of blowing then\u00A0away on sight and they will start firing on your spaceship\u00A0on sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game even allowed for a single save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-16T20:54:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2019 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T21:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it odd that people on the KSP forums are complaining that games take up 1000s of hours of play time.
