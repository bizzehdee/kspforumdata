It all depends on how much damage done to the book you\u0027re willing to tolerate (cover will likely need to be razored off), and how \u0022pretty\u0022 you want it to look. The way I saw this fixed usually applied a new cloth strip over the old and ended with a small thin line of glue where the binding broke (basically, the two pages were slightly glued together and you could notice it if you looked for it.)\n\nGetting it professionally repaired would be insane though; you COULD, technically, just even use duct tape to fix it with the main problem being that you now can see the silver tape on the spine... but getting it done professionally would be if you really did have a first edition."},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T05:32:33Z","Content":"The cover and spine are fine, the only damage is what\u0027s shown in the photo.

I used to pick up every new issue when it came out, they now occupy several boxes because I don\u0027t have the display space any more. My interest waned as the numbers approached 80, and cover prices left \u0027casual purchase\u0027 territory, and entered \u0027lunch money.\u0027 It saddens me to go to a used book store, and see them by their dozens, in the bargain bin. \nI would pick up novelizations of episodes or movies, looking for extra scenes and tidbits. The worst for me was \u0022Unification\u0022 - the Next Generation novelization of a two episode story. I was thinking the huge story of attempting to mend fences between the Romulans and Vulcans could contain subplots and political intrigues that couldn\u0027t be filmed for time. It had SPOCK in it, for goodness\u0027 sake. Sadly, the novel version was a complete waste.

Big. Deal. to me because it meant I could stop moving a half ton of old science fiction around every time I changed houses/apartments.

I still buy physical copies of the things my friends write and the things I really, really like (sometimes two copies - such as with The Martian - one to keep and one to give away).\n\nThe other big deal with eBooks is I can read anything anywhere without being judged by my book\u0027s cover.
