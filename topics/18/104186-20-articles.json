Conversely, the 67P comet is some 310,000,000 miles away from Earth and moving at 23.6 miles per second. Therefore, the likelihood that a 10-year old spacecraft landed on the comet first try around is highly improbable to say the least.\n\u003E \n\u003E Maths? Pfft.\n\u003E \n\u003E Evidence:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. No Video Footage (GREAT START! SCREW TELEMETRY AND PICTURES!)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. No Real-Time Communication (Who needs light speed, anyways?)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. No Aerodynamic Shape (Vacuum? PFFT!)\n\u003E \n\u003E 4. No Stars (Duh, asteroids don\u0027t reflect light)\n\u003E \n\u003E 5. No Fiery Glow (Asteroids = Mini-stars)\n\u003E \n\u003E 6. No Vapor Trail (Halley\u0027s comet has a vapor trail, 67P doesn\u0027t. FAKE LANDING!!1!1!!1)\n\u003E \n\u003E 7. No Space Sheer (Philae was only able to get 2 of its legs in contact with the comet, but stood upright in space. [A chair can\u0027t stand on three legs.](http://static1.bonluxat.com/cmsense/data/realtime/big/walter-papst-three-legged-chair_jsf5.jpg) Ignore that 67p Gravity \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2  Earth Gravity. )\n\u003E \n\u003E 8.

We can barely get reliable cellular and Wi-Fi service on Earth yet these spacecraft are Tweeting in real time from 310,000,000 miles away? Even stranger, it was reported on November 15, 2014, that Philae is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Casleep\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 after its batteries ran out. One would think that the ESA would have installed batteries that last longer than 72-hours but clearly that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not the case. Chances are it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a convenient way of ending the conversation about the highly improbable comet landing before it even gets started.
