The Lee has a small cannon turret and the Churchill has an extra cannon in the hull, neither of which are usable. In the PC game War Thunder, you can use any and all weapons on your tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn WoT, they should add a system where the secondary gun has its own ammo options in the consumables list, and you could switch between the weapons in battle. Say your Lee\u0027s main gun gets knocked out, or your tread gets blown off by somebody behind you and you can\u0027t turn to face them. You would still want to be able to engage the target, so you could switch to your secondary cannon. It\u0027s a smaller gun, but at least you could still fire on the enemy. Also, if you\u0027re in the Churchill and your turret gets jammed, you could switch to the hull cannon and still fight effectively. If you didn\u0027t care much about the secondary weapons, you could disable them in the consumables list, saving some money on ammo and reducing the risk of ammo racks getting hit and exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Tow cables\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is another thing that War Thunder has beaten WoT to. Say a buddy is trapped at the bottom of a cliff and they can\u0027t get back up. If your engine is strong enough, you should be able to attach some tow cables to their tank and pull them up. This would also add some interesting strategy to the game. Say a T28 (a REALLY slow tank destroyer) needs to get somewhere quicker. A faster and fairly large tank could attach a tow cable to it and pull it to another location a little bit faster than usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Wheeled tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may seem like an iffy idea, but wheeled vehicles would add a whole new area of strategy to WoT. They could either have there own category or just be put in the light tank category. A few wheeled vehicle ideas are the British Mk.II Daimler, the German Puma, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent acceleration, braking and view range. Could handle falling and bumpy terrain better than treaded tanks. Very maneuverable. Could be slowed down, but not immobilized. Great camo factors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisadvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t turn in place like treaded tanks. Wheels easily damaged, causing vehicle to lose speed and maneuverability. Very lightly armed and armored. Would have more trouble traversing soft terrain than treaded tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf somebody could copy and paste these on the actual WoT forum, that would be great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T04:19:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JMBuilder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T08:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4. planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T10:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4.
