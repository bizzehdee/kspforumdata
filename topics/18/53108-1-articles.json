At it\u0027s heart it\u0027s an \u0027Open Source\u0027 submarine drone designed to be able to be built by anyone with a soldering iron and a hot glue gun. It includes an Arduino Mega and a BeagleBone Black as control boards, and a 1080p camera for lovely views. You can buy a kit for $800 or cut pieces from scratch, but either way it\u0027s a far cry from the 20,000 you had to pay previously for a ROV-sub. Right now I\u0027ve already got a tricopter and a rover on my hands, but maybe in 6 months I might just fork up the $800 for the kit. I suppose that\u0027s what you do when you live in one of the best locations for diving, but can\u0027t actually dive. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#offtopic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould anyone be interested in an RC thread?

I suppose its a hobby thing, but then also its a pretty cool scientific platform.
