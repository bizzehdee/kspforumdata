Was it like the concerts of today where people sit and listen quietly? Because strangely enough I read or heard somewhere that Mozart\u0027s 41st and last symphony was supposed to be played at a casino hall! I suppose while patrons gambled? That\u0027s a lit different than the solemn concerts we know today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was the purpose of concertos? Solemn concert? Or background music to a picnic or festival?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what about divertimentos?! I read they ACTUALLY were for social events... Mozart is said to have composed his 11th Divertimento for his sister\u0027s birthday. So I am guessing it is... background music?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf all of this is really true it saddens me. Since I would love it if there was a normal festival (does not have to be one celebrarting classical music) that actually played classical music as the background music.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr even picnic music! It is sad that people think of classical as stuffy concert hall music for prideful persons when it\u0027s original use appears to be background music for all sorts of NON-concert hall ACTIVITIES.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you know on this European?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-09T22:22:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2020 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
