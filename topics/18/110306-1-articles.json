It was an asian song (maybe japanese or korean or so), but i cannot remeber the title or at least a part of it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nthe song is about a girl, that dreams of flying a spaceship and therefore studies hard and becomes some sort of engineer or so. In the end she has the chance to take control of a spaceshuttle. at least this is what the video shows ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) i dont speak a single word japanese (or whatever)\n\nI already dig through the forums with every keyword i could imagine, but without success...\n\nDoes anyone know this song/video? Or has anyone any idea how to find this song?\n\nEDIT: some additional information: the video was in pretty good quality (special effects), the actors(also singer??) was definitely asian, the song itself was pretty sure (99.99% ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) in an asian language.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T23:25:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stoani96**"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:41:26Z","Content":"Maybe this one?\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bZkp7q19f0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:48:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe this one?\n\u003E [http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0](https://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0)\n\nI accepted this as inevitable."},{"CreatedByName":"stoani96","CreatedById":71886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:34:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe this one?\n\u003E [http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0](https://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0)\n\nSorry, but this is not the video i was looking for!

Because of that she studies very hard and later on (when she is grown-up) she is some sort of engineer. One of her friends has to go to the mission, but something goes wrong and she has to take over control and land the shuttle safly. After that she is a \u0022hero\u0022 \n\nThis is everything i can remember from the content of the video (visually) and also covers the whole video!\n\nI could swear i have found it here on one of the blogs, but i cannot find this blogpost.... youtube ect. is pretty hard because it is in some asian language and i dont know which exactly. i already tried google translate with several keywords and languages, but without success...."},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:45:22Z","Content":"Jem?\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/k53NGe64RBU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNot asian, though..."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:57:02Z","Content":"This.\n\n![EjzIJ.gif](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/international/EjzIJ.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"stoani96","CreatedById":71886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:00:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Jem?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/k53NGe64RBU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E Not asian, though...\n\nNope, the video I\u0027m looking for ist definatly asian! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBut thanks for the try! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"stoani96","CreatedById":71886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T16:51:54Z","Content":"Hey! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m still looking for this song/video... :/ Any suggestions?"}]}
