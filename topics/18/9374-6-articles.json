I would really like knowing \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E this is a problem all of a sudden, though. Is it because of poor parenting? Maybe. Is it because new technology has made entertainment seem more important than education? Maybe. Is it because they feel the authority is just leading them to a dead end? Maybe. Or is it all of that? Cause and effect - Something\\\u0027s causing a drastic change in how people look at authority, and it needs to be found and dealt with in some way. A lot of people think it\\\u0027s just teens being teens, growing pains. But I doubt it. Did you hear about this kind of stuff before? And why is it happening on such a huge level now? Saying it\\\u0027s just teens being teens just doesn\\\u0027t sit well with me.
