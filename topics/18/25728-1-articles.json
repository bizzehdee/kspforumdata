Pretty nice graphics, and my machine hasn\u0027t realy that much troubles with running it on ultra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem are the FPS drops. Sometimes i get drops to 35 FPS, which is annoying in a fast pace shooter. I\u0027ve been looking at GPU activity and FPS in-game, and i don\u0027t understand why i would have fps drops if my card is only used for 30 - 40%. My CPU is used for 80 - 95 % on 1 core, and 50 - 70 % on the other 3 cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadeon HD 7950 XFX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFX-4170 overclocked from 4.1 to 4.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsrock Extreme3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1330 MHz 8GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my cpu is bottlenecking my GPU, would it be a wise idea to buy a FX-8350? is an 8 core realy worth the price?

An FX-6300 should do that card good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Zambezi Architecture that the 4170 gives performance comparible to a Phenom II no matter how far you OC it. Anything in the Vishera archetecture will be have a sizeable increase in performance. In my opinion i would not go all out on an FX-8350 and just get a FX-6300. they are reasonable in price and should do well for your setup. Yout ram is also at a slow clock speed which cant be helping to situation. Get a FX-6300 and spend the difference on some faster ram, it should work out the bottlenecks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
