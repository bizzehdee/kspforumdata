Go to an airfield and join an aeronautical club where others share the same addiction. Do not rely on internet information ! I do not know whether there is an aeronautically reworked version of the pulsar engine, it seems to be a bike engine ? You cannot use a bike engine to propel an aircraft, sooner or later it will fail during flight because lubrication is not laid out for changing g-effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy knowledge about this is totally outdatet, a long time ago i flew single engine pipers and robins but friends of mine owned and flew micro- and ultralights (max. 450kg TOW). I don\u0027t know what kind of contraption you are doing. Aerodynamically steered or through weight shift ? Do you build it from scratch or is it a kit (i assume so) ? Surely there are recommendations from the kit manufacturer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeight and balance must be observed, stability of the frame, forces of gravity during flight for the fuel and lubricants circulation. Engines usually don\u0027t run long upside down. Also depending on the country you live in certifications and regulations do apply. Germany and France are liberal, Spain totally strict, the US in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually engine and frame are selected all together because engine mount and connections are tightly integrated into the rest to stay below the TOW limit for certification. If it is a one of then talk to your countries aeronautical agency, they will gladly hand out all information you need and help get in contact. That is their job :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, get in contact with other airmen/-women.
