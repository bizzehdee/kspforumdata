The people who find merit in KSP are mostly highly intelligent, interested in science and sometimes at least a bit nerdy.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0This is an obvious consequence of the theme and the steep learning curve of the game and also clearly visible when reading posts or looking at the content that people here create. With this comes also the greatness of this community: Where else can an absolute newbie boast with his first orbit and get complimented and motivated to reach further even by players who by now do a Jool grand tour with nothing but a command seat, 2 solar panels and a can of spam? Where else can new players post questions that have been answered a thousand times and get a friendly, encouraging, helpful\u00A0answer? Where else do you find mods that require a working knowledge of orbital mechanics, mathematics, rocket science and programming to even think of?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is (...got a little side-tracked here...): I would be interested in the personal background of you guys. Of course I know, this is the internet, nobody likes to (or should) give out personal information more than absolutely necessary. All I\u0027m interested in is what is your profession? How closely related is it to the game? If not related at all, why do you KSP?

My work has (unfortunately) nothing to do with space travel or rocket science. When I was 16, my sister gave me Stephen Hawking\u0027s \u0022A brief\u00A0history of time\u0022 and later Bill Bryson\u0027s mind-bending\u00A0\u0022A short history of nearly everything\u0022 for Christmas. Ever since I have been hooked on science, how we came to be, how the solar system was born, etc... The reason I am a manager is that I suck at maths. I would much rather be a scientist (astrophysicist to be exact).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now it\u0027s your turn, I\u0027m looking forward to and appreciate any constructive answers. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T20:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoftware engineer with a physics degree, and a space nerd of long standing.\u00A0 So KSP is about as close to a dream come true for me as it is possible to get.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T20:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, IT guy here.
