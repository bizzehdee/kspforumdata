Earlier in the movie they say that the pods the original 12 were sent out with had slightly more than 10 years of life support. If we assume that the new crew arrives at the water planet just 5 years after all the Lazarus missions landed and they spent 23 years there according to the guy just outside of this crazy time dilation zone. That means 23 extra years have passed on Mann\u0027s planet too. 23\u002B5=28. With pods designed for a bit more than 10 years it\u0027s crazy it lasted that long, of course he reused the source from his robot and CASE also had to last 23 years but the power source of CASE and the other robot are probably the same and I doubt CASE could power a whole pod for living in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fingal","CreatedById":109326,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T00:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see Neil deGrasse Tyson has felt the need to peer review a work of fiction.

In fact, I felt like it\u0027s attempt to treat itself as one ensured that it wouldn\u0027t belong to that club.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know my expectations were probably too high, partially as a result of excited science and science fiction communities and partially because I\u0027m a big Matthew McConaughey (and Nolan) fan. There were simply too many moments of disbelief (yes, let\u0027s eject into a debris field inside a black hole--then let\u0027s count how many thing are seriously whacked about this one single sentence!), which simultaneously lacked any serious point or direction. Then they had the balls to skip over the seriously epic and interesting components of the story--what are these massive stations orbiting Saturn? how is Brandt setting up her colony? when and how did we magically reach back and configure these magical tesseracts, and how did we manage to avoid the obvious causality issues?--as if the previous 2.5 hours were better spent on poorly-constructed character development, the obligatory psychotic scientist plotline (tell me where that led again?), and bemoaning some strange and unsolvable crop issue affecting the entire earth from which an easier solution than elementary biology and crop science is apparently to transport a couple hundred embryos to another galaxy. Sigh...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELest I come off as too picky, please consider the following: most science fiction near-future epics will take one of two approaches: either a technical approach that usually leans on personal suspense and character development, or post-discovery (aliens, revolutionary technologies, etc.) fantasy that is more broad and focused on the development and enlightenment of a culture. These are good formulae, and there\u0027s a lot of room for creativity and direction. Sometimes there are filmmakers who can combine elements of both and/or create something new, but this particular film tried and failed to do any and every one of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPositive points: I\u0027m a softie for well-crafted father-daughter relationships, and this was a good one. The idea of food shortages was a good starting point, if under-developed and ultimately non-sensical. The mechanics of colony exploration and establishment were interesting, as well, if (in the long run) nearly irrelevant to the story they tried to tell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-13T05:39:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2014 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TythosEternal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos and improved word insertion\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TythosEternal","CreatedById":117821,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T07:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease forgive me, Highlad, but I\u0027m going to use your post as a template for my response, because it contains so many of the things I see being repeated in this thread.

There\u0027s also the hibernation equipment, the reliance upon robotic support (which got flipped on its head, when you expected the robots to turn on the astronauts but they turned out to be the most reliable counterparts and teammates in the whole film), and the 2010 reference in which a robot accompanies the main character on the transcendence analogue.
