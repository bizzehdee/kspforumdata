In X-Com, every action you take generate a new number for the result of the next action (or so I think) and therefore if you repeating the same sequences of actions, you get the same result, thus if you want differences results, you need to take different action. So in my case, if I randomly take actions with any of my soldiers, before sending in my hacker attempting that 35% hack, I may luckily find a sequence that gives me a successful result. 35% of my possible action sequences will result in success, while the rest will be failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is now the beginning of my turn, and I have 6 soldiers, all with 2 actions to be used, totalling 18 actions that can be input in anyway. The process of hacking the target itself is an action in the sequence, and will end the sequence there, thus the sequence can be as long as need but with a max of 18 actions (the hack itself as the last action in sequence).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the amount of possible combination I have, and what is the lowest number of sequences I must try out before I hit a successful sequence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DNR : takes this as a long winded lamentation of the RNG in X-com 2 (frigging missed a target at 95% hit chance). Meant to be fun and not really asking for an answer, but I would like to see one if anyone got enough time to waste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I know this doesn\u0027t even account for the the amount of possible locations you can choose for your soldiers on a move action, all of which generate different result for the next roll.
