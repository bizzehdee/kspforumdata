An additional bonus is the skills gained can lead to a variety of careers in different sectors outside the military.

I\u0027m going to write this as if you had just graduated high school. If you want to get into the space industry you may want to look at something used specifically in pursuit of that. Engineering, aerospace systems, physics, being awesome. Put the money in when you join, about 100 bucks a month for your first year or two, to get the full Montgomery GI bill if you plan to get a degree. Schooling while in is subject to your supervisor\u0027s approval, and job always comes first.

Remember, the space industry can be highly competitive. You may want to be the guy who gets in with avionics, networking, datacenter operations, piloting, engineering. Just know that getting almost any job is a matter more of either being the absolutely best person that ever applied for a job, or knowing the right people. While you\u0027re in the Air Force get to know lots and lots of people. Keep in touch with them. You\u0027ll never know when one of them will get hired by SpaceX, knock something out of the park, and be in the position to recommend you to a hiring manager or HR rep.

The Air Force is trying to cut some fat. People will still be able to join but you might see limited openings for certain career fields.
