The main downsides are 1, that to make sure your edits are solid, you have to buy the star (for as little as a dollar, sure) and 2, they gave up on the last update (I think), which would include full editing of moons.

It\u0027s different from Kerbol, to avoid copyright infringement (highly unlikely, right?), because it wouldn\u0027t be fun, and because I couldn\u0027t find a perfect copy.

Do you like it? Edit: According to google, Kerbene is 150 million km from Kerbelle, just about the same distance as Earth.
