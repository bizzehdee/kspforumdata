This revived a question I\u0027ve been asking myself for some time now; does anyone here play Total War games? If so, which one is your favorite and why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those who don\u0027t know, Total War is a real time tactics, turn based strategy game developed by Creative\u00A0Assembly and published by Sega. On the campaign map it plays just like a simplified strategy game such as Civilization, but when one army attacks another, the play enters a real time battle where every unit in the army is controllable and every single man in every unit is modeled and animated. The series ranges from the conquests of Alexander the Great to the Boshin War and Meji Restoration in Japan while converting nearly every historical period inbetween. The\u00A0newest game even expanded into the Warhammer universe, and is the first TW game not based on historical time periods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShare stories and cool screenshots here, or ask about the games if you\u0027re interested in buying one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T03:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222652599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467171414\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pTrevTrevs\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, pTrevTrevs said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~snip~\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES!

Once they all chain-rout I can send my knights out to chase them down and kill/capture them.
