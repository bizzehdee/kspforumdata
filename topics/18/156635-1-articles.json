It\u0027s more of a horrifyingly stupid management story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was working for a semi-major retail chain based in Southern California. They owned a huge distribution center in East Los Angeles that was in a famous state of disrepair. We had recently completed installation of a wireless network in the DC that allowed the forklift drivers to actually receive and update their pick sheets electronically. So, it\u0027s February, it\u0027s raining cats and dogs, and I\u0027m out at lunch, when I get a call that the entire DC network has gone down. My boss was out of town, so I was the chief point of contact. I drive back to the DC and meet one of my network admins, the operations manager, and DC director in the office, and we walk out to the DC to see what is going on. We get out to the main DC office, which is where the UPS (uninterruptible power supply, or battery backup, for those who don\u0027t know) for the entire wireless network resides. It was like a little building within the larger building of the DC. When we get there, I see that there is a huge leak in the roof of the DC directly over the office. It is pouring water on the roof of the office. We go into the office, into the room where the UPS is, and there is water pouring through the roof of the office directly onto the UPS. It is literally standing in two to three inches of water, with water dripping out of the front panel. I turn to the operations manager:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, there\u0027s the problem.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The UPS tripped because there is water pouring all over it!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What do you mean?

IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the DC director is outside the office with my network admin trying to explain to him that the water couldn\u0027t be the problem because there was electrical switchgear on the outside wall of the office that had water dripping down it, and that was fine, so therefore water running all over live electrical gear was not a problem. He was dumbfounded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I gathered everyone in the office and said, \u0022So, this is what is going to happen. I am not going to touch that UPS.

He is going to go into your wet breaker panels on the other side of this wall and figure out how to deenergize the UPS so that you can move it somewhere that it can dry out.

I could tell you stories for days. The CEO was the guy who had started the chain with one store back in the 70s. He had absolutely no business being the CEO of a NYSE-traded company. He micro-managed everything. For example: He would stop at the front desk every day after the UPS and FedEx drop offs. He would gather up all of the packages that were sent overnight or 2-day, anything except ground, and take them to his office. He would call each person those packages were sent to and have them come to his office and read them the riot act, because he believed that there was no reason to ship anything any way other than ground, anything else was an unnecessary expense. This is how the CEO of the company spent his afternoon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Brian, the guy who managed the help desk and the cabling, had to buy this really bizarre connector for splicing fiber optic network cable in a freezer.

He orders it, thinking that he\u0027ll just intercept the package before Dave, the CEO, gets to it. He is unsuccessful. He gets called into Dave\u0027s office, and the conversation goes like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDave: \u0022Why did you feel the need to ship this package 2-day air?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrian: \u0022Well, Dave, I needed this part to fix the cable run in the freezer, and this vendor was the cheapest I could find, and the only shipping option they offered was free 2-day air.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nDave: \u0022No! If 2-day air was the only shipping option then this vendor was not your cheapest option. Because shipping is never free.

Ha! Never happened. He worked six days a week and expected everyone else to as well. (Didn\u0027t happen.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe full story was this: They took the company public back in 1996 (because it had always been Dave\u0027s dream to run a publicly-traded company). When they passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 (You know, the one that made it a crime for corporate officers to knowingly falsify SEC filings, accounting documents, and investor statements.), Dave and the other family members that ran the company suddenly felt a burning desire to take the company private again. But they didn\u0027t have enough money. So they wound up going half-and-half with a private investment group and took the company private in 2011. But the new investors figured out all of the family\u0027s shenanigans, so in January of 2013 they leveraged all of them out of the company and off of the board. Three months after that, Dave dropped dead of a heart attack. Because, as was no news to any of us who had worked there, Dave loved that company more than anything else in the world, even his own wife and kids. In the immortal words of Rupert Giles, \u0022The words \u0027let that be a lesson\u0027 are a tad redundant at this juncture.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I was long gone at that point, they walked me out in January of 2005. Everyone in that company got fired. (Of the six guys I hired there, five of them ended up getting fired. One of them got fired twice in one week.) My boss got fired the summer before because he got into an argument with one of the family members. I saw the writing on the wall at that point and was already looking for another job. His replacement (Mike) was hired the first week in December. First meeting with him, he walks into my office, sits down, and says to me, \u0022I just want you to know that I have someone in mind for this position, and it isn\u0027t you.\u0022 I didn\u0027t really care, I was already moving on. But apparently word may have gotten back to someone in HR, who may have informed him that \u0022I have someone else in mind\u0022 is not a cause for termination in the State of California. So he comes into my office again two days later (which was only the second time I ever laid eyes on him), \u0022So, I think that some of the things I said in our last meeting may have been misconstrued.\u0022 (\u0022Misconstrued\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E) He blows all this smoke up my butt about how he\u0027s going to send me to some ridiculous leadership training and all this crap. I\u0027m still nodding and giving him my best, \u0022You\u0027re boring, can I go back to browsing job sites now?\u0022 look. Christmas comes and goes, I literally don\u0027t see him again. First week in January, I get a call from HR. I shut my computer down, pack my bag (I\u0027d had my office cleaned out for months), and walk down the hall. Jennifer looks at me and says, \u0022Mike told us that he set some specific goals for you back in December that you haven\u0027t met.\u0022 \u0022Nope, never happened.\u0022 Jennifer starts to look a little nervous, like I\u0027m going to get argumentative or something. I reached across the desk and patted her hand, \u0022It\u0027s okay, I\u0027m already looking for another job. Now I can do it full time with unemployment checks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, months later, after I found another job, I\u0027m having lunch with Brian (yes, same Brian from above), and my old boss. Brian has a story. Mike brought his new guy, Logan, in to interview a couple of weeks later. (It turns out that Logan was actually someone I had worked with at a previous company. Small world.) After the interview he walks him around to meet everyone, and they all decide to go out to lunch. Brian says, \u0022Hey, Logan, you can come ride with me.\u0022 So they get in Brian\u0027s truck and head out. As they\u0027re driving, Logan asks, \u0022So, how do you like working here?\u0022 Brian says, \u0022Actually, it\u0027s a %*\u0026amp;#@!^$%# nightmare. Everyone in management is insane. They\u0027re all moronic workaholics with rage issues. Everyone is just walking on eggshells praying they don\u0027t get fired. Nobody gets raises, nobody gets promotions. I\u0027m just here milking paychecks until I get fired, but I\u0027m not too worried because I\u0027ve already got a side business I\u0027m building. If you join on I suggest you do the same.\u0022 (All of which was completely true, but Brian just laid it on all thick and serious.) By the time they got to the restaurant and met everyone else, Logan looked like he was attending a funeral. And, lo and behold, he wound up turning down the job offer! Brian finishes up his story with, \u0022So, to the list of all of Mike\u0027s failures and shortcomings you can add, \u0027Let Brian drive the new guy to lunch.\u0027\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
