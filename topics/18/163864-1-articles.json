But I am serious about the awareness to a threatened species thing. Desert rain frogs are listed as \u0022vulnerable\u0022 due to habitat loss in their very small range around the western coast of South Africa. Thankfully, a stupidly squeaky \u0022defense cry\u0022 is all that it takes for humanity to fall in love with this little guy. Without this video I\u0027m pretty sure that conservation efforts for this frog would be much more limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T03:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a cool frog!
