He packed his phone, toolkit, snacks and laptop into the storage at his feet. He was a mechanic, and hitched rides on his sister\u0027s orbital taxi service to get to the stations and bases he needed to get to. He had built the Red Dart, it\u0027s aforementioned lack of red was due to it being named after his sister\u0027s racing ship, the Red Arrow, which was a nuclear thermal afterburning engine powered 2g pulling monster which had a red paint job, a red engine plume, and red hot radiators. His sister was a quite accomplished racer, having set the record for the Deimos circuit, and won many races around their home planet, Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sat and waited for the three other passengers to pile in, there were one other martian and two earthlings, recognizable due to their short stature, and struggle to move around in one third of earth\u0027s gravity, after a multi-month transfer, at this window, a 5 month semi-hohman transfer, gets you there faster, but takes more fuel than the industry standard 7 month, or maximum efficiency 9 month transfers, they either spent that in microgravity, and struggle due to muscle weakness, or centrifugal gravity, and are adapting to the lack of the coriolis effect. They packed their things away and strapped in, talking as they went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal asked him:\u0022Heins, what\u0027s the ship status?\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Everything\u0027s good for launch, tank\u0027s full, and we\u0027re ready to go down here.\u0022 She thanked Heins and radioed launch control:\u0022Control, this is the Red Dart, on pad three, all systems ready, and we\u0027re waiting for permission to launch.\u0022 They replied:\u0022Red Dart, you got a ten minute launch window, launch anytime.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal started everything up, including her countdown to launch:\u00225, 4\u0022 one of the earthlings tilted his head toward Heins and said:\u0022Your sister\u0027s very ho-\u0022 \u0022Ignition!\u0022-Val mischievously explained while throttling up to 1g of acceleration, which caused us to feel a net 1\u2153g accounting for Mars\u0027 gravity. He suddenly weighed 4 times more than he should, and the earthlings weren\u0027t enjoying it much either, after their time in 0g or low centrifugal gravity. She kept it there, before throttling back to the standard 1g of total acceleration (accounting for Mars\u0027 gravity). They continued up to orbit on mostly 1g the entire way, his sister was the only one able to talk well in the high gravity, she could even drink some water on the way up, presumably just to brag about her g tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe got into orbit and plotted a rendezvous with a small centrifugal station in high martian orbit, she told everyone to drink their nausea pills for the coriolis effect of the station, everyone drank their\u0027s except for the one other martian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-06T12:22:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2021 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EReason for edit: Thought I made a mistake, then noticed I hadn\u0026#039;t.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-05T10:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart 1, continued:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVal easily got a rendezvous with a short \u2153g burn, and they coasted towards the station nicknamed Rosy for the next 30 minutes. Heins mostly looked out of his window, the only thing separating him from the vacuum of space was two sheets of aluminum, or in his window\u0027s case, bulletproof glass, with a layer of water ice, acting as a radiation insulator, sandwiched between them. They had their solar panels and antennas folded out since getting into orbit. The station steadily grew larger in front of them and Val got them stationary relative to it with a short retrograde burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was light grey with red and orange stripes, it was shaped like old car steering wheel with a large spoke running across its diameter, coated in solar panels, and some radiators. The station radioed them and said they had ended up on the side where the dock was taken, and Val, instead of flying around the ring, threw them through the gaps between the wheel\u0027s two spokes. Heins was suitably quite angry at his sister\u0027s recklessness. She used short bursts of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to match its rotation and docked perfectly, she had done this type of maneuver almost a hundred times on many flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeins confirmed the dock was safe to cross, they opened the door and clambered into a decently sized elevator which carried them into the station\u0027s centrifugal gravity, and its resulting dizziness. Heins and Val had been in the coriolis effect\u0027s grasp many times before, and could function fairly well from the beginning, the two earthlings already knew that they would struggle. As the elevator came to rest in the station\u0027s comfy \u2153g, the martian said: \u0022See, I don\u0027t need no nausea pills.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe elevator doors slid open, the martian turned towards the outside, and his lunch proceeded to hastily empty itself into a nearby trash can, which was almost certainly the reason why they put a trash can there in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal said:\u0022I gotta go pick up some hazardous materials haulers and land them on Mars, I\u0027ll pick you up on the way back in about 90 minutes.\u0022 Heins waved at his sister as she closed the elevator doors and headed back to the red dart. He walked down the outermost floor to meet with Johnson, the station manager and go fix the CO2 scrubber that has lost efficiency, it was one of eight scrubbers on the 50 meter diameter station. On his way he spotted a news broadcast with the title:\u0022Martian independence negotiations break down, tensions rising.\u0022 He was somewhat afraid of the possible cold war between the two planets, though it wasn\u0027t that bad yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe met Johnson and asked why she didn\u0027t have one of the station\u0027s three engineers fix the scrubber, she replied:\u0022Two of \u0027em got government contracts, on Phobos, they still work here every now and then, but they\u0027re not here this week. The other one hurt her arm in a elevator examination, gonna be out for 3 days while they make sure she\u0027s okay.\u0022 Heins went to the broken scrubber, removed the grill over it, and inspected it, he didn\u0027t see anything wrong. He got out his phone and used its thermal camera to inspect it, and saw a hotspot on the lithium hydroxide canister baking system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scrubbers work by absorbing CO2 with lithium hydroxide canisters, and then they bake the CO2 out, compress it, and later vent it, they have two canisters so that there is always one absorbing CO2 while they bake the other one. They use this mechanism because it is cheaper than a proper oxygen reclamation system. He took a screwdriver and removed the panel, as he expected, there was a minor short, not enough to melt the fuse, but enough to waste power. He switched the scrubber off, fixed the short, and it work just like normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJohnson paid him for fixing it and he went to a cafe for some drinks, Val had 40 minutes before she got back. On the way he passed a bar, where a drunken earthling struggled to walk, due to the astonishingly hazardous combination of intoxication, low gravity, and the coriolis effect. He entered the cafe, which had padded white walls, like everywhere on the station, but also, false wooden floors and counters, some glass tables where people talked, and some large screens on the walls, which were standing in for windows, while smaller screens displayed newsfeeds and sporting events. They were playing music, Heins recognized the song: James Cotton\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/GZXMWklGf84\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe creeper\u003C/a\u003E, martian music consisted mostly of blues with the occasional bit of rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe ordered a soda and began drinking just as Val messaged him that she had arrived, he finished his soda and met her, as well as three earthlings, the crew of the hazmat hauler, they went back to the Dart and undocked, they deorbited safely and reentry and landing went flawlessly, on the ground, their landing pad docked a tranfer tunnel and they disembarked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore they returned home, he asked one of the haulers what they were transporting, he replied:\u002250 tons of medium grade Plutonium to Phobos.\u0022 Heins took a couple of seconds to verify that his ears were working right. He replied:\u0022Who on the Lord\u0027s red Mars needs that much Plutonium?!\u0022 \u0022The government is workin\u0027 on something there, must be a reactor or an engine or somethin\u0027.\u0022 Heins was still very confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Author\u0027s note, I really enjoyed making this, I have an idea for where this series should go, but the next part is a bit hard to figure out, for spoiler laden reasons.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-06T12:19:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2021 12:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EParagraphing\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-05T12:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a bit of background info, not the next \u0022chapter\u0022.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLore intermission 1:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe martian economy is stable and growing in this series, here\u0027s how it got there:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2027: first humans on mars\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2040: colony is 80% self sufficient, most of its money is coming from scientific research, private companies/governments giving donations, and tourism\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2042: first martians are successfully born, and are stable.

The end result of all its features was a striking similarity to an old earth based windmill, which is where it got its somewhat funny name from. It had a job carrying valuable cargo from earth to Mars, fragile stuff like non lab grown meat, cheese, wine made from actual grapes, wood, and pets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts valuable cargo and three of its six crew members had been landed by a large pressurized cargo lander the previous day, and the Red Dart was docking with the Don Quixote to lift the last three crew members off it and land them on Mars where they would wait a month for the maximum efficiency Hohmann transfer back to earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA woman speaking perfect English with a thick Russian accent guided them in for docking on one of the two ports, the rings were stationary, and everything except the life support, comms, and essentials for docking and leaving was turned off, they were running on battery power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Val was busy docking, the Russian, named Natalya said:\u0022Docking systems spotted another object with no location beacon heading towards us at 172 meters a second relative velocity, four kilometers out, it is projecting a near miss, we\u0027re trying to contact it.\u0022 Val calmly responded:\u0022Roger, I should be docked by the time it flies by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe docked and Heins confirmed it was safe to open, as he was doing this, he pondered the minuscule probability of a random piece of debris floating by their ship at that speed and nearly missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as they opened the docking hatch, and just before he could mention the oddness of this encounter, the piece of debris ignited its engine and the Don Quixote was hit by a hail of nuts and bolts, a few of which made holes in the hull, and one injured a crewmate of the Don Quixote.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNatalya shouted what Heins presumed were Russian profanities before the ship contacted them and said,\u0022This is the Blackadder, the Don Quixote must tranfer all cargo to us or we shall open fire!\u0022 Natalya responded,\u0022We don\u0027t have our cargo anymore, it was landed yesterday!\u0022 The Blackadder started punching holes in the Quixote, and approaching the other docking port.

Val said, \u0022Heins, make some swiss cheese!\u0022 The guns fired a barrage of bullets at it, and she could feel the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E going mad to keep them stable.

This made her suspicious, the ship contacted her and asked why a ship as small as her\u0027s was sent to them, she said it was to guard against another pirate attack while someone came to get them. She sent a directed message to the Rocinante class ship, named The Huntress, that was coming to pick the crew up, to warn them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Draper was probably the closest thing space had ever had to a soldier, he was friendly, but strict, and was always a little angry. His father came from earth, he was a soldier who had retired after he was disabled from the waist down, he came to Mars because he had some cousins here, and because the low gravity allowed his barely functioning legs to walk, albeit with a cane. Bob was born on Mars, and his father trained him to shoot, by the time he joined the navy, he was probably the most experienced zero and low g soldier in the solar system. The crew of the Huntress nicknamed him \u0022the marines\u0022 because calling him a single marine would be an understatement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob \u0022the marines\u0022 stood, along with two other crewmates, in the airlock of The Huntress, the pilot had docked with the Kingpin, and they were waiting for it to finish cycling. They were wearing bulletproof MCN eva suits, with their guns ready, the Kingpin had lost its pressurization, and the eight crew members were wearing eva suits. The Red Arrow had warned them that this may be a trap, so they came prepared. The airlock screen went green, indicating it was done, he contacted the crew on their eva comms and prepared to exit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey opened the hatch, and he saw the crew, of only four, float in front of him. That was a surprise, but it was massively overshadowed by the fact they had guns. The apparent leader said, in an accent you\u0027d usually only hear in gangster movies, \u0022Are we gonna do this peacefully, o\u0027 do we have to fight for yo\u0027 ship\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of them fired a silent warning shot at the wall, and span backwards with about as much dignity as a brick. The others seemingly agreed that this ment war, and shot at him and his crew. He threw an emp grenade towards the shooters before the others tried to shoot back, this stopped the attackers\u0027 life support, and more importantly, caused the electric triggers on their guns to reboot. They quickly gathered up the, now disarmed, pirates, with their comms disabled, and brought them into The Huntress.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey told the crew of the Red Arrow that they safely gathered up the pirates, a fact the Arrow\u0027s crew seemed disappointed to hear. They put them into the holding cells on the ship, and Bob interrogated the leader. After confirming, with both the pirate\u0027s claims and an eva drone inspection of the Kingpin, that there was nobody else on the ship, he asked the pirate other things.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt turned out the Red Arrow\u0027s crew\u0027s speculation was correct, and this was, in fact, the wreckage of the Don Quixote, used as bait to lure in a Rocinante class. The pirates wanted to take the ship and use it to fight off earth ships, in order to get earth to \u0022leave Mars alone!\u0022 They had failed, but it was still a threat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile he was interrogating them, the pilot, a red haired woman named Alex, came to show him a news broadcast from earth.

They did, however, put heavy tariffs on Mars, start to work with the MCN, and start building a skeleton force of earth ships at private construction docks around Mars, with volunteering earthlings as the crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThings on Mars were rough, the martians were angry about earthling taxes, tariffs, and control, the earthlings were terrified to Pluto of terrorism and martians, and the pirates were ashamed and surrendered, well, the martians at least, the earthlings started going absolutely pirate potty. Piracy increased by at least twofold, almost all of it was earthlings attacking martian ships and stations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt least martian colony architecture made riots close to impossible, the bases are made of 3d printed or assembled habs joined together by partly or fully submerged tunnels, the closest thing most of Mars had to a shopping mall was a load of small shops next to tunnels. The best any angry people looking for a riot would be able to do, would look like a bunch of disgraced customers standing in line to file a complaint with a phone store.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately that caused people to find other ways to release their rage on the other side.

She had blasts shooting down ships, her way of fighting ships was massively different from that of a Rocinante class, it was like a space borne tank, coming in at a reasonable pace and using its superior firepower and armor to fight or guard ships. The Arrow came in like a jet fighter, it was small enough that ships would struggle to detect it with its transponder off, and then it shot itself around the battlefield leaving a trail of pdc fire, missiles and general annihilation in its wake.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer brother, Heins, was busy as a MCN mechanic and as the Red Arrow\u0027s gunner.

Two seconds later its single working torpedo launcher malfunctioned and exploded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 minutes ago it had stopped in front of one of the station\u0027s docking ports, stopping craft from docking there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 minutes ago a small on orbit shuttle, filled with 5 times more people than it was designed for, nearly all of them from the station, narrowly escaped from the hail of pdc fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now, the Red Arrow was screaming in towards the station at a hundred meters a second. They shot past the Asimov and fired a giant emp blast that crippled all four of its left pdcs, they flew through the centre of the station and Val did a 2g burn to get them to a stop. From the other side of the station they shot a missile which went back towards the Asimov and broke one of its forward heavy artillery guns, as well as damaging its command centre.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVal put them on a diagonal trajectory around the edge of Rosy, they could feel the shots pounding on the outside of the Arrow, and some of the sound came through their acceleration seats and allowed them to hear the shots in their eva suits. A bullet flew quietly through the Arrow and made a hole. No air was in the ship, so it didn\u0027t matter. For a few seconds, the shots halted, as the station was between them, when it wasn\u0027t, Heins shot a missile through the newly formed pdc blindspot and made a large hole in one of the Asimov\u0027s pressurized fuel tanks, forcing it into a slow roll.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVal stopped the Arrow and put it onto a new trajectory passing over the Asimov. About halfway to it, a new blip appeared on the battlefield radar, along with a smaller, faster and closer blip. The small blip tore through the Asimov\u0027s engines, they exploded in what the external camera registered as a flash. The Normandy had arrived, bringing torpedoes, armor, and salvation for the station.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Arrow shot down some of the pdcs on the \u0022top\u0022 of the Asimov, its slow spin brought the next line of pdcs to them. A recently fired torpedo from the Normandy exploded as the Asimov\u0027s pdcs shot it down. The Red Arrow shot half of those new pdcs down with emp blasts and its own cannons. On the other side of Rosy station, people were piling into the Normandy, carrying the injured with them and whatever things they needed to salvage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Arrow came to a stop and then shot itself between the lone spoke and the edge of the heavily scarred and bullet wounded wheel, it launched a missile which broke into the Asimov\u0027s unpressurized command centre, the crew were vaguely visible on the exterior camera feed. The inhabitants of Rosy station continued climbing through the emergency access ladders, as the elevator would not be able to ferry enough of them, to the Normandy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter everyone was on the ship, at least, everyone who wasn\u0027t dead, the refugees and Johnson, the manager, agreed that the Normandy could undock, and that no one was left on Rosy. They undocked and burned at full throttle away from the station, the sardine can crowd wailed and struggled as Newton punished them for accelerating. A couple of seconds later, they floated around as Newton\u0027s laws were appeased with the gift of constant velocity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the Red Arrow safely drifted away from the station at fifty meters a second, Val and Heins were both relieved that the tragic battle was finally over. Val broke the silence by saying over their ship comms, \u0022Good shooting back there.\u0022 \u0022Good flying,\u0022 Heins replied, and they fell back into the eerie silence of sadness, fear, and a tinge of rage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe martian reporter stated, her face struggling to hide the fear beneath, \u0022Of the three hundred and eleven people on Rosy station when the attack occurred, a total of seventy four of them are dead, and a further one hundred and forty two are injured. The quick actions of the crew of the Normandy and the Red Arrow saved the station from even more casualties from the earthling warship, HMS Asimov. The earthling space command have blamed this on rogue navy soldiers, but the Martian intelligence agency has found an encrypted broadcast from earth to Mars giving the order to attack the station. Now we go to the president, who is giving a speech on this matter.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe broadcast cut to the president, who said, \u0022For a long time, we have lived in fear of having to fight in space, we had been designing the Rocinante class long before the attack on the Don Quixote. I personally had always dreaded the day it would be necessary. That day has came and went, and now, after the tragic massacre of Rosy station, we must reevaluate our alliances, we must ensure that this never, ever happens again, we must punish those who caused this tragedy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And we must declare war!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-18T10:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve removed the contents of this post due to making up my mind, I was going to ask something for what will happen next, but I\u0027ve made up my mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso: 5257 words!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-19T08:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2021 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIndecision is no more!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-22T18:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhhh, good stuff.

After the first ships were destroyed, some of the others sensibly decided to surrender, decreasing the losses on both sides.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeins and Val had been contacted for a mission on a new warship to Earth. Heins had been working on a new ship design which he started officially building on a MCN station. This ship would act as a carrier for the Arrow, it would have some stealth systems which would allow it to hide itself from most forms of ship based radar and laser range finders, but not optical detection. It would allow them to survive on long missions with the Arrow, with decent habitation space, food, and most importantly, a toilet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere were already negotiations between earth and Mars, mostly around independence, though earth was not intent on granting Mars full independence. Heins was working on the new stealth carrier ship, which they had decided to call The Red October. A couple of weeks on a orbital construction station run by the MCN later, and they had finished it. It reminded both Heins and Val of the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/gGZNk-yBpR0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMorrigan class\u003C/a\u003E ship from the expanse. It had a cylindrical pressure vessel, encased in a metal shell which both gave it its distinctive shape, as well as reflecting radar signals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA couple of days later, they docked the Arrow to inside of the October\u0027s carrier bay (or as they call it: its belly) and closed the doors over it. Thereafter they undocked the Red October, with the Arrow inside, and flew it to a ship around Phobos. This ship they were rendezvousing with was the result of the secret project around Phobos. It was the biggest, fastest and most dangerous space-warship, let alone spaceship ever built.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs they approached the Dreadnought, it grew from something that looked like a thorn in Phobos\u0027 side, into a gigantic thirty meter diameter by seventy meter long behemoth of a cylinder. At the back, a cluster of twelve twenty-meter long combustion boosters surrounded it, ready to push it far enough from Mars that its one hundred-thousand-second specific impulse drive won\u0027t give every piece of electronics on and around Mars a heart attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey entered a ten meter high bay in the centre of the Dreadnought, and docked inside of it, between a pair of Rocinante classes. They exited the October and entered into the first of four floors, the 4 meter high engineering floor, containing a group of ten separate airlocks, more than one of which big enough to fit the entire Red Arrow through, along with mech suits, work areas, paint rooms, and a 3d printer so big that it probably could print Val\u0027s hab.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey went through into the next floor, containing the 2.5 meter high (all the other floors are that high too) command sector, along with the armory, jail, and docking/airlock port, designed for the edge case they wanted to board someone. After that they entered the preposterously spacious habitation section, containing a cafeteria that would dwarf most restaurant complexes on Mars, a community area the size of a medium sized tennis court, along with some laboratories for if research needs to be done.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen they found their cabins, in the habitation floor, and put their bags with clothes, tools and personal amenities in their neighboring cabins. Just before they could start to unpack, the captain told everyone on the ship to prepare for the boosters igniting and them undocking in a few minutes, and called a few people, including Val and Heins, up to the command centre.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey went up to the deck using the same ladder they came up with, in zero g, they could coast up faster than the elevator could carry them. Captain Allonzo Savage was of average martian height, but of slightly above average width, he had dark skin and grey hair, and a preposterously deep voice. The end result of these features was someone who was both friendly and very intimidating at the same time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe greeted them and, once others had arrived, briefed everyone on the basics of the mission, as well as how to attack the earth. He used a large screen to video call a news broadcast, showing and announcing the launch of the first Red Dwarf class warship, the Dreadnought. When it was almost time to launch, they started a 1 minute countdown, mainly so that everything that would become a hazard when gravity was applied could be safely stowed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00225,\u0022 he said and the docking clamps holding it tightly to Phobos released, \u00224... 3... 2... 1.. Ignition\u0022 he said, and 0.4g gravity just like on Mars embraced the Dreadnought as its side boosters pushed it away from Mars\u0027 largest moon, and started raising its apoapsis to the edge of Mars\u0027 gravity well. After the apoapsis was sufficiently high, the booster engines cut out, with fuel left for other non main drive maneuvers. They coasted for a couple of mildly boring hours, until they started deploying the main drive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Dreadnought was powered by a Medusa drive, a cousin of the old Orion drive concept. It functions by expanding a large hemispherical sail in front of the ship, which, alongside its fuel, takes up the front forty meters of the ship, then exploding a nuclear bomb inside that sail, which pulls you along, leaving a giant wake of radiation of all forms.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sail folded out in front of the ship, using small rocket engines to pull it out, the winches holding it in place tightened when it was expanded. Then, after a brief countdown, a nuke was hurled into the centre of it, and at the exact right time, exploded. The blast shot the sail forward, the winches acted like rubber bands, only much finer tuned. They made the acceleration as constant as they could, and a few seconds later, another bomb exploded, pulling the Dreadnought valiantly along on its 0.4g charge to earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery time it pulsed, a new sun appeared and vanished in the martian sky. It was the beating war drums of Mars attacking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Author\u0027s note: if this was a tv show, this would be the season 2 premiere.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T12:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Red Arrow:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227sxC6wo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7sxC6wo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225CJlzD4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5CJlzD4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aN0XbTH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aN0XbTH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy laptop isn\u0027t well, I think I may have broken it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-27T12:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2021 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-29T07:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, I recently edited the continuation of chapter 3 to add some background to Bob, and to make his reaction to the asteroid dropping fit his character a little better.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-30T10:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Something a little different this time.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 7: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/0ZoSYsNADtY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Blue Danube\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Tina Grayson was no stranger to zero gravity, as the head of the US space force she was in and out of gravity in nearly equal parts, she had her hair in a bun to minimize the occasional annoyance of hair floating into her eyes. She was on her way to a rotating station in low earth orbit for a international military meeting about the Martian battlecruiser barreling in towards the Earth in what appeared to be a nuclear bomb powered partial brachistochrone trajectory at 0.4g.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Orion, a small Dreamchaser mk3 spaceplane operated by Pan-Astra spacelines, was carrying her to the aforementioned meeting between multiple military generals, ship and station captains, and even a few heads of state. She had seen a clip from 2001 a space odyssey, and had recognized the remarkable similarity between this situation and the clip. She played the blue danube on her headphones and let a pen drift beside her to complete the scene.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich was immediately destroyed as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters crackled and the spaceplane began to slowly spin in tandem with the station, sending the pen gliding towards the wall. She caught it with one hand and put it into her pocket. The big spaceplane coasted slowly into the rectangular docking bay in the center of the station, and calmly maneuvered itself onto a docking bay with enough precision to almost make you forget how many tons it weighed, almost.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe station verified that the seal was good and a hatch in what usually would be the ceiling dinged and slid open to the side with the slight hiss of retracting pistons. She undid her seatbelt, put her laptop bag on her back like a backpack and pushed herself off the half seat half acceleration couch. She coasted at a reasonable velocity to the hatch, entered the elevator, and rode down towards the edge of Memorial station. As she traveled gravity slowly increased, until the elevator\u0027s front doors slid open and she was feeling a comfy 0.75g.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe made her way to the meeting room, which had real wood floors, a few glowing white ceiling lights, and a large high resolution wall display that showed the view outside. The long rectangular table in the centre was made of wood surrounding a large screen which was displaying all sorts of information in a black and dark blue color scheme.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe sat at one corner and looked over everyone else who was there, at a glance, she could recognize Leonid Petrov, head of the Russian space program and one of the leading strategists in space warfare, the Chinese president had a translator bud in his ear, not that he needed one, Alex Peterson, head of Luna, and lastly, someone she didn\u0027t expect, chief engineer Simone Kampf of Tycho station. After giving it some thought, Tina knew she shouldn\u0027t have been surprised, they were going to need a load of warships, and Tycho was the biggest construction station in Luna\u0027s, no, Earth\u0027s sphere of influence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore people piled in, until every seat was filled, she started talking, asking questions and determining strategies. She began with Simone, asking, \u0022How many ships can we build in the two weeks before it arrives?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We can build either five Gagarin classes or about eleven Shepards, and that\u0027s if we have everyone doing overtime in every construction dock in Tycho.\u0022 Simone answered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What about using other stations too?\u0022 Tina asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Then we could probably, if everything that is or can be a dock is used, make ten Gagarins or about twenty five Shepards,\u0022 Simone replied and then continued, \u0022but our main problem is redesigning the ships.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTina was surprised and asked, \u0022Why must we do that?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022EMPs, the rusties built EMPs into their ships, we didn\u0027t anticipate that, a single blast can knock out a whole row of pdcs on a Gagarin class. We need shielding, also, the nukes in the big battleship they\u0027re sending are the mothers of all EMPs, they could give Earth a radiation belt to match Jupiter\u0027s in a couple of minutes with the drive on.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTina was slightly annoyed by the derogatory term \u0022rusties\u0022 for martians, but to be fair they did call terrans \u0022earthlings\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Okay, so, with that included, how many can we build?\u0022 Tina asked, slightly annoyed by how long the engineer was taking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Ten Gagarins or twenty five Shepards, I factored it in already.\u0022 Simone replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Thank you.\u0022 Tina said semi-sarcastically, then she asked the room, \u0022What\u0027s our battle plan?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I think our first target is the drive, to strand the little boat around Earth.\u0022 The British navy general suggested.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Nyet, drive\u0027s nuke proof,\u0022 Leonid stated in a thick Russian accent, \u0022even if torpedo gets past pdc network, nothing happen.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Also, they\u0027ll probably fold it back in when they arrive, and with that many nukes, I\u0027ll be surprised if they even need pdcs.\u0022 Alex, head of Luna, interjected before continuing, \u0022Which brings me to another question, what\u0027s that bucket even armed with? Seriously, we\u0027re trying to take down a giant warship without knowing it\u0027s armaments!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve been working on that,\u0022 The head of the CIA said, \u0022from what we\u0027ve seen, at least a hundred torpedoes, a decent pdc network, and some other unidentified weapons on the side, best guess, high velocity cannons of some kind.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So, how on Earth do we crack it? You\u0027re making it sound like trying to blow up Jupiter with a toothpick!\u0022 Tina snapped.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, we have one idea, their pdc network has a small gap in the front, can\u0027t put guns on the part that folds open, I guess, and they only have six torpedo tubes. We can get shelter in the blindspot if we need to, but I can\u0027t really see the need. Our main advantage is our bigger fleet, 10 or 25 against one..\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So we swarm them, and throw everything we got at the tubes, and then get to work on the pdcs. This sounds like a suicide mission already.\u0022 Tina finished.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well...\u0022 both Simone and John, the space force head of engineering, said at the same time. Simone pointed to John, signaling he could take this one, \u0022We have an idea, we build a load of weaponized drone ships, park some crewed ships where the delay is reasonable and attack with drones only until they have few enough weapons for us to board them.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022And where exactly do we get these drones?\u0022 Tina queried.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Build \u0027em\u0022 Simone said, \u0022Unmanned is a load easier than manned, all we need to do is strap engines, guns and armor to a chip and let it float. Tycho has something like a hundred different drones for moving ships and cargo around, in two weeks, thank goodness they have to coast a bit and can\u0027t do a proper bacistrocome trajectory, we could have them all ready go into war, plus a few which we could build. It would be ten times more effective than building crewed ships, and we don\u0027t need to lose as many people.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey had a plan, and it could work. They continued planning and strategizing. Then they set their plan in motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-30T11:42:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2021 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMinor corrections, many of them.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-31T10:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, the exams start Tuesday, so no new chapters for a while probably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
