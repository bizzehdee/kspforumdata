He has an undeniable style and although this is a Sci fi movie set in the real world Ridley will be Ridley. So the style is future NASA but it\u0027s Sykes by Ridley Scott. When it comes to the Hermes they did take quite a few liberties but with the exception of the book saying \u0022the Hermes was an enormous ship\u0022 Andy Weir didn\u0027t exactly go in to detail that much. The engines could still be nuclear but the ship and the habitation areas are as large as the ISS so they would need solar panels that big including that much power to maintain a nuclear reactor. Look at the movies they made for the constellation missions those solar panels are huge."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T18:43:01Z","Content":"I thought Hermes engines are ions?

And, this is why hard sci-fi films are so rare. Yes, it can be done, but in 99% of cases is going to be so terribly dry that nobody is interested in watching through 3 hours of boredom. So, they spruce it up a bit. And you get a hit film that gets tons of new people interested in science. But the people already interested in science, start getting infuriated.\n\nFrankly, I\u0027m just happy there\u0027s a film or two out there encouraging the public to look at the sky with the stereotypical wonder that civilization so desperately needs.

Even if it would take a dozen buttons to push and menu\u0027s to confirm there is a possibility somebody would accidentally activate it. Or what about malcontent, an outside hack, a bug/virus or simply an electrical failure? By building in physical limitations you can completely avoid those scenario\u0027s. Look at the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. They do NOT have an off switch. They can be put into a sleep mode but never be turned off. This too is a safety feature. Even the best protected button can accidentally be pushed.

I felt they tried to shift focus away from the technical nature of the book but then never really developed (or even met what I thought should have been the standard) the characters. I had friends leaving this movie thinking Watney was just pompous and cocky\u0027 date=\u0027 if you read the book you would know there is much more to it than that! [/quote\u0027]\n\u003E They were watching a different film than the one I saw then. Cocky? Maybe a little but he\u0027s an astronaut for goodness sake - rampant self belief goes with the job. And he didn\u0027t come across as at all pompous to me. Actually, I thought the film did a great job with the supporting cast - if there was one complaint I had about the book its that the NASA characters (and the rest of the Hermes crew for that matter) came across as a bit two-dimensional.

Both airlock doors open inward. When the airlock is pressurized, the force holding the outer door closed is far greater than what the door actuator can overcome. Likewise when the airlock is depressurized, the inner door is held shut by the air pressure in the ship. You need to close the inner door and depressurize the airlock before you can open the outer door, or close the outer door and pressurize the airlock before you can open the inner door. It\u0027s a simple failure-safe physical method of preventing both airlock doors from being open at the same time. Overriding this would require the actuators that open the doors to be strong enough to overcome the force of the ship\u0027s air pressure on the door, but the designers of the ship would have no reason to do that, especially as it would make the ship less safe if a software failure could open both doors and depressurize it.\n\u003E \n\u003E"}]}
