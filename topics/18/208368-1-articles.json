They do pretty good complete systems and can help you design the setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the topic, it seems you\u0027re looking to completely disconnect from the grid, correct? There are several different battery options available to you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELead acid\u003C/strong\u003E: Big and heavy, but that doesn\u0027t matter much in a static system. Relatively cheap, but this kind of battery doesn\u0027t have many duty cycles (they\u0027ll need replacing much sooner than other technologies). Make sure you have enough batteries so that you\u0027re never going to discharge below 50% and they should last a while.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELithium ion\u003C/strong\u003E: Very popular nowadays. The smallest and lightest option, very long service life (many charge cycles)\u00A0but also likely to be the most expensive in the short term. Requires an advanced battery management system to prevent damage from overcharging or over-discharging. Note that although these are more expensive to buy than lead acid, they can actually work out cheaper in the long term because they last that much longer.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are the two most common choices, but there are some unconventional options that might be worth it if you can get them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENickel metal hydride\u003C/strong\u003E. These are almost impossible to get in the kind of sizes you will be looking for. But if you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0get them, they will last a long time and likely work out cheaper than Lithium ion.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENickel iron.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ENow these are pretty special. They are big, heavy and quite hard to get, but these batteries will last longer than your house. There are electric cars that used these batteries 120 years ago and the original batteries are still in \u003Cem\u003Eperfect working order.\u003C/em\u003E Unlike any other battery chemistry that I know of, they can be abused through overcharging, complete discharging, freezing... you can overcharge them to the extent that all the electrolyte boils away, refill and you\u0027re good to go. You can deep-discharge to 0%, leave them out in the winter and let them freeze solid, bring them in, thaw them out, charge them, and they\u0027ll be fine. I certainly wouldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Erecommend\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0doing any of this, but it does give some idea of how hardy they are. They need a little maintenance in the form of topping up the electrolyte from time to time, but they\u0027re not likely to take any serious damage if you forget once in a while. They have no known limit in the number of charge cycles. I can\u0027t think of anything better for a stationary off-grid system.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe angle of the solar array is different for on-grid and off-grid solutions. If you are actually going off grid, they should be angled for optimum power in the \u003Cem\u003Ewinter\u003C/em\u003E. This will give you less total power throughout the year than one optimised for the grid, but it\u0027s in the winter when you really need to chase the photons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T19:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy not use LiFePO4 batteries. i think they are ideal for power wall scenarios, and dont explode as much as lithium ion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-27T19:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2022 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-28T05:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224138342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653679006\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy not use LiFePO4 batteries. i think they are ideal for power wall scenarios, and dont explode as much as lithium ion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, lithium iron phosphate batteries are good.

It\u0027ll probably be autumn until it goes into production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI opted for bifacial panels (~10 kwp), monophasic inverters, chargers, system\u00A0 monitoring of a high price sector, 51.2V ~28kwh LiFePO4 battery (LFP from now on, diy), and as a future option charging of a small electric car. This isn\u0027t cheap (~22keuro when ordered in february, more today), allthough I am doing it myself so only little extra cost, mainly for the bureaucratic things. DC isn\u0027t rocket science, if I may say so \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E The layout is redundant in terms of component failure, otherwise it could be much cheaper. I may join a neighbourhood project in the future, should such a thing ever come into existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most important thing before starting over is to do a thorough review of your necessities, list up all the consumers, the potential your roof/patio cover/garage/whatever has in store in terms of area, azimuth, inclination, geographic setting, shading, prevailing weather and climate. You can\u0027t of course go offgrid with solar alone at 70\u00B0N because winter and cold. You can easily go off grid with solar alone in South Africa (?) if you\u0027re not under a constant cloud of a prevailing wind system ;-), have a well insulated and air-tight house, use a heat pump for heating/cooling and a ventilation system with heat exchanger and recuperation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever technology and how much of it you choose as a storage depends. When using lithium, I\u0027d recommend LFP because they do not (easily) suffer from \u0022thermal runaway\u0022 like some othe Li-Ion tech.\u00A0 They are temperature sensitive, but have a high round-trip efficiency and needs only very little care, mostly adjusting and monitoring settings and charge states. When going for Lead-acid, have a look at \u0022traction batteries\u0022 (OPzS). Leave Gel, AGM and starter batteries alone. All lead acid is environmentally unfriendly and needs quite some love and monitoring, but is extremely sturdy and \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E also last a long time. But they can easily be destroyed in a short time when discharged deeply or overcharged to a high degree. Also, do not nuy batteries from storage, have yours made for you on demand, by a battery make not on the other side of planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLTO is another upcoming lithium technology. NiFe (as said Nickel Iron, good old Edison battery) have a terribly efficiency, but can last longer than a human lifetime. They are very expensive, if available at all. Oth, they can be discharged until they switch polarity. They only need little brewery every now and then, refill water or change the electrolyte.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is more upcoming technology, like sodium batteries, but for a beginner it is probably best to go with the main stream and use either LFP or OPzS. When they die in 20 years or so things may look different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou asked for a dvice, but this is far too general. A lot of things play a role, besides some electricity which can potentially kill and a high component value which could probably go up in smoke, there may be regulations, scarcity of material these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion: do you diy or hire an installer ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you thought of a system to just get over the grid failures instead of going completely off ? Because off is off, usually utility companies do not allow such systems to be connected to the rgid because of multiple failure modes they can introduce. For a mere UPS like system with a set of panels and a battery/inverter combination to get over the failures you will need an installer and proper documentation, but it may be much cheaper than your own power plant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-02T14:54:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2022 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pixophir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-02T19:18:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224140436\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221654172774\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maria Sirona\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Maria Sirona said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSA?

But let me comment, \u0027sheer spite\u0027 alone might not be the best criteria. As said, we\u0027re talking about a lot of money, and a constant obligation to maintain and repair things. In principle a photovoltaik installation runs or doesn\u0027t. If it does, fine.\u00A0 If not and you don\u0027t know where to look you become dependent on installers. There are also details to observe, and things to maintan, cables, connections, batteries to monitor, and components might need replacement in a few years, etc. That\u0027ll all cost your time if you DIY or your money if you must call an installer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink it over, also alternatives like a solar powered UPS, or a setup that allows you to feed into the grid, with compensation or without, if that exists over there. I read SA is actually pushing small pv installations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-14T14:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224144689\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655194839\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212417\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyperspace Industries\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Hyperspace Industries said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwants to just stop paying eskom (the electricity provider) out of sheer spite\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan be done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill be expensive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturn on investment often measured in decades and you are likely to be \u0027upside down\u0027 forever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re getting good technical advice above - but if I can offer my $.02: if you can afford it, spend some of that on a lawyer to inform you of the regulatory impact of the choice / decision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you, I know nothing about SA law, but I have heard of jurisdictions that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Erequire\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E homes to be hooked up to the grid where available.\u00A0 In many places the \u0027sell back to the provider\u0027 isn\u0027t optional (it\u0027s required) and the rate scheme is completely in favor of the utility company.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe technical difficulties are often easier to solve than the legal, FWIW.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-14T14:15:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2022 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by JoeSchmuckatelli\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixophir","CreatedById":221686,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-15T13:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212417-hyperspace-industries/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022212417\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212417-hyperspace-industries/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Hyperspace Industries\u003C/a\u003E, I had some time today and performed a short search on PV in South Africa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I get there is a strong case for small private installations connected and feeding surplus into the grid, not just as a means to secure personal power supply of households, but also as a stabilizing element for the grid as a whole. It seems to me that the municipalities are the ones to ask for the detailed how-tos of such a system. Haven\u0027t found out if there are subsidies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere also seem to be financial benefits, tax exemption, etc., even to a degree that some money can be made with a private installation that feeds surplus into the grid. Get all the information you can, from other installations in your area, from the administration of your neighbourhood/municipality/whatever, your tax advisor if you have ... before you start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn principle this sounds like the best of both worlds to me, far more than I can expect here in Spain where the utility bill can not go below 0. You will definitely want a certified installer for such a thing, and if there\u0027s money to be made you will probably want the PV as big as affordable, meaning use all the available/permittable area. I would, in this case, also advocate for a smaller storage, just to get over an outage and not too much more. You want to sell the energy, not to keep it in the pockets. Your house-inverters should not charge from the grid, but from solar alone. Such systems usually have a galvanic separation between the inhouse-energy and the grid connection (different inverters/chargers), so that in case of a grid failure the inverters that feed into the grid can switch off but the in-house supply remains stable. This is extremely important !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, even an electric car can be charged from solar alone if the system is large enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice: grab your dad, talk him out of the rebellous aspects, tell him about the good in people who dedicate their personal efforts for the wellbeing-of-all(tm) and all that, you get it \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E And that he can draw some satisfaction out of the fact\u00A0 that you\u0027ll be selling energy to the ones who have been fooling you for so long ;-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-16T06:50:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2022 06:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pixophir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAutocorrect corrected and missing word made unmissed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
