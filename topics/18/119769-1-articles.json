I would really like to know where it\u0027s going, between 2 laptops, 2 smart-TV/BR\u0027s, and a pile of iCrap. I\u0027m sure the biggest users are NetFlix and YouTube. My router is a Motorola/Arris SBG6782, which doesn\u0027t seem to mention SNMP monitoring (the SBG6782-AC does). I\u0027m trying PRTG right now, but it\u0027s kinda complicated and probably overkill for my needs. I tried setting it up before I realized my modem/router doesn\u0027t support SNMP, but PRTG has a zillion other options to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if someone could suggest an easier way to track bandwidth usage on my network, or how I can set up PRTG in an easy-to-use, low-overhead way, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
