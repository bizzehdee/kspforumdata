First of all, there\u0027s obviously the issue with mods overlapping or being outright identical to DLC content. That would likely be taken down if they ever decided to do such a thing. Which I\u0027m kinda fine with, but also not? Mods tend to do things differently, and not everybody has money for essential and fairly simple things like parachutes (parts shouldn\u0027t be an issue, it\u0027s mostly gameplay funcitonality and DLLs\u00A0we should be concerned about).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, there\u0027s the problem where they conceivably could create multiplayer in such a way that mods would be regarded as cheats. This would easily be prevented by implementing dedicated servers in a way that mods would have to be server side too in order to be used (like in minecraft). Considering that that is by far the cheapest way to implement multiplayer, this should not be an issue... unless they want people to pay for online functionailty via subscriptions,\u00A0in which case modding is most likely doomed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third issue would be the notion of microtransactions.

GTAO has a need to strongly balance against the strangely-dressed Trevor Phillips\u0027s that roam the online servers, and any mod that has the potential to give a player an unfair advantage and bypass the need to pay for content creates problems for the very large amount of players that want to play fair (by GTA standards) as well as for Rockstar and Take-Two. KSP multiplayer relies on a mod that (from the looks of it; please correct and fill in my partial information) is less stable than GTAO, and the community around it is no where near as large as the \u0022community\u0022 of GTAO. The need to shut down mods that effectively unbalance multiplayer is greater in the GTA case than in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others have said, Take-Two have the power to do as they please with KSP, and I do carry a bit of pessimism about what may happen to KSP in the future.
