The astronaut \u0022morale\u0022 thing from the original felt tacked-on... there was no real way to optimize it in flight crews except through trial and error; and given how quickly astronaut crews were recycled, I tended to ignore it pretty completely after a while. Needless complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were other fiddly bits that I didn\u0027t much like -- the fact that for some parts of the program, there was only one real way to go to remain competitive; the way that failures were always catastrophic and never one-off problems; the fact that a lot of mission decisions seemed to be, basically, \u0022Abort Mission? \u0026lt;Y/N\u0026gt;\u0022... but these are trifles, really; I have fond memories of endless hours of playing the first with my former college roommate, and still go back to the open-source version to reminisce from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
