And so I tried to figure it out. I\\\u0027ve written a small program that simulates a gravity well and a planet moving inside it. This actually works. So far so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurs to me though that there should be another way using keplers planetary laws. Using the web I figured out how to determine period from semi-major axis and I understand the basics of the angular momentum and how this is a constant for every orbit.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t figure out though how to calculate the actual position of the planet at a certain time when I know the semi-major axis eccentricity and inclination.
