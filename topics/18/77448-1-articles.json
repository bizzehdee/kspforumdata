In doing so I have determined that our current price structure is losing us money, and so have decided to change it. I have asked the team, and we have come up with two options on how to offer our ziplines. The only problem is that we are divided on which one to go with. This is where you come in...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll rides are on separate cables, we have 10 total. They start off low and slow, then get higher, faster, and longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption A: Four rides for $55, minimum of two people or you have to tag on to an existing class. You have to start at the beginning, but if you add more you can mix it up and change what cables you ride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption B: Six rides for $55, minimum of four people or we will schedule you if we can where we can. If you want any more than the six rides it will be $35 more. No mixing it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any and all help!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ep.s.

The only problem is that it costs us at least $100 just to get the place started up (we inspect everything daily as per the ACCT standards, which takes at least two people), plus the insurance bill that has four zeros attached to it. This is actually as low as we can go without losing money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s the current price structure?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$55 for 6 rides, minimum of 2 people.
