Good news is that I only need about 5-10 minutes worth of footage to satisfy my needs. The bad news is I don\u0027t know when the problem is about to occur, so I\u0027d like to record continuously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I would not like to burden the PC with any unnecessary tasks such as compression on the fly, my thinking was to have the\u00A0screen recorder overwrite old footage as to not consume insane amount of storage. Is there a screen recorder that can record 3840 x 2160 desktop (there are two monitors in the bottom\u00A0row and one on top of them)\u00A0and loop through the recording?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-03T07:07:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2016 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shpaget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T13:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222346739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451804726\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, the program takes up 3\u00A01920 x 1080 monitors and there are a bunch of tiny numbers all around,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you by any chance doing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/91/7b/91/917b91356dd1f9c4a89585ead802e261.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022917b91356dd1f9c4a89585ead802e261.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 monitors.
