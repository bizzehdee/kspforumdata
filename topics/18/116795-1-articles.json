I\u0027ve been boating for practically all my life, here are some tips:\n\nThere\u0027s a little something called a plug on the bottom of the transom (Back part). Be sure to screw it in when you put in and unscrew it when you pull out. Trust me on this one, we almost sunk our boat by not putting it in, and the transom eventually rotted off the back and we had to get a new one put on because the plug wasn\u0027t pulled and the water let out every time.\n\nGet a [life jacket that fits](http://fishandboat.com/boatcrs/pfd/fit.htm) for everybody who\u0027ll be on board, a throwable PFD, some flares (reqd. on Great Lakes, but good to have everywhere. Lets people locate you easy and know you need help and you need it now.), a loud whistle (required in most, if not all places; any one will do, I recommend the Acme Whistle Model 636 or the Fox 40) and (THIS IS IMPORTANT) a good, long paddle, about 3-5 foot long at least. The paddle has saved me countless times, and you can push off the bank/dock with it.\n\nKeep some tools (stndrd. and Phillips head Screwdrivers, pair of dikes/Diagonal Cutters, pair of vise grips, pair of pliers is what I\u0027d recommend at the least) in a box on board, they\u0027ll come in handy. Keep a good, sharp knife on board, too, and keep it away from kids and stupid people. If you carry a pocketknife (like I do) or leatherman you can omit the knife. Learn how to fix your motor, no matter how good you think it is WILL fail on you when you\u0027re on the water. The paddle also comes in handy if the motor decides to flip you the bird.\n\nExpect to get wet every time you go out. Learn how to swim if you don\u0027t know how. An easy way to learn how to swim is to get somebody to toss you in the water, that\u0027s how I learned.\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t have a ladder on the back, be prepared for some pain when getting back in. \n\nTie the rope on the boat before you try to launch (It happens, and it sucks when it happens). Launch with at least 2 people. \n\nWhatever you do, be sure to follow the rules, regs, signs, and buoys in whatever water you\u0027re in. The coast guard or whoever patrols the water will, from quite a long distance away even, write down your boat\u0027s registration number with a pen and a pair of binoculars and send you a fine in the mail. They might even pull to the side of your boat to talk with you and even ask to board your boat, it just depends. Don\u0027t drink while boating, that\u0027s how people crash and get hurt. And please keep your boat registered (All you gotta do is pay the fee and put a sticker you get in the mail on it like you put a sticker on your license plate), it\u0027ll save you a lot of money and trouble down the road.\n\nIf you\u0027re young, check your state\u0027s laws on age and operating boats. You might need to get a Boating Safety Certification, which I had to take an 8 hour class and pass a 35-question test to get. It cost me very little, I think it might\u0027ve been free now that I think about it. Don\u0027t worry, the test is dead simple if you pay attention. Check your state\u0027s Boating Comission/Authority/Department website to find out about the laws and Boating courses. Boats might be covered under your state\u0027s DMV if it doesn\u0027t have an official, separate organization for boats. For the Boating courses you can also look up your nearest Coast Guard Auxiliary, they offer classes. Either way, I recommend the classes for everybody, I learned a bunch of stuff I never learned in many, many years of boating.\n\nDon\u0027t get cavalier and do dangerous or stupid stuff to impress people or have fun. That\u0027s how you get hurt and a fine and/or a hospital bill in the mail.\n\nBoats are always referred to as \u0022she\u0022 and \u0022her\u0022. That\u0027s because you should treat them like you would a fine, young lady. It\u0027s also considered bad luck not to.\n\nIf you\u0027re planning on going to the Great Lakes, check the [NOAA wave height forecast](http://www.crh.noaa.gov/greatlakes/?c=map\u0026l=gl\u0026p=a\u0026m=wh) for the lake you\u0027re going to (Click on the lake to to be taken to it\u0027s forecast, use the bottom grid of dates \u0026 times to check forecast for each of the things on the left). If you\u0027re in a smallish boat (\u003E10, \u003C25), don\u0027t go when the waves are over 5-10 feet, you\u0027ll be tossed around and when you\u0027re boating fast on the water your back and body won\u0027t thank you for the absolutely jarring ride.\n\nCHECK THE WEATHER BEFORE GOING OUT. PREPARE FOR CONDITIONS. HEAD FOR HOME IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL OR STARTS RAINING.\n\n**Safety is NUMBER ONE.**\n\n**FINALLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT:** Have fun with it! The water\u0027s one of my favorite places to be.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T06:31:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:28:30Z","Content":"*Very good advice!* ^\n\nI\u0027ll throw one more thing: Your boat; When you\u0027re out with family and friends aboard, be it you or your dad (whichever one), there is but one \u0027Captain\u0027.

Be extremely careful when refueling and have a fire extinguisher on board, a fire on a boat is no joke.\n\nHave emergency methods both for keeping the water out, and for removing it if it gets in. A small tarpaulin and some rope can save your arse if you get holed. One or more manual bailing devices are a must, even if you have a bilge pump. \n\nTo quote the Boating Bible: \u0022The best bilge pump ever invented is two frightened sailors with a bucket.\u0022\n\nA bucket and a length of rope will also make a serviceable sea-anchor, should you find yourself without power and drifting into trouble. \n\nIt\u0027s been said, but I\u0027ll say it again: Always have alternative means of propulsion. A paddle will suffice if you\u0027re not too far from shore, two is better.\n\nAlso, and something that annoys me on a regular basis: Please read up on the [international rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea) of the sea - there\u0027s nothing more annoying than pleasure boaties who think that the give-way rules etc. for the *road* apply on the water.

Let them know where the extinguisher, life vests, Throw PFD, Flares and any other safety-related items are and how/when to use them. Also let them know what they can and cannot do while underway. Something I like to do is tell them that if they don\u0027t follow the rules they can sit back at the dock.\n\nAlso, something I forgot about the flares: CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE. Yes, they do expire. Get new ones when they do, they aren\u0027t considered good for Great Lakes and thy might not work if they\u0027re expired. It\u0027s easy to check, it\u0027s printed right on the flare.\n\nAnother thing about extinguishers: Make sure to shake your extinguisher every once in a while. Most of the time it\u0027ll be a dry fire extinguisher, meaning that there\u0027s a bunch of powder in the extinguisher that gets shot out when you use it, and motor vibrations and impacts with waves can cause that powder to compact and make the extinguisher useless. Shake it up for a minute or few every once in a while, or better yet, every time you go out. And aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire, not at the flames. This is true of all extinguishers, but is especially true when your life depends on it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T18:44:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T01:54:04Z","Content":"Humm... another essential forgotten... should your vessel capsize, ALWAYS STAY WITH THE BOAT.

So many people have perished while trying to swim or hike to safety, while they would have lived it they had stayed with their vehicle.
