I had a prescription antihistamine that I could take, but it would knock me out for hours. The playground at the school I went to was surrounded on two sides with these massive oleander hedges, and every spring when they would bloom I would just be incapacitated. I would miss probably a week or two of school a year. Cats and perfume were also bad, but they were pretty easy to avoid.

(Although I haven\u0027t been officially diagnosed with it, since I haven\u0027t gone in to have the genetic testing, my doctor and I both agree that it is most likely suspect.) I\u0027ve always had loose joints, I have a long history of dislocations. And then in 2014 I had emergency open heart surgery to correct a 10cm ascending aortic aneurysm, which by all rights should have killed me. So now my aorta all the way from my aortic root through the arch is a mix of ex-pig parts and Dacron tubing. I\u0027m going to have to go back in and get my aortic valve replaced sometime in the next 10-15 years. (7-12 years now, where does the time go?) But they\u0027re already doing that as a minimally-invasive procedure through the femoral artery for high-risk patients now, by the time I get around to it they\u0027ll almost certainly be doing that for everyone. So, the good news is that this is the worst thing that can happen from Marfan\u0027s. We\u0027re just keeping an eye on my eyes to see if my lenses slip (which is correctable with surgery), and I\u0027m working out to keep my muscle strength up which helps with the dislocations and to keep my resting heart rate down which will stave off the valve replacement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, even with all that, I can sit here and easily name half-a-dozen people I know or have known personally that have it worse than I do.

I started getting them back in 2007. First time I had one it scared the crap out of me, I thought I was having a stroke or something. But after talking to my doctor I discovered that they were essentially harmless and I was only getting them about every other month, so I just ignored them. But, after I had my surgery in 2014 I started getting them two or three times a week, which was a bit more of a problem. So my doc here put me on medication for it, and now they\u0027re down to about every other week. So, I guess I\u0027m unlucky that I get them at all, but lucky that I don\u0027t get the headaches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually get that, followed by a numbness in a thumb or toe which crawls about my body, and my mind gets fuzzy and I can\u0027t remember how to speak.
