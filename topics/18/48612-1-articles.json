I love RP in games, i play Crusader kings 2 instead of the TW series because i like the family intrigues, in space i\u0027d rather be a trader than a fighter pilot, i\u0027d like to land on planets, deliver supplies to outposts, soak in the atmosphere, watch as computer controlled factions interact randomly, hire crew, that kind of thing, so which of these games would i like most do you think? Oh lastly i don\u0027t want an mmo, i only like single-player games these days despite having spent 6 years in WoW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EX-Rebirth most probably will emphasize the economic aspects ... building your own space trade empire. Also you will have a single ship as your basic ship, which, however is upradable and in which you can walk. X-Rebirth will, most probably, like the other X-Parts play 100% in space (no landing on planets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElite: Dangerous will have the hugest universe to explore (around 4 billion star systems, each with its own planets on many of which you will be able to land and probably will mine for ore).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStar Citizen will have only 100 star systems ... what it has, however is, that you can walk inside of your space crafts (in contrast to X you will have several different models which you can pilot) and feel like home there. Landing on planets may or may not come in Star Citizen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX-Rebirth is AFAIK purely single player, while E: D and SC have a prsistent Multiplayer universe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno which you should buy/back. I for my part back E: D and Star Citizen ... but probably I will also buy X-Rebirth in the near or far future.
