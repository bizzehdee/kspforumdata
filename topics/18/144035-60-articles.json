The threat for brief waterspouts and/or tornadoes should\n   correspondingly increase through the early afternoon.\n\n   DISCUSSION...Tropical storm Fred continues to gradually shift\n   northward towards the FL panhandle. To the east of the center\n   circulation, persistent rain bands continue to feature embedded\n   thunderstorms thanks to a combination of low-level confluence over\n   Apalachee Bay and warm theta-e advection off the FL peninsula. VWP\n   observations from KTLH have shown strengthening flow in the lowest\n   1-2 km over the past hour as Fred\u0027s stronger wind field shifts\n   north. Consequently, low-level helicity has increased and is\n   supporting weak rotation in thunderstorms within the rain bands.\n   Recent RAP analyses support this trend and show favorable ESRH\n   beginning to overspread much of the Apalachee Bay coastal areas. As\n   a result, the potential for brief waterspouts and tornadoes is\n   expected to increase along the coast over the next few hours as the\n   rain bands begin to move onshore.\n\n   ..Moore.. 08/16/2021\n\n   ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\n   ATTN...WFO...TAE...\n\n   LAT...LON   29638516 29978500 30188460 30278422 30118368 29968346\n               29788331 29568333 29488345 29538358 29698373 29878389\n               29928411 29768436 29638465 29498492 29488512 29638516 \u003C/pre\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peridoot","CreatedById":211038,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-16T18:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNEW TORNADO WARNING IN TEXAS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre style=\u0022background-color:#f5f5f5;border:1px solid #cccccc;color:#333333;font-size:13px;padding:9.5px;\u0022\u003EBULLETIN - EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\nTORNADO WARNING\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AMARILLO TX\n111 PM CDT MON AUG 16 2021\n\nTHE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN AMARILLO HAS ISSUED A\n\n* TORNADO WARNING FOR...\n  SOUTHWESTERN ROBERTS COUNTY IN THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS...\n\n* UNTIL 145 PM CDT.\n\n* AT 111 PM CDT, A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A TORNADO\n  WAS LOCATED 7 MILES NORTH OF PAMPA, MOVING SOUTHEAST AT 10 MPH.\n\n  HAZARD...TORNADO AND QUARTER SIZE HAIL.\n\n  SOURCE...RADAR INDICATED ROTATION.\n\n  IMPACT...FLYING DEBRIS WILL BE DANGEROUS TO THOSE CAUGHT WITHOUT \n           SHELTER.

Other storms\n   may produce isolated severe wind gusts and some hail from parts of\n   the central and southern High Plains, Southwest, and northern\n   Rockies.\n\n   ...FL/AL/GA...\n   TS Fred will move ashore this afternoon/evening over the FL\n   peninsula, with bands of convection affecting the region.  Local VAD\n   profiles and model guidance show strong low-level shear profiles\n   that are conditionally favorable for supercell structures and the\n   risk of a few tornadoes.  The threat should slowly spread northward\n   into parts of southeast AL and southwest GA later today.  Please\n   refer to WW #441 and MCD #1532 for further details.\n\n   ...AZ...\n   Mostly clear skies are noted this morning over the mountains of\n   northern/central AZ, where afternoon MLCAPE values over 2000 J/kg\n   are expected.  This should lead to scattered thunderstorm\n   development as a shortwave trough over UT tracks southward.  Models\n   suggest that northerly mid-level winds will strengthen this\n   afternoon around peak heating, helping to organize cold pools and\n   propagate storms off the higher terrain into southern AZ.  Damaging\n   winds will be possible with the stronger cores.  Given this\n   scenario, have added a SLGT risk for parts of the region.\n\n   ...MT...\n   Strong heating is also occurring over the mountains of eastern ID\n   and southwest MT.

To the north of the center of circulation, velocity data and\n   VWP observations from KTLH, as well as recent RAP mesoanalysis,\n   suggest low-level shear is maximized west of Tallahassee, FL owing\n   to a maxima in Fred\u0027s wind field. However, persistent stratiform\n   rain has reduced near-surface theta-e values as temperatures\n   struggle to warm above the mid 70s, resulting in a minimum in\n   MLCAPE. Subsequently, storms away from Fred\u0027s center moving into\n   this region have shown weakening trends. Given the strongly sheared\n   environment, a brief tornado remains possible, but the probability\n   for a robust tornado threat seems reduced. \n\n   Further to the east, low-level trajectories from north/central FL\n   are advecting higher theta-e air into Fred\u0027s eastern rain bands.\n   This higher-quality air mass is denoted by MLCAPE values exceeding\n   1000 J/kg in recent analyses, and should continue to support storm\n   development over the next few hours. Deepening convection is noted\n   within a developing band that will likely move towards the northern\n   and eastern Apalachee Bay coast over the coming hours. Although\n   low-level shear diminishes with eastern extent, there should be a\n   sufficient overlap of favorable low-level SRH and instability to\n   maintain a tornado threat for at least the next 1-2 hours for the\n   north/eastern coastal areas of the bay.\n\n   ..Moore.. 08/16/2021\n\n   ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\n   ATTN...WFO...TBW...JAX...TAE...\n\n   LAT...LON   30068427 30478406 30518373 30328325 30108291 29808263\n               29438258 29138259 28998273 29028311 29218325 29468345\n               29718364 29908393 29968412 30068427 \n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-16T20:38:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2021 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by peridoot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peridoot","CreatedById":211038,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-16T20:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mcd1535.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.90\u0022 height=\u0022388\u0022 width=\u0022518\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/mcd1535.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre style=\u0022color:#000000;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003E\nNEW DAY 1 OUTLOOK\n\n\nSPC AC 162000\n\n   Day 1 Convective Outlook  \n   NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK\n   0300 PM CDT Mon Aug 16 2021\n\n   Valid 162000Z - 171200Z\n\n   ...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE FLORIDA\n   PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND SOUTHWEST GEORGIA AS WELL AS\n   SOUTHERN ARIZONA...\n\n   ...SUMMARY...\n   Threat remains for a few tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle into\n   southeast Alabama and southwest Georgia this afternoon and evening. \n   Other storms may produce isolated severe wind gusts and some hail\n   from parts of the central and southern High Plains, Southwest, and\n   northern Rockies.\n\n   ...Discussion...\n\n   Primary change for this update has been to remove the MRGL risk area\n   from southwestern KS and shift it south to along and south of an \n   outflow boundary from the TX Panhandle into OK. Have expanded the\n   MRGL risk east into southeast KS ahead of an MCV.

Local VAD\n   profiles and model guidance show strong low-level shear profiles\n   that are conditionally favorable for supercell structures and the\n   risk of a few tornadoes.  The threat should slowly spread northward\n   into parts of southeast AL and southwest GA later today.  Please\n   refer to WW #441 and MCD #1532 for further details.\n\n   ...AZ...\n   Mostly clear skies are noted this morning over the mountains of\n   northern/central AZ, where afternoon MLCAPE values over 2000 J/kg\n   are expected.  This should lead to scattered thunderstorm\n   development as a shortwave trough over UT tracks southward.  Models\n   suggest that northerly mid-level winds will strengthen this\n   afternoon around peak heating, helping to organize cold pools and\n   propagate storms off the higher terrain into southern AZ.  Damaging\n   winds will be possible with the stronger cores.  Given this\n   scenario, have added a SLGT risk for parts of the region.\n\n   ...MT...\n   Strong heating is also occurring over the mountains of eastern ID\n   and southwest MT.

This may gradually\n   spread across the remainder of northeastern Georgia into Upstate\n   South Carolina by 10 am-12 pm EDT.  Trends are being monitored for\n   the possibility of a new watch, but it is also possible that the\n   threat may become marginal and/or isolated enough that a new watch\n   may not be needed.\n\n   DISCUSSION...More substantive central pressure rises have been\n   occurring the past few hours as Fred migrates northward.  A\n   corresponding weakening of low-level wind fields has also been\n   observed, and these trends are likely to continue as the depression\n   progresses north-northeast of the Auburn, AL vicinity, toward the\n   Greater Atlanta metro through 14-16Z.  \n\n   Mid-level subsidence warming nosing northeastward around the\n   southern through eastern periphery of the circulation aloft is\n   contributing to diminishing convective potential across the Warner\n   Robins/Macon vicinity into the Greater Atlanta area, and this is\n   forecast to continue spreading toward the Savannah River through mid\n   to late morning.  This also corresponds with a weak surface wind\n   shift, and the onset more unidirectional shear in the near surface\n   layer.\n\n   Ahead of the wind shift, strongest mid/upper forcing for ascent,\n   low-level convergence and largest clockwise-curved low-level\n   hodographs will generally be focused in an area overspreading\n   northeastern Georgia into Upstate South Carolina through 14-16Z. \n   Although wind fields are gradually weakening, southerly 850 mb flow\n   on the order of 30\u002B kt may still contribute to sufficiently large\n   low-level hodographs to maintain at least some risk for the\n   development of supercell structures with the potential to produce \n   tornadoes.  This probably will be aided by at least some further\n   increase of surface dew points through the lower to mid 70s F across\n   parts of the Piedmont.\n\n   ..Kerr.. 08/17/2021\n\n   ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\n   ATTN...WFO...CAE...GSP...FFC...\n\n   LAT...LON   34458355 34918266 34188175 33458189 32948238 33708311\n               34068367 34458355 \u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mcd1543.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.90\u0022 height=\u0022388\u0022 width=\u0022518\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/mcd1543.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peridoot","CreatedById":211038,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-17T14:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncurrent trnado watch:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre style=\u0022color:#000000;font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003ESEL3\n\n   URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED\n   Tornado Watch Number 443\n   NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK\n   340 AM EDT Tue Aug 17 2021\n\n   The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a\n\n   * Tornado Watch for portions of \n     Central to northeastern Georgia\n\n   * Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 340 AM until\n     100 PM EDT.\n\n   * Primary threats include...\n     A couple tornadoes possible\n\n   SUMMARY...Gradually increasing buoyancy and lift are occurring\n   northeast of the center of Fred, in an environment of favorable\n   low-level shear for supercells.
