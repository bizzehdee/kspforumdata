I doubt that they stuck around for much more.\n\nAlso, the author said that at the time of writing this mod, he was not that good with coding, and was basically learning java. I will not say that it wasn\u0027t Mojang\u0027s fault (cause there\u0027s a 70% chance that it was), but it might be just that he was doing it not the most effective way."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T19:04:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could you describe me in PM what was the thing with this mod?

Game companies are pushed to deal with it by their customers\u0027 increasing tendency to give a personal touch to the games they are playing.\n\nIn a sense, it\u0027s a continuation of the *sandbox* idea, yet it\u0027s reaching questionable levels of appropriation and outspoken dissatisfaction, as if the openness of *sandbox* environments were never enough. It would probably be a breath of fresh air to stop acting like barons considering they are the legit owners of the land.\n\nAnyway, mods are not part of a game. And I don\u0027t think developers should be concerned with making their software more easily hackable. I would suggest keeping the discussion to the lowest common denominator.\n\nSame reasoning for the seemingly insatiable appetite for updates. On this forum, we can regularly read people asking simultaneously for a finished product and for constant new features. Talk about oxymorons.\n\nWhat an apparent majority of players are doing with a game has little connection with the quality of the game itself. Blame these players if you want. They may be just a tip of the iceberg anyway. That\u0027s how I want to see the grumpiness which is prevalent on many video games forums.\n\nAs far as other matters are concerned, I find some comments in this thread offensively self-assured, especially regarding two games that have been recognized and praised by so many professionals from different fields of expertise; two games that both made it to an EDU program, and that are played by people from so many different generations, which I think is a high-quality sign for a cultural product.\n\nNew interesting games are coming, but there\u0027s no doubt *Minecraft* is a milestone in the history of video games.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T02:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026 Akakak**"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T23:20:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E old minecraft was good, but now its just a lot of kids,pvp servers and silly youtubers arround\n\nI\u0027ll just quote this here."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:21:14Z","Content":"Wait, how and when did this thread get stickied?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:38:59Z","Content":"Is this even a valid question?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T01:05:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait, how and when did this thread get stickied?\n\nSal\\_vager chose it as a [Thread of the Month](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64392-KSP-forums-Threads-Of-The-Month%21?p=2114896#post2114896)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T01:08:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sal\\_vager chose it as a [Thread of the Month](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64392-KSP-forums-Threads-Of-The-Month%21?p=2114896#post2114896).\n\nOh!
