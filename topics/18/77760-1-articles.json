You should do Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER3: Why would you want to use A, you should use B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP: I have A, and need to do X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER4: B is much better for doing Y. You should get B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER5: R4 is crazy. I have had much better luck doing Z with A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER4: Yes but OP was asking how to do Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER5: No, OP was asking how to do Z, but you started talking about B. Are you a B fanboy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP: I think I may have been unclear about what I am trying to do. I am trying to use A to do X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER4: Not a fanboy, but not a troll like you either R5. B\u0027s reputation is obviously better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER3: Like I said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER2: As others have said, B is better at Y. If you are insistant on doing X, then your A will be just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 years later:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER6: I was trying to find out how to do X and came across W. heres a link\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER7: Can I use A to do A?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to pitch in \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
