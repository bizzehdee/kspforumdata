I\u0027m trying to make a KSP cinematic, but ran into a rather major issue. When switching from my screen recorder (I use Krut) to KSP, instead of getting KSP I get a black bar in the top left corner of my screen. How can I avoid this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETested with other screen recorders. (ezvid, Media Encoder). Same result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WololoW","CreatedById":114478,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T18:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what is happening for you, but when I use OBS to record video of KSP, that doesnt happen.
