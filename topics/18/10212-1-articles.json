On your mark.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  Tension crept into the blast bunker, like no other. This was a completely new design unique to KSP. A small winged capsule, with a lander module was to be boosted by seven Multi-Purpose Expendable cores all the way to the Mun. It would then perform various science experiments, instrumental to the spaghetti-o production and packaging back home. Something with this much significance, with the power to affect their evening meals, was not to be taken lightly.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027Three\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027Two\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027One\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  Nothing happened. The crew of ANTHRAX looked at eachother awkwardly. Just as Joe took hit soda out of the cupholder, the engines ignited. The metal can quickly hopped into the dashboard, frying the computers more crisp than a grilled burger.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027WHAAAAAAA!\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027Monty, stop crapping yourself! You\\\u0027re over that now, aren\\\u0027t you?\u0027 snapped Dunham.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027I can\\\u0027t help it! The vibrations are shaking it loose! Plus, the computers are fried, and we\\\u0027re screwed\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  The entire world seemed to stop for a second. Without the computers, there was nothing controlling the ship! And the last rocket with a systems failure ended up as a hole in the VAB. Dunham reached with all his might to grab the joystick. But his arms were too short\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027What the hell? Are these things made for six-foot beasts or something?\u0027 he cried. Suddenly, genius struck him. Dunham kicked the cord and it fell onto his lap.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027F\\*ck yes! Hang on guys!\u0027 He pulled the ship up thirty degrees, slamming Monty\\\u0027s helmet onto the back of his chair, and cracking it. The rocket was at the correct attitude now, but it still didn\\\u0027t please Monty\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027Hey Dun, my helmet it broken!\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027What do you expect me to do about that? We\\\u0027re out of duct tape as far as I can remember.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027But then I\\\u0027ll never perform my Munwalk.\u0027 Monty began tearing, and his eyes took a puppy-like appearance.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0027Dude, keep it toge-\u0027 \n\u003E \n\u003E  MECO! The boys felt a jolt - the stage separation - and sighed from relief. With the second stage engine working perfectly, nothing could go wrong. At least they thought...\n\nAaaand that\\\u0027s the prologue. More will come, I promise!"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T02:31:41Z","Content":"\u0027FUC\\*\u0027\n\nYou may want to censor that or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Caesar15","CreatedById":11257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T02:36:51Z","Content":"A fanfic?
