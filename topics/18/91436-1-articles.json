I am currently developing my own game and am open to helping and joining other game development projects that interest me. But I have to say, from what I have read on here so far, I would NOT be interested in joining your project, sorry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) you are making a space simulator that sounds like KSP. Like one of these other guys said, why are you trying to re-invent the wheel? KSP is a fantastic space simulator game. It has a certain appeal to it that opened it up to the masses. It teaches basic physics while still being a fun and simple video game. To make something remotely like it would be pretty much be knocking off from this game at one point. People don\u0027t like and will not play a knock off of another game, especially in the indie game market. KSP is brilliant, I honestly consider it (despite some of it\u0027s minor setbacks) one of the top 5 best video games ever created in history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Believe it or not, even though I love KSP, the businessman inside of me has thought about making a competing product. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s practical. KSP has a few weak points, one being that it is using a framework known as \u0022Unity\u0022 and that is has technical limitations. To pass these technical limitations with a superior framework would require a great deal of money and investment into a more powerful game dev tool, and this is all on a hunch that your product would be better than KSP. Also, getting something more technical means longer development time in making an already complicated product about space travel and physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Have you ever attempted any type of game development? You are getting in way over your head if you think you will pull this off even remotely. Making a game like KSP is technically extremely complicated. This game has probably more mathematics and technical aspects to it than even most mainstream games. It is elementary rocket science, and making it would be very difficult. If you\u0027ve never even tried game development, prepare to have your mind blown. 3D alone is a very difficult concept, and to do something on the scale of KSP takes a brilliant mind with a lot of patience and help from other people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EMAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E This point pretty much rules them all out. I am all for making new and fun video games, but \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy not try something new\u003C/strong\u003E? A space simulator already exist, and it is called Kerbal Space Program. You know how many times I\u0027ve seen someone say \u0022I want to make a game like [insert game title here] but better\u0022? How many cheap knockoffs of \u0022Minecraft\u0022 have you seen over the years? They were never as good as the original. Think up of your own, fun concept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, take it from someone who has pretty much wasted several years and dollars on indie game development. Do something fun, original, and do-able in a short amount of time. Set a short goal, can you make a simple and finished video game in say, six weeks? DON\u0027T try to take on KSP or make a cheap knock off of it that\u0027s going to take years to make with tons of developers and no experience in doing so.
