I squeed and he laughed, knowing full well how excited I\u0027d get. Under the tapes? A TV-VHS combo, small enough to sit next to my desk. I squeed again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day while I worked, I had the movies playing the whole time. I hadn\u0027t seen these versions of the movies since the Special Edition came out, which came out when I was 9. My girlfriend had NEVER seen the originals, so that was fun.
