I\u0027ve had it for over a year now, and its performance is still great. It has all the bells and whistles except wireless charging and a fingerprint reader, which are not high on my priority list. It can be easily rooted and flashed, so you have a large choice of custom ROMs that you can get on xda-developers.com (I\u0027ve been using SlimLP as a daily driver since I\u0027ve had the phone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only drawback is the lack of choice in custom cases. There are a couple of nice ones, but the well-known flagships have a much wider variety.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T10:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a Oneplus One too and its the best phone I have ever had.
