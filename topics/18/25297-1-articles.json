It\u0027s not much of a better or worse system than Windows 7, it does eat up somewhat less RAM and has some nicely updated software like the task manager and the windows explorer, but there are some things that are quite annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe greatest problem of course is the Metro interface. Although I kinda like the new redesign and the new Windows visual identity with the sharp corners and all, the interface itself is really badly concieved and it simply looks like in their quest to present it as something amazingly intuitive, they actually made it more complicated. Unity had it\u0027s share of criticism, but it really just needed some time to get used to. It does have some \u0022overly inventive\u0022 features being crammed in there, but it makes sense and works quite well. Metro, on the other hand managed to hide the shut down button in the options sidebar, makes launching applications actually more difficult unless you have a touchscreen, and the Metro apps are complete and utter bull**it. The Mail app doesn\u0027t even support POP, the settings app is useless as it has limited options, and you actually have to go into Control Panel like always in order to change anything, and for some reason, you need to link the computer to your Microsoft/hotmail/whatever account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T20:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank god I picked the only CyberpowerPC on newegg with Windows 7 \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T21:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust buyed a new computer by parts, of course, windows 7 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moustachauve","CreatedById":41337,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T21:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8 is only good for tactile devices\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T22:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grove\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grove\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlmost threw it out of the window?
