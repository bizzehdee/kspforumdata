It didn\u0027t show the windows boot up animation and the following...erm... \u0022choose a user screen\u0022, desktop-like...thingy........place, thing. Err. Yeah it didn\u0027t show any startup animations but I knew it successfully booted up because it played that characteristic winodws boot-up sound. I tried restarting my computer but that didn\u0027t work. So to better diagnose what was wrong, I plugged my tv via hdmi cables to my laptop and I am able to see things with the tv monitor. I went to the hardware manager and checked the laptop screen and it said it was working properly, which obviously it wasn\u0027t. I think my computer screen is damaged somehow. I brought it to school with me today and I accidentally bumped my bag into another person. Wasn\u0027t super hard but it was moderate. No visible damage can be seen anywhere on my laptop. It just refuses to display anything. Now it isn\u0027t a completely black screen. On startup it flashes grey then a whiter grey, then it settles in a grey screen. So there is some light coming from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo do you think my monitor is damaged, or is it a software glitch. Should I get it checked out at a pc repair place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, don\u0027t know if this would help but my screen is an LCD. My computer model is a toshiba satellite a665.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T23:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould be the plug came loose, there is a very small connector inside the laptop, usually buried under the keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.irisvista.com/tech/laptops/Toshiba-Satellite-A665-A660/laptop-disassembly-1.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis might help you.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T23:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat seems like a very nifty guide sal linked; I\u0027d suggest going with that as your first attempt. The most likely explanation is just a loose cable. Though the guide doesn\u0027t specify which screws are used.

Its a scary proposition to me and looking at that guide, it appears it takes alot of taking apart just to get the monitor. However, on the third page there is a link that just shows how to get to the screen. I might do that and see if a loose cable is there. If not, ill take it to the shop thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
