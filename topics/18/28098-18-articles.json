A few shots anywhere on it would take it out, so a quick snapshot could take it out rather than just damage another, heavier plane. It would be more vulnerable to any shots, as a result of the armour, small arms included. One was shot down with a BAR from a C-47 once. I think the elevators would lock up if the Zero/Reisen went to fast though. It was one of the best carrier fighters of WW2 with a 12:1 Kill ratio as a result of its legendary manoeuvrability though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chobit-389","CreatedById":40105,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T21:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAye, proof you don\u0027t need a bulletproof vest and duel-wield miniguns to be an absolute badass ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeonG17","CreatedById":65024,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T21:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELikely the only kill for a C-47.
