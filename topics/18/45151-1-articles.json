And it got me to thinking: why can\u0027t I send a rocket like that to the Mun in KSP? From the diagram, it uses stacked SRB\u0027s for launch, and then liquid fuel for the last two stages, the last one probably more for orbital adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any ideas on it?

SpaceX believes in reusability, so it is going for relatively complex designs and they hope to recoup the cost by reusing the hardware over frequent launches. This will lead to fewer launchers being built. Another approach is to build cheaper dumb boosters and to mass produce them.

Awhile back (1970\u0027s) they developed solid rockets they could shut down (by causing flame-out via different mechanisms like blowing off the nozzel) to do this in KSP would require solids that could be shut down like Minotaur V IRL ones. Either that or playing around with existing solids from different mods that can launch a specific mass into a specific orbit with 100% of it fuel, no more or less. OR try somekind of crazy scheme to jettison the unfinished solid manually and not have it crash into your cargo pod... that sounds like a lot of fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T23:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I actually gone and accomplished it.
