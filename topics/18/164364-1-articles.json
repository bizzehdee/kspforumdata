I was hoping to have a dogfight thread where each participant record some of the videos, but was wondering how common is video recording capability in our community. \u00A0Most people probably don\u0027t have dedicated recording software, and I don\u0027t either, so I was wondering how many people have\u00A0Geforce Experience, and if you tried recording video with it? cuz I think Nvidia cards are pretty common these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-13T05:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2017 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by goduranus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-13T05:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTBH, although I have a Nvidia card, I\u0027ve switched to using OBS for video recording.
