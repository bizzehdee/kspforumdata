I can design most things an FDM printer can reasonably create. Solid inspector is a must have. Another trick is to build in meters aka 1000 times bigger than you actually want. then simply export generic \u0022Units\u0022. When importing into the slicing program use millimeters as the import units setting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T11:38:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wudupdogz**"},{"CreatedByName":"PnDB","CreatedById":134433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:47:47Z","Content":"For simpler 3D printed parts (Pi housings, mounts for electronics, etc, even clockwork mechanisms), it\u0027s really a matter of personal preference; just about any of the freeware 3D modeling packages will do what you want. I would go ahead and start with Sketchup and see how far you can push things in terms of design. If you find you can\u0027t get something to work in Sketchup, see if Blender can do it instead. \n\nFor particularly complicated objects, I\u0027ve been using Rhinoceros v5 as my modeling package of choice. The downside is that Rhino costs dollars. Blender just couldn\u0027t handle the design of a 3D printable aircraft wing with internal trusswork, servo mounts, spar tubes and cable routing; Rhino didn\u0027t even break a sweat. I\u0027m sure something like SolidWorks or Catia would have done equally well or far better, but at much higher price points."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:03:25Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to The Space Lounge, as the topic at hand is about modelling software for 3D printing, rather than making add-ons for the game]**"}]}
