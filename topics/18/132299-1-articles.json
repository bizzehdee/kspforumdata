Partly i think it is because of the mobile devices that lack the power of a pc. You \u003Cs\u003Ecan\u003C/s\u003E must choose exactly the functionality you need for your task, and nothing in excess.

I think of Outerra and Proland. So, i hoped for a step forward in terms of usability to a broader mass of aspiring wanna-be programmers. I am not afraid of malloc and free (though their time is over as well), with memory management i mean taking care that all your objects clean up nicely behind them. Which in the case of Vulkan means that you either have another overhead cleaning up at the end of each action or you write your own functionality e. g. a wrapper that you pass a function call to for the destruction of your objects.
