Part of what bothers me about the movie adaptation is that the movie follows your attitude (slow zombies not a threat, must use fast super-zombies), but the book spent time explaining WHY slow zombies would be an actual threat even to the military. While the book has some combat with zombies, it\u0027s much more about why society as a whole falls to the zombie horde, and how it (and its military) adapts to overcome the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
