I noticed I was getting a bit of traffic from over here, so I figured I would stop by. I\u0027m a huge Kerbal fan (if you couldn\u0027t tell from a few of the influences in the game...), so it\u0027s cool that Sol 0 is getting a bit of notice over here. Sol 0 is still in beta - still a few bugs and honestly a bit less refined than Kerbal\u0027s beta. That said, I am updating frequently with bug fixes and am now trying to hit a two-week or so update schedule. The bug noted above is fixed for the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESol 0 was Greenlit back in early December, and I\u0027m planning on releasing on Steam in early 2015, so if early access isn\u0027t your thing, the full 1.0 release is on the horizon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
