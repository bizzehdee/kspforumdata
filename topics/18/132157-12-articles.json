SQUAD has a whole team of people, There is no reason why they couldnt have made something even better, And yet they moved to curse, Why?, Because curse is riddles with ads! Ads make money! Squad in making that decision abandoned any care for those who played their game so they could make even more money. And when kerbalstuff came along the first thing it did was cut deeply into the revenues, And as such SQUAD showed it no remorse when it shut down, Because now they thought we would finally move entirely to curse, And then they would have full revenue from the ads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts good that the community is reviving kerbalstuff as Spacedock.info because as long as spacedock takes of as fast as kerbalstuff did, Squad wont get its ill gotten boost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard to know where to start with this, but I\u0027ll try:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Squad does not earn ad revenue from Curse. As I understand it the arrangement does not have money exchanged between Squad and Curse. Curse pays for its staff and server/bandwidth costs through ad revenue, though you are free to use the Curseforge site with fewer ads or just block ads altogether.(Another way to look at this is Squad gave KerbalStuff exactly the same financial support it gives Curse \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KerbalStuff did not affect Squad\u0027s revenue, because of the above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Squad has expressed remorse at the\u00A0shutdown of KerbalStuff. Why wouldn\u0027t they? Any fansite supporting the game is a good thing, generally speaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- No one expects everyone to move to Curse now that KS is gone. There have always been other hosting options than KerbalStuff and Curse, and that remains unchanged. And it\u0027s looking like another KS-equivalent site will be online soon, which just about everyone thinks is a good thing. More hosting options is strictly better than fewer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jabbman","CreatedById":116895,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T13:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the clarity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be interested to see how much revenue\u00A0Curse gains from being Squads partner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is Squad gaining from endorsing Curse?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, if Curse is making profit from the work of Squad and the community, shouldn\u0027t Squad be gaining something in return?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould Squad bring community mod distribution in-house and retain profit for themselves?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
