I\u0027m \u0022quite tech savvy\u0022 and I tend to get this every now and then. But this time, I may have been outsmarted.

It seems something is loading the CPU by 100%. However, even if I open the Task Manager \u002B Resource Monitor, I can\u0027t see what is using the CPU. But something IS killing the processing speed. It\u0027s impossible to do anything else really. Any attempt of opening anything will only slow it down until it wants to restart explorer.exe or anything (A window pops up with \u0022Microsoft Windows is no longer responding\u0022. Hitting restart will only cause it to freeze further).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I did so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used Win7 safemode and used Malwarebytes and Spybot Search\u0026amp;Destroy. It did kill the usual floating stuff, but the lagging is still there. Another problem I have is Free Avira. Now, this is probably my mistake. It hasn\u0027t really been updating all this time through. It\u0027s been stuck on this 2015 version. And it\u0027s always been acting up with blabla, you need admin rights (although I am logged in as admin) and I just stopped caring.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I wanted to see if I could use freeAvira to do a full scan, but it also won\u0027t load either now. And, well, if I let the computer load win7 in normal mode, it will only try to start Avira and just lag to oblivion ,_,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sorta came out of nowhere yesterday.

Was no big deal until it just simply started to lag/freeze out of nowhere. I know windows tends to act up. Usually, I could always rely on task manager, find the culprit .exe or whatever process and just rename it. However, this time, I can\u0027t even see any process really doing anything. And by the time stuff fill the list, it\u0027s already \u0022lagging\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere must be some sort of process/exe that is hidden and not showing up.

I have installed this product with and for people, and they seem to be happy. I agree with you that some products are outright obnoxious. A lot of \u0027free\u0027 versions that come with new computers tend to be fairly horrible in this regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last scentence is true, but as is always the case with security, you are wise to have multiple layers in place. The user is the most important part of the equation, but it helps to have a few safeguards in place if he fails.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223076040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496312564\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steve_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, steve_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that actually \u003Cem\u003Ereplace\u003C/em\u003E all the system files though?

With hashing and other technological tricks, you can be pretty sure you have the original files at hand. Of course, obliterating disks is no guarantee either, since malware could be nesting in firmware, the BIOS and in other places it is almost impossible to detect or get out of. The only way to be absolutely sure is to replace the hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
