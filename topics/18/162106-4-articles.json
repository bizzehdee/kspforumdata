As an (ex-)modder myself I\u0027m familiar with the way many mods work, and almost all of them had their developers reverse-engineer parts of KSP over the course of development of said mods. Now, it was mostly done to either work around some stock bugs/limitations or just to figure out how exactly things work (as we have NO documentation worthy of mentioning whatsoever), which is why Squad turned a blind eye to that by adopting a policy of \u0022don\u0027t tell, don\u0027t ask\u0022 (which is why a lot of regular players are completely unaware of this). And I\u0027m not talking about some obscure mods that nobody knows about - these are mods which top the list of most-often-used mods.Now, this practice did not in any way affect a business of Squad, which is why they were lenient on this, but lawyers are a different breed of people who care only about winning legal battles to make money on them (in order to justify their own existence and their big\u00A0paycheques), and legally they will be in the right. THIS is why a lot of modders are worried now - many of them invested thousands of hours of their free time into their creations out of their own affection to make the game better for everyone, and none of them want all this work to be in vain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-16T00:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2017 12:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by asmi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neroziat","CreatedById":169246,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T00:44:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027m rather horrified that squad supports a company like take two anyways, i feel like they will make a ksp 2.0 that has plenty of addon packs to buy and microtransactions, and we will all end up on a third party website playing the last good version of ksp with mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T00:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t be afraid it won\u0027t shut down ksp mods.
