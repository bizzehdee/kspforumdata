I had set my deadline for the 20th, and I finished the painting on the dot.

I don\u0027t have any collaborators of any kind, I work alone. I was short on time for doing it, but I did the best I could in the 4-5 days I had to do it. I would\u0027ve been mad at myself if I finished it later than the 20th. I\u0027m glad you enjoyed it. I try not to weep for our fallen hero, but sometimes it\u0027s a bit too much. I\u0027m still grieving for him, even though it\u0027s been almost a year. He was my one true hero to the very end. And whenever the full moon is out, I\u0027d ask, \u0022How\u0027s it going, Commander?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
