I was a member in good standing with a model radio control aircraft club for nearly 30 years. I joined in high school as a freshman and that was 97/98 school year. We as a club would have our dues come up in July at the meeting. Well as we know July is just days away. I was getting concerned that I had not yet seen the newsletter for June which would have the notice for the July meeting and when/ where it would be. I contacted at first the officer in charge of membership over a week ago and then a few days later having gotten 0 reply. Then yesterday I reached out to the vice president of the club seeking information. I finally got a reply back informing me the club dissolved. No word was sent out to members not on social media or not receiving the electronic newsletter or at the final meeting the dissolution occurred at. Im frustrated that this happened. Nearly 30 years dedicated in dues and loyalty to not be given the courtesy of being told the clubs gone before nearly spamming the entire leadership wanting to just be a good upstanding member.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n235606272024\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat really blows.\u00A0 Im very sorry that has happened.

Part of why I had no clue aside from the officer of the club in charge of members/membership is because I avoid social media like the plague. I have fb but have not used it since maybe 2014, instagram hasnt seen me post since my cat lia passed 5 years ago. Im irritated by them not respecting not only me (ive a nasty issue there too as it feels like a pattern to my existence) but the club as a whole that is like me and doesnt do social media, avoids crowds and prefers physical literature over digital bs. I stressed over this until finding out the club was gone all because they couldnt bother informing people. Worse yet the membership guy that i contacted prior to contacting the clubs vp NEVER BOTHERED TO REPLY!!!

I was confused why toys not related to a NASA themed movie set in the late 50\u0027s early 60\u0027s was popping up. Then I tried to search their departments not finding the one related to movies. I could not fathom why I couldnt find anything. Then I googled the query: did best buy stop selling movies. Answer? Yup. They have decided to cease all physical media sales other than video games as of the start of this year. I am sorry but what? I am wholeheartedly against only having access to digital copies of anything. It makes me nervous to only have digital copies of Elite Dangerous and MSFS2020 as examples. I do not fully own these copies, only my access to them that can frankly be revoked by Frontier or Microsoft at any time for any reason even if I have broken no rules. The same goes for e-books or digital copies of movies. Do any of you remember digital copies from Ultraviolet? I doubt most of you will. See, thats a problem. When you have only a digital copy of something you do not truly own it. Anyone a fan of the movie Dogma? If you do not have a copy good luck. You cannot stream it, you cannot buy it anywhere for cheap. Its impossible to find. If you had a digital copy of it, you dont now. That simple.
