In each case, the leader of a country steps off their\u00A0private aircraft and they, along with their entourage are escorted to a significant building in their capital city. Therefore, in each case, the social context remains much the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the first page, the aircraft is a lighter-than-air airship, and the leader and their entourage travel by horse drawn coach.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the second page, the aircraft is a modern jet airliner and the leader and their entourage travel by limousine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the third page, the aircraft is a point-to-point suborbital rocketship and the leader and their entourage travel by hovercar.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do each of those first pages affect your first impression of that book?\u00A0\u00A0What sort of expectations do they give you about the world that book is set in? The fine details of how those three aircraft work may or may not be important to the plot but I would argue that the general details of how they work \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E important parts of the \u00A0worldbuilding and setting the scene for the rest of the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking another, more concrete example, consider the \u003Cem\u003EKetty Jay\u003C/em\u003E series by Chris Wooding. The stories are set in a world in which aircraft are lighter than air yet propelled by \u0027prothane thrusters\u0027 which I\u0027ve always assumed to be a kind of jet engine. Aerodynamics isn\u0027t much of a factor for a lumbering freighter but is definitely a factor for the far more nimble fighter craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly how the aircraft\u00A0work is never quite explained and is almost irrelevant to the plot. There are a number of scenes which would need to be rewritten to work well with conventional aircraft but the import of those scenes could remain the same. Certainly the main characters and the ways they interact wouldn\u0027t need to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut... the odd blend of technologies that go into those aircraft is hugely important for setting the tone and feel of those stories. In short, they\u0027re a key part of the worldbuilding and what makes those stories so distinctive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-18T19:02:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2021 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T19:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223974777\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621364318\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the first page, the aircraft is a lighter-than-air airship, and the leader and their entourage travel by horse drawn coach.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the second page, the aircraft is a modern jet airliner and the leader and their entourage travel by limousine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the third page, the aircraft is a point-to-point suborbital rocketship and the leader and their entourage travel by hovercar.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFirefly\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T19:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223974796\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621366347\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFirefly\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly!\u00A0\u00A0I was going to mention \u003Cem\u003EFirefly\u003C/em\u003E in my last post but decided against it in the end.

In each case, the leader of a country steps off their\u00A0private aircraft and they, along with their entourage are escorted to a significant building in their capital city. Therefore, in each case, the social context remains much the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the first page, the aircraft is a lighter-than-air airship, and the leader and their entourage travel by horse drawn coach.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the second page, the aircraft is a modern jet airliner and the leader and their entourage travel by limousine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the third page, the aircraft is a point-to-point suborbital rocketship and the leader and their entourage travel by hovercar.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do each of those first pages affect your first impression of that book?\u00A0\u00A0What sort of expectations do they give you about the world that book is set in? The fine details of how those three aircraft work may or may not be important to the plot but I would argue that the general details of how they work \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E important parts of the \u00A0worldbuilding and setting the scene for the rest of the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking another, more concrete example, consider the \u003Cem\u003EKetty Jay\u003C/em\u003E series by Chris Wooding. The stories are set in a world in which aircraft are lighter than air yet propelled by \u0027prothane thrusters\u0027 which I\u0027ve always assumed to be a kind of jet engine. Aerodynamics isn\u0027t much of a factor for a lumbering freighter but is definitely a factor for the far more nimble fighter craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly how the aircraft\u00A0work is never quite explained and is almost irrelevant to the plot.

The setting is the universe the story exists in. So anything you can conceive within that universe is worldbuilding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for what place to begin working from, there\u0027s no correct answer. I start with a map, and add interesting locations. A good harbor, strategic mountain pass, a sea, or whatever. Or, for space, the general population and resource distribution, and the \u0022terrain\u0022 of the star system or galactic arm or whatever. This gives me ideas for the political situations and such. That approach is good for an epic saga of international proportions, but maybe not so good for a story set in one small location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERear Window\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eworldbuilding consisted of a single apartment complex.
