I hope you\u0027re all having a great day. I\u0027d like to share a video I produced recently. A friend and I re-did all the sound in this 3 minute scene from Five Deadly Venoms. It\u0027s a funny little adaptation of the original dialog. Along with all new sound effects recorded in my own apartment. A real tribute to foley design.\n\n**It\u0027s entered in a competition. Please vote on it by clicking \u0022like.\u0022**\n\nHaving said that, I hope you like it yourself. Thank you!\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153126874034395\u0026fref=nf](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153126874034395\u0026fref=nf)"}]}
