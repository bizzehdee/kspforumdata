For a long time, science was referred to as \u0022natural philosophy\u0022. Since Wikipedia deals primarily in factual things, which tend to have origins in the sciences, they naturally tend to drive back to philosophy. Likewise with \u0022softer\u0022 things, like religion and works of fiction. Religion is on its own a type of philosophy, so no real problem there. Works of fiction take you through literature, which in turn goes eventually to philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Greeks viewed philosophy as the \u0022base case\u0022 of all the sciences - maybe they were onto something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the maximum number of steps, let\u0027s break it down from a mathematical point of view:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretical maximum is the total number of articles for a given language wiki.

This is far more common than the above case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what has been discussed leads to an interesting conclusion - that, after a certain amount of time, the articles tend to \u0022converge\u0022 down certain pathways, which lead inevitably to the article on philosophy, with articles of increasing breadth (greater abstractness) being more highly trafficked. This, in turn, implies that a tree-like structure, with philosophy as the root node, could be used to answer this question (but with the rather odd construction method of building the tree from the branches inward, rather than the other way around). The most distant branch, naturally, represents the article that requires the most steps to reach philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I propose a different question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking any of the wikilinks in a given article, which one would send us to philosophy the fastest (i.e. fewest clicks)?

For a long time, science was referred to as \u0022natural philosophy\u0022. Since Wikipedia deals primarily in factual things, which tend to have origins in the sciences, they naturally tend to drive back to philosophy. Likewise with \u0022softer\u0022 things, like religion and works of fiction. Religion is on its own a type of philosophy, so no real problem there. Works of fiction take you through literature, which in turn goes eventually to philosophy.\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient Greeks viewed philosophy as the \u0022base case\u0022 of all the sciences - maybe they were onto something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the maximum number of steps, let\u0027s break it down from a mathematical point of view:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretical maximum is the total number of articles for a given language wiki.

This is far more common than the above case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what has been discussed leads to an interesting conclusion - that, after a certain amount of time, the articles tend to \u0022converge\u0022 down certain pathways, which lead inevitably to the article on philosophy, with articles of increasing breadth (greater abstractness) being more highly trafficked.
