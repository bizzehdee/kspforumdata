But i heard that GP2\u0027s rings are going to be based on the same code which weather will be implemented. If you want planets now, you can get Krag\u0027s Planetfactory mod which adds a second gas planet with rings and a cool system of moons(including a moon with rings:cool: ). Also, rings around a small rocky world will be very rare, they will need to be far from the planet and very spread out, otherwise the rings will disperse. But it\u0027ll still be a spectacular sight:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
