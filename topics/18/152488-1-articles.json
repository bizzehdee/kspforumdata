A few days ago I was flying a model rocket (which was my first launch of an \u0022E\u0022 engine) and, well, it sort of exploded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetails: It was an Estes E9-6 engine. The rocket was an Estes Magician. When it launched, the propellant, cap, and nozzle separated from the cardboard engine casing and blasted up through the rocket, breaking it in two and melting the paratrooper I had stuffed inside. This was not an engine\u00A0mount failure, the mount was perfectly fine and the empty (no nozzle or anything) cardboard engine casing was still in the rocket after the failure. The clay cap in the rocket engine may have been partially cracked, the other two in the package are sort of cracked (although it is hard to tell if this is normal - this was my first \u0022E\u0022 engine launch) and that may have contributed to the breakup of the engine. As far as I know, I stored the engines properly. They were stored in my basement, which can get a bit chilly but is usually at\u00A0a constant temperature. Not sure about humidity, but if it helps I live in Iowa. The engines are less that\u00A0two years old, and I have successfully\u00A0fired engines stored in these same conditions for\u00A0around three years, although they were not \u0022E\u0022 size.\u00A0The temperature at the time of launch was cold, but above freezing. I also flew another rocket that day, but it wasn\u0027t an \u0022E\u0022 and the engine did not fail (although the rocket sort of did). I can provide more details, pictures of the empty casing and other two engines, and two separate camera angles of the failure if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is this - is it safe to use the other two engines that came in the package? And if not, would adding some glue to reinforce the clay cap fix the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T20:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222862135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152488\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479930081\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n54 minutes ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is this - is it safe to use the other two engines that came in the package?

\u00A0Sudden temp changes can also do Bad Things\u2122 to rocket motors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with the others that you absolutely should NOT do anything with the motors. \u00A0Any tampering with them will void any chance you have of getting anything for them, and will definitely make YOU responsible for any injuries and/or property damage that comes from it. \u00A0I might also suggest joining the National Association of Rocketry ( www.NAR.org ) and finding a local section to fly with. \u00A0The best things that the NAR can provide is information, a $1,000,000 insurance policy covering you for damage/injuries from defective rockets (provided you\u0027ve followed the safety code) and Sport Rocketry magazine (or whatever they\u0027re calling it nowadays). \u00A0AFAIK, the insurance has never had to be used, although there have been attempts, but they ended up turned down because they violated the safety code in one way or the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last bit of advice I can give you is to check out The Rocketry Forum:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/forum.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rocketryforum.com\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t been there in a long time, but it\u0027s still very active, and you might get better help there, as well as seeing stuff that just might make you want to get some power tools and start saving money for BIG projects. \u00A0Like this (yeah, that\u0027s me, and that\u0027s also my Pershing 1A model sitting on the table):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iGDJrB0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGDJrB0.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also this display and talk I did for fifth and sixth graders a couple years before I quit rocketry (no money, space, or time):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cBmJvKn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022687\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cBmJvKn.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat red metallic cylinder in the top right image?
