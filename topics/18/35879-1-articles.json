I committed to buy an item several weeks ago and paid right away. A few weeks later it still is processing by Paypal, so I contacted the seller about it. They said they couldn\u0027t see the payment record in ebay, and asked for my personal email adress so they could send me the payment request. Of course transactions outside of ebay are not allowed and they might be faudulent, so I haven\u0027t replied to the email. The only thing I can find about cancelling purchases on ebay says I have to ask the seller and it\u0027s up to them. What if I ask and they say no, I have to pay? I can\u0027t pay outside of ebay. I don\u0027t want anything happening to my account either (It can be limited or suspended if you don\u0027t pay for things you committed to buy. It\u0027s not like they\u0027ve sent the item or anything. What can I do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T15:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPaypal introduced a thing recently called \u0027Pay After Delivery\u0027 where your payment isn\u0027t processed for 14 days.
