The two recent videos I did also required me to start recording from the desktop, then alt\u002Btab back into KSP and edit that out later.\n\nIt appears to be an issue with Unity, and I can\u0027t find any recent information on it.\n\n[https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/796519/issues-with-shadowplay/](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/796519/issues-with-shadowplay/) \u003C-- External link"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T22:00:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I get this too.
