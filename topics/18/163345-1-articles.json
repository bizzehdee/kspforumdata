Cute dog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of our dogs got hit by a truck when I was a teenager. Funny story, in hindsight. We had a fenced yard to keep the dog in, but on this particular day a friend of my dad\u0027s had come over to drop off some stuff, and he had backed his truck into the driveway, so the gate for the driveway was open. Well the dog snuck around the truck when we weren\u0027t looking and got out of the yard. He got out into the street and this big 4x4 pickup came roaring up the street and ran right over him. We heard the thump and the yelp and ran out and got him. He was messed up pretty bad, broken rib, collapsed lung, dislocated hip. But we got him to the vet and got him patched up and he was okay. But there were two lingering effects:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. That dog would not voluntarily leave the yard ever again. We could leave the gate wide open and walk away, and he would just stand there and peek out. Like the second he set foot out there again that truck was going to come out of nowhere and get him. If we were taking him somewhere, like the vet or something, we had to pick him up and carry him out of the yard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. His right rear leg was trussed up and immobilized for three weeks because of the dislocation. For the rest of his life, whenever he got in trouble (and, let me tell you, that dog was trouble) as he was skulking away he would pull up his right rear leg and limp on it, like it was trussed up again.
