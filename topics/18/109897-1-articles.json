It\u0027s been designed by the developers to take away most, if not all of the files. It\u0027ll be in the folder that the file\u0027s installed in, usually with a name like \u0022Uninstall \u003Cprogram name=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u0022, \u0022Uninstall\u0022, or \u0022Unins000\u0022. If there are files left, just delete them using the standard delete function; The program that used the files doesn\u0027t exist on your HDD anymore so there won\u0027t be any dependency issues. I never got a definite answer as to why programs do this, but I think that because it\u0027s in documents the uninstall program can\u0027t delete them.\u003C/program\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T14:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**\n  \nI Need a Copyeditor anymore..."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:23:57Z","Content":"The issue is knowing *where to look.* Do you know off-hand which C:\\Program Files\\whatever\\ folder a program installed into a couple of years ago (especially if you manually set the install folder)?

Most programs are pretty self-contained, and the uninstallers work just fine cleaning up, other than sometimes leaving empty foders. The problem is not knowing whether that\u0027s the case.\n\nI\u0027m wary because it\u0027s not just cheapies that are the problem. We have a program at work that clutters up two different folders in Application Data and eats all my user network storage without periodic cleaning. I got sick of that and wrote a .bat file that does it for me each login. The program happens to be CATIA v5, which costs tens of thousands of dollars for the installs we\u0027re dealing with.\n\nWe also have Patran, which in the past started by default in C:\\Windows\\Temp. Check your temp folders too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T16:04:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pincushionman**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:02:12Z","Content":"My experience has seen that most programs **do not** do a full uninstall. It is not uncommon for files and folders to be left behind, stuff that contains user data and/or settings ... under the premise that you might one day want to re-install. And not only are files and folders left behind, so are *registry entries*. Some of the worst offenders for doing this are big names, like Microsoft and McAfee and Norton and AOL (just to name a *very scant* few).\n\nManually editing the registry to remove such junk is possible (I do it all the time), but I would not recommend it unless you really know what you\u0027re doing. Instead, there are utility programs (some free) which can scan and clean the junk from your registry for you - usually providing a list of suspect stuff and then asking you if any of it was recently uninstalled. [CCleaner by Piriform](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner), yes, is one such utility; Another I\u0027ve used in the past was [jv16 PowerTools](https://www.macecraft.com/). I\u0027ve not used jv16 in a while, so I guess I\u0027ll have to check it out again - nice to see it\u0027s still around."}]}
