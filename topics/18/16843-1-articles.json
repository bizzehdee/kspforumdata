You can get LPEs to work without doing that, but they have to be simple and small so as to allow the cylinders to work with minimal resistance.

Lego Technic was probably my favourite toy back in the day! Not too long ago I was at a friends house and he happened to have some boxes full of the stuff. I found some caterpillar tracks and within a few minutes I\u0027d managed to build myself an elastic-band powered tank. Because I used a worm reduction gear it had enough torque to climb almost anything grippy and a range of maybe ten meters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of model engines, I used to play around with Nitro off-road R/C trucks. Eventually I ended up stripping the little engine down, smoothed over the porting for smoother fuel/air/exhaust flow and spent a good couple of hours carefully polishing the piston and cylinder head liner with Brasso metal polish. I swear throttle response and high-end RPM were vastly improved, but I didn\u0027t have a dyno on hand so I couldn\u0027t quantify the improvement. I even considered enlarging the ports for more aggressive intake timings but I subsequently read online that even a slight miscalculation in the modification could ruin the 150GBP engine, so I chickened out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T15:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI once built a lego single-cylinder engine with leftovers, I\u0027ll see if I can find a picture of it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It ran at at best 60rpm. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: found some images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/8824/dsc0423nx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dsc0423nx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1858/dsc0551bg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dsc0551bg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe enormous mass of gearing runs to the flywheel which keeps the engine turning over, albeit slowly.
