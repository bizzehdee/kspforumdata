Her name is Marah. She is beautiful and funny and smart. We are good friends but I have developed a MASSIVE crush on her recently. I don\u0027t know what to do because Muslims can\u0027t date properly. But they also can\u0027t marry non-Muslims. I\u0027m an Agnostic which isn\u0027t that bad I guess. But the main problem is that we won\u0027t be friends anymore if she rejects me. I have developed a note on which to sneak on her desk later this week. It says \u0022Hey it\u0027s Nathan, just to let you know I think you\u0027re beautiful and really\u00A0fun to hang out with. You make me smile when you are happy and around. I understand if you can\u0027t date me or wan\u0027t to. I will be there and I understand our relationship wouldn\u0027t be easy if you did say yes. But there\u0027s the saying \u0022Not because it is easy\u0027 but because it is hard\u0022. If you do say yes I will be glad to do whatever we need to to be together. either way I will respect your descision. ,Best regards your friend Nathan\u0022. I don\u0027t expect anyone to respond with advice that would help me decide to ask her out or not but hell it\u0027s the KSP community we can do anything. Right? Anyway any help would be appreciated.

When you stop by, maybe she gives you a big toothy ear-to-ear smile; again, she can say she\u0027s just trying to be friendly. But between the two of you, if there is in fact mutual interest, signals have been exchanged. So you decide to escalate, but only slightly; again, it has to be something that could have two meanings depending on how she feels, such as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Foxster\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s coffee date, which could be spent platonically complaining about co-workers as friends or alternately talking about more personal subjects. Eventually, the signalling can accumulate to a point where you feel confident enough to suggest a \u0022real\u0022 date like dinner and a movie (I guess it\u0027s Netflix now?), and if she says Yes to that, then the flirting stage is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the key concept is that at each step, there are clear but subtle signals that each person can give to indicate \u0022yes\u0022 or \u0022no\u0022 without having to actually say it. And it\u0027s not about \u003Cem\u003Emaking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0her like you back; you can\u0027t pick one person and make it happen like that.
