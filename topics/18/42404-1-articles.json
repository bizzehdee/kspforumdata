However for that price I\u0027m pretty sure you could find nearly the same laptop with 8Gb of ram. My laptop cost me about 830$ and has an A-10, 8Gb of ram and dual graphics.

For most games I play, I can run them from upper medium to max settings, this includes The Witcher 2. KSP on the other hand, I can run at max for medium sized ships (about around 150 parts for me) before I start feeling crippling lag. One thing you should note is that the vents for the s55 are rather small and on the bottom, so you have to elevate the back it, also the heat sink is right side were you would rest your hands, so it can get pretty warm there after a while. But over all, I\u0027m happy with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshiewowa","CreatedById":74879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T15:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use a Gateway NE56R34u running Windows 8.
