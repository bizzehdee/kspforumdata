I would think brick is much more expensive than wood-frame, especially if the brick needs to be shipped a long distance. Many houses in southern Ontario are brick because there was a ready supply of good clay in the area. My area recently approved wood-frame apartments up to 4 storeys high now, with proper sprinkler systems, of course. Again, economics: wood is cheap here, and it\u0027s a carbon sink, unlike concrete\u00A0 and steel or fired bricks.
