But it\u0027s just how it would work. You get more DeltaV and energy if you don\u0027t try to reuse the boosters. On high energy trajectories, it would help out quite a bit. Not to mention that landing from high energy trajectories isn\u0027t an easy thing to do... (not as high energy as the upper stage and payload, but quite a bit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T22:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently the center core of an F9H will be different than the single stick F9 or the F9H side boosters (which should be the same design).
