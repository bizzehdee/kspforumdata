In this time, a (very good) friend used to send me scans of what they had done at school that day, and I\u0027d copy them down on my notebooks, I also had a couple of those personal teachers for mathematics, physics, and chemistry. So when I got back, I was at the same level as my classmates. BUT my spanish teacher didn\u0027t like it, and he made it very, \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E clear. Dude simply hated me! There were many times when I would simply lack the time to finish my homework (because I was doing lots of tests to validate my first semester), and he wouldn\u0027t even take my notebook. He rated my work very low just because he wanted to. One time, he made us write a chronicle about a manned Venus mission, and I was like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh man, I\u0027m gonna get you this time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started doing research on the Apollo fly-by proposal, and wrote a badass three-page chronicle using the most complicated technoblabble I could find, and terminology.

He still works there, but we have a new teacher this year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My religion teacher. Oh, my religion teacher... Where do I start? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s one of those guys who believe abortion is against god\u0027s will and euthanasia is the devil\u0027s work. Most people where I live are catholic, so my teacher thought it would be a good idea to do one of those \u0022draw Jesus being good with people\u0022 things. Even though he\u0027s a very nice guy, he\u0027s the worst religion teacher I\u0027ve ever had. I\u0027ve always been opposed to the idea that religion should be taught in schools, so that kinda makes it worse. We\u0027ve always had some of those \u0022Atheist vs. Religious\u0022 unintentional debates, which are kinda fun. We get to talk to each other and talk about the topic in hand instead of avoiding it, and as an atheist, I feel like I should be the image of a good atheist for my classmates. Question what doesn\u0027t seem right, ask why it is so, but don\u0027t be offensive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut everything changed when he started a class with one of those work guides that basically explained why atheism was bad and how \u0027we\u0027 should cure it. It was the most offensive and childish thing he had ever done to us. One of my close friends stared at me as I read through the first page, and when I got to the end, almost half of my classmates were sharing evasive stares at me. They knew I was pissed and I knew it too. So I patiently got up and asked my teacher what did that thing mean. I bet he could see I was getting red, because he immediately started explaining himself, and saying that guide was intended for those who believed in that thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat followed was the most intense, frightening, and mature moment I have ever had in my school years. I proceeded to let out an internal scream in the form of gentle but penetrating words, telling him how childish and offensive that little piece of paper was. I asked him how he would feel if I started handing out papers that said we should cure christians, and continued rambling on him for about five minutes. All that time I was standing up and looking through his black eyes and into his soul, while my classmates were sitting down and quietly staring at both of us in shock. I finished my ramble with something like \u0022\u003Cem\u003EI expected much more of somebody like you when I first saw you. Guess I was wrong\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. Then we stood there staring at each other for about 15 seconds, and then my buddies slowly started clapping. My teacher sat down first, and then I returned to my work group and sat down. They knew the class was over as soon as I stood up and started arguing with my teacher, so they had already packed their stuff. It was then when I realized what I had done. Blood was running through my veins, my pupils were so dilated I could almost see through the walls, and I could have crushed a concrete brick with a single hand if I had wanted to. I was like a war machine, ready for battle, but that wasn\u0027t gonna work against a detention. My teacher just sat at his desk, scribbling on a piece of paper, and you could almost see he was about to cry. I completely demoralized him and felt kinda sorry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, the next class he explained everybody why atheism wasn\u0027t bad and \u0027God still loves atheists\u0027, and then made us work on other religions too, until the end of the year. This year he was the first teacher I spotted in my first day, and he kindly guided me to my classroom. I guess that moment was like a learning experience to both of us, and it was just a way to say \u0022stop it!\u0022 when he reached too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMan, I wrote a lot. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut please read it. pleeeeeaaaase!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T17:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy 10th grade English teacher.

It was a school that, at the time, had about 50 students so it was clear to everyone that I was bullied, since the guy who made it happen was such a little Hitler that he even got the 6th graders against me. Every single teacher there just pretended it wasn\u0027t happening. Because of that, even after the bullies went to a different school for 3rd class, I was left so emotionally unstable that every time I got a bad grade or sth I got pissed off and started throwing stuff across the classroom etc. The teachers just ignored me when that happened. No one asked why. Then, in 5th, I started getting Russian classes. That teacher also gave me a few other subjects. She didn\u0027t just ignore me. No. She punished me, made fun of me, made sure that everyone would know about it, basically did everything she could to make it worse. About then the school started hiring some teachers that would do more than just shoot the breeze about problems so I was sent to the school psychiatrist. That didn\u0027t make it any better, though. Then, after 6th grade, when that school finally ended, I went to a bigger school (1400\u002B students) with some serious mental problems. Didn\u0027t help that even though 2 of my former classmates came to the same school, they were put in a different class so I was now alone, too. A few years later I met that teacher again and she acted as if we had always gotten along nicely. It was almost as hard not to punch her that day as it is to avoid badwords in this text.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T02:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have good memories of my sixth grade social studies class.

While I was there, I did \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have a nice class. They basically took every opportunity they could to mistreat me (although I now suspect it was related to their even stranger parents) and liked to exclude me or make fun of me. When I talked to the teacher about it, she ended up saying how the best way to get over it was to \u0022get a big group of friends\u0022 - which, of course, I didn\u0027t have. After that, I don\u0027t think my teacher ever did anything else about it. Nothing ever happened to anyone who mistreated me, and the only reason they stopped was because I moved away. Part it continuing for so long was due to there being little bullying awareness in the German school system, but I think some actual action would have helped a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryn","CreatedById":5407,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh, Miss Kent.
