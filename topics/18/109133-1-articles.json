I saw a car flying away, and a guy on the sidewalk. The guy had been hit. His 2 girl friends screamed, and looked out my window. 3 people called an ambulance, and they got there in 5 minutes. Unfortunately, even with the help of my neighbor, Bill, he died. They\u0027re all still out there, I think they\u0027re trying to save his life. He is dead though. Very terrifying.

People respond in different ways. Some just break down, some feel the need to share their story (which is probably why this thread exists), while others need to distract themselves. However, not responding or processing the the whole deal, of which even a stranger dying is a pretty big one, hardly seems like a healthy coping strategy. Maybe you cannot even call it that, as people are not coping.\n\nThe fact that I have to explain the discord between a fairly major event happing in front of your eyes and having little to no emotional response scares me a bit. Maybe I can illuminate my point a little better with someone else\u0027s story. Both reacting excessively (like PTSD soldiers overreacting to fireworks) or not at all to major events can be signs that something is wrong.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While appearing on Inside the Actors Studio in 2006, Laurie discussed his struggle with severe clinical depression. He continues to receive regular treatment from a psychotherapist. He told host James Lipton that **he first concluded he had a problem whilst driving in a charity demolition derby, during which he realised that seeing two cars collide and explode in front of him caused him to be neither excited nor frightened**, but bored. \u0022Boredom,\u0022 he commented, \u0022is not an appropriate response to exploding cars.\u0022\n\n[Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Laurie)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:15:30Z","Content":"Something upsetting happened, and a forum member needed to vent about it.
