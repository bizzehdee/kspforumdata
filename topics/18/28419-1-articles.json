In the olde days, it was gold, jewels, and such. For the new it\u0027s what ever costs or is of value to someone else. Once the term \u0022pirate\u0022 gets thrown around, you are opening up a can of worms that will bring swift retribution from those in power. Originally freemen, pirates became hated, and now again loved by all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found that on these forums, discussions of this matter tend to get negative reflections or are designed to weed out suspected pirates. If there is one thing the \u0022Geek Squad\u0022 hates is pirates that would rather shoot the bloody thing than get it fixed. I speak from experience as where I ran a sword through a laptop cause it angered me. Easy come easy go. On these forums, I am a participant that is tolerated by most, in the real world, I am known simply as Pirate. I work on cars, have my own shop, known as Pirate Automotive. I dress the part, always has. I have declared myself for many years, Omaha\u0027s original and only pirate.

I can\u0027t remember what the name o\u0027 the ship was y\u0027see, because I got hit in the head by thar cannon and i went to sleep. When I woke up I saw me matey\u0027s ship sailin\u0027 away, and I was on an island! I only had me clothes and a cannonball, and about 2 gold pieces worth of cannon powder. Now, another one o\u0027 me mateys showed me how to look for food and drink on islands, so I started a-lookin\u0027. I found a few o\u0027 them yellow things that looked like one o\u0027 me pistols, and I found a wee bit o\u0027 drinkable water. Now, I was on that island for many a fortnight, but one day I got up early, and I saw a good-sized tradin\u0027 ship. I swum out to the ship and killed most o\u0027 her crew, keepin\u0027 a few to give me some crew for meself. From there I built that small ship up to be the finest warship for 300 Miles. Her name be The Soul Trader, and she\u0027s still goin\u0027 on. I don\u0027t know how I got me name either. I\u0027ve asked a lot o\u0027 me mateys how I got me name, but they don\u0027t know either. I got me 4 Flintlock pistols, 2 Cutlasses, 1 Sword I pludered from one of those British ships, 1,000 gold pieces worth of Cannon Powder, and a collection over 50 ships sailin\u0027 all of the seven seas. I still got that cannonball from the island, and i\u0027ll be givin\u0027 it to one o\u0027 me crew If I die. I sail The Soul Trader all by meself, and i\u0027ve even made a little mechanism to allow a matey to fire and load up the cannons from the captain\u0027s chair. Me mateys from me 50 ships meet up once a year on the south pole for 5 weeks to total up the gold and have a good time. We plunder beer food and gin from the trading ships before we meet up, and we drink it all up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-23T15:43:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2013 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T15:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYar!
