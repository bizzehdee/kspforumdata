AMD chips are much slower than Intel chips at the same clock rate, and the architecture shares floating point units between pairs of cores, so if both cores need to do floating point math, they simply can\u0027t and have to stop dead while they wait for the other unrelated workflow to finish. Games, particularly games like KSP, use large amounts of floating point math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD has run a very successful marketing campaign where they\u0027ve convinced large numbers of people to buy their inferior products, because it has more cores. The problem is, most applications can\u0027t do anything with more cores. Applications which scale well with additional cores are fairly rare, and generally Intel chips outperform the AMD chips anyway because of the massive difference in efficiency and the fact that your chip effectively loses half its cores when presented with floating point workloads.

It seems the 8320, 8350 and 9590 are all the same silicon (fun fact, AMD initially planned to sell the FX 9590 for $800, despite it being the exact same chip they\u0027d been selling for $150 for a year). The only differences is the 8350 and 9590 have been \u0022binned\u0022 (AMD pulled the best chips aside to guarantee performance) and run at higher stock settings. The differences in benchmarks are likely due to differences in popularity of the chips. More 8350s means the best 8350 benchmarks are better than the best benchmarks for the other two chips. The best 8320 is, theoretically, identical to the best 8350 and best 9590, due to random chance. However you\u0027ll see a higher average on the 9590 because of the binning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you don\u0027t have a ton of overclocking headroom, because you\u0027re effectively already overclocked from 4.0 to 4.7 GHz, and AMD chips are already running ludicrously hot (220W, compared to 84W for a 4770k). However, you do have a binned chip, so you should be able to take it over 5.0 GHz without \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much trouble. Average overclock on an FX 9590 with air cooling, according to HWBot, is 5.135 GHz, or about 10% over stock. It\u0027s not much, but if you can manage it without upgrading your cooling system, then it\u0027s literally free performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think buying a new CPU cooler for this is probably a waste, though. You just don\u0027t have enough headroom to justify investing any money into overclocking. Your next opportunity for significantly better CPU performance is likely going to be the next CPU launch by AMD. Unfortunately, AMD recently announced that they aren\u0027t going to have anything for the enthusiast CPU space, and the FX series of processors is at an end. Their focus is increasingly on power efficiency for low cost APUs and mobile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe power desktop space, I\u0027m afraid, has been completely abandoned by AMD.
