It looks like they are making some good headway towards delivering what they showed. I particularly liked the idea of being able to tailor the solar system to your liking before starting a match. However it\u0027s lack of stability has kept me from buying it thus far. I don\u0027t mind a glitchy or incomplete beta experience, but constant CTD is too much of a deal-breaker, and that still happens quite often from what Ive seen around. Once it gets a bit more stable I\u0027ll probably pick it up though, it looks like a ton of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"air805ronin","CreatedById":40948,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf its has as enjoyable battles as Total Annihilation I\u0027ll totally buy it, but all I\u0027ve read of it how much is crashes and I\u0027m not ready to spend my money on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T21:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe space lounge isn\u0027t facebook, kid\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to say that to this guy you had better go through 90% of the space lounge and say the exact same thing....
