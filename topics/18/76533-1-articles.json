I\u0027ve been contemplating the idea of building my own custom controller for KSP or any game really. I don\u0027t have a clue what I\u0027m doing as far as the Arduino Due clone I bought, but I have a (very) small amount of knowledge in programming (VB.Net to be specific) and basic electrical systems. This thread is just a general project thread that will hopefully continue past the first post. I put it in this forum because I wasn\u0027t sure it was entirely KSP specific at this moment but it eventually will be, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst was the microcontroller itself. Right now it\u0027s in a configuration for a test sketch I was running... Basically what it does is I give it input over SerialUSB and it forces the \u0027virtual keyboard\u0027 to type it back to me, with a short pause and a blink of the LED for each character. Simple, but you have to start somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140702_152854.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002220140702_152854.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is the fact that I don\u0027t feel like spending a bunch of money on a 3 axis joystick plus potentiometers and such for my testing phase, without knowing how far I\u0027m actually going to go with this. Next best thing, and a learning experience in the process? Cannibalizing an old RC helicopter remote for some pieces so I can nail down the concepts here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140702_152728.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002220140702_152728.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem... The cheap-o 15w soldering iron I bought (once again, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here!) doesn\u0027t get hot enough to actually do anything useful, much less desolder anything. I managed to get some of the excess off but it\u0027s still holding on pretty tight. So I went to Radio Shack today to buy a 40-60w plug in soldering iron, but I accidentally the whole store. I walked out with about $80 worth of stuff, although the $30 IR Thermometer isn\u0027t entirely related to this project (it\u0027s just really cool... err, I mean useful for diagnosing computer and car problems and generally knowing the temperature of things). I ordered the helping hands online along with the solder pump and wick, and the first (red) battery operated soldering iron. So much for not spending a bunch of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140702_152019.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002220140702_152019.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the rest of my arsenal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140702_154400.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002220140702_154400.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my first order of business will be to get some of these useful components off of the remote and wire something up to accept joystick inputs. Or something similar. I\u0027m debating whether I\u0027ll try to use Zitronen\u0027s plugin to make it act like a \u0022real\u0022 joystick (I haven\u0027t even looked at the plugin yet, so that\u0027s another rabbit hole altogether), or just start by manually calibrating a threshold at which it will emulate a keypress (WASD). By the time this is said and done I definitely want it to act like a real joystick to fine tune everything, possibly with a custom precision mode wired to a switch assuming that\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoals for this project:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Learn how to use an Arduino. I might be a little in over my head with the Due, I bought that one against my better judgement and the advice of pretty much anyone who has ever used one, as they aren\u0027t very beginner friendly. What can I say, I\u0027m hard headed and I wanted the extra pins. Luckily I\u0027m usually pretty good at \u0022figuring stuff out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Learn how to use an Arduino \u003Cem\u003Eproperly\u003C/em\u003E.

Most of my electrical knowledge is from 12v automotive related stuff and a tiny bit of 110v house wiring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Prove to myself that I can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bring a new sense of enjoyment to playing my favorite sandbox game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Joysticks for ship control and camera rotation, possibly one for RCS alone. Preferably 3-axis to avoid clutter, and possibly a \u00224 axis\u0022 (hardware button) for SAS or precision mode toggle on the main stick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Buttons or switches for RCS, SAS, stage control, view control (staging, map, IVA, etc), gear, lights, brakes, precision mode, pot slider or knob for throttle, a few actions groups, ?????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-LCD display for time to x (maneuver node, AP, PE), altitude, relative speed, vertical speed, stage fuel levels, ????? (some of these may end up being analog meters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I\u0027m still wrapping my head around all this. Any input, suggestions, comments, questions, etc are welcome and encouraged. I\u0027ll post updates here as I go, but I\u0027m not going to promise anyone including myself any sort of specific schedule, and I hope it won\u0027t be considered a necro to update my own thread if I fall behind a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T21:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s time to science!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*SCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways corrections aside are you considering:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This controller\u0027s equivalent of an X key?

It may or may not actually work that way, but I fixed the variable and I\u0027m going to wire it up properly next time I play with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It seems I\u0027ve had a small break of success with the joystick. It\u0027s not acting \u0022quite\u0022 right and the serial output is garbage, but I was able to fly a rocket on a suborbital flight with it and twirl around a bit (with the plastic finger friendly piece added). I\u0027m pretty sure this wiring is somehow wrong because the \u0022not quite right\u0022 part is mostly while using more than one axis, but I\u0027ll figure it out when I\u0027m not as tired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140703_030401.jpg~original\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/Custom%20Controller%20Project/20140703_030401.jpg~original\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually going well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027m out $3000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all seriousness, if this isn\u0027t nearly as a pain to get set up as it might seem, I would need one of these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T06:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Special Agent Sigvan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Special Agent Sigvan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIT\u0027S A NEW SHOW ON AMC...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I don\u0027t watch much TV...
