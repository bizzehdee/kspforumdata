For the past two years, it has been possible for an attacker to read out plain private keys, usernames, emails, passwords and other such information from the TLS heartbeat. This attack leaves no trace on the affected server and could be performed indefinitely often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 66% of all secure connections on the entire internet today rely on this vulnerable version of OpenSSL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fix has been provided together with the announcement, but due to the untraceable attack, nobody has any idea of the magnitude at which this was exploited, or or who used it and since when. This has potential to be one of the single biggest security breaches to ever exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T13:41:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T09:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I saw an article on it today.
