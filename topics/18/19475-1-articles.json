When I was young, TOS was the only thing out there -- there weren\u0027t even any movies. I developed a love for it, since it was the only thing really like itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen TNG came out, I was skeptical that another crew could be interesting. And to be honest, the first season kind of confirmed that. (Unbeknownst to me, Roddenberry had decided to rule that there would be no interpersonal conflict among crew members. That, and the fact that a lot of the plots were simple re-hashes of some TOS plots, brought me close to just walking away.) But as the series matured, it really grew on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt evidently grew on a lot of people, since they started making other series in the same era: DS9 and VOY. I realized as I was watching it, though, that I missed the feeling in TOS of \u0022We\u0027re out here and we have no idea what we\u0027re doing\u0022 that were in a lot of TOS episodes. By TNG era, they seemed to understand space travel pretty well. In TOS, they seemed to be flying more frequently by the seat of their collective pants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time ENT came around, then, my fandom had wrapped back around to TOS. I tried to get into ENT, but it seemed much more sloppily written to my eyes; your mileage may vary, of course. (Plus, TOS had a sort of campy feel to it that reminded the audience that This Was All Pretend. I\u0027m still a little freaked out when people say, apparently in all seriousness, that Trek represents \u003Cstrong\u003Efuture history\u003C/strong\u003E, or that its treatment of science is unparalleled in its accuracy.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for my money, Mr. Spock is \u003Cstrong\u003Estill\u003C/strong\u003E one of the most intriguing characters ever to appear in American televised science fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still enjoy Trek whenever I bump into it; the stories are often engaging, and certainly more thought-provoking than a lot of television.

I wonder if there\u0027s a strange kind of peaceful homogenization taking place on Earth, though, even so. I\u0027ve heard that a handful of languages are on their last generation, for example, because the native populations that speak them are being absorbed into the larger culture that surrounds them. As media travels ever more quickly and becomes even more widespread, will national differences become blurry and largely disappear after a few generations? It\u0027s an intriguing thought, if somewhat chilling (I rather like the diversity of humanity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, since geographical separation seems to deepen cultural differences, perhaps becoming a spacefaring race will merely cause the diversity of the human species to show itself more deeply along different lines -- Earth\u0027s differences will be closer to, say, the differences between modern-day provinces than between modern-day countries, but the cultural differences between Earth and Mars will be much more readily noticeable. It\u0027s also interesting to observe that certain physiological traits tend to crop up in geographically isolated populations (e.g., red hair). Some people even claim to be able to pick out nationalities based on facial characteristics. As genetic pockets in different regions of space develop, I wonder if certain physiological traits will be emphasized in certain populations, and what those might be.

Unfortunately, the rate of change is very slow; radical ideas that might work are rarely implemented (and rightly so, given all the lives at stake). Perhaps traveling to other planets/comets/asteroids/moons/whatever is an important step in learning how to do society right. Each one of those habitats is going to need some form of governance; we\u0027ll be able to try out a lot more ideas, and ones that don\u0027t work will (for the attentive ones) be selected out, leading to (it would seem) much more robust societal models as the ones that manage to survive. Maybe spacefaring is what a species \u003Cstrong\u003Eneeds\u003C/strong\u003E in order to develop really good, strong societies, since it really opens up the adaptive landscape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m rambling again, aren\u0027t I? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Sorry about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T22:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVoyager Rock!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T22:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, my favourite Star Trek series had to be Enterprise.
