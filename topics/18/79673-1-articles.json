Most problems we see stem from a failure to do this. Additionally I would hope that people embrace science for what it is and can bring. Society where decisions are made on best knowledge and judgement rather than emotional arguments should bring a lot more progress and a higher quality of living for everyone. We should not micromanage, we should decide where we want to go as a society and have science figure out the best way of getting there.
