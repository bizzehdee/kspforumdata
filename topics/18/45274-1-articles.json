Pretty much all earnings are strongly linked to the sales. Chances are most of them are still doing it out of suasion. Maybe thinking about making more money later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know many indie-developers but chances are they dont earn that well and have a very risky job that can end up either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople like Notch are the absolute minority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat beeing said i would never hire someone that seems to see the job as some sort of plan C.

Do you have any specific apprenticeship or knowledge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso since programming and the game are both in english chances are they talk english a lot.
