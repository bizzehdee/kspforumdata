Unlike the ZL-58, the thrust comes from twin turboprop rotors mounted on tilting nascelles. The cabin can hold three people with space for one to sleep. It also features multiple wings - though these only provide the majority of the lift whilst flying. Regrettably, the \u003Cem\u003EAustralis\u003C/em\u003E cannot glide. Or rather, it has the same gliding ability as a fourteen tonne paper aeroplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T23:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight I ask why it uses turboprops instead of large jet engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T06:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[jealous]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHNNNNNNGGHHNNGGNGNHGGNGGHGHGNNGNGG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy you so awesome at drawing on computer \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/jealous]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T07:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually this is pretty easy, i reckon this is the type of art where you frustratingly erase one line a gazillion times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d love to see it smoothed out and shaded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T08:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I ask; is this a design you came up with yourself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T09:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor everyone\\\u0027s information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed this on Spore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI drew it out on paper from looking at the Vehicle Creator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI scanned it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used Paint.NET\\\u0027s Ink Sketch tool to get the first image.
