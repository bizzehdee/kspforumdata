It\u0027s all the low-level nitty-gritty stuff\u2014physics, collisions, entities.

We\u0027ve seen the results of this in KSP development, where particularly stubborn bugs have been tracked down to a root cause somewhere in the Unity engine, and SQUAD has been unable to fix them. Your point about the loss of control of the game world is valid in this sense. However, from what I\u0027ve seen of e.g. Unity development, the game developer is responsible for the vast majority of game mechanics. Stuff like collider behavior is usually too low-level to impact mechanics (a notable exception is Shadowmage\u0027s KSPWheel colliders, which would work much better with more access to low-level engine components).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if a developer ever decides that they would be better off without the few restrictions a good engine puts on them, they can always cast it off and write their own engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T23:24:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s be honest, programmes today are barely optimized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame engines are one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T04:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s overall a good thing.

In Unity\u00A0you can happily drag and drop in a few images, attach them to objects and point and click to position instances of your objects in the game world.

Artists, writers\u00A0and musicians can concentrate on supplying excellent content instead of arguing with the coders as to why their last lot of content didn\u0027t work as intended because someone changed the spec or introduced a new bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame Engines ultimately come down to Reusing Known Reliable Code, and that is something every good coder should recognize as a Good Thing.
