I usually test my new spacecraft on a sub orbital trajectory and just get a shake down of all the systems, staging etc. That way, the flight\\\u0027s over fast and I know what I need to fix. Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt B.E.C.O. (Booster Engine Cut Off), I saw the G-meter drop to zero and I got to thinking. I imagined what it was like to be suddenly on a ballistic course and feeling totally weightless. I\\\u0027ve felt weightlessness for real before, but there\\\u0027s just something special about it being in space I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a few seconds after I started thinking about this, I suddenly felt as though my entire body had \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E went into zero-G. My arms, now off to the side of the desk floated up in front of my face as though there was no gravity. As soon as I realized it, I suddenly became aware of the 1G and my arms fell back down. It\\\u0027s just really amazing how the brain can do things like that to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-07T07:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the processing power of the average computer was equal to a normal house, the processing power of your brain would be equal to a skyscraper, with its base as large as an entire city and stretching all the way to the moon.
