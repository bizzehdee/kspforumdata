I own FRAPS, so I tried recording KSP with it. It drops the FPS down to 5-10 (FPS drops everywhere: Main menu screen, VAB, launching, space) from the usual 20-25 FPS (~100 part ship launching). Do you guys know what the problem is? I suspect limited RAM, but it could be something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy specs\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisplay adapter (I assume this means Graphics Card) (Device Manager): AMD Radeon HD 7520G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU/Processor (Device Manager/Task Manager): Dual-core AMD A6-4400M APU with Radeon HD Graphics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Speed (Task Manager): 2.70 GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(jumps to 100% usage during KSP and recording, may be limited by CPU now that I look at it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly have about 70 processes running right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM (says Memory in Task Manager, assuming it\u0027s RAM): 4 GB DDR3 (only 3.5 GB can be used)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed (Task Manager): 1600 MHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn use (during KSP and FRAPS recording): 2.9 GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlots used (no idea what this means, but I\u0027ll include it anyways): 1 of 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a sneaking suspicion that my CPU is limiting my KSP experience (and recording).

So, if I got a little bit more RAM, a better CPU, and a slightly better graphics card, should I be able to run KSP more smoothly?

KSP is a 32bit Process and is able to use up to 3.6 GB of RAM. Would RAM be a Problem, KSP would crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFRAPS is a real performance killer.
