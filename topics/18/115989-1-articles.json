KSP is **NOT** (bolded for emphasis) an graphically intense game. It is VERY processor-intense and can currently only process physics on a single-core as well.

If you want 30 fps on a non-trivial vessel, water cooling probably won\u0027t suffice anymore.\n\nOther than that, you\u0027ll want a good video card (good will do, no need to go for excellence). 8GB of RAM (preferably more, but 8 should suffice for a \\*lot\\* of eye candy).

The same goes for ship size and part count.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I basically purpose-built my computer to run KSP well (I wanted to actually be able to have clouds! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) and I learned that generally you want the fastest *per-core* CPU you can find, i.e. an Intel chip, as AMD produces chips with multiple cores which all run slower, but provide better multithreading support. This is due to all versions of KSP so far only running calculations on one CPU and not making much use of the GPU nor other cores much at all.\n\nHowever, with the devs moving to Unity 5 for 1.1, you will want to make sure of a couple of things. For much better performance in the long run, consider getting a Nvidia card; their PhysX software is built into Unity 5 and so this will offer a nice performance boost compared to nowadays. I\u0027m not sure what sort of multithreading improvements Unity 5 will bring, so I can\u0027t advise you there, but if someone knows more about that sort of thing, feel free to improve on this answer.\n\nMy computer has the following specifications (I\u0027ve omitted parts which don\u0027t have much of an impact on performance, e.g. the motherboard, hard drives, etc.):\n\n**CPU:** Intel 4670K (3.4 GHz)\n\n**GPU:** Nvidia GeForce GTX760\n\n**RAM:** 8 GB\n\nI also run the game on an SSD, which makes loading the game up *much* quicker.\n\nAll in all, go for a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and a reasonable graphics card. You don\u0027t need a terribly fancy GPU, just enough that it can take the limited tasks its assigned from the CPU and let that do all the physics calculations. If you intend to build your own computer, you can also overclock the CPU for better performance.\n\nLet me know if you\u0027d like more information on the topic; the main takeaway is that you don\u0027t need a super high-end gaming computer to run KSP well, just a competent graphics card, a reasonably powerful processor, and a good amount of RAM."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T20:04:36Z","Content":"I had trouble finding it earlier, new website and all.

(I\u0027m not talking about getting the best performance right now, just an improvement)\n\nThe gritty explanation involves something called Cache, which is memory... on the processor, and also system RAM. Cache is faster because it is right there on the die, where RAM has to be accessed through the motherboard, and the slowest forms of storage are your SSD and then HDD. So, each processor can have it\u0027s own cache but with integrated graphics, the GPU shares the same cache as the CPU (in your case you have a 1024 killobytes L2 Cache and no L3 Cache). It also shares the same system RAM, of which you have 8GB. By comparison, by Nvidia GTX560Ti has 4GB of it\u0027s own memory, not counting the 8GB I have of system RAM and I\u0027m pretty sure it has it\u0027s own cache but I\u0027m not sure how much.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t even count the GPU\u0027s processing abilities. I know mine is 900Mhz on the GPU but with integrated graphics, it\u0027s really hard to say, they don\u0027t advertise it.\n\nTL;DR Yes, the biggest improvement you can make is dedicated graphics. The CPU is kinda mid to low range but is still fine for KSP and the RAM fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No one has mentioned this but that guy is running a hacked version of KSP that you may or may not be able to get to work.

However, the CPU may become the bottleneck which would cap the amount of improvement you actually get. The bigger concerns lie elsewhere. Video cards can be large, so you may not have room in the chasis. So take measurements where it would go to find your clearanc. Caution: Either shut your PC down or use a measuring tape (sewing), not a tape measure (construction) which is metal and can cause damage.\n\nThen you have to be concerned about power supply, as bigger video cards need more power. See if you can find any information printed on the power supply unit that might indicate it\u0027s capability. You need to know the wattage and ideally the Amperage on the 12 volt rail. Sometimes they don\u0027t publish all of that unfortunately and wattage alone can be misleading.\n\nAs for which card specifically, I will have to defer that question to others. My card is as old as your computer (which isn\u0027t easy to find for sale anymore) and that is the last time I did any research.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T23:06:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T23:07:47Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had it running on max settings on a gt210 its about the same performance as on my gtx640 on the sak machine.\n\nother games are a different story, but KSP is just fine."},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T23:22:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...on the highest graphics settings, with fancy visual enhancement mods, at 60 fps (30 fps at least)?
