He was a Roman Emperor, and he was much wiser than anybody alive today. He wrote a work called \u0022Meditations\u0022, which is almost a manual for living stoically. Living stoically is, in my opinion, best summarized by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which defines it as \u003Cem\u003E\u0022the quality or behavior of a person who accepts what happens without complaining or showing emotion\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Meditations\u0022 is a great work, and you would be better for reading it through.
