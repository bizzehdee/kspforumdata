So I brought the electric grill, he brought a cooler and plates/forks, we put our stuff inside the classroom and went to a nearby market and bought some meat. We arrived back and guy \u0022B\u0022 was there with a bluetooth speaker (note: it wasn\u0027t your average portable speaker, the thing was massive, almost a studio-grade speaker), he had also brought soda. We hid the speaker inside a room where laptops and projectors were stored, since it was highly unlikely any teacher would decide to use them on the last day, and waited until recess. When recess started and the teacher had left the room, we took out our equipment and fired it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire thing had been planned since the middle of the year, and since it wasn\u0027t exactly forbidden by the school\u0027s rules (we analyzed the rules AND the school contract) we took a \u0022the show must go on\u0022 strategy, keeping the barbecue going no matter what (what were they going to do, it was the last day, all tests had already been done, and it wasn\u0027t forbidden). It was fun as hell, by the time recess was over and the next teacher went\u00A0to the classroom\u00A0there was meat sizzling, music blasting, mad card games going on in the room\u0027s corner, even more so after people from the school\u0027s administration started coming around to see what the hell was going on and not knowing how to react.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrincipal came around, telling us we were trying to damage the school\u0027s image (even though no recordings were made, we told nobody outside our group, nor was this posted to social media), we kept offering him to join us. A few moments later it was the school owner\u0027s turn to have it out with us, and to do my part I picked up a soda bottle and a disposable cup, went to her and also started asking her to join us, asked if she wanted some Coca-Cola (she refused), filled up the cup and kept offering it, telling her not to be shy, that everyone was having fun and\u00A0there was food on the plates that she was free to enjoy. Everyone was acting as if there was nothing out of the ordinary going on, and it was beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately we had to shut it down because some people started believing the threats made against us, but it was worth it.

the day, we used the IBM Fishbowl terminal PC in high school.\u00A0\u00A0 For some reason the printers would only spew out every fourth print job.\u00A0\u00A0 I knew that the spool was jammed in the printer Queue, so I asked the one teacher to let my use her account to clear out all the jobs, and we could start anew.\u00A0\u00A0 Which was especially important as I was the layout editor for the newspaper, and we really needed those jobs printed.\u00A0\u00A0 She didn\u0027t want me mucking around in her account, for whatever reason, we weren\u0027t connected to the net (wasn\u0027t even a thought at the time).\u00A0 So with her watching over my shoulder, I opened the password list file, which was unencrypted (??),\u00A0 got her password, logged into her account, fixed the printer, and then said \u0022See, everything\u0027s fine\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe threw a fit, and started pushing for me to get expelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen brought before the principal and superintendent, I pointed out that a) I had fixed the problem and b) there were no rules regarding what I had done. \u00A0 They agreed, told the teacher to do her job better, and let me go with a warning of \u0022Don\u0027t do that again\u0022. \u00A0\u00A0 In the next years school handbook, there was a page and a half of rules on computer networks and security. \u00A0 I can claim that I single handedly made the school district rewrite the handbook.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 years later, my brother did something similar, this time relating to the internet (I don\u0027t know the details), and again they had to rewrite the handbook cause of us.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother Story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas stage crew for drama club for my senior year., cause I like building things.\u00A0 We were doing \u0022Pirates of Penzance\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0 Director asked me if it was possible to make a working cannon for the ship set we had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen she said \u0022working cannon\u0022, she meant a puff of smoke and maybe some flash paper.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I had took this to mean she wanted to make a \u003Cem\u003Eworking\u003C/em\u003E cannon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I made an air cannon with a 10 inch barrel.\u00A0\u00A0 An air compressor charged a section of the gun with air upto 120 psi, and when the aluminum foil diaphragm I placed in it ruptured, it would fire, making a very loud boom.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The amount of pressure required depended on the number of layers of aluminum foil.\u00A0 The effect was made even cooler by adding a bunch of gold glitter and baby powder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, and a 10 inch Nerf Ball, painted black, as a cannon ball.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo one day, I\u0027m down \u0022below decks\u0022 in the ship, working on the compressor and the cannon.\u00A0 Never heard the choir come out on stage to practice.\u00A0\u00A0 Neither did they notice me charging the gun.\u00A0\u00A0 BOOM.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Then I heard the screams.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Yeah they were a tad upset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot the gun dialed in enough that it would send the nerf ball half way out into the auditorium, usually caught by the audience.\u00A0\u00A0 But on the second night, I had dialed up the pressure to it\u0027s max, and when the ball came out, it knuckled right down into the orchestral pit, catching the trombone player right between the eyes, causing her to flip over backwards in her chair.\u00A0\u00A0 She too was a tad upset.\u00A0 It\u0027s hard to not laugh at somebody who has a baby powder \u0022burn\u0022 mark in the middle of her forehead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T12:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnothing
