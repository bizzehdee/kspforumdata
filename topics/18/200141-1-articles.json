This was a specific instance of melkor arriving on middle earth. Tulkas arrived before that assault. He was put to sleep by nessa just before this happened. It would fit that bombadill could be tulkas and nessa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think tom is tulkas keeping an eye on sauron and actively keeping track of or dealing with melkors actions/consequences over time. He may also be acting as protector of the shire or an active passive threat to sauron. some of the description of his fighting didn\u0027t seem to involve pure brute force as much as cunning. He may be more of a strategic leader on top of anything else. There is also the interesting idea he made the hobbits. Maybe he\u0027s keeping an eye over them. Or designed them to destroy the rings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.quora.com/Could-Melkor-in-his-full-power-beat-Tulkas\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.quora.com/Could-Melkor-in-his-full-power-beat-Tulkas\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly adding to the point that tulkas more of a strategist and not a brute force warrior. It would explain how he\u0027s acting potentially. He\u0027s more like how the return of the king guy was a scout and used others to do things and not his own physical power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-07T07:33:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2021 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-07T10:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBomby is Tulcas under sedatives, kept in the personal\u00A0calm green asylum - the Forest, with Nessa as nursie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s unlikely \u0022good\u0022 because he doesn\u0027t worry about the man-killing tree and other monsters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe got others with his bruteforcing, so they decided to \u003Cs\u003Ehave\u003C/s\u003E give him a rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t remember, did JRRT describe soft walls in the Bomby\u0027s rooms?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat looks rather strange, is why was Orodruin not guarded, so two random travellers just got to there by feet (except several minor incidents).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why did not\u00A0Gandalf just send eagles to carry them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why did Orodruin explode just after the ring was destroyed?\u003Cbr\u003E\nLogically, the power of the ring should just return to the owner, making Sau just stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do they think that the returned Gandalf was actually Gandalf?
