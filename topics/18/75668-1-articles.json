In the kerbal science trailer, there is a little octopus thing that looks (and moves) like a flood infection spore thingy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the halo nation it says the flood came from a crashed ship on the edge of the galaxy. Crashing is a very kerb-ally thing to do. It also says that the ship contained a powder that, when consumed, the consumer turned to flood. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my theory of where the flood came from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin a mission to go interstellar happened, containing a science jr lab thingy. Kerbin was near the planet where the flood landed, and when they entered warp, something went horribly wrong. The Kraken attacked!!!, smashing the occupants of the ship against the walls of there spacecraft so vigorously, for so long, the Kerbals, and flood thingies in the science module, turned to dust, the dusts mixed, and the flood powder was formed. The ship was already on a collision course with the forerunner planet, and it crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forerunners thought the powder was sugar, and the ship, a crashed cargo ship, so they ate the \u0022sugar\u0022 and the flood was formed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, and don\u0027t forget to leave your opinions below!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krosulhah","CreatedById":83946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T21:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E It\u0027s.... it\u0027s so damn obvious now.... why did none of us think about this?!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T05:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone press the drama button!.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T15:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, well, my Kerbals are never developing warp drive.
