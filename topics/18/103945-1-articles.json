If OP is looking for a Windows-like GUI on Ubuntu, I\u0027d recommend installing the KDE Plasma desktop environment on top of Unity (These can be switched at any time by using a menu in the login screen). There are two main packages for KDE Plasma:\n\nkde-plasma-desktop - This only includes the KDE Plasma desktop environment and whatever libraries it absolutely needs in order to work. Pick this if you just want to have a look at the desktop and the menus.\n\nkde-full - The full KDE package. Includes the KDE Plasma desktop and all KDE default programs and features. Pick this if you want to try all the things KDE has to offer.\n\nIf you decide KDE is the right desktop environment for you and you don\u0027t need Unity anymore, you might want to wipe your disk and install Kubuntu instead. Kubuntu is basically the exact same thing as Ubuntu, but it uses KDE instead of Unity, and has a different set of default applications.
