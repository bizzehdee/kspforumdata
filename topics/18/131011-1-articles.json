The events of your life. The events of your parents\u0027 lives, their parents\u0027 lives, all the way back to the first lifeform on Earth. If it didn\u0027t exist, we might not even exist. What if our sun didn\u0027t even form? What if earth didn\u0027t form? What if the Galaxy didn\u0027t exist? Well, it wouldn\u0027t matter. The rest of the universe is almost entirely unaffected.

Every generation of humans has had the exact same relation to the universe that we do, they just didn\u0027t know it.

Not by a long shot. We might have descendants for centuries, millennia, or longer, and the grand scope of the universe means that they can never possibly get bored or run out of exploring to do. Even if it takes our species, say, another twenty thousand\u00A0years to gear up for exploring other star systems, they\u0027ll still be there, and the universe will barely have blinked in the meantime.
