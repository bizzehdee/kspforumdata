You don\u0027t necessarily have to run gnuplot from the command-line, although the scripting format is relatively easy to get your head around once you\u0027ve done it a couple of times. Just to give you an idea of how powerful gnuplot is, I once wrote a little script to give me a decent visual display of some ideas I was prototyping in PHP - it was easier than working through the myriad of issues I had getting PHP\u0027s implementation of GTK to work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s307.photobucket.com/user/Tork_Unib/media/map_current.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i307.photobucket.com/albums/nn302/Tork_Unib/map_current.png\u0022 alt=\u0022map_current.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few programs available that will give you a gui frontend for gnuplot too. Of course you could also go with MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc for plotting the graph itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
