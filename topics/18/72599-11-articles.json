Likewise, the physics in Gravity didn\u0027t bother me while others went on ad infinitum about some perceived \u0022lack of realism\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Interstellar, I thought it was better than Gravity and I wasn\u0027t bothered by the liberties that they took with the physics to advance the plot. I think they could have made it a better movie by simplifying the plot into something more in line with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98181-Christopher-Nolans-Interstellar-movie-shines-new-light-on-black-holes?p=1538547#post1538547\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMr Shifty\u0027s suggestion from earlier in this thread\u003C/a\u003E, but they had their reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think Interstellar\u0027s \u0022sad story\u0022 was a handicap. Sad stories don\u0027t make for bad movies. Twelve Year\u0027s a Slave, American Beauty and No Country for Old Men all won Oscars for best picture and they aren\u0027t happy stories. Was Interstellar entertaining? Sure. Do I agree with Bill Nye\u0027s assessment? Maybe a bit. Would I go see it again? Probably not. But that\u0027s just my opinion.
