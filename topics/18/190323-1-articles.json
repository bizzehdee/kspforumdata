But leaving that aside:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 It certainly used to be the case (no idea what current thinking is) that any serious combateer would be flying with Flight Assist off. That\u0027s only pseudo Newtonian because your speed is still capped (so scratch that 2nd Law) but the 1st and 3rd laws are very much in effect. So players can already demonstrate their Newtonian knowledge if they so wish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0 I suppose that would be \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E to the current system but I\u0027m not sure it would be any \u003Cem\u003Ebetter.\u003C/em\u003E If I recall rightly, the basic setup for E:D has lasers being good against shields but relatively weak against hull, with projectile weapons being good against hull but relatively weaker against shields. I forget how missiles and plasma accelerators work. On top of that you have various tweaks you can apply to armour, you can fit extra hull reinforcements into equipment slots, you\u0027ve got various countermeasures, ammo types, shield boosters, shield banks - plenty of permutations to make things interesting if that\u0027s what you like doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 When combined with your kinetic missile concept, your shield types actually sound quite dull. Standard procedure for any griefer would be to kit out their ship with missiles plus as many multicannons as they can cram on. Find an unsuspecting target, fire missiles at extreme range. If target is carrying kinetic energy shields, they go boom. If they don\u0027t go boom you can be fairly certain that they\u0027re carrying standard shields or rate-of-fire shields.
