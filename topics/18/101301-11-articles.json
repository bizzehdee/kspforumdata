On the CPU side it depends. KSP is poorly multithreaded so shows up the weakness of CPUs with lower single-threaded performance like the AMD FX range. Cities: Skylines is excellently multithreaded so shows up the weakness of CPUs with lower overall performance including recent Intel dual-cores. Both games share that they can be very CPU-intensive, and that the CPU load depends on something the player controls - part count in KSP, population in Cities."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T16:41:00Z","Content":"Well, I finally joined the Skylines club while waiting for 1.1 to drop.

I had a couple floodings working out my own dams, and this was always the case.
