It\u0027s a bit dangerous, since during the process of heating the sugar to melt it, if you go too hot by just a few degrees, or heat it for too long, you can end with a fire at best, and a small explosion at worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re just considering building and flying rockets, you might want to consider model and/or high-power rocketry. These are considered hobby rocketry, unlike sugar rockets (and other materials) which are considered amateur rocketry, which has quite a bit more in the way of regulations and restrictions as opposed to hobby rocketry. Also, the motors used for hobby rocketry, black powder and ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP - very similar in compostion to that used in the space shuttle SRBs) have better isp than equivalent-size sugar motors, and are generally cheaper than the initial costs of setting up to do sugar motors. BP motors are pretty much exclusively for the model rocketry side and range in size from 13mm (diameter) x 1.25 inch (length) - yes we mix measurement systems here - to 24mm 3.5 inches. APCP is used in both model and high-power rockets, and range from small 18mm motors (length can vary, depending on what is needed) up to 98mm (dia.) x 3 feet or more in length. All BP motors are single-use. Some APCP motors are single-use, and there are several makers of reloadable casings for Aerotech reload propellant grains (I think there are other makers of propellant as well - it\u0027s been awhile). Reload casing have a bit of a high initial outlay in funds, but over a few flights, the casings pretty much pay for themselves, since the grains are cheaper than their single-use equivalents. The downside is the after flight cleaning, but gun barrel cleaners (such as Hoppes) makes it a bit easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a couple of links I\u0027ve posted in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68630-Video-Wednesdays-Jeb-Takes-a-Trip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68630-Video-Wednesdays-Jeb-Takes-a-Trip\u003C/a\u003E ... regarding the two US hobby rocketry rocketry organizations. These are a good place to start if you\u0027re looking for more information. If you\u0027re not in the US, either of those sites should have links to branch groups from outside the US.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, here\u0027s an example of how far you can go with hobby rocketry (and that\u0027s not considered a very big rocket on the high-power side of the hobby): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/4491-Put-a-Face-to-the-name?p=1010789\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1010789\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/4491-Put-a-Face-to-the-name?p=1010789\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1010789\u003C/a\u003E The small rocket on the table between the two trophies is mine as well. One trophy was for best of show (the Little Joe II - the big one), and the other was for best scale rocket (the Pershing 1A, since they couldn\u0027t give me two trophies for the same rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firov","CreatedById":57445,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume you\u0027re talking about KNO3/Sugar rockets, AKA candy rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a rocket powered by a \u0022G\u0022 class KNO3/sugar engine for my senior project in high school, in 2006. It worked remarkably well, considering that I didn\u0027t really have any experience with model rocketry outside of Estes up to that point. I basically had to conduct my own crash research and development program to develop the fuel, casting method, igniter, motor, and rocket body. Now that I think about it, I\u0027m kind of amazed my instructors, or the school board, approved that project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what are you thinking of making the rocket casing out of? Metal? Or are you going for a disposable, but more easily constructed, design such as a PVC casing with a graphite nozzle? If you have access to a machine shop, or wouldn\u0027t mind contracting out to one, I\u0027d suggest you go with the metal design since it\u0027s reusable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used low carbon steel (AISI 1018) for the nozzle and forward bulkhead and electrical metallic tubing for the motor casing. I don\u0027t remember what I used for the bulkhead screws, but I do remember ensuring that it had a lower shear limit than the EMT casing, which would result in an axial explosion (up/down) rather than a radial explosion (pipe bomb) in the event of an over-pressure failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, take a look at the following link. It\u0027s a site run by Richard Nakka that I discovered towards the end of my project. He\u0027s about the closest thing to an expert on KNO3/sugar fuel you\u0027ll find. I\u0027d suggest taking a close look at the A-100M rocket motor design and test data on there too. It\u0027s an excellent starting point for making your own KNO3/sugar rocket motors. Plus, when you\u0027re getting started with these, you really don\u0027t want to jump straight into a large motor. It takes time and practice to perfect your methods for casting fuel grains into the motor casing. Another benefit is that, as a metal motor, it\u0027s basically infinitely reusable and that fact combined with the low cost of the key ingredients (powdered sugar and potassium nitrate, as a minimum) means that it\u0027s very easy on your budget to fly these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nakka-rocketry.net/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would be very careful with the fuel mixture when you\u0027re casting it. While it might be called \u0022candy rocket fuel\u0022, it\u0027s not something to be trifled with. That said, as long as you\u0027re careful you\u0027re not going to blow up a city block with this stuff. It\u0027s designed to burn. Not explode. Even if you dope it with red iron oxide it\u0027s still relatively slow burning. Furthermore, there are fuel casting methods that are designed to reduce the ignition risks until the very final stages of fuel casting, and even without those methods it takes a lot more than going over the correct temperature by \u0022a few degrees\u0022 to ignite. Just be careful, take it slow, and consult with Richard Nakka\u0027s site early and often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if all of that sounds too much, consider the commercial motor route. It\u0027s going to be more expensive in the long term, since you\u0027ll be dependent on mostly disposable motors and proprietary fuel grains, but there\u0027s no faster, or easier, way to launch rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-14T19:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2014 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI urge not to make any pyrotechnics or explosives at home and remember to abide by your local laws.

That\u0027s one of the reasons, I suspect, that other paper tube motors like Estes use black powder.
