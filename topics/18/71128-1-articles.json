It\u0027s largely impossible to find something you are searching for; the board instead emphasizes showing you only what the community at large thinks you should be seeing. On one hand, the voting system (if used correctly, which it often isn\u0027t) can greatly raise the quality of the content by filtering out junk and unrelated information, but on the other hand, it results in a self-perpetuating content bubble that only allows popular content a short-lived window of attention. There\u0027s no chronology maintained and threads disappear relatively quickly, to be replaced by something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an interesting system, but it\u0027s not for everyone.
