There\u0027s some bug with the update feature for people who turned auto updating off.\n\nThe fix is to go into the control panel and find \u0022Update Settings\u0022 (something like that). There should be an option in there to go through with the update.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, the Windows 10 updater from Microsoft works great. You don\u0027t even need a USB or anything, just works right off your computer. Updated a Win7 and Win8 PC this week, both work great (including KSP, with OpenGL and with mods). Uh... you WILL have trouble with Win10 until you let it update and restart. There are weird issues with the start button, search functionality etc. Hmm...\n\nOh, and if you use Office products, you may have issues opening files. This is because Trust Center is being stupid. Just launch the application by itself, go File -\u003E Options -\u003E Trust Center -\u003E Trust Center Settings -\u003E Protected View, and uncheck everything. This could let a script kiddie massacre you with a crazy excel file, but if you can\u0027t open any excel file in the first place you\u0027ll probably lose your job so..."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T10:03:31Z","Content":"Sorry if this has already been answered, but...\n\nWill all my win7/8 computer games work with win10?"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T19:20:37Z","Content":"Can anyone confirm/deny if windows 10 \u002B my nvidia drivers will still break my PC?

It would download but would never install. Then I found the media creation tool and tried it that way. I fell asleep, and when I woke up it was done downloading so I hit next and it froze. Then last night I ran the media creation tool again and kept with it all the way to where it starts installing and restarting and went to bed, woke up to shiny new windows! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOk, can someone help me? Windows 10 boots longer than windows 7, and after logging in, it takes an additional 60 seconds for the desktop to fully load. Windows 8 on our other computer boots in 10-20 seconds and going from login screen to desktop takes 10-15 seconds. Why is it taking me 2 minutes from start to desktop?"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:02:51Z","Content":"Really?
