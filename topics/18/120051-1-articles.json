I get an air of disingenuity from NGT, like he\u0027s \u0022doing it for the money\u0022. His version of Cosmos also doesn\u0027t have the pure magic that Sagan\u0027s had; The remake, for me, was just facts presented in a CGI way. I had an appreciation and amazement for space and human technology that I didn\u0027t really have before after watching Sagan\u0027s original. I was excited by the info from Sagan\u0027s show, but with NDT it was just another show. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, Sagan\u0027s voice is a million times more relaxing and pleasant-sounding than NDT\u0027s. Just my personal opinion. And Seth Macfarlane should stay with adult cartoons and vulgar entertainment and not be the writer on a goddang science show.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
