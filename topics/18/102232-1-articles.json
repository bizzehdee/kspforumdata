If you install 4 more, KSP will have 4 GB all for itself. No more creating virtual memory on hard drive. You will definitively experience an enormous surge in computer speed. KSP will load a bit faster, but what is more important - upon exiting you won\u0027t have to wait for all the stuff in the virtual memory to be transfered to RAM. Occasional crashes will turn from 10 minute agony into a few second nuisance.\n\nSo yeah, install an identical additional 4 GB module and you\u0027ll be a lot happier with your computer performance. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T15:36:01Z","Content":"I have kip running exentry (on the lowest graphics settings) with only 3 gigs of ram so 8 might be a little over kill"}]}
