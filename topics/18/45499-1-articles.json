Other people tend to feel better when they see good done in the world, and if this person saw that you told other people around the world about something great they had done (Without using their personal information), would it not most likely make them feel a little better?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could even be something you yourself did. Its good to talk about how you helped somebody else, and it normally makes others feel better to see good being done. If you don\u0027t know of anything you or other people have done that fits this, go and do something and tell us about it. Its never a bad idea to tell somebody they make the world a better place, by doing or by example, and its normally easiest to start by doing exactly that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T06:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust little side note, nothing that you should worry about too much:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing like a nonselfish deed.
