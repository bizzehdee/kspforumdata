Unfortunately, as the KSP Community grows, we need to be spending as much time as possible, concentrating on the KSP Community. That means that non-KSP Community threads, especially large ones, can go unmoderated which can lead to many issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and feel free to PM me any questions you may have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E This also extends to Chat Threads, much for the same reasons as above. Chat Threads are defined as threads that have no central topic to discuss and revolve around speedy and brief posting.
