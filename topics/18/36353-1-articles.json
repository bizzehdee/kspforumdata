One, they don\u0027t use propellant crossfeed -- the outer tanks are only feeding the outer engines, and the center core lasts longer because it runs at reduced throttle for much of the time. Two, real rockets tend to have higher propellant fractions than Kerbal hardware (about 0.88 for the Delta IV CBC), so they can generally burn longer per stage.
