Other games look fine so I have never been sure what exactly is different for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use Fraps for recording. I record in 1080p at 30fps. I use Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5 for editing and rendering. I have uses a lot of different settings trying to fix this. Oddly so far in testing the best improvement was when I doubled the FPS to 60, it looked great after rendering, of course once you upload to YouTube it puts it back at 30fps breaking the quality again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, if anyone else makes videos and uses Premiere to render and gets legible text and good quality, can you let me know what settings you use? More info can be provided if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a second option, does anyone just know a way to increase the fon size? I mean making the UI doesn\u0027t really do that to any of the text I would want bigger. That would help too but I havnt found any topics explaining a way to do this ether.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T19:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI brought the text into focus by striking the side my head with an adjustable ratchet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#EDIT: If you\u0027re new at this sort of thing, I highly recommend starting out with the ball peen before attempting any sort of ratchet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T01:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use Vegas Pro rather than Premiere, but the settings should be similar.
