Now, depending on the craft this is either a Very Bad thing, or simply a Very Inconvenient thing. For sure, that particular engine is toast until it can be cleaned out. But some aircraft have two engines to provide redundancy. For generic commercial craft (tourist helicopter) this is usually an unnecessary expense if a cheaper single engine version is available. Considering this sounds like a Search and Rescue craft, these tend to be (but are not always) military castoffs due do the sometimes extreme conditions the S\u0026amp;R team may operate under, which would likely mean a double engine helicopter. If the craft is a single engine one, then the pilot was totally in the right as it is likely he would be unable to take off safetly and maintain stable flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow assuming the craft is a double-engine type then when something like this happens it is up to pilot discression. What makes good procedure is if the pilot recieves some level of information about the patient, thus allowing the pilot to make an informed decision. Without an inspection of the engine compartment, it is possible that second engine is also compromised, presumably the pilots instruments would feed him enough data to show that engine 1 is down, engine 2 is possibly ok. At this point the pilot has to make a decision. He hasn\u0027t taken off yet, so he isn\u0027t committed to flight. If he knows the patient has a non-life threatening injury (example: a broken arm), then it is just safest for the patient, the pilot, and the medical team for the pilot to shut the aircraft down and wait for backup. As I said, without an inspection of the second engine, the pilot has no way of knowing for sure that it isn\u0027t on the verge of breaking down, so taking off in this situation is risking the lives of everybody on board. For a non-life threatening injury, this would be inexcusable. Now if the patient in question had suffered a life threatening injury AND the medics stated he had a better than low chance of survival, then the risk is warranted given the patient\u0027s situation. If the patient is highly likely to die regardless of making it to the hospital quickly or not, then it is up to the pilot to risk the lives of himself and the medical team (the patient no longer enters because he can be assumed to be dead on arrival at this point by the pilot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the bird entered the engine midflight, then depending on the readouts of the console and how close they were to the hospital, the pilot would likely decide to continue flight, but this was because he already has proof that the second engine appears to be holding up to the strain well enough to do the job. While the helicopter was on the ground, the engine had not yet been asked to go to full power, and since it could have been damaged, and attempting to fly on a damaged engine that fails can result in a drop of at least 10-15\u002B feet and possibly a rollover of the helicopter, likely severely wounding or killing everyone on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven beside all of this, the pilot of an aircraft is something like a captain at sea, god emperor of his land. If he believes something is a danger to himself and his passengers he is legally allowed to do a great deal of things, including refusing to fly a mission that could save someone\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end, the pilot was fully in the right to refuse to fly both legally and situationally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T19:01:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mazon Del\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T19:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the Space Lounge, Pawelk, please use the Lounge for these sort of threads in future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T19:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly a bad pilot would fly after a bird flew into the engine, nothing to do with being a coward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T19:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, a single bird can cause major damage to a jet engine\u0027s compressor blades - even if the blades don\u0027t break on the spot, it could very well break inflight - one of these blades going through the jet engine while inflight could kill the engine (especially as most helicopters jet engines are much smaller than airliners turbofans - and on a turbofan, the jet engine part is much smaller than the fan itself - so it reduces the risks of a bird going through the main compressor and combustion chamber)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejet engines are tested against bird ingestions (up to a certain size of bird), but taking off after a bird ingestion without checking the engine for damage and cleaning it would be completely stupid.
