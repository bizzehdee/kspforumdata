I sometimes reflect on this fact and I think it is down to a couple of things. First, I get to choose who I spend my time with. Nearly every single one of my relationships is with people I choose to spend time with. Nobody is forcing me to sit next to someone I hate, nobody is forcing me to go to a place I hate.

Just being able to do what I want, to go to bed when I want, to go where I want, to buy what I want. It\u0027s just so refreshing.

Less some days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETbh the golden patch is in between starting work and having kids, that\u0027s when you\u0027ve got lots of disposable income, fewer obligations, lots of free time, and a circle of friends that have the same. My 20\u0027s were good times. I\u0027m kind of hoping there will be another good patch in life after retiring...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T09:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou hate school, but then you leave and immediately wish you were back there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I still miss school and I left 3 years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T19:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHell no.

From 9th grade on, I honestly think it\u0027s the best thing that has happened to me. Just a couple years back, when I was on 7th grade, I was bullied (I think I was bullied for about 10 years, from kindergarten all the way to 7th grade) and had very few friends who I could trust. Then **** really hit the fan when my parents divorced and I and my mum and sister had to move to another town.. It felt like the end of the world. I had lost all hope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this great misfortune proved to be the chance of a lifetime. A chance to start a new life, completely from scratch. People actually liked me in my new school. It made me realize that maybe, just maybe, there is still hope. As days, weeks and months passed, I gained more and more self-confidence. I became more social and learned to disregard the idiots. For the first time in at least a year, I did well in school.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, last summer when I thought things couldn\u0027t bet any better, I got a letter from a high school I had applied for, saying that my application had been accepted. The school was in my previous home town, so I and my family moved once again. I started my studies there and got to know many, many more great people. It was at that point that I decided to let go of the past and set my sights on the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, there are some annoying students or teachers, things do go wrong sometimes, but after going through such a hell on earth, I just don\u0027t care anymore - I\u0027m just happy that I made it through all that and that it made me a much better person. It\u0027s difficult to really appreciate school before **** really goes down and school helps you get yourself back together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T16:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eschool = legal torture\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
