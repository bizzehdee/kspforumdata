You can play as one of the doctors, engineers, security, or in many other roles, and do your part in keeping the station together. However, some players may be assigned the role of a traitorous crew member, an operative of another organization, or even a space ninja. They are only placed there to make somebody\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s job harder, or even to kill them. Sometimes the admins may even decide they want to have a little fun, and will turn someone, or even themselves, into one of these antagonists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hosting a server for this game, and I hope that some KSP forum-goers are interested in dropping in occasionally. Right now, there isn\u0027t much about the server that is customized, besides the KSS prefix to the server name, but I am looking to make this server a fun place for people with a common interest in KSP to have some fun in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current admins are likely to be lenient on roleplay. (We are okay with a botanist doing first aid or opening an oxygen canister, but a botanist doing neural surgery or turning on the singularity is not acceptable.) Other rules, however, we are still discussing. I, along with the other admins, have only ever had to permaban one person for causing a problem, and we really don\u0027t want to have to permaban too many more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have never played Space Station 13, all you have to do is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.byond.com/download/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edownload the free BYOND client\u003C/a\u003E, set up a BYOND account \u003Ca href=\u0022https://secure.byond.com/?page=Join\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, and choose a Space Station 13 server. I am trying to create a few video tutorials for this server to teach new players how to use the interface, how to do specific roles, and how to follow the server rules while still having some mischievous fun, as almost every tutorial is either a Let\u0027s Play with some general advice, a person showing how not to play the game properly, or for a different/outdated station build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good resource to use is the wiki for each build. This server runs a nearly up to date /tg/station build, and the /tg/station wiki can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.nanotrasen.com/index.php/Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. If you have never played the game, and you don\u0027t want to play it before you see it or learn about it, one of the wikis is a good place to start.
