But how do you shop for little games like KSP? I happened across KSP while pottering around with Sandbox Universe, but obviously that was just luck. However, I will NOT go through Steam, for a number of reasons we need not go into here, so please, don\u0027t even bother to bring it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T03:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the indie games I find through forums, people usually have a thread recommending this game they found and it goes from there.

It\u0027s really nice. Project Zomboid is a great in-development title, the incredible indie horror Paranormal is there, and a number of other really awesome games. There was a forum post a long time ago about Ace Combat that ended up with someone mentioning a then-pre-alpha PC game titled Vector Thrust. It\u0027s matured into a very interesting cel-shaded PC Ace Combat of sorts, and it\u0027s a Desura title. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, as previously suggested, check out forums around the internet.

Desura looks especially interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the kinds of games I\u0027m looking for, I used to love the Total War series before they decided \u0022Debugging is for pansies!\u0022 and saddled it with Steam, Simcity before EA decided to make it cartoonish and simple instead of a detailed simulation, and the X-Com top-down tactical shoot-outs, but only the early ones with base, research, and personnel management in addition to the firefights. Going way the snot back, I loved Master of Magic (but not the pale imitation of Age of Wonders), and Civilization before they decided to downplay managing your empire and just kept adding more military units and mindless conflict. I *LOVED\u0022 Morrowind, but gave up on Elder Scrolls when they decided to discard all the career alternatives, house-building, customized items, and kept all the tedious combat. And, I ike the occasional oddball that doesn\u0027t fit into any category, like KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fernbhoy","CreatedById":75292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T23:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you like RPG like city building kinda games, check out Towns\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.townsgame.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.townsgame.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicly the idea will be running a town above dungeons that supports the \u0022heroes\u0022 you are used to playing as in clearing said dungeons below.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trefil","CreatedById":75429,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T20:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found most of my games on youtube by watching videos, KSP is one of them.

The latest XCOM and Tomb Raider Games were my final straw with bothering with AAA Titles. I\u0027ve had more enjoyment with the 3 Indie Games I play, KSP, Faster than Light, and Don\u0027t Starve, then I have with all Games combined for the last like 5 or so Years [GTA being a exception!!!]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll generall have a Quick look through Steam, and Youtube for any fields I\u0027m interested in, for instance, I found KSP through Youtube by just typing in \u0022Space Game\u0022 and a Vid from Kurtjmac came up, after 5 minutes of watching it, I bought the Game straight away, no need for the Demo, and have never looked back. Kickstarters are also a good place to find some decent Indie Games that are in production, such as Lacuna Passage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my Oppinion Youtube is mandatory to watch some Let\u0027s Plays to get a proper feel of the Game rather than some Reviews by brainwashed morons who just like to Promote / \u0022Lie through their Teeth\u0022 for things that aren\u0027t worth my time.

But although that gets away from some of the hype from the company trying to sell you the game, the majority of player-made videos, well, SUCK! I hate having to sit through 20 minutes of garbage waiting to get to the point, or often just somebody fumbling around because he doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s trying to do. It\u0027s still useful, but you have to dig through a lot of junk to find anything worthwhile. A plea to Youtubers: EDIT YOUR FLIPPING RECORDINGS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
