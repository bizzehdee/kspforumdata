So, in December, we packed everything up and headed to his hometown of Gulfport, Mississippi. Now most civilian youth believe that DoDDS are \u0022propaganda mills\u0022 for the military. I often heard this as we moved every two to three years and often times, I went to public schools wherever we lived at until my dad was sent to Germany in 1984. In fact, I found the DoDDS schools totally different - and far more advanced than their civilian state-side counterparts. I had the option to take summer courses beginning in the summer between my 8th grade and 9th grade year - which I did. As a result, by the time I began my senior year of high school (in Germany), I was taking courses such as College Prep English, Physics II, Calculus II, Basics of Electronics II (a vocational technology class), French III, German II, and band. I also took Latin classes after school because I didn\u0027t want to go home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen we moved to what I began (and still do) refer to as \u0022Red Neck Tech\u0022, they had none of that. The graduation requirements for high school only required three years of English (I was technically taking a class offered for those who had already completed 4 years in the DoDDS system), they only required two maths, two sciences, and some other stupid classes. For my last semester of high school, I had ONE class: band - followed by seven study halls. So, with that said, I was concurrently enrolled in a local community college while I was still in high school.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI do not consider myself a \u0022graduate\u0022 of that broke-down high school. I opted out of walking across the stage, I have never attended a reunion - because when I attended that school as a student, I was treated like an outcast. I didn\u0027t go to prom nor did I even had a girlfriend. I often was referred to as a \u0022Kraut\u0022 or my personal favorite, a \u003Cem\u003EWorld War II era German, but a certain other word that cannot be used on the forum. \u003C/em\u003EI was also treated like a foreigner because I was not only fluent in French, but could also read and write basic (conversational) German. All because many in the high school were ignorant that while a military dependent, one can live in nearly any foreign country their military parent is assigned to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo... for me, I personally hated high school - specifically that last half-year.

If you act like them, then they will welcome you provided you fit the social norms. If you deviate, then you\u0027re either going to be easy picking or you need to go under the radar a bit. It helps to have a large circle of friends. Chav mentality is pack mentality. It was always a group of at least three chavs that gave everyone grief. Larger groups roamed the grounds and you were to stay well away from them. If not, you would get shoved. They establish dominance over people. Some more than others. It was a rule that every non-chav got grief from chavs, but if you appeared vulnerable to them, you would be targeted more often.
