Group activities and being forced to board with a gaggle of excited, extremely-outgoing people is my idea of a horrible time. I could possibly deal with it for a day or two, but 1-3 weeks? I\u0027d be exhausted and depressed by the end. The fact that I\u0027d most likely have all kinds of authorities/overseers/leaders endlessly encouraging me to be outgoing and essentially participate in some sort of groupthink when both those things aren\u0027t a part of me would probably give me some sort of disorder. I\u0027m the kind of person that would rather read nonfiction books and build things out of wood by myself rather than go through such an ordeal as a \u0022summer camp\u0022. It\u0027s also made infinitely worse by the fact that I\u0027d probably have literally no form of support or understanding, just a truckload of screaming banshees wanting me to be just like them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T16:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T16:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGroup activities are horrifying.

Actually, quite a few. Many of them were only day camps, but a good number where week long, stay in a cabin or whatever type camps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, it\u0027s some of the best fun I\u0027ve ever had in my life, speaking as a reserved introvert. I think a week is all I would typically be good for, since I do eventually need a break from people, and there are certainly times when I would like to have some more down time, but by and large the experiences were always worth some inconveniences. A couple of the best camps I\u0027ve ever been two were two scout Jamborees, just because of the massive variety of things you get to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had opportunities to meet professionals I never could have met otherwise, and become friends with people from cultures I would never normally be exposed to. I can\u0027t say I loved absolutely every camp I ever attended, but I would absolutely do it all over again in a heart beat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the camps I\u0027ve been to had a focus. A fair few are scouting camps (by far the best is fantasy camp, where you spend an entire day playing real life D\u0026amp;D). I\u0027ve also done stuff like computer camps, or rock climbing, or band camp. It\u0027s not like a whole bunch of random kids get thrown together and do random stuff. Almost every time there was some common factor. We were there because we shared common interests, or were training for the same sport. For bonus points, I was always in fantastic shape by the end of summer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T23:26:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xzxvrx","CreatedById":57321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T01:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been to 2 Civil Air Patrol NCSA\u0027s this summer (I got to solo! yay!) and I\u0027ve been to 6 total over 3 years and all of mine have been a week long.

I got to know my mates better than before, I got to know their hidden sides, and they were very surprising for me to discover. We had out fav teachers from school and we had a few scientists come over. At day, we worked our brains to the max, at night, we did whatever we wanted:watch movies, play games, talk, listen to music, go into an abandoned house nearby and so on. Heck, we didn\u0027t always sleep in our own cabins.
