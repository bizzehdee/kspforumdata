I\u0027ve found the best way to \u0022let them out\u0022 is through writing, which has lead to a somewhat bizarre catalogue of short tales and snippets. Not sure how many would interest the community here, but I had one recently I thought might strike a chord, and figured I\u0027d share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr data-role=\u0022contentPageBreak\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Untitled)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia, serif;\u0022\u003E\u0022You\u0027ll die,\u0022 said Marco.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 replied Weston, \u0022I will finally \u003Ci\u003Elive\u003C/i\u003E. I will be immortal.\u0022 He looked upon the great white machine with the adoration of a proud parent. This ship, this ugly, boxy, angular vessel, which brooked no comparison to the sleek rockets his grandfathers had envisioned, whose hide was composites and ceramics and materials so strange and alien they would never have imagined in their time - this fine thing was to be his, and his alone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re a fool, and you\u0027ll die a fool\u0027s death,\u0022 his pessimistic companion declared.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022If it is foolish to chase your dreams, to live them, I would not wish to be a wise man. How many hundreds of years, Marco? How many has Mankind waited for this moment, dreamed of it? How many since we looked up at the stars and took it in our heads that we should be out there, among them? To stride vast distances of nothing, as the Gods do. I shall meet them all, Marco, the Christian and Islamic and Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Myan, Sumarian, and all the rest! I shall shake Ra\u0027s hand, ride Apollo\u0027s chariot, help Orion fasten his belt!\u0022 Weston\u0027s eyes grew wide as his excitement tumbled from his lips. \u0022I will see with the eyes of Hubble and Kepler, Chandra and Spitzer and Herschel, drink from the ice of comets, breathe from distant nebulae, bask in the warmth of newborn suns. The whole of the universe, the length and breadth of infinity, all of it within our reach at last. Our mother Earth, a green bud, at last blossoming, flowering, spreading the pollen of human civilization into the cosmos. It all begins here, Marco, with this. With us!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMarco shook his head, hiding a smile. Weston\u0027s passion would not, \u003Ci\u003Ecould not\u003C/i\u003E be undone, by words or force. Death itself might not stop him, he considered wryly. The boy had been born with stars in his eyes, rocket fuel in his veins, his head forever far, far above the clouds, where molecules of gas danced lonely waltzes through the edge of space before bumping into another of their kind. His future on this world had only ever been to leave it. \u0022I will miss you, my friend.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWeston clapped him on the back. \u0022Oh cheer up already! You\u0027re standing at the feet of history as it\u0027s being written, this is no moment for melancholy!\u0022 A heartbeat of silence, two, ten... \u0022I\u0027ll miss you as well. And Renee. Florida. \u003Ci\u003EEarth\u003C/i\u003E. But just look out there.\u0022 He pointed to the night sky, the star-flecked darkness behind the spacecraft on the pad. \u0022All of it, this whole solar system, the Milky Way, someday we\u0027ll look at it as \u0027home,\u0027 they way we think of our towns now. Someone will ask where we\u0027re from and we won\u0027t answer \u0027New York,\u0027 or \u0027Cincinatti,\u0027 no sir, we\u0027ll say \u0027Earth,\u0027 or \u0027Proxima Centauri,\u0027 or \u0027Gliese 667.\u0027 They\u0027ll teach geography in stellar terms, not national ones. Just \u003Ci\u003Eimagine\u003C/i\u003E it Marco, imagine that day!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You really are a madman, Weston,\u0022 Marco told him, laughing. \u0022But by God, I wish we had a million more like you. Just don\u0027t forget to send us some damn fine pictures when you get up there, would you?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Pictures? I\u0027ll send holovids. People will have the wonders of the universe, right at the tips of their eyeballs. But it won\u0027t be the same, you know. They won\u0027t \u003Ci\u003Efeel\u003C/i\u003E the warmth of a new sun, they won\u0027t hear the patter of dust on the hull or the radio-band sonatas of gas giants singing them to sleep. There\u0027s only one way to have that - they\u0027ll have to follow me up.\u0022 For a moment, Weston\u0027s voice grew low, serious. \u0022Make sure they do, Marco. Space is vast, but it\u0027s not empty and it\u0027s not meant to be lonely.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We all do our part, Weston. Get some rest, you\u0027ll need it tomorrow.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv data-role=\u0022contentPage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Chr data-role=\u0022contentPageBreak\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always liked Ray Bradbury\u0027s work, but somewhere along the line he became my \u0022favorite\u0022 author (at least of Sci-fi). There\u0027s an earnestness in his writing I greatly admire, and I\u0027ve been itching to try and capture some of that. So you might consider this a sort of literary homage to his style.

One day it was simply \u003C/i\u003Ethere\u003Ci\u003E, a gleaming silver Fifties-style space needle, perched on three stubby fins. There were no visible hatches or windows of any kind, no openings in its smooth metallic surface except the exhaust nozzle in its base. And perhaps most mysterious of all, the ground below it was still green and fresh, without a single trace of scorching or interstellar fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor days, people crowded around the Rocket, cautiously poking and prodding and snooping. When the craft stayed silent and dead, they grew bolder, tapping and hammering and even attempting to cut into the metal to get at whatever workings might be inside. Their efforts were wasted. The Rocket stood silent and impassive, its hull unblemished and whole despite their drills and saws and torches. No diamond tip or fiery plasma could make so much as a scratch on the strange craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince it had \u0022landed\u0022 in the park, out of the way of all but the weekend Frisbee-throwers, the townsfolk were content to leave it alone and forget about it. Certainly, the mystery remained, but it was neither an obstruction nor a danger, and so it became an idle curiosity instead. Gossip, rumors, and fanciful stories circulated through the town, and the surrounding counties, but there were no answers to be had.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree months passed. A small group of children were playing in the park, enjoying their last few days of freedom before school resumed once more. They dodged around and between the Rocket\u0027s fins, heedless of the black exhaust nozzle over their heads as they pursued one another in a game of tag. But as bottomless as a child\u0027s energy may seem, they did eventually grow tired and turn to the more passive activity of Hide \u0026amp; Seek. And that was when it happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile the other children scurried off to hide among the bushes and trees of the park, seven-year-old Victoria had a different idea. She crept around one of the Rocket\u0027s fins, looked up at the tall gleaming object, and asked quietly, \u0022Please, let me in?\u0022 And so it did.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA doorway appeared in the base of the Rocket, a small oval of white light, and it extended a ramp down to where she stood. Hesitating for only a second, young Victoria walked up the ramp and disappeared inside it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Five!\u0022 counted down the Seeker, whose name was Timothy. \u0022Four...! Three...! Two...! One...! Ready or not, here I come!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd ready or not, there went Victoria, streaking skyward on a tongue of orange flame and white smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo this day, no one\u0027s been able to find her. She always was the best at Hide \u0026amp; Seek.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-17T20:07:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2016 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kieve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T03:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv data-role=\u0022contentPage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a particular fascination with meteors, comets, asteroids, and other assorted stellar debris.

It \u003Ci\u003Eshattered\u003C/i\u003E. The world turned on its side, and bloody lances of illumination fell on the hills, sundering them. There\u0027s an old rhyme about red skies at dawn, but we had no warning, no \u003Ci\u003Etime\u003C/i\u003E to take warning. When the sun rose, it was angry, and everything on our side of the horizon bore its wrath.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou think I\u0027m speaking in metaphor? That some calamity we can\u0027t name fell on us from the heavens and started tearing up our world? No, my friend, this is literal. Every morning is like this. Our world is being continually ripped apart as it turns, and no matter where you live, dawn is the worst of it. That\u0027s when the absolute cold of night meets the shock-heating of solar exposure and the surface goes from freezing to \u003Ci\u003Evaporizing\u003C/i\u003E in seconds. So of course your next question would be, \u0022why do we live in such a hellish place?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is all we\u0027ve got left.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt used to be a planet - decent one, too. Had water, air, ecosystems, the works. Guess the cosmos didn\u0027t like that too much, since they sent another rock on a collision course with ours. But not just any rock. No, friend, there are little ones that melt in the sky before they hit the ground, there are crop-dusters and city-killers, crater-makers and harbingers-of-the-apocalypse that\u0027ll wipe your world clean so what\u0027s left can start over fresh. And we\u0027d seen them all, over the millennia. But this rock, oh this one was the great-grand-daddy of them all. This was a \u003Ci\u003Eplanet-buster\u003C/i\u003E, may as well have been a planet all to itself. Twice our mass, less than a quarter our size. It was an interstellar musket-ball of a rock, and when it hit dead-center after getting a nice slingshot off the other side of our sun?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of us are just counting our blessings there was enough of our mudball left to make a comet from. I\u0027ll bet even \u003Ci\u003Eyour\u003C/i\u003E planet blinked when that thing hit us. Winced, more like.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo we live on a comet now, half a hundred left out of a few trillion. Preserving the species, amirite? Somehow our little bunker managed to hold together when the world itself got blown to shreds, riding what\u0027s left of the mountain it was buried in through space. But hell, you already know all this don\u0027t you? You can see it in your telescope when you look up at night, hurtling down out of the black. We\u0027ve had a good run, even all these centuries after The End, but it was bound to catch up with us eventually. Maybe the rock that hit us was in our shoes now, carrying the last remnants of some other poor sucker\u0027s civilization with it. Our turn to pay it forward, I guess.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut hey, for whatever little it\u0027s worth?
