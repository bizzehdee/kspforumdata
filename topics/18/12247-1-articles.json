It overheats and I get maybe 15-20 mins of gameplay before KSP locks up, or worse, I get a BSOD and an immediate shutdown....Sometimes I can get it to limp along for a couple hours, by disconnecting all network connections, and shutting down all but the most basic Windows processes, and setting my resolution to 1280x720 and running KSP windowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont buy into the Intel TurboBoost...Might be OK for the occasional \u0022boost\u0022, but yeah, definately wont do any good for gaming...You\u0027ll be looking at an i7 or comparable at the least...and good luck finding one WITH a matching GPU in a laptop for under $1000...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-14T05:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2013 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bothersome","CreatedById":66869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T23:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem with \u0022store bought\u0022 computers is all the bloatware the factory puts on it as default.

Microsoft has \u0022Microsoft Security Essentials\u0022, it\u0027s free and it\u0027s the only other party besides yourself that wants your computer to operate efficiently.
