on Falling Stars went great in December, with some finishing touches on the Single Player version of the game, completion of almost all of the features, and tons and tons and tons of feedback from beta testers (much of which has already been incorporated into the base game). \u00A0Hearing players frustrations about UI woes,lack of tutorials, unintuitiveness, etc in other games and getting their input on how we could avoid that is 100% the biggest takeaway from we had from this last month of work. \u00A0Being the developer on a game and understanding every nook and cranny will always leave you blind to the player experience, so we logged every bullet point of feedback we received, implemented everything that wasn\u0027t a major change in the core game, incorporated some things that WERE major changes to the core game, and the rest we put on a schedule to either patch in post-release as little enhancements or even sneak in before release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne feature that our next beta build will make available to players is the diplomacy system, which is really a mixture of many systems but encompasses the majority of diplomatic relations especially with the lesser races in the galaxy. \u00A0This directly influences your ability to expand your empire, because you need to interact directly with each planet you encounter when you decide to conquer them and use up all of the planets resources, or instead form a treaty with them where you get an offering in place of resources each turn. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether or not you choose to \u0022Barter\u0022 with them or \u0022Conquer\u0022 them is dependent on a few different things, and it makes each decision meaningful but also very very important:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 *Who the allies of that particular planet are \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 *Who the enemies of that particular planet

planet until you\u0027re ready to make a decision on what you want to do. \u00A0While orbiting a planet gives you no immediate benefits, it protects the planet from the grasp of another empire, and it also allows you use a very well-timed barter to take other players by surprise. \u00A0Bartering can give you instant technology, resources, fleet, or even cause an uprising on another planet. \u00A0So if another player takes their ground forces off of the ally of the planet you are guarding, and you cause an uprising, it will immediately revert it back to neutral, forcing the player to lose the resource benefits of the planet. \u00A0That\u0027s just one of many examples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConquering is much like your typical exploitation in 4x games. \u00A0You take the planet by force, defeating any uprising and gaining their resources each turn. \u00A0Pretty simple. \u00A0But what you also much take into account, and why this is so closely tied with diplomacy, is that each planet has allies and enemies. \u00A0If you conquer a planet, their enemies will rejoice and you can potentially gain additional bartering benefits from them. \u00A0However, their allies will shun you, and can potentially reduce your benefits to zero, or even cause an uprising on one of the planets you\u0027ve already conquered, temporarily costing you valuable resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis really just skims the surface, but keep in mind every planet has their own unique set of allies and enemies, bartering benefits, resources, and influence and based on their random placement throughout the galaxy every game, it makes for a really unique experience and challenge every time you play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArkisVir","CreatedById":154606,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T19:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guys, I know I was quiet on this for a while but I
