Settings is the top button on the left column. The settings window should open to general by default. The list on the left side of the window should show the top word highlighted in blue. If this is not the case, click on that word (the one at the top) to change to general. Language is the top setting in the options pane, click on the dropdown menu box and select english.\n\nMake sure to look around and get some ideas on how to set up OBS for recording instead of streaming too. In particular, you may want to bump the quality up past what is available by default (custom x264 encoder settings, look for \u0027crf\u0027).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T19:47:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T20:01:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I started using OBS with the intention of trying to make vids, but how do I change the language?
