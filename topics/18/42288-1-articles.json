Your everyday\u0027s car engine consume fuel to make tires spin, while jet and rocket engines expel the fuel at high velocity to thrust themselves forward. And exhaust velocity is an important part of ISP calculations. So no, you can\u0027t calculate your car\u0027s ISP. There\u0027s probably other ways to calculate it, but not this way really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_impulse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAdditional info\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T09:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, another one (since we are at it): What about the mentos/coke-drive?
