Say you were making a hydraulic system and the instructions stated you needed to fill it with 2 pints of oil. What pint do you use\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I\\\u0027ve had experience with both systems and that dictated how I would record various things. When someone says their weight in kg or lb, it means nothing to me because I have to visualise the size of people in stones. But at the same time, I don\\\u0027t really use imperial units for measuring the weight of anything else (except cooking if both the recipe and the scales support it). For distances, I\\\u0027d use miles over km, but smaller distances I\\\u0027d quite happily switch between yrd, ft, cm, m, mm as the situation requires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately it comes down to which system you are most comfortable with using and which allows you to effectively communicate with others. Except Fahrenheit - that can burn in hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003EAn imperial pint = 20 imperial fl.oz = 568ml, a US pint = 16 US fl.oz = 473ml\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
