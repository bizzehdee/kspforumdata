Not only do you get twice the capacity for noticably less than twice the price, but there\u0027s also the fact that the smallest member of a SSD series usually has slightly reduced performance compared to the other models (because it has less physical storage chips and thus cannot parallelize data transfers as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough even a small SSD will run circles around any sort of magnetic disk.

Windows has this habit of accreting all sorts of digital gunk over time. Starting over will give you a leaner, cleaner and faster machine. It also takes the onus of configuring Windows for SSD operation out of your hands. During installation, Windows autodetects if it is being installed onto a SSD and sets configuration options like disabling automatic defragmentation and other such things itself.
