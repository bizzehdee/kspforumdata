I heard you moved there recently from Mars. How is Amy doing? Have you managed the guts to tell her how you feel or are you the same shy chicken I knew in the Academy?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for me\u2026 I\u2019m still just settling in here on Dorado, There is a lot to learn being a first time colonist. For example: Did you know that Dorado has no rotation? We didn\u2019t find out until halfway there when our telescopes detected it. Its odd living on a world where the day lasts half an orbital period and the nights are almost as long. The days are very bright, Lit in fact by two sun\u2019s, We didn\u2019t see it until our ship got closer but this star has a binary companion that orbits so close to its bigger sibling that they look like one star from a distance. As bright as our dual Sun is it will eventually have to go down as on any planet that isn\u2019t tidally locked. And we have no idea what will happen when it does go down, we were lucky enough to land on the day side of Dorado, We have no advance knowledge of what will happen when it goes completely dark. We intended to mount an expedition to the night side weeks ago but where thwarted when we discovered that what registered as land from space was in fact a sticky gelatinous sea separating the two primary continents. I\u2019m not looking forward to this long night, As you know I was always afraid of the dark, I recalled to you once an incident when I was on a date and she turned off the lights for a movie, I became immediately uncomfortable and had to explain to her that despite all my insistence on logical thought, My subconscious mind still maintained a superstitious attitude that in the dark\u2026 Frightful things came out. I can still remember her laugh; while the rest of the date went well and we eventually married (and later divorced) I never quite got over the humiliation. Also of interest: I found some plants just a kilometer away from our base. Interestingly they glow in the dark, I don\u2019t really know why but they do. Many of my co-workers have suggested different theories but none of them seem right to me. I feel I must inform you that this will be my last letter to you for at least nine weeks as our side of the planet will be facing away from Sol and our satellite relays are not functioning properly. I the meantime I give you full control over my property back home, The estate should automatically unlock for you once this message has successfully been verified.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSincerely\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoe\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n//END OF MESSAGE TIMESTAMP 1/5/2210CE 4:15PM//\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n//PERSONAL LOG: COLONIST 3RD RANK JOE WILLIAMS 1/5/2210CE-ONWARD//\u003Cbr\u003E\n---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\nI sent a message to Robert today; I didn\u2019t want to tell him that it could be my last. We don\u2019t have any idea if we will survive the night at all, For the last week or se we have been stocking up on supplies from our replication systems, Because we don\u2019t have the power to sustain all our systems on battery alone for nearly nine weeks, we will have no choice but to power down most systems such as: replicators, environmental systems, And\u2026 Lights (I would not have joined this mission if only I knew!). We\u2019ve also been searching the local area for edible plant life. //END OF ENTRY//\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n//1/6/2210CE//\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe search teams have returned with several interesting items. We cannot even tell apart fruit and vegetable if either even exist here. Most items turned out to be poisonous except one, the scientists say that it has no known toxic elements so I volunteered to try it. When I took a bite the juices exploded out all over my face, luckily there was no acidic content in it. The fruit (that\u0027s what I\u0027ll call it.) tasted very oddly, which is expected since the biology of this planet is significantly different from our own. Afterwards I felt kind of weird, when the doctors examined me they couldn\u0027t find anything wrong but I felt wrong. The feeling eventually subsided and we all agreed not to consume this fruit unless we absolutely have to. //END OF ENTRY//\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n//1/7/2210CE//\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProgress is really being made. We have very little idea what we will need other than the average provisions but we have plenty of contingencies on the drawing board. The sun is a little lower today, the shadows are longer and more noticeable. Strangely, plant growth has accelerated in the shadows, new kinds of plants are sprouting up all over the place, always in the darkest areas. None of us have ever seen anything like it. \u00A0However, despite it evidently being dim enough for them to start growing, they are still slowed by the remaining light, we know this because we brought one of them indoors and turned off the lights, it began to grow exponentially faster, it also revealed itself \u00A0to be quite predatory, as it grew it immediately was attracted to a potted plant in the corner and grew towards it, eventually wrapping itself around the stem and inserting root like appendages into the plant. The victim immediately began to wilt and died within a matter of minutes whereas the the vampiric night dweller only grew even faster, luckily it appeared to show no interest in us. However now that. I\u0027ve seen what it looks like fully grown, I\u0027m not looking forward to the forests of them that will soon be growing. //END OF ENTRY//\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n//1/8/2210CE//\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plants have grown even taller today. They seem almost intelligent, our observations show that beneath the surface their roots are interconnected meaning that they start out separate and grow into a single entity. I find them really unnerving, in fact: I am relocating to new quarters on the side of the colony furthest from those plants. Everybody is extremely tense. Especially one of the kitchen staff; Harold Vager, he started acting suspiciously and when captain Donnerson and the rest of us interrogated him, He confessed to having eaten several of the fruit, he apparently wasn\u0027t convinced of the serious risk and decided to taste test them to find how they should be best prepared. How a man of such foolishness could be allowed to join this mission I do not know, but the captain ordered him confined to quarters under guard until the effects are confirmed to have worn off. Aside from all that, I carried out a survey of the animal life, like the daylight plant life they glow in the dark, We have already determined that the vampiric plants do not have a taste for animal life and that the day plants glow to repel the night plants. Are there night animals we should be afraid of? We will soon find out, the sun is now just barely above the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Raging Sandwich","CreatedById":164377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T22:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NorthernDevo","CreatedById":161219,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T01:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222819768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150625\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477241370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002266349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E2016\u200E-\u200E10\u200E-\u200E23 at 0:49 PM, Motokid600 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to get into writing myself.
