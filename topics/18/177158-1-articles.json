I\u0027m on my phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the unlikely event anyone was wondering what happened with the last job post i did everything has gone well so far. Thier lead local tech is here like once a week and he hasn\u0027t said a single word to me in the 10 months or so i\u0027ve been here. Kinda prefer that actually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, i\u0027ve been at my current job about 8 months now and got a message from a friend of mine around a month ago that i should apply where he works. While the pay at this place is adequate there isn\u0027t really any potential to go anywhere. I did a interview at the new place and didn\u0027t get THAT particular job but did get a interview last week with a different department in thier building. The job is basically VOIP tech support for Microsoft Ofice 365 products, which based on my interviewers own statement is a fairly hard job. Objectively, this new position would be better in all regards and even sort of has some potential for advancement within the company. I\u0027ve done some tech support work in the past but, my gut feeling is even with better pay i might not last long there. I just can\u0027t decide if it would be stupider to pass on a objectively better job. Better benefits and office too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, i know this quick post is probably lacking in details but, i wanted to get posted and not floating around my head. I\u0027d like some opinions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-30T03:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much experience are they asking for?

If you\u0027re young or fairly early into your career, jumping around from job to job is ok if you\u0027re trying to get a leg up or move into something more aligned with what you really want to do. However, after a while, it does start to look bad on your resume to be at one place for a year, another for 15 months, etc. It sounds like this would be your third job change in 2-3 years, so you\u0027re starting to get into that territory where employers are going to question if you can stick around anywhere for a reasonable amount of time. In the IT world, especially, it can take as long as 2 years to fully bring someone up to speed, so if you\u0027re jumping around a lot, you may find it harder to get interviews next time because few employers are going to want to hire someone who is just going to bounce before they even get fully integrated into the company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, keep in mind that unless there are written promises of advancement, everything your interviewer tells you about that is BS. So, if you take that job on the hopes or impression that you\u0027re going to have a chance for advancement, you better get it in writing or you better really want to do VOIP tech support for Office 360. You may end up stuck doing that for longer than you anticipated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-30T14:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223424579\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532959054\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118096\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnny Wishbone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n44 minutes ago, Johnny Wishbone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an IT professional of 20\u002B years experience, there isn\u0027t enough money printed in the history of the world to make me take that job.

I think it\u0027s a few things in the interview he said that caught me a bit off guard, he himself called it a hard job with long days. Most interviewers tend to cast the job in a positive light.
