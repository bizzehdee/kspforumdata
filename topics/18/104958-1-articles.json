Like KSP, it involves building ships out of parts and then flying them. Unlike KSP, it\u0027s about using them to blow up other ships (no really, it\u0027s actually the point this time. I mean with actual weapons).\n\nIt\u0027s inspired by some semi-old 2D games such as [Battleships Forever](http://wyrdysm.com) and of course the KSP ship builder. Ships fly around using decidedly unrealistic physics, Star Wars-style, and the player must use a selection of ships and a good strategy to outmaneuver and defeat a group of enemies.\n\nMore information here: [http://helia.heliohost.org/4813/](http://helia.heliohost.org/4813/)\n\nLatest development video:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5v5bQc2kZM4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nFor now I have the working title of ~~\u0022Space Pizza\u0022~~ \u0022StarBlast!\u0022, but I don\u0027t want to use that for the finished game ~~because, well, it\u0027s not about pizza (please contain your disappointment)~~ - so title suggestions are invited! Please give me *something* because I haven\u0027t been able to come up with anything decent on my own.\n\nAnd even if you don\u0027t have a title suggestion, please do tell me what you think! Would you be interested in playing this game once I get around to making a download available? Are there features you think need to be added?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T07:45:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**\n  \nbeep boop"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T23:58:55Z","Content":"Hyper ship.\n\nMaybe use a similar game engine to make a game about delivering stuff in space."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T07:43:28Z","Content":"Bump!
