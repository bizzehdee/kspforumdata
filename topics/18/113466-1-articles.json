SOME states have strong castle doctrine, which does indeed state that if someone intrudes into your home, lethal response is allowed. In some places, this protection is extended to your vehicle, IF you are inside of it. MOST states require you to attempt to retreat first, even in your own home. If the intruder pursues or otherwise impedes escape, then a lethal response is allowed. \n\n\u0022Stand your ground\u0022 laws have nothing to do with trespassing. \n\nIf your life is being imminently threatened, that\u0027s self defense and doesn\u0027t matter where you are.\n\nThe spirit of all of these is to empower citizens to protect their lives and the lives of their loved ones, not to provide an excuse to kill people.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T15:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:21:26Z","Content":"If you\u0027ve that much disrespect for yourself and for others that you would trespass and steal/rob/etc, then perhaps you deserve what you get.
