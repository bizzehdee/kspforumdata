It really looks like it, just with higher resolution and cleaner textures (which admittedly is nice, I seriously hate the super grungey look of skyrim).\n\nI don\u0027t get comments like this. They dumped a large amount of money in gamebyo and while patching in more low-level enhancements rather than rewriting to use the latest features would be preferable, we are not actually doing anything INTERESTING with graphics these days. It\u0027s just \u0022Bigger Textures\u0022 and \u0022Moar Pixel Shaders\u0022... sometimes using \u0022flat textures\u0022 or \u0022outlining\u0022 rather than investing a single man-hour into actually doing cell-shading (even then, the effect is only used for certain scenes).\n\nWake me up when we do something as simple as finally stop merging clothing meshes with npc models and apply physical weights and attributes to the clothing model, thus allowing it to not only move realistically instead of being obviously glued to the torso but also be applied damage to realistically; and if we want to further this we\u0027d have areas upon which there are damage be treated as unarmored... well, instead of hyping the upteenth rebirth of VR.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I like that Beth actually upped the bar on the graphics (presuming we\u0027ll get all that in the end product)\u0027 date=\u0027 but I\u0027ll have to wait to see some gameplay (and what features they\u0027ve decided to \u0022streamline\u0022) before I can decide if I\u0027m going to be hyped.[/quote\u0027]\n\u003E We decided that most people who play our games are illiterate, as they clearly are unable to RTFM and always go on the boards saying things like \u0022How can I, a normal human with no superhuman abilities, not be a master of every weapon in the game? It was point blank range!\u0022 Thus we\u0027re removing the last remnants of the RPG and just releasing a pure FPS with arbitrary quests that have no relevance to the underlying story while each still trying to act as if it is a major life-or-death situation that you can leave and return months later to finish... even mid quest.\n\u003E \n\u003E In fact, we\u0027ve decided even the travel system needs an overhaul. Our examinations of gameplay revealed that 90% of the time, the player is still doing the tedious task of walking to some location. That players need to spend even 5 min walking to a location is unconscionable. Now you can instantly teleport to any location at any time even when in the middle of an enemy death camp, while fighting, and encumbered in loot... because we love you.\n\u003E \n\u003E We also decided it makes no sense that the player has to \u0022discover\u0022 locations that the people of the wastes obviously know exists before fast traveling to them; that\u0027s why instead of adding in maps or other neat ways of adding lots of locations while keeping some secret, we\u0027re revealing EVERY location at once! You can also fast travel to them without needing to visit them; after all, who wants to play walking simulator 2015?\n\u003E \n\u003E We even replaced those huge cities with NPCs that have random lines but no real level of interaction with a pop-up shop. We know the only reason you go to town is to sell and buy, why bother improving your interactions with NPCs and making your actions open up multiple lines of dialog as an evolution of the classic rpg would expect? We still allow you to enter the \u0022city\u0022 only so you can shoot everyone, of course, we know that people enjoy that activity very much for some strange reason... but it really is just a testing room with spawns of your choice.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bethesda, abandoning our loyal fanbase one game at a time."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:10:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good god, are they still using the same horrible engine?\n\nThey never were.
