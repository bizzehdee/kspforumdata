Here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people who like space made two computer people, and then put them in space. The computer people went to another world that was very small, and was made of ice and ground-stuff. It took a long time. When the computer people got to the other world, they broke into two different pieces. The people who like space meant for them to do that, so it was not bad. One of the computer people went down to the other world, but the other one stayed above it. The world was really small, so things on it were not very heavy. To make sure that the computer person didn\u0027t fall off of the world, the computer person had a thing that was like the guns that people use to use to kill really big water animals. These guns fire at the world, and stick inside it. That didn\u0027t actually happen, because those guns didn\u0027t work, but the computer person didn\u0027t fall off the other world, so it was okay. The other world was really far from our world, so it takes a long time for the people who like space and the computer people to talk, but since the people who like space told the computer people what to do before they left, the computer people didn\u0027t need to talk with the people who like space that much. The computer people sent pictures of the other world to our world. Those computer people are the first to ever go to a world like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this story with the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://splasho.com/upgoer5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eup goer five word change thing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T00:53:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by temporalExile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed an error\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T17:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this supposed to be Rosetta?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T17:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty obvious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I have started another one, but this is actually a pretty tiring exercise, since the words are fairly unpredictable.
