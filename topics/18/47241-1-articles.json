It contains 1.4kg of nitrogen producing 3 m/s of delta-v, and some electronics to automatically stop a spinning unteathered astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and it masses 38kg! Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone here know more about it, in-particular why it masses so much? 38kg for 3 m/s just seems outlandish to me. Heck, you could probably squeeze out an extra m/s by taking the empty unit off and throwing it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA isn\u0027t crazy, so obviously there\u0027s a good reason for it being so heavy, but an hour\u0027s research came up empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny info appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwoHedWlf","CreatedById":7163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T21:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you\u0027ve got got the weight of a tank to hold about 3000 PSI of pressure, some plumbing, some nozzles, some electronics, batteries to power the electronics, some gyros, some valves, some electronics to actuate the valves, some latches, a structural frame, some fabric...Obviously adds up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T23:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the input. You got me thinking about more details... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoogle Books returned a section of \u0022Walking In Space\u0022 describing the Gemini 4 Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit in detail. It had two 4000 PSI tanks along with minimal plumbing, nozzles, valves and such too. But it produced delta-v of 1.82 m/s with a total mass of only 3.4 kg. So double that to slightly exceed SAFER\u0027s 3 m/s: 7 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith SAFER the plumbing will be 8 times as complex since it can stop spins without being manually aimed. But playing around with replicating the plumbing using off-the-shelf brass and copper parts from Home Depot I can\u0027t make it add up to more than 5 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t buy the electronics amounting to much. A set of 3 commercial ring-laser gyros from Honeywell adds 1.4 kg and 6 watts of power consumption. That wasn\u0027t commercially available in 1990, but was common in military applications. Everything else would be sitting in standby until needed, but since it was designed back around 1990 I\u0027ll allow another 10 watts. Allowing 0.6 kg for the electronics and wiring is too much, but it puts my math back into round numbers. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the structural frame, latches and fabric we can toss in an average aluminum-frame backpack: 2 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy model is up to 16 kg and has everything but the batteries. But the standby power draw we\u0027ve identified is only around 10 watts at 15 volts. My notebook\u0027s lithium-ion masses 1 kg and is enormous overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was able to account for 17 kg. Could they need to heat the plumbing even when it\u0027s just on standby? That would require significantly larger batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T23:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you taken into account the environment it\u0027s meant to be used in?
