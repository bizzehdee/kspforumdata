This part of Missouri is extremely karst, meaning most of the hydrology is underground. Longest caves in Missouri are in this county (been so long, memory is a bit fuzzy, and the numbers might have changed . . .) Rimstone River Cave and\u00A0 . . . damn the other one I cannot remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of these are in the 30 miles of total surveyed distance ballpark, and what they consist of is: a dendritic network of downstream phreatic tubs with some vados modification. Far upstream ends either in a surface infeeder or a blockage. Downtream ends in either a blockage or a \u0022sump\u0022 (meaning the \u0022roof\u0022 of the cave goes below the water level). Essentially this is an \u0022underground river system\u0022 (which not all caves are by a long shot) in which the amount of water (and air, the important part) in the cave system is HIGHLY dependent on the amount of water currently in the immediate environs on the surface. To put it simply: these caves are extremely dangerous flood risks, particularly in the smaller infeeder (with the entrance sections especially) passages where the quantity of water coming in at the surface can easily exceed the volume of the passage itself = no air. Base on observations, there are very few if any places in this entire cave system that are always safe from flooding, though in some of the largest downstream trunk sections (the biggest trunks are in the 40 x 30 feet cross-section ballpark), the highest points in the passageway only flood about every decade or less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one must be quite attentive to the current situation of the aquifers as well as weather forecasts when visiting these caves: true for pretty much the whole of Perry County, MO (though in many caves, particularly in the Ozarks, flood risk is effectively a complete non-issue).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had driven from Columbia where I was in school and unfortunately the weather forecast was not good. Not terrible but not good. It was drizzling the whole time I was driving. Basically, the risk that the cave(s) would flood was not particularly high, but it was obviously above \u0022safe threshold.\u0022 My inclination was to get the Perry County locals I was going to meet to head to some destinations that were \u0022zero flood\u0022 risk, but the fellow who was leading the trip we had planned (which was a no-go as a result of the precipitation) suggested that we could do a useful trip just inside one of the entrances to Rimstone River cave. This particular entrance is a small sinkhole with small tube that leads about 150ft to a T-intersection with a larger tube that more or less has permanent water flow. The infeeder section is normally dry and flow into it only occurs under exceptionally high aquifer conditions. The larger tube is a near sump to the right and goes as a low airspace stoopwalk/crawl for a hundred feet or so before it too sumps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen this entrance was \u0022discovered\u0022 it was no entrance at all, but merely a short cave, which by plotting against the Rimstone river map revealed that it must be the upstream side of the cave system. There is a large gravel bar immediately downstream of the T-part I referred to above, which was simply excavated a bit, which lowered the water level in the pool it was holding (which formed the \u0022sump\u0022) and this \u0027created\u0027 the entrance to the cave; quite a handy thing to have. However, this gravel bar tends to progressively block the flow over time, so periodic trips to scoop it out are necessary to keep the entrance passable without diving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we went in and did some digging and yep, the airspace in the low-crawl \u0022near sump\u0022 was nicely increased from 8 or 9 inches to nearly 16\u0022 . . . There were some other guys in the group who at least wanted to see the main trunk, but me, I was playing it safe. I headed back to the entrance to check the weather and the other cavers went downstream for quick tour, promising to be back in no more than 45 minutes or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the entrance I found things had cleared up quite a bit, not quite a sunny day, but no longer drizzling. So I headed back in and proceeded down the belly crawl infeeder to the T-intersection . . . and this is when the OMG moment happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got back to the small \u0022chamber\u0022 where the entrance belly crawl intersected the tube and peeked both up and downstream . . . yep all looked good. The lowering of the pool was continuing a bit still and the airpsace was even a few inches larger now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly I started to hear something. My heart froze as the prospect of drowning like a rat in a mudhole leapt into my mind. It started like a whistle, but quickly progressed to more of a howl, and thence on to what I can only describe as \u0022like a train horn\u0022 except just constant, i.e., not going on and off like the engineer actually does\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VKhETMt9Y8o?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI raced back to the entrance and was surprised to note no inflowing water as I did, and when I got to the entrance and wriggled my way out, I was even more surprised: even sunnier than it was 10 minutes before and absolutely no sign of precipitation or impending flood disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was of course a bit baffled and clambered back down into the sinkhole . . . yep, that noise was still down there . . . it was coming from somewhere inside!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo cautiously, I decided, well it seems this isn\u0027t an existential thread moment so why don\u0027t you go see what the hell is making that noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack down at the T-intersection, it was now obvious the howling noise (which continued and had done so for some 10 minutes, but did seem to be starting to lower in intensity) was coming from the UPSTREAM section of the T-intersection. The water level in this section had obviously been lowered somewhat too, though not as dramatically as the pool that formed the original sump that blocked the entrance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I went upstream I found that the sump on the other side had been opened as well, and the noise was a result of the air rushing into the previously water-filled upstream sections that had been \u0022opened\u0022 by this higher pool having been lowered!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stooped there in knee-deep water for a few minutes watching the water ripple at the small 4\u0022 gap between cave roof and water surface as the air rushed upstream, listening to the howl as it slowly died down and disappared. One of the most amazing things I\u0027ve ever seen, and not only have I never heard any other cavers report anything similar, but of course . . . by the time my buddies got back it had completely quit and they didn\u0027t believe a word of it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
