The game does a good job of easing you in gently and helping you along. How long things take varies, depends how you like playing and what your goals are. If you build to a grid plan, use pre-made interchanges, and don\u0027t care what needs bulldozing then you can grow a large city in a few hours. If you prefer a less regular structure, opt to hand-build your junctions, or like to minimise demolition it\u0027s naturally going to take longer."},{"CreatedByName":"Kozak","CreatedById":128114,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:50:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not gonna preorder it, it looks cool and possibly better than simcity.

DropBox runs in background, but in the upper memory addresses that are not commonly used by programs... With that said, once i exited out of DropBox (and Outlook) running in the background, I was able to play Cities: Skylines without any problems. You can do this one of two ways: 1) Do a right click on the DropBox icon on your systems tray and select \u0022Exit\u0022... or\n\n2) Open up your Task Manager (control-alt-delete will bring this option up) and select \u0022Task Manager\u0022 and look through the Apps, the Background Processes.
