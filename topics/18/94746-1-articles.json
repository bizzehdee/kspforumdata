Incidents and deaths are significantly and structurally lower than even 15 years ago. Flying is safe, even compared to flying. I hope not to offend anyone by discussing the subject like this in this thread, but people need to be aware that what they are doing right now is statistically more dangerous than flying. Do not let a couple of high profile crashes convince you otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T19:19:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T19:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDeaths are not considered the defining variable when if comes to aviation safety by experts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not buying that. to be a little over the top, this would be like saying that four crashed paragliders with the worst injury being a broken leg are worse than MH370, MH17, QZ8510 put together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T19:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MBobrik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T19:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not buying that. to be a little over the top, this would be like saying that four crashed paragliders with the worst injury being a broken leg are worse than MH370, MH17, QZ8510 put together.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the top of the list of numbers I posted it says that only aircraft with more than 13 passengers are counted \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This is to eliminate local traffic and aviation, as those operate on different principles, by different standards and are operated by different people.
