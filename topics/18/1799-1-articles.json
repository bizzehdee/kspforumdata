(Much as I love Star Trek, for example, the physics in it are pure fantasy, at least within all of our lifetimes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start it off with my recommendations of the Holy Trinity of space movies/TV shows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Right Stuff\u003C/em\u003E - While it\u0027s heavily exaggerated in places, related to Tom Wolfe apparently not being able to tell when someone\u0027s telling him a sea story and thus putting *everything* into his original book, it\u0027s still a compelling and largely-accurate tale of the early X-planes and the Mercury program. The stuff they depicted the astronaut candidates as having to do in the selection process would probably be a Geneva convention violation, but it\u0027s all accurate to what they went through in the first selection process. (Mercifully, it was made saner in time for the second round.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EApollo 13\u003C/em\u003E - Dramatized, to be sure, with the usual amalgamation of people into single characters for storytelling simplicity and compression that left out some critical moments, but Ron Howard\u0027s lifelong love of the space program made him insist that they Get It Right, and that led to a very realistic and believable depiction of what some consider to be NASA\u0027s finest hour. The sets and props were so realistic that they were reused on my third selection; some of the props like the three-ring-binder checklists in Mission Control were *actual* ones used on the flight, pulled out of NASA storage facilities. Enough of the zero-gee footage was shot in the original Vomit Comet that it actually wore out parts of the aircraft, with the studio footing the bill to replace the engine pylons as a result. Side note: Because Howard couldn\u0027t find stock footage of a Saturn V launch of adequate quality to put together a complete launch sequence (he could put it together, but not with consistent light and shadow), he did his own with scale models and CGI; the footage was so convincing that, after seeing the premiere, Buzz Aldrin asked where he found that footage--and, after being told it was new footage, he asked if NASA could use it, because it was better than what they had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFrom the Earth to the Moon\u003C/em\u003E - Howard again, this time with fellow space nut (and Apollo 13 star) Tom Hanks co-executive producing. The twelve-part miniseries format allowed them to finally give many of the \u0027forgotten\u0027 parts of the program the sort of spotlight that they deserved. While there were a few more goofs (like showing Apollo 7 being launched on a Saturn V), and some of the episodes may be a bit off-putting at first due to directorial or creative decisions, each one ends up holding up extremely well. The Mercury and Gemini programs are compressed into a single episode that mainly focuses on Gemini, since it was felt that The Right Stuff had covered the Mercury program, and the episode about Apollo 13, rather than retread the same ground as the movie, instead focuses on how it was covered by the press, which is a fascinating story unto itself. If the Apollo 8 Earthrise sequence in \u00271968\u0027 isn\u0027t nearly a religious experience for you, then you have no soul! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyone else got any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RangerDanger75","CreatedById":1760,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-20T08:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it goes without saying, but \u003Cem\u003E2001: A Space Odyssey\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
