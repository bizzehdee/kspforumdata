I actually watched it BECAUSE of a reference to it on the KSP forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt inspired me to expedite full manned missions to Eeloo, to look into the possibility that it is in fact, Europa, ejected from Jool\u0027s orbit (it nearly intersects Jool orbit). Studies indicate that the \u0022brown gash lines\u0022 are areas of brown soil, lacking the formation of ice crystals that spans most of the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll recall in the movie those lines on Europa were stress fractures in the ice (where the ice was thin and heavy with cryovolcanic activity). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality we don\u0027t know what those lines on the real Europa are, they could be dirt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP Eeloo is Europa.
