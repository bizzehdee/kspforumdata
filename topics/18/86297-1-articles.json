Most people refer to the much-wanted 2142 sequel as 2143, similar to how the sequel to 1942 was 1943.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the sequel, I\u0027d like them to introduce the US army in some way, perhaps by adding a \u0022Western Alliance,\u0022 a coalition of US, Canadian, Mexican and South American forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see Titans battle each other directly in massive air battles, not just hang by the edge of the battlefield and get pelted by missiles. I want to see skies lighting up with fire!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of all, I want to see battles in orbit. In the 2142 storyline, the Earth is being engulfed in an ice age, so naturally, one solution would be to leave the planet. Nations would construct massive ships in orbit, awaiting some form of interstellar technology to be developed. On one of these vessels, a prototype FTL drive would be successfully tested, and the news would spread. Several nations would want that technology, and some would try to take it by force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T04:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t having the titans battle in space go against the core design of the franchise being a FPS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a personal level BF2142 is the last full released BF game I ever bought (I did buy 1943 on xbox and I liked that).

No sign of \u0022escaping Earth\u0022 in the cards for that universe.

And any fighting that happens up there is just going to further guarantee that we get stuck here, because of the debris field becoming a blockade.

It was my favorite of the whole series, and felt more balanced than the others (though air superiority as with all of them was still a bit ridiculous). I dunno, there was something about the charm of that one that just had the right balance between realism, fantasy, and game mechanics, that really appealed to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see it possible for Titans to fight in the air though, classic \u0022broadside\u0022 style. I don\u0027t know where that would leave us for the capture/control objectives of launching missiles though. Still more maneuverability would be nice. They should be able to go anywhere on the map, and also rotate. I think I\u0027m in the minority there though. Seems that most servers late in the game\u0027s life kept their Titans locked to the starting location, so I guess maneuverable Titans weren\u0027t very popular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T00:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there could be a \u0022Captain Mode\u0022 where a player is selected to command the flight of a Titan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, space debris could be a levolution aspect.
