Maybe everyone will have left in starships, and the ruins of our once great cities will stand above dense jungles and arid, lifeless deserts. I imagine walking along, looking at the huge monuments, and think of how great that civilization was to build all that. I\u0027ll also wonder why they left. Nothing stays perfect. Every clock winds down. Every orbit decays. Every civilization falls. Every building crumbles. It doesn\u0027t matter if it takes ten or ten million years, it will happen. That is the only thing we can be sure of. One day, KSP will die. The forums will be forgotten. That\u0027s just how the universe works. It\u0027s still cool to look at the ruins and wonder what it was like before it ended though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
