It regards the problem of propelling a spacecraft from Earth\u0027s orbit to Alpha Centauri, and I want to know how to work out some facts about this hypothetical voyage (such as the required delta-v and the best position to launch from)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ijuin","CreatedById":157,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-23T09:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERequired delta-v depends pretty much on how soon you want to get there. Alpha Centauri is 4.36 light years from Sol, so at a cruising speed of 10% of the speed of light you will get there in 44-45 years. For a one-way mission, total delta-v is just over twice your cruising speed. For a round-trip mission, total delta-v is just over four times your cruising speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for where to launch from, the delta-v involved in the flight is so much more than the velocity needed to orbit/escape from Earth that it pretty much doesn\u0027t matter where you launch from--though if your engines can not lift your entire starship from the ground into orbit, then you might want to assemble the whole thing in low Earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsion-wise, unless new discoveries in physics give us additional options, we have three viable choices for our engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Antimatter rocket. Antimatter is the most energy-dense fuel that can be carried, and with the use of drop-off fuel tanks, your starship can reasonably travel at 90% of the speed of light both ways on its voyage (especially if you refuel the \u0027matter\u0027 half of the reactant at Alpha Centauri instead of carrying all of your return fuel). Such speed can let you take advantage of relativistic time dilation to make the voyage shorter from the astronauts\u0027 frame of reference (only about two years each way instead of five).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Lightsails. Have about a terawatt of solar-powered lasers in our solar system focusing their beams onto the sail to drive it, and you can get up to 40-80% of the speed of light. By separating part of your sail at the opposite end to act as a mirror to reflect the laser back onto your spacecraft, you can slow down at the other end, and then you can do the same again (assuming that the people back on Earth keep the laser turned on) to accelerate back towards Sol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Fusion. Being a hundred and fifty times less energetic than antimatter, you probably won\u0027t be going faster than 20% of the speed of light with this--unless you can build a workable Bussard Ram-Rocket, that uses a huge magnetic field to scoop up hydrogen from the interstellar medium, thus giving you an inexhaustible fuel supply. On the other hand, fusion reactors are much less likely to go kaboom if their fuel leaks, unlike antimatter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-23T10:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, with all three of these options the \u0027viable\u0027 bit really means more of a \u0027slightly less sci-fi than warp drive, in that a century or two in the future it might, if we\u0027re lucky, become a useable propulsion method\u0027.

Then you have to stop, delivering 1 kg to the destination for every 11.6 kg that you accelerate to 0.9c. This clearly requires unreasonable amounts of antimatter. Some form of matter annihilation that doesn\u0027t require antimatter would work...if we ever discover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusion has similar problems, it\u0027s only going to get you a few percent of c at best. Bussard ramjets do solve the problem of carrying mass\u002Benergy source, but in our region of space, they produce more drag than thrust once they get above a few percent of c. They might be useful for decelerating if you use something else to accelerate, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven how difficult antimatter is to make, beam propulsion really seems like the only thing that is likely to get a payload to another system in a human lifetime. It completely sidesteps the big issue of having to carry a power plant and reaction mass on the accelerating craft.

I mean, right now you get a few thousand free-floating positrons or anti-protons stuck in electromagnetic traps, and it\u0027s even harder hard to trap neutral anti-hydrogen atoms at all. Using 100kg of magnetic trap for 1000 positrons is a very poor energy-to-weight ratio. Something on the order of multi-Avogadro\u0027s numbers.

I think I specified a manned mission to an outer planet as an example of where VASIMR is optimal for a near-future (i.e. within our lifetimes) mission. Missions where the delta-v exceed three times VASIMR\u0027s plausible exhaust velocity will run into the same \u0027can\u0027t carry enough fuel\u0027 limitation as any other carry-your-reaction-mass craft.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u003C/strong\u003E was talking interstellar missions on human timescales in general, and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cjameshuff\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cjameshuff\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a bit early for missions to other stars, though.

After the first few kilograms of plutonium, you can just pile in the lithium deuteride and scale up arbitrarily. Reliable and simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
