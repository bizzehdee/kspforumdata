So in that case most of the planets would probably be huddled up next to their star, And since the mass a brown dwarf is low the DeltaV required to get from one planet to the other would not be much.\n\nLadies and gentlemen i bring you an example of mine that is still WIP\n\nTHE OPLARA SYSTEM:\n\n![UtwO6kT.png](http://i.imgur.com/UtwO6kT.png)\n\nHope you guys like it, I am currently having trouble porting it to kopernicus (Mainly because 0.90 is so darn stupid that the ksc buildings glitch beyond all usable form!! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) I hate how if you are unable to get the latest version the best mods will always advance farther than you and you will be left behind unable to do anything! ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) ) so if anybody can help please PM.\n\nJust imagine a whole star system of planet packed really close together and the DeltaV requirements to get from one to the other are tiny."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:36:02Z","Content":"But brown dwarves aren\u0027t stars.
