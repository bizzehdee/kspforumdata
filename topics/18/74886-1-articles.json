He was originally hired for construction. When the ziplines needed a new guide (we only had one at a time back then) he was put on ziplines. That was about 10 years ago. Since then he has installed over 12 new ziplines and hired and trained a force of about 20 (it varies on the season). I was his first employee and he taught me everything. Sometime before I was hired the boss had a heart attack and he held the company together while the boss got better. Several years back he quit because the boss put him back on construction, then treated him like crap. He was hired back on ziplines and continued to be THE MAN (in a good way). Well it happened again and for the last time. The boss sends us to a conference to catch up on all of the current trends and standards, then when we come home and try to implement them he gives us crap and stresses us out. Our manager doesn\u0027t have good health because of all of the stress he has shouldered over the years and he is over it for good. They have already gone through several talks that were both good and bad, he was hired back, then immediately quit for the same reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the boss want\u0027s to wash his hands of the business one way or the other, and he is giving the safety committee the opportunity to become the new owners as long as they give him a small cut. This is extremely generous, and we all think that we can do it, but nobody has any training in running a business and we don\u0027t really have a lot of time to figure it out if we want to keep it going. I have raised my family on my wages for 8 years, and have done it all outside (rain or shine), smiling, and usually at least 20 feet off the ground. I don\u0027t want to lose my job, and I would love to own it. I just have no idea how, or where to start looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if this is to be our business, we are going to foot all the bills. I don\u0027t know if you know how much it costs to run a zipine resort (but it\u0027s ALOT ALOT) but we don\u0027t have the funds for that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the interest in any case, the KSP community really is the best one!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T05:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, so there really is no conflict any more, just a decent proposal to take over the business? Like people said, if you need money for something like that, go to the bank. They are not too keen on giving out money nowadays, but if you present a good business plan (a description of \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E this business is making money) and you can prove it is profitable by showing the books of the past few years you have a very good chance. If you are planning to buy a business it is customary that you get to see the books, because you need to know what you are spending your money on. If this is all magic and mumbo jumbo to you, consider hiring expertise. Yes, that takes even more money, but that should be something that is affordable and then you have someone to help you. Making mistakes and spending a lot of time could be more expensive than just getting someone to do it together with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is important to figure out what you want to do exactly. Do you want to buy out the old boss? Does he get any say in how the business is run? Do you want to take over/buy the company? Or just hire his stuff to make money? Do you do it personally or as a team? If you do not work this out really explicitly I am quite sure you will have trouble in no time. The boss changes his mind and everyone is stuck without a job and possibly a debt. I am quite sure the bank also requires this, as they will not loan money when these things are not secured and put on paper. Just make sure that you get rewarded for the risks you take, and that the old boss does not just keep on profiting while not running any risks. Be sure to make very clear who is and will be responsible for what, within the team of employees too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is something you like, it might be a great chance of making a career move and maybe even owning a company, instead of \u0027just\u0027 being an employee. Just be sure of what you want and be doubly sure of coming to agreeable terms with each other and then putting them on paper in detail. Prepare as if you are going to court and document everything. If nothing happens, which usually is the case, everything is fine. If things go awry, you will have a strong position if you have a nasty legal fight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-15T06:06:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2014 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zipmafia","CreatedById":108469,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T17:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf this is all magic and mumbo jumbo to you, consider hiring expertise.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it is important to figure out what you want to do exactly.
