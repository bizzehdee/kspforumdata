I would highly recommend looking into an i5, they have turbo boost and can achieve even better single threaded performance. KSP is primarily limited by the physics thread, and Intel dominates AMD in single threaded performance at the moment.\n\nMinimum 8GB of RAM (I would personally go for at least 16, especially since it looks like it won\u0027t be too long before we\u0027re freed from the tyranny of 32-bit, or you can use Linux to take advantage of it right away)\n\nDedicated graphics card. Absolute minimum would be something like a 750ti, if you have the money to build a more future proof machine I would recommend something closer to a GTX 970 (ATI has some good deals on cards as well, but I prefer nvidia due to better driver support overall in my experience and much better power efficiency).\n\nSolid state drive. This makes a huge difference in load times (especially when you have a heavily modded game). 256gb is the sweet spot for me with enough room for the OS and a decent amount of software, although from a pure price per GB perspective I think ~512GB drives are a little cheaper now, but not by much. I also highly recommend a secondary storage drive, something inexpensive with high capacity (speed isn\u0027t an issue). Great place to store all those mod downloads and backups of KSP installs.\n\nMake sure to get a decent monitor, keyboard and mouse. A lot of people overlook the peripherals, even though that\u0027s what you\u0027ll be using to interact with the computer and can make a large quality of life difference.\n\nIf you\u0027re building this specifically for KSP, I would recommend going with Linux instead of Windows for the time being due to Linux having proper 64-bit support.\n\nI don\u0027t know what your budget is, but here\u0027s what I would recommend if I was building a PC right now:\n\n[Rosewill RANGER-M Micro ATX case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147122\u0026ignorebbr=1) $30 \u003C- Feel free to substitute for another case if you don\u0027t like how this one looks, but make sure it has good ventilation.\n\n[Seasonic SSR-550RM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151119\u0026ignorebbr=1) 550W PSU $85 \u003C- Technically more power than you strictly need, but more future proof. You can probably cut back to 450W without any issues if you want to save a little. Make sure to buy from a reputable brand (and read reviews for that specific PSU), a poor quality PSU can fry everything when it dies.\n\n[Intel Core i5](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117302)-4460 $190\n\n[ASRock Z97M Pro4 Motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157521) $75\n\n[16GB G.SKILL Ripjaws X DDR3 RAM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231528\u0026ignorebbr=1) $100 \u003C- Memory prices fluctuate a bit, this was the best deal at the time\n\n[ASUS STRIX-GTX970 GPU](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121899\u0026ignorebbr=1) $320 \u003C- This particular 970 is one of the quietest ones available and comes with a backplate, plus it\u0027s the best deal right now\n\n[Crucial BX100 500GB SSD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148946\u0026ignorebbr=1) $190 \u003C- Great deal\n\nI would also recommend a 4TB HDD, but I don\u0027t see any great deals on them ATM, and with a 500GB SSD it may be unnecessary if you already have a decent sized external drive.\n\nTotal: $990. This is a pretty beastly PC that could run any game out there on max settings at a minimum of 1080P with a good chance of maintaining the performance at 4K for a little older games.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps. Feel free to critique my part suggestions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T20:08:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:39:25Z","Content":"Moved to Space Lounge, as this is not about the game itself."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:54:46Z","Content":"I have a Dell Vostro 220 with 3gb RAM, 2.9GHZ processor and a AMD HD6670 1GB graphics card and KSP runs perfectly with the graphic settings maxed out.
