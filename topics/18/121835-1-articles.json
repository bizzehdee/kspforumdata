What if the Mars 2020 rover\u0027s skycrane carried a small, aluminum Kerbal that is 3 inches tall (Exactly 1/10 scale) that had it\u0027s own miniature parachute attached so that it lands on the ground on it\u0027s own?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, the same model could land with the InSight lander (This would have to happen fast, InSight launches next year) or ExoMars lander and not need to have it\u0027s own parachute, instead it could simply land with the aeroshell/airbag lander package and stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could put a tiny microchip inside the metal Kerbal and put photos and videos of our KSP experiences on it, as an archive to future Kerbal players who visit Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think of this idea? Is it so nuts and stupid that it could never happen or do you think that we could get it on InSight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, putting payloads on the Martian surface costs less than 1.5 million dollars per pound. Considering that a metal Kerbal probably weighs less than that, not only is it cheap but it probably wouldn\u0027t affect a spacecraft trajectory and NASA probably wouldn\u0027t charge the KSP community $1.5mill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also added a poll for you guys to vote on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current favorite opinion is to put the metal Kerbal on the Mars 2020 rover. As such the logo displays a metal Kerbal at Columbia Hills, which is the Mars 2020 rover\u0027s current selected landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the sig version of the image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7uUwfU8.png\u0022 alt=\u00227uUwfU8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-30T00:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by _Augustus_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T19:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just attach it to the rover so he can ride around and see the sights?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point they tied a Buzz Lightyear toy to a rocket payload, and that was a lot bigger than the kerbal models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T19:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea: What if we put a tiny microchip inside the metal Kerbal and put photos and videos of our KSP experiences on it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows, maybe the first people on Mars will have once been KSP players who are kids right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy not just attach it to the rover so he can ride around and see the sights?\u003Cp\u003EAt some point they tied a Buzz Lightyear toy to a rocket payload, and that was a lot bigger than the kerbal models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Yes, but that would be harder to do, as it could obscure a scientific instrument and also impede the rover\u0027s speed.
