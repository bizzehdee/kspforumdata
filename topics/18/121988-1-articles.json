You\u0027d be at 500kts before you realized it and ripping the wings off. I liked the Barron because it was so nicely balanced, and very forgiving as far as a twin-engine prop went. I could put that thing down anywhere, the shortest of runways. I like it better than any of the Cessna\u0027s, except of course for the pontoon plane which is a must while flying all over Alaska lol. Speaking of Alaska, there\u0027s a runway way up north (I forget what country it was in) that\u0027s on the side of a mountain/cliff; The approach is straight in, no alternatives if you screw up, and you\u0027re landing essentially uphill.

Just this year they had a B-25 and an AT-6 come in and a bunch of military vehicles.
