It\u0027s a widely spread hobby, practiced by thousands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what about takeing R/C model flight to the next level? To space, maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are, of course, many problems connected to such an idea, for example the legal aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for now, let\u0027s overlook that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it clear, I am not talking about really going to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Espace\u003C/span\u003E. This would be too expencive and you would need huge vessels, nothing that fits into the trunk of a normal car. But what about a rocket-propelled spaceplane which can reach heights of about 100000 ft (30480 m) ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about the team that built a rocket that reached that height, but it was a rocket, not a spaceplane. Nothing reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe project (maybe):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was think about building such a plane, 2 - 3 meters long and about the same wingspan. It will need relative large wings for a spaceplane, because it has to be able to glide and it\u0027s quite small for a plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tSeOkBm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tSeOkBm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first model, this is what it will probably look like. Looks very similar to the Space Ship One. There is yet no space for an airbreathing engine, though. Maybe it will be added to the upper rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe look is not intersting at the moment, it will have to adapt to the practical aspects. It will be propelled with a jet engine like you can buy them in model shops for the first part of the ascent. When either fuel or athmosphere runs out, the rocket engine will be ignited and the second part of the ascent begins. After the burnout of the rocket motor the plane continues flying upwards to its apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will then fall back and start to glide back to the airfield where it came from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket motor itself should be liquid fueled, for example with oxgen and hydrogen which both can produced far easier than other propellants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there will be a small gas container with a small flame always burning inside the rocket motors\u0027 chamber to be able to (re-) ignite the rocket motor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the technical aspects: I would use a special r/c control, constructed to send the commands to the space plane even when it is near it\u0027s apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there should be one or more cameras attached to the vessel, transmitting a good view so that the \u0022pilot\u0022 is able to control the plane even when he doesn\u0027t see the plane any more. (You get problems seeing R/C planes at about 500 m, believe me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help, designs, ideas or constructive criticism is appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarkusA380\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-29T20:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2014 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MarkusA380\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T13:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027s probably get bored really quickly once the FAA, the Air Force, the DHS, the FBI, etc. start talking to you about your drones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-29T20:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you\u0027s probably get bored really quickly once the FAA, the Air Force, the DHS, the FBI, etc. start talking to you about your drones.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
