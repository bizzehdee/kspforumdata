But this would be my first time building one. I want this to be a gaming PC, but slightly different than most. I\u0027m really only interested in playing indie games. I don\u0027t need something that will run Crysis 3, Battlefield 4, or Skyrim. Just the smaller indie games. Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, and stuff like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never built a PC before and I don\u0027t really know parts that well, but I\u0027m fairly tech savvy. Any insight, tips, or straight up builds would be super appreciated.

I haven\u0027t built one in a couple of years now and naturally pcs have moved on MASSIVELY, BUT its actually really simple. You want a PSU, Motherboard, RAM, HDD (preferably SSD if you can afford it) Processor (AMD have some have with the motherboard combined have some decent graphics built in(its what i use for \u0026gt;300 part ships in KSP)) and some peripherals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside the case on the Motherboard its mostly labeled from what i remember. So You will have a SATA cable from your HDD that will plug into the SATA socket on the motherboard for example. All the little doodads and cables are normally labeled too so someone who is able to put together an airfix can build a pc pretty much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone else can chime in on more detailed info since i have been out of the game (computer building) for some time now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweety\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T16:03:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA bit more on storage. If you store a lot of data you would want an HDD I used to do recording and I have an HDD because I need lots of storage and HDD\u0027s offer the best price per GB. If you want fast boot times and games to load fast you would want to go with something like a 256 Gb - 512 Gb SSD depending on the size of your library.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kenobi McCormick","CreatedById":57254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T16:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStep 1 through 9: Buy used parts. $500 \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E get you a rig that\u0027ll run BF4 if you\u0027re not ridiculously afraid of used parts like a lot of people seem to be.
