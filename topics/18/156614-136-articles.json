They cost roughly 7-8 times what one of our standard laptops did, and based on our revised costs after I took over the maintenance we didn\u0027t expect them to last 7-8 times longer. We actually got to the point where we were retiring a lot of the older laptops rather than losing them to attrition, simply because we improved our maintenance and educated the sups. Plus for us losing a laptop in the field wasn\u0027t mission critical, it didn\u0027t take down the site. The sups did most of their communication with the subs by phone or FTF on-site. Most of their on-site documentation was hard copy,. So if their laptop went down, waiting for a new one to come out by 2-day air didn\u0027t lose the company anything except some status reports and some convenience for the sups. if we were in a situation where losing the laptop brought the site down and we were losing money by the minute, then yeah, the ruggedized units would have made a lot more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223535438\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549394080\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVirtual remote desktops, accessible by the personal smartphones and by the cheapest available nettops with a reduced linux\u00A0with the only program loading on startup: a remote desktop client..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, the last project I was working on there before I left was to bring up a Windows Terminal Server that would publish an application to the sups desktop that they could use to make their status reports directly into a project management application the company had purchased, instead of writing them up in Excel and emailing them to their project coordinators.

The the design of the elevator itself seemed good from the day one (and so far still seems so) but I had trouble with the motors, namely deciding how powerful they needed to be. I\u0027ve tried two sizes of steppers and while the second (twice as strong as the first one) was mostly sufficient, there were a couple of instances where, at full spewed, they skipped a step or two which led them to stall out. In addition to that, the steppers being steppers, they are fairly loud. It\u0027s just their nature, which we didn\u0027t particularly like. So we broke the piggy bank and went all in. I ordered some industrial grade brushless servos that have the smarts to behave just like steppers, so all my electronics and software still work without major changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the moment they arrived and I first tested them I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of them. They have all the torque you may want and torque limiting (should you want such a thing), silent running, feedback to the microcontroller, error checking and closed loop control. Like I said every thing about them is great, well, except the price, which was aligned with the axiom \u0022you get what you pay for\u0022, but I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the story, at the start of December we finally put the elevator in action and for more than a month it operated without issues. Well, without issued caused by the elevator. The software running the trains barfed up a few times and caused trains to stop a bit too late. The first time is not a problem since the elevator has custom made full metal barriers (such as on level crossings, but across the rail track) on each end of the elevator and on each fixed level, and if the train stops too late the barrier stops it. This collision is intended as a last line of defense, not as a part of regular operations. The thing is, once the train hits the barrier, the barrier needs to be checked for misalignment of the barrier arm and the U groove on the opposite side in which the arm sits once lowered. The crash can cause the arm not to sit in the U groove properly and the next train that hits the barrier can crash through. This chain of events (computer failing to stop a train in time, and nobody noticing it before it happened again) is not likely to happen often, but over the course of 40 days it naturally did happen. Murphy made sure of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result of this is that a locomotive that crashes through the barrier went over the edge of the elevator, lost power as soon the front set of wheels fell off the cliff and the rear set lifted up. Now the locomotive is halfway over the ledge and the elevator doesn\u0027t know that. The software running the trains is the one responsible for deciding where and when the elevator moves, and not knowing about the loco over the edge, it directs the elevator to go up. The only problem is a locomotive that is about to be caught in a pair of scissors made up of on one side 10 x 12 mm brass profile holding the fixed level (10 mm plywood) and the elevator itself, which is a beefy aluminium 150 x 50 mm L profile 8 mm thick. The motors are 200 W each, geared down 2:1 and turning a ball screw with 5 mm pitch. Smething has to give and it sure as hell is not the elevator. Actually the fixed level is the one that suffers the most. Brass profile is sheared off in the root where it is turned down to 9 mm and meets the iron frame of the elevator itself, and the plywood stands no chance. Locomotive suffers only minor damage to decorative wires on the roof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody here is impressed with the power of the system and on more than one occasion we discuss the dangers of it. Even though the elevator is behind a plexiglass, we install additional safety panels to restrict access to the moving parts to prevent fingers being caught in the dangerous parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also prompted me to install additional safety measures for the trains. I made new barriers, this time a little bit more sturdy, added sensors which should detect if the barrier arm does not sit in the groove properly, and optical trip wire sensor to detect if the train stopped too late which will at the same time block the movement of the elevator and report the error to the PC. Since I was already doing some software and hardware changes I decided to do one more thing that kind of bothered me. The original design had only one sensor for zeroing placed on one end of the elevator, but two motors driving the entire thing (one on each side), which meant that if the motors got slightly (one step) desynchronized on power up this small error will add up and each day it will get worse. So I installed another sensor on the other side and reprogrammed the initialization sequence to recheck the leveling each time the elevator is turned on. So, now I have everything hooked up, it\u0027s time to test it out. A few minor issues with the software which I quickly fix and the startup leveling works flawlessly, except that during the very slow movement during homing sequence there is a squeal coming from somewhere. I quickly locate the source. It\u0027s the timing belt between one of the motors and the lead screw which doesn\u0027t sit in the middle of the timing pulley and rubs (lightly) against the side flange. I can\u0027t do much about it and let it be for the time being until I finish up the wiring, reprogram positions of the fixed levels and readjust lateral track positions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that this is done the though of readjusting the timing belt comes back to mind. I really don\u0027t know why, it\u0027s not even a problem as it doesn\u0027t squeal in normal operation, only in the very slow movement during homing, but in this moment the elevator is moving and I have a bright idea to just push the belt a little bit downwards towards the middle of the pulley. Well, it was a bad idea. The belt is made of steel wire rope reinforced rubber and grips the skin very well. In a split second my finger went from the side of the belt to the inside of it and towards the pulley about to be caught between the belt and the pulley. I managed to pull out just a little bit too late and got the tip of my finger caught before I ripped out a piece of skin. Like I said, I\u0027m an idiot and could have lost a finger. The motors would not even slow down and the steel wires in the belt were not likely to yield before my finger got mushed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-06T14:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought a fountain pen, and it was slightly clogged.

I\u0027ve been in that industry since 2001. I can vouch for the capability of some of those motors. The ones I used to work on at my first motor manufacturing job had servo drives that ran on 3-phase AC, and drove the motors at 295 volts at up to 30 amps continuous, 45 amps peak, driving 3-8 inch diameter rotors with motor housings (including magnets) being 8 inches up to just over\u00A0a foot in diameter and a foot to a foot and a half long (that\u0027s just the stator length, the motors were closer to 2 feet long, to accommodate for\u00A0the sensor hardware).\u00A0A touch bigger than what you were using. Definitely powerful. You could reverse it, even at full speed, and you only saw the shaft for a fraction of a second before it was already at full speed the other direction. Crazy torque! Also amazing how it can hold torque, even when stopped, thanks to the closed loop feedback. We used to use an analog tachometer for torque feedback, and hall sensors for commutation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, you painted quite the picture in words!

While I was playing with these ones I held them in a vise (that\u0027s actually what the manufacturer strongly recommends to do before you start fooling around with them) and tested them for torque and acceleration. Definitely near instant top speed and braking/reversing. It did make entire bench shake on direction change, so I toned down the fun XD. These things have a USB port so you can hook them up to a PC and fire up their software that graphs out every thing imaginable (requested and/or actual speed, actual torque, total power, power as fraction of maximum, divergence from requested position... the list goes on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe purpose of the elevator is to connect three rooms.
