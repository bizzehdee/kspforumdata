Just look at things like Mars-One or Space X they get huge public resonance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people probably dont think its that important but by making space-exploration interresting for the broad public funding will also grow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think has changed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really dont understand why space-programs arent supported way more these days.
