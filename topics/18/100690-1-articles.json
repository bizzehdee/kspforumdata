It is as funny as it sounds, and the situations that led to the high school girls becoming astronauts were as unlikely as any other anime, but what sets it apart is thanks to the technical assistance of JAXA in its production, along with the author natural interest in hard science fictions(his light novel is pretty nice), and so it is less about fantasy rocket tech, but more or less grounded in reality. Though some hijinks may also be included.\n\nIt is quite interesting to watch, just started my first episode after reading the first novel of the series in english.\n\nAfter ep 5 it starts getting more into space flight drama and stuff, so don\u0027t be daunted from the beginning at first where characters are being developed.\n\nStill, the novel is better. The anime cram too much stuff into a few episodes, and skipped over a few other things along with making much further leap of faith:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ending of Ep 6 has them landed right in the pool of the main char\u0027s school from orbit. Like, really? The novel has the main char actually meet up with MIR in orbit before her sister catch up with her, and a lot more space craft related things. A lot of important things happened on MIR, damn it japanese producer! I highly recommend you to read the novel, the first two has already been translated to english.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T17:57:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:18:50Z","Content":"I really enjoy the anime.
