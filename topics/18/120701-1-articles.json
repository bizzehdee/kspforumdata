For example, First Person Shooters -- they\u0027re a dime a dozen, yet there\u0027s enough subtlety between each that you can ask any gamer what his or her favorite is and they\u0027ll nail which one and why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I hope KSP opens up the space exploration game market enough to attract studios with larger production values. I don\u0027t wish for Squad to go out of business (and I doubt they will) but think of a KSP-inspired title made by a huge team of artists and developers. Imagine \u0022Space Engine\u0022 level graphics combined with KSP\u0027s lego-style rocket building.
