This will enable the experiment to be repeated with less parts breaking, allowing you to recover more of your body.\n\nMany versions ago, I used to attempt to gain extra flight time when jumping from stairs, by attaching a blanket to my arms. I have not tried this lately, so maybe that\u0027s something you could try, if you want to get the \u0027in flight\u0027 situation.
