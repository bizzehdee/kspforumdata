It could also include more of those Cosmic Cubes like the one they had in the first Avengers movie. Now I need to get thinking on who would make a good Adam Warlock...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Thor: Ragnarok is interesting. Interesting because it happens during the Civil War, which is possibly the setting for the Captain America movie. I\u0027m not sure how it will all play out, since The Avengers was created AFTER the evens of the Civil War, but it\u0027ll be interesting to see what happens. I was never really a big Thor fan but if memory serves, Ragnarok is a clone of Thor created by Tony Stark. I\u0027m even more interested in Age of Ultron now, since apparently Thor is supposed to disappear before Ragnarok is created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I wish DC would have come out with their stuff sooner. I can\u0027t wait for the Justice League films. I just hope they don\u0027t have Superman kill someone (I mean, what were those dumb writers thinking?), and I hope they pull characters from the TV shows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregA","CreatedById":126788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T06:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh please other film companies, do the right thing and let Marvel have Spiderman and Wolverine (erm I mean X-Men) back...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
