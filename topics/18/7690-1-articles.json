It is designed to knock enemy aircraft out of the sky, and to do that efficiently. It would appear to have succeeded in this goal if exercise results are representative of real life combat. Let\\\u0027s hope we never find out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back in the 1970s it was discovered that the US Air Force would not be able to purchase enough F-15s to meet their needs; so they set up a competition for the new Light Weight Fighter (LWF). This competition produced two excellent aircraft - the YF-16, which was ultimately chosen by the Air Force to be produced as the F-16 Fighting Falcon; and the YF-17, which was never put into production but became the basis for the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18. Although in absolute terms the F-16 is big and expensive, as fighter jets go it\\\u0027s actually small and cheap; and the US Air Force was able to buy a lot more of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a similar vein, the changing political realities (as well as skyrocketing development costs) have meant that the US Air Force cannot get as many F-22s as they\\\u0027d like (to be fair, they are the most expensive fighter ever made). Fortunately for them, they already had the F-35 in the R\u0026amp;D cycle. This was designed to be a multi-role combat aircraft. It can\\\u0027t match an F-22 in air combat. It\\\u0027s not meant to. It\\\u0027s meant to be the jack-of-all-trades combat aircraft that can carry bombs, recon pods, air to ground or air to air missiles, even a laser weapon (if the technical types ever actually get one working[1]). It\\\u0027s fairly stealthy, so it will be difficult to detect (more so than even the F-117A, although not as stealthy as the F-22). It will also be considerably cheaper than the F-22, and will be produced for a large number of countries, which means a large production run, which means further reductions in costs (as the costs are spread out over a lot of nations). This is the aircraft that will replace the F-16 and F/A-18 in many of the developed world\\\u0027s countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the skepticism that many people have about this project, my experience is that generally the kinks get worked out. When there are so many countries riding on the one project, failure really isn\\\u0027t an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] This sounds like science fiction, I know. It\\\u0027s not; there are three models of F-35, the A (land based), the B (Carried based, and VTOL) and the C (Carrier based, with catapult and arrester hook), and the A and C have a space where the B model has its lift fan. Since this is already set up to allow the engine shaft to power something in this area, the idea has been proposed to use the shaft to power an oversized generator, and use the extra electricity to power a laser (\u0027directed energy weapon\u0027 being the technical term). This would have the advantage of being able to hit targets at the speed of light (simplifying targeting immensely) and not require ammunition. However, it is certainly a long way off, if it is EVER going to be practical. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MassiveEffectz","CreatedById":8742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-06T20:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went to bed after i made this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot the F-35?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing of a night hawk flying toward your face.
