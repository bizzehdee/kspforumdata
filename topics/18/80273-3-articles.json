It ran on Iphone operating system 3.2 and had 256Mb of ram. I still use it even though I have a newer Tab pro because I still have shows on it. I like the quick iOS interface and such but when it comes down to it, I prefer my Tab Pro over my 5s and iPad. For starters, when it comes to raw processing power and storage, Samsung and android devices tend to beat out Apple products rather consistently per price. A few examples of this are Phones like the Galaxy S5 and Oppo Find 7, both have similar price points to mid storage iPhones. The find sports a 13mp rear camera and the s5 has a 16mp one, the iPhone is left with just an 8mp camera. Another point is the pixel density of the screen. Now keep in mind the iPhone was released a few months before the other two but the discrepancy is still too large for that to account for it. Back to pixel density, both phones are larger yet still usable with one hand and both have a higher pixel density. The S5 has a density of 432 ppi on a 5.1 inch screen and the Find 7 has a density of 538 ppi on a 5.5 inch screen. The iPhone 5S is left with a density of just 326 ppi on a tiny 4 inch screen. The next big thing is storage, both the S5 and Find 7 feature 32 GB of built in storage but also accept a Micro SD card of up to 128 GB that is also interchangeable, leaving you with 160 GB of storage. The iPhone is left in the dust once again with a limit of 64 GB that is not expandable. The next point is battery, The S5 features a 2800 mAh batter and the Find 7 has a 3000 mAh battery both much more than the Iphone 5S at a measly 1570 mAh. This brings us to processing power. The S5 has a 2500 MHz 4 core processor and 2 GB of ram. The find 7 also features a 2500 MHz quad core along with 3 GB of ram. Both beat out the iPhone\u0027s dual core 1300 MHz processor. The final point here is price. The iPhone comes in at around 800$ for the 32 GB version- On par with the other two phones storage wise. The Galaxy S5 is 700$ and the Find 7 is a relatively low 600$. In the end it seems price is inversely proportional to screen area, density and processing power. Not only are the raw specs better but I find that the Kitkat interface is much better than the iOS 7 one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
