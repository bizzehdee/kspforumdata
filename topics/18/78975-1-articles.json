These studies and data from the state register of arms showed the guilty, the school principal, he had a gun permit, a former police officer who believed in strict discipline with respect to both boys and girls, both murdered boys were killed shot in the backs of their heads, so-called. \u0022Katyn shot\u0022 like us in Poland used to be called the method of execution. The police arrested the director of the school, which as I said was a retired police officer, investigator shouted at him that abhor the fact that he once was once a cop, that brings discredit to all Polish police officers and teachers, and it\u0027s still cowardly \u0022Katyn shot\u0022 if he could not look the victim in eyes. He replied that he could not hurt any of those children because for him they are closer to him than his own, which does not have. He said that a month before he lost his weapon, he suspected that someone stole it, but as a retired police officer knew the procedure. in such cases, he feared it might lose a gun permit and a job (although this last in his case it was not that terrible, because he had retired, because in Poland until recently police man could go on retired, already 40 years old when he/she was 20 years service)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe headmaster said he was a policeman but I always wanted to be a teacher, but he had already qualified, finished the police academy and had graduated from the Law, but he wanted to be a teacher, in the meantime the police service, he graduated in absentia studies of pedagogy.

The perpetrator was a 16 year old boy but very poor with very good results at school. These boys bully him, cup of bitterness overflowed it that he burned his only pair of shoes, teased him that he is the headmaster lover (although that guy was not a pedophile, because this topic was examined by the police) because this often stayed in the room the director of the school. with whom he played chess, he also had some money from the school principal for cleaning his office, for that he knew where he holds the weapon, which it headmaster himself showed him) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when the police interrogated heard (on the radio: Shots fired!
