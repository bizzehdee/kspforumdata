I live in the outskirts in Austin. It\u0027s a really nice neighborhood, but there\u0027s a problem. Just some background info for later in this piece here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, not trying to turn anything here politics-oriented. But we here have all (well, at least, most) heard of the US Supreme Court striking down Net Neutrality. This is HUGE. Worse than SOPA or PIPA. Not because it\u0027s really bad. They\u0027re both equal. But this is different. Instead of the government blocking websites, the ISPs are blocking it. Making money off of our misery (funny how no one in America cares about anything, but when someone kills your internet, there\u0027s hell to pay). This is (at least, I would consider it,) worse than SOPA or PIPA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, back to the Austin stuff. So, any of you non-Texans, in Texas, most of the state has one choice of cable/internet providers (this is true for a lot of the states, but replace TWC with Comcast or some other provider): Time Warner Cable. Now, my internet has been slowing down, and it has been really patchy, since the beginning of February. I was concerned they were throttling my internet a while ago. But then, while watching the Olympics on an HD-Antenna thing, I saw an ad that said if you get a Cable-Internet package \u0022now for the next [numerical interger from 1 to 30] days\u0022 (can\u0027t remember how many days,) you can get a free \u0022speed upgrade\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENow I\u0027m pissed.\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to rant. But then I thought back to Verizon or some company saying that they \u0022Would never use this against their customers for their advantage.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelp, going to jump off a cliff soon.
