Basically if you put 100mL of water into a syringe and press it with all your might, it will still take up 100mL under normal circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the key word is that little bit at the end - \u0022Under normal circumstances\u0022. If you have a lot of water and a means of conferring enormous pressures on it, you\u0027d be able to see some compression take place. It wouldn\u0027t be very great, but over a large sample of water it\u0027d be measurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore: When we say water is incompressible, we\u0027re really meaning \u0022practically incompressible.\u0022 The amount of compression that can be achieved using the equipment we\u0027re likely to deal with on a normal day is so slight as to not really be worth considering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you\u0027re talking about the entire planet\u0027s water . . . \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T13:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETemperature can be used to \u0022compress\u0022 liquid.
