Running with one 800 fuel tank and 4 B9 D-30F7 Turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the back story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was testing the limits of the B9 Jet engines, specifically the Turbofan and Turbojets. These engines are notably more efficient than the vanilla ones. First, they burn the same amount of fuel slower. Time trial, one fuel tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVanilla Jet(1): 12 Min (no warp)* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Jet(2): 21 Min (no warp)*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*trial commenced on an average of 10000 feet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go lower, the Fuel consumption rises, inevitably because humidity can produce a \u0022steamy\u0022 affect in a jet propelled engine, noted on turbojet 1 and 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go higher, the oxygen count lowers(making the effect of a constant jet stream impossible), rendering altitudes of 40,000-50,000 very hard to reach without rocket assistance or air compressors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest performance will be around 10,000 to 30,000 feet, but getting through the humid troposphere can consume a lot of fuel, so bear in mind if you are planning any long term flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough science, more news.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this hype is because I used 4 Jet engines to circle Kerbin twice, on one fuel tank per engine. (With the help of a radial, advanced aerodynamics and expert made air compressors).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight was commenced on a very uneventful 1 hour and 34 minute flight period. The Flight log was really only rumbled by an Engine-3 overheat 40 min into the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirframe was light and primitive B9 S2 fuselage with a S3 Hyp. Module and heavy duty wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly extra components were nav lights, a thermometer and a transmitter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I managed a landing at home KSP with no fuel to spare. I glided 1 km to the airfield, set her down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComment down below for tips/suggestions on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VChNpSq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VChNpSq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T21:07:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Turbojet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T07:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming you mean 10000m. 10000ft is approx. 3300ft.
