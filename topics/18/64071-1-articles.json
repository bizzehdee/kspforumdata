It looks better than San Andreas, but the story line is a little erratic. San Andreas was focused more on character development than GTA V. I think you will be happy with it if you can get past the vulgarity and violence and such, and enjoy it for what it is, a good looking and good playing game. It is definitely the best console game I\u0027ve played since San Andreas, although Skyrim is pretty damn good too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for whether to buy for a console or a pc, I look at it like this : I know it will work on my xbox 360 or my PS3, most definitely not on my laptop. If you have a high end PC, then go for it. Some of the screenshots I\u0027ve seen from pc\u0027s are amazing. The California sunsets are rich and full of color. Not to mention the incredible amount of detail you will notice from time to time, like mud puddles filling up during rain storms, or tent flaps flapping in the breeze. Getting a game set up for a pc can be a pain, while consoles are simple : put the disc in and go. Either way, the game looks great. Gameplay is smooth and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : Okay, now I\u0027m confused. I thought I saw screenshots on a forum last week from a pc, but it still hasn\u0027t released for pc yet?
