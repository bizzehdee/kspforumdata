So much italics. Too bad the forum doesn\u0027t automatically do it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[1] The Escapee\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You may take the ground you stand on for granted, like most do; a nice, relatively flat surface, upon which you walk. But it can be quite intimidating, as I shall demonstrate. Picture yourself a few thousand feet in the air. Got it? Now, get rid of any support, so that you are falling several hundred feet in a few seconds. Now imagine what the ground would feel like when you hit it. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s where I am now. Two thousand feet from a nice, crunching, bloody death on your peaceful ground. Add the fact that the few thousand pounds on my back is trying to kill me, and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got quite the pretty picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And even worse is the fact that my wingmate is mocking me. In freefall beside me, just watching as I plummet toward the ground. Classic Kiternyae. This final fact gives me the nip on the tail I needed to let me spread my wings and begin spinning, fling my assailant off me, and pull out just over five hundred feet above the ground. And Kiternyae just continues to stare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EWhat?!\u003C/em\u003E I ask. She really gets on my nerves sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENothing. Just the fact that you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to go five seconds without someone attempting to murder you.

I follow suit shortly after, rejoining Stoern and Skyaerz at the starboard position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EDid Kiternyae have to save you again, Spirion?\u003C/em\u003E Skyaerz has his trademark edge in his voice, which he uses quite often to tick others off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENo, but if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not careful, I might be asking you the same question.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003ESorry.\u003C/em\u003E He glances at me warily. Ah, well. At least he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s capable of fighting for himself. It takes the three of us just to keep Stoern out of trouble. If you just let him out of your sight for a few moments, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll go and try to take on an entire platoon by himself. Which he is by no means capable of doing. Obviously, he doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to know that. As if on cue, a squad of enemy dragons shoots by overhead, and Stoern peels out of the tail position and angles toward them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENO!\u003C/em\u003E Kiternyae and I both shout to him. He hardly notices our plea, and puts on speed to intercept the squadron. The three of us share a look, and bank to follow. Skyaerz flies directly after him, while I ascend high into the air and Kiternyae dives lower. Meanwhile, Stoern has nearly reached the dragon in the tail position, and for some reason it still hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t noticed him. \u003Cem\u003EOh, boy, here we go\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 again.\u003C/em\u003E I signal to the others, and wait. Skyaerz is first, loosing a blast of white fire at the group. Now they notice us. Then Kiternyae strikes, knocking the point position out of the game by breaking several wing joints. Skyaerz comes in for a second time, burning quite a large hole in the tail position\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wing. The dragon screeches and falls from the sky. Jeez, he has hot flame. At best, most dragons can only manage a little bit of blue-white. I can hardly do fire at all. But he goes around, just incinerating things left and right. \u003Cem\u003EShowoff,\u003C/em\u003E I think to myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 have something special, too. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my turn, and I flip over, diving silently over the starboard side dragon. He doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even see me coming. I angle toward his neck, driving my shoulder into his. Usually, I break something. Whoops; that came out weird. I mean, I usually break them. But he had tougher hide than most, and resisted any real damage. But the force of the impact upset his balance, and he tumbled out of the air for several seconds, before slowly leveling out. Good, it looks like I at least bruised him. The one remaining dragon turns his blue tail and dives out of the action, hopelessly outnumbered. Stoern is just left hovering there, a disappointed look on his angled face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EAw, come on, guys! Could you not go and get every one every time?!\u003C/em\u003E Kiternyae comes out of nowhere and cracks her tail like a whip across his chest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EOw! What was that for?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll give you a shot when you start following orders!\u003C/em\u003E Ouch. As squadron leader, she can be aggressive. Now Stoern looks more scared than anything.

One day, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just not be there, and he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to get wounded or killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EHey, Spirion?\u003C/em\u003E Skyaerz opened his mind to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EYes?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EYou\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking kind of stressed.

I felt like I was going to pass out at any moment, barely able to keep my wings moving. Kiternyae was in no better shape, head and tail drooping slightly. Skyaerz hardly functioning either, but at least he is still alert for danger. Stoern, on the other hand, who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s seen little to no action, is still being his disobedient self, veering off course every once in a while to either tangle with the younger dragons or to try and attack stranded enemy ones on the ground. By this point I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve told Skyaerz to take care of it. He was right; I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m in no condition to do this kind of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m in squadron three, out of ten such four-dragon squads. That makes up our entire platoon of forty. Sometimes, several platoons go into battle, but this time it was only the one. We had set up a temporary camp, about a hundred-and-fifty miles from our main battalion, rather close to the opposing side\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s territory. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClose\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 as in a few minutes by air. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why we are constantly fighting, to maintain our position. Although lately; we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had a few casualties. Thankfully, these were not in our squadron, or Kiternyae and I might be even more stressed about Stoern\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s disobedience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we land at camp. I manage to keep my footing, hind legs touching down first. Kiternyae, on the other hand, practically plows face-first into the soil, leaving several feet of broken dirt behind her. She groans in discomfort, but doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stand up. I attempt to go over and help, but Areiak, a black dragon from squad one, gets there first. In my semi-conscious state, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s better for both of us. Areiak is much more able at the moment, unlike us, who really need to rest for a while. And at that moment, my weakening legs collapse and I slump down to the ground, out cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My eyes open under the darkened night sky, and are immediately blinded by our fire pit just inches away. An afterimage is burned into my retina, and I have to blink several times to clear it. I lift my head and see the rest of our squad around the fire, but they are all asleep. Seeing nothing amiss, I shortly succumb to sleep once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003ESpirion!\u003C/em\u003E I am instantly alert and my head jerks upward, my skull making contact with Kiternyae\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jaw.
