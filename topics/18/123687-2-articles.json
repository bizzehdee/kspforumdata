I think this will be a good time to bring some of the uniforms and galactic technologies a little forward into the future, since the trilogy which comes at the beginning of the story required some retro-looking stuff so as to be older than the middle trilogy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T18:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about casting for the sequel ... ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubyo5eZz_Jc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T00:26:02Z","Content":"\nLess than a month to go for Star Wars Episode 7: The Hype Awakens!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found the International Trailer on Space.com, which has scenes that weren\u0026#39;t in the US trailer.
