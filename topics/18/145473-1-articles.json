This is more or less the product of occasionally think about it whenever I was bored for about the last six months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if they were tiny?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figure this\u0027ll need more explanation than that, so here we go. We\u0027ve seen the things robots can do; some can perform amazing stunts, while others struggle to walk. In the end though, we still don\u0027t have fully autonomous machines that can maneuver through this world like a human. But what if it were to be controlled\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eby\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a human? I don\u0027t mean with a keyboard or some joysticks, but something more like how the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C4w-6W0bRe0/Ui9BqY0pEVI/AAAAAAAAeuk/3nVriOSigjg/s1600/pacific\u002Brim\u002Bawesome.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJaegers in Pacific Rim are controlled\u003C/a\u003E, sans neural connection of course. Not quite looking like that, but you should have an idea now:\u00A0move your arm, and your little robot mimics the movement. But this is only a part of this whole idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other part is, of course, the robot which I\u0027ve taken to calling a Mikey (short for Micro android or Micro bot). The robot, every time I\u0027ve imagined it thus far, has only been about 6 inches (~15 cm) tall. Preferably two cameras, a pair of microphones (one for each ear), and possibly even contact sensors so the operator can somewhat feel the environment.\u00A0More or less a range of motion similar to a human\u0027s, so it can properly respond to most of the operator\u0027s input. Contrary to most things, these little guys wouldn\u0027t actually be built to be as durable as possible. Strong enough to handle what I would consider \u0022normal function\u0022 without being nigh-indestructible at the hands of another Mikey. The intent being that they\u0027d be something of a small scale disposable analog to humans. Perfect for their purpose, which\u00A0would be small robotic deathmatches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix months of thinking about\u00A0tiny robo gladiator fights. Usually when I imagine it though, the Mikeys are engaged in modern-like combat.\u00A0So usually including guns, correctly scaled vehicles, and an urban-ish environment to fight in. Really though I\u0027ve brought this here with a simple question in mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you find something along these lines entertaining enough to watch or participate in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00221\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:14.4px;\u0022\u003EP.S.

Further more there\u0027s also the problem of energy storage for robots that small.
