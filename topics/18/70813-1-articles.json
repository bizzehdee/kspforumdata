But it\u0027s really fun to play, with all the new plants and that (some plants did return, but regardless). By now I\u0027ve played all the levels available and am starting on the endless zones of all the worlds (Ancient Egypt, Pirate Sea, Wild West, Far Future). I\u0027m looking forward on the new Zombot for Far Future and the new world (some speculated to be called Dark Ages) which may be a lot more fun than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Added a link after the photo links from Google gone HAL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/yYcmX#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/yYcmX#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T04:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 04:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Designer225\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T04:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeriously?
