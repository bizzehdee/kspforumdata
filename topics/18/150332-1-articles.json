And then, following the habit of altogether too many game AIs, they would refuse to make peace, no matter how badly I was beating them, so that the only way to end the war was to kill the entire faction off entirely. Very aggravating and tedious.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, the Civilization family of games are all driven by economic/industrial growth, and then in the late game, you suffer environmental penalties for having a highly developing industrial base. In the others, though, it was a relatively minor problem. it didn\u0027t spoil the game for me. But in SMAC, the result was that you would be targeted by a never-ending succession of mindworm attacks, and it would just keep getting worse until my nation was either crippled by the constant fighting, or by having to dismantle enough of my industry to be acceptable to the damned worms again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Edid not like that game.
