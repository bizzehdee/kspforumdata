The engine (I think) is slightly more powerful than the Sensei. Its really fast and sensitive. Sometimes when taking off I almost smash right back into the ground. I can do a lot of aerobatic stuff with it. The Sensei is quite large and stable being a hi-wing plane. Also, for the Sensei, I practically need to take tools and such with me when I fly to put the wing on. As with the Archer, I can easily just carry the transmitter and the plane out to my backyard to fly (I have a huge backyard, I even mowed a runway and have a windsock and everything). Overall, its a good big-medium sized plane. Only if you take off from grass with it, there isn\u0027t much clearance in between the prop and the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
