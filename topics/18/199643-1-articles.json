I\u0027ve been interested in playing a game like this since Shattered Horizon back in 09 but didn\u0027t have the Hardware back then. \u00A0Now of course a competitive multiplayer shooter might not be for everyone who is into KSP but I thought there might be some people here who would be interested, and there are some interesting design decisions that make it seem like the devs did at least some research. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
