A good idea just pops into your head, or you see an already great game, and you imagine something that would make it even better. If you\u0027ve ever had one, way not share it here. Maybe someone can tell you of a game they know of that matches your idea? We can agree that would be good for everyone, you get to play a game you like, and talented games designers get a wage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is the Kerbal Space Program forums, the first entry should be a space game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIHAGGI: Think Buzz Aldrin\u0027s race into space, but more so. While BARIS was a great idea, it was limited by the computing technology of the day, and was rather simple by today\u0027s standards. For a \u0022simple\u0022 game, it was also really difficult, even unfair. The most complicated missions had such a low chance of succeeding, it was equivalent to, shall we say, \u0022pissing in the wind\u0022. There is always an uncertainty in space travel, but men got to the Moon with good training and solid engineering, not blind luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe setting is similar: as the head of NASA or OKB-1, circa 1945-1975, you must put a man on the Moon and return him back to the Earth, before your rivals on the opposite side of the world. To do more stuff, you need to have support from the government. To get that support, you need prestige, which you get from successful missions, particularly \u0022firsts\u0022, like first satellite, first man in space etc. This game goes much more in-depth than BARIS, in which the biggest choice was \u0022direct ascent\u0022 or \u0022lunar orbit rendezvous\u0022. This game is an unprecedented love letter to the history of the space race, where every proposed technology and mission profile with an the realm of sanity is available to be used. You have to decide who develops and tests the necessary equipment, and you make the big decisions. \u0022Alright, we have to send men into Lunar orbit by the end of the year, do we do a simple free-return trajectory (safer, but less prestige and smaller safety bonus to Main engine) or a Lunar orbit insertion (more dangerous, more prestige and large safety bonus to Main engine).\u0022 Do try to rush for prestige like the Soviets, in the hope of riding the wave of support to do the big mission soon, risking the lives of the astronauts/cosmonauts, or do it the NASA way, slow incremental steps to make the trip as safe as possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave your good game ideas down below!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thermobaric","CreatedById":31322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T11:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a great idea for a pretty long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA combination between the style and gameplay mechanics of Reus and the rocket building of ksp. Also, it should look a little like cortex command in a gaint scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a 2D space colonization game, where you have to manage your own space program to colonize different planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a tech tree, and to unlock techs, you should send probes and robots to other planets. Also, there should be a good budget management system. After you got the techs and the moneys, you should send the basic parts of a base to the planet and send some astronauts to build a facility there. Money should be generated by getting it from the government. The more succes your space program has, the more money you get. When not done well, you should also be able to get bankrupt and start over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T05:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an idea for a multiplayer horror game, with 2-4 people, and you need a mic. So, imagine the gruop going into a building, and then they have to split up, like to activate multiple generators at a time, and the communation system would be with walkie talkes, there would be static, and the celing would collapse so they are trapped away from each other.So you would be able to hear the other people, but somethings there would be a static interruption. If a player dies, their walkie talkie would turn off, so would hear, \u0022Huh, is that the creatur- OHHH MY GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-\u0022 then shuts off. Also, if the microphone is load it will alert the creature in the area, allowing for some trolling. Sometimes you could come close to meeting up, like a window seperating you. Imagine walking down a halway with a tinted window on the side, and your friend is on the other side, so you could see his flashlight, and mabye he could see your outline, or the monsters outline... Imagine the fun times you could have with that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
