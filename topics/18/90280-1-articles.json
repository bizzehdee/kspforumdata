My school is special, its national school of arts. In my case, i am a cellist with 9,5 years of experience. And we have our school\u0027s orchestra, you must attend it if youre at 9th grade or older. I have to sit with a cellist which is younger. His name is Kasper and, as i know him, he is a gamer. He often talks about League of legends with his best friend. But he\u0027s very childish and he pretends that he knows everything better than others. So, today, we were playing (its 1,5 hours long lesson). Our conductor was speaking with wind instrument players so i picked my phone and started answering the texts my girlfriend sent me. Then, Kasper started to say that im having no life, i am addicted to the phone and similar stuff i didnt hear. Also, he\u0027s always stating that he plays better than me (which is not true in my opinion, i have more experience). I said some normal comebacks but he started to mimmick me with his highly pitched voice. What to do? Im asking this because i have to sit with him every tuesday and friday..
