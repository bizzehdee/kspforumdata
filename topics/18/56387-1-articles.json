Then when the Soviet Union Launched Sputnik it woke people up to the fact that the Soviets had the technology to launch rockets and get payloads into space. The United states had catching up to do, and i think that\u0027s one of the many reasons that the USSR got so many \u0022Firsts\u0022 in terms of space travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T02:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe United States was developing a long-term reusable spacecraft around the time Sputnik was launched. This was actually before NASA, and a group called NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) was handling spaceflight. Once Sputnik began its mission, the government kick-started NASA in its stead, and scrapped the long-term project for immediate results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly, it was the Soviet space victories that spurred NASA to put out such amazing results. We learned that Gagarin was the first human in space just a few days before Alan Shepard went up, and we also found out that Aleksei Leonov had been on EVA just before Ed White could do it. In fact, because NASA learned of the Soviet spacewalk, they bumped up the first American EVA two whole missions. In addition, the Soviets landed Luna 1 on the moon before US probes could make it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstandably, most Americans weren\u0027t too happy with these developments. NASA, especially after JFK committed the first moon landings into plans back in \u002761, was racing to catch up, and we managed to leapfrog the Soviets by the time we triumphantly landed. The US has been ahead ever since (though today, the crown of Space Kings can be contended).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps! I also did a paper on it, and here\u0027s what I know.
