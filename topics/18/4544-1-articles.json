I wouldn\\\u0027t mind helping a site get money that I like. Problem with that is, if the ad is unobtrusive I skip it over without even looking at it. I didn\\\u0027t even realize google had advertising in its search results until someone pointed it out, for instance. I just tune it out, it\\\u0027s not the information I\\\u0027m looking for. If it gets in my face? Sorry, that annoys me to the point where adblock is turned back on. So I never actually *look* at whatever is being advertised - so, no click. People haven\\\u0027t been able to invent a form of advertising that gets me to look at whatever is being sold without driving me up the wall yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-16T06:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if you don\\\u0027t click the ads, the impressions you give the site help them attract more paid ads.
