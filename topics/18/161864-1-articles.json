We found an iPhone app that could record the forces over time, but its archives don\u0027t show the graphs like it does in real time. It does, however, export the recorded data as csv files. Can someone suggest a way to convert those back to graphs via software, or at least to display the number so he can graph it by hand? Thanks. He only has the weekend to get his data organized, the project is due Monday but he has a bit of extension cuz of this trip.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T21:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t Excel import csv files?
