There was a part that there were a couple of cameras on a red planet (Mars or venus) that were melting like chocolate. The subtitles in Dutch (It was English, but I couldn\u0027t speak English back then) said that it was very hot there. Anyone that knows a documentary that has these things in it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
