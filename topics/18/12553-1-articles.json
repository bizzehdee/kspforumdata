I have a few projects that I intend to make with these little things ranging from home automation to hand held devices that can have a lot of use (gps, sat weather, network testing, exc...). I also tinker with my arduino and make little toys (more or less Haha) entertaining myself. Anybody else have have plans to purchase and complete some projects for fun or actual useful purposes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody is curious of what I am talking about, please check it out\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.raspberrypi.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.raspberrypi.org/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T03:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike...what is there to do with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks really cool, but Idk what I\\\u0027d do with it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mojavi-Viper","CreatedById":21827,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T03:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I will refer you to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=15\u0026amp;sid=4857e9bcaab04b518a87b72485ce0e96\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E to see what you can do, but there are many more ideas that have yet to be thought of. In a basic nutshell its a $25 computer that you can program to pretty much anything you want (limited to the hardware of course). It has GPIO pins basically output pins for programmable to do different things such as run gps, motors, other items as well as USB but the biggest selling point is the price point of $25 allowing these cheap computers to be used in education (Its the main purpose of the Raspberry Foundation) to low income areas such as Africa. That\\\u0027s a rough general explanation but I think you should get the general idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T09:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want one of these really badly, i\\\u0027m planning on making a computer for my car with a touchscreen using one.
