Everything in that game is done right, IMHO. Does it have a replay value? Well, give me a few years between each game then yes but it\u0026#39;s very linear with very little you can vary between games. Still, overall it\u0026#39;s up there as my number 1 favourite.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther games are close:\u003Cbr\u003E\nPanzer General II (if only it would run on a Win 8.1 laptop), by far the most entertaining TBS games I ever played with a good balance between light fun gameplay and decision making. With all the different roads to victory (or defeat) it also has a decent replay value.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMonkey Island 1-3 (never played 4 much). The MI games are hands down the aces of the classic point \u0026 click adventure era. Strictly linear games but the goofy fun of leading Guybrush into trouble and out again gives these games a good replay value (as long as I give them a good break between games).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTIE Fighter: IMHO, the best space fighter sim I ever played. It really is that simple. The combination of the SW universe, being a baddie (or as my commanding officer would call it, the good guy), great action and a story line that unfolds with each mission makes for a rock solid game in my book.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSearch \u0026 Rescue 4 Coastal Heros: How many games are there where you pilot a helicopter not for blowing things up but to search for and rescue people and get them to hospital? Combined with a pretty good game engine that really let you feel the difference between a sluggish Sea King and a nimble Dauphin (as far as a game this old will allow anyway), and it\u0026#39;s definitely the most interesting heli sim I played. Again, damn you, Win 8.1 and this laptop for blocking my opportunity to play it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone mentioned Caesar III. This is a game I still play from time to time, partly because I\u0026#39;m pretty bad at it, figuring out how to build a large city that doesn\u0026#39;t collapse due to lunatic AI pathfinding, so I never beat this game. I wouldn\u0026#39;t call it a favourite as such, but rather a favourite source of frustrations.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nX:Tension: Another space sim that took Braben\u0026#39;s Elite/Frontier into the strategic production genre. I always found myself puzzled (really, I did), that doing nothing for 10 minutes while the ship traveled through a sector towards a factory would be this interesting. It still baffles me. There is just something incredibly soothing about this game I can\u0026#39;t put my finger on. Perhaps it\u0026#39;s the music and the view from the cockpit (amazing graphics for a game this old), perhaps it\u0026#39;s something else entirely, I don\u0026#39;t know. The variety of ships and the difference between them (unlike Frontier where every ship basically had the same characteristics), adding the factory/production/trade bits makes this one game I would really like to have more time for.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T12:36:22Z","Content":"\nMy nomination: Archimedian Dynasty, circa 1997.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA multi-hub, mission-based story, 6 DoF shooter, set underwater, post-apocalypse.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust a good game, well executed, good story well written and voice-acted.
