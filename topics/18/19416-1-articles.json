If he can\u0027t be bothered to teach you how to make better videos then you can delete his message and ignore him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it can\u0027t hurt to look around for tutorials on making videos, to see if any teach style and technique rather than the mechanics of using the software. You might pick up on some of the decisions you are making that annoy this fool so badly, which will help you make better videos for other people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also helps to watch as many other videos as you can, with your finger on Pause, and an open notepad document where you can write down the things that irritate you when watching other videos. Things like - the guy doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s going to say in a tutorial video, he\u0027s telling you things that 1,001 other videos tell you, the music sucks, the action doesn\u0027t match the music, he keeps jumping from rocket view to orbit view (always good to edit those bits out), he doesn\u0027t use captions (excellent tool for tutorial videos) etc, etc, etc. The more you become aware of the mistakes other people make, and that helps you to make better videos yourself. (It\u0027s how great film makers become great; they watch other peoples\u0027 films, learn how they do it, and learn how to avoid their mistakes - and then when they can make good films they add creativity to create great films!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, this is not exactly about KSP itself, so I\u0027m moving it to Off Topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nerfsmurf","CreatedById":45845,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T04:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, i checked out your channel and didn\u0027t bother to look at the videos.
