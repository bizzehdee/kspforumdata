The engine allows completely seamless transitions between space and atmosphere(much like ksp with less explosions). Let me make this clear, everything you see in any screenshot is a point you could theoretically fly to! That moon? Sure go there! The ring? Lets go play around with rocks. You can travel to any of it seamlessly and without loading screens. It\u0027s not a promise. It\u0027s not a stretch goal, it\u0027s a current feature in the engine! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself have been following it for a good few years and I\u0027m really excited for them to finally get funded. Battlescape will be a solar systemwide arena-like gameplay with 2(maybe more?) teams duking it out with matches planned to last over many days and possibly weeks. They plan to have battles of at least 100-200 players participating at a single longer to capture the \u0022starwars-esque space battles\u0022 which is an actual quote from Keith but I can\u0027t find it right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my extremely poor explanation got you you\u0027re interested, then head over to the forums at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forums.inovaestudios.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://forums.inovaestudios.com/\u003C/a\u003E and ask questions! I will also try and pay attention here to answer as many as I can as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kickstarter begins on 10/21/2015, so 5 days! I\u0027m just trying to spread the word. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do they need a kickstarter? Currently, everything you see has been made over the last 10 years by 3 people working in their part time. I know this will get compared to E:D and SC and I\u0027m hear to tell you that it shouldn\u0027t. This prototype that you see was made my a small team working part time over a decade. E:D and SC have huge teams and more importantly money! Please do not compare them. Treat Battlescape as you would any indie game you\u0027d see on greenlight or steam, because that\u0027s what it really is with A\u002B visuals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can add more quotes and more dialogue but I think I\u0027ve made this post long enough as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ignore this thread - there was already one posted.
