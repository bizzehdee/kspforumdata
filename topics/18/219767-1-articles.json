Over the summer, I have been working on the rules for a sci-fi themed board game with an exploration mechanic that is vital to the main part of the game. This is the first place I am putting the rules, and hopefully there will be some vital feedback from this. I also need name suggestions, so if you have any, give me some!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vt9QddRnZ0u0H85Z_0V0k6J8RVLV4XjxaM9LxLfchc4/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Game Rules\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
