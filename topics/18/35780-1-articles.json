Though skilled at imitating the human form, and well acquainted with it\u0027s subtleties, he became disgusted by it when he witnessed the Propoetides prostituting themselves. These women were punished by Venus for their lack of worship with a coarseness of skin and a crudeness of nature, and were then forced into prostitution. Seeing this, Pygmalion the sculptor was repelled and could no longer appreciate women.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeemingly alone, Pygmalion sought to create for himself a perfect, pure, unsullied companion. He used his particular skills to this end: he created a statue bride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are about to watch is a mysterious video. It\u0027s origin is attributed variously, and almost certainly spuriously, to various abstract artists or surrealists.

He may well love her fully, perhaps more fully than any of us could ever hope to be loved. In the mind of her creator, she is a near goddess; the perfect representation, not just of femininity, but the peak of human potential.
