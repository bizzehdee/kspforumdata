You\u0027re right though that a multi-role aircraft is a jack-of-all trades (and therefore master of none). The obvious advantage is flexibility. Having dedicated types is great if you always know the nature of the threat. During the Cold War it was sensible to always sail with a couple of squadrons of hardcore naval air superiority aircraft on board, but what happens if the air threat disappears (as it largely has). All of a sudden you\u0027ll want more strike aircraft. A multi-role aircraft is useful in lots of different wars, single role ones are often designed to fight the last war. As I noted above, the decidedly single-role F-14 was shoehorned into a ground attack role at the end of it\u0027s life. Hell, the Iranians even tried using them as AEWs. So just because an aircraft is designed for a single role, that doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t have to try it\u0027s hand at multi-roling it once it gets off the drawing board and into the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that all aircraft should be multi-role, far from it. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s true that they\u0027re less cost-effective than dedicated types. With a multi-role aircraft you\u0027ll simply be able to get away with having less of them, which means less expensive air and ground crew, a simpler logistics system, and overall large cost savings. That\u0027s why they\u0027re so popular with airforces and navies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T09:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the Saab gripen NG?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camulus777","CreatedById":77385,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T22:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how the F-35 is the worst fighter ever.

The F-35, on the other hand, can be completely and utterly ruined if lightning strikes nearby (according to my cousin, who is an Air Force mechanic). It\u0026#39;s stealth ability is inadequate as well, I remember hearing about a radar that can detect the F-35.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo basically, it\u0026#39;s a fragile, detectable aircraft that underperforms in its intended role, so no, we should not buy it. The A-10 is tougher, cheaper, and more capable.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Dfthu\u0027]Does the lighting take out the computers or something like that because that sounds horrible.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo, not ruined ... it\u0026#39;s merely a maintenance issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]The F-35B did not maintain \u0022residual inerting after flight for the required interval of 12 hours, which is a lightning protection requirement.\u0022 In other words, the plane would be vulnerable to lightning strike if it were forced to fly twice in a 12-hour span, unless the fuel tanks were frequently \u0022purged\u0022 with \u0022external nitrogen.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0026#39;s apparently an unacceptable additional layer of maintenance.
