I Have been away awhile for school reasons and that jazz, but a major reason for my absence was because I went to Florida with my family for spring break! The weather was great, the sea was salty, and the KSC was amazing. Here are some pictures!\n\n![skMvHQ1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/skMvHQ1.jpg)\n\nThe Rocket Garden, where old rockets, including the Mercury Redstone and the Saturn Skylabs are on display!\n\n![YGRUbQD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YGRUbQD.jpg)\n\nA single Saturn V rocket engine.\n\n![Poy5J7p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Poy5J7p.jpg)\n\nBus tour to the actual KSC. Bit rough of a ride, so the photos arent great. This is the Vehicle Assembly Building. From 4 miles away. Worlds largest single story building, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n![yEOc54v.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yEOc54v.jpg)\n\nLaunchpad Crawler.\n\n![Xs3PdtW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Xs3PdtW.jpg)\n\nThese photos were taken before the Space X Falcon 9 Launch a few weeks ago, but if you watched the live feed, you may recognize this launch pad. This was 5 days before the launch.\n\n![R8k8TLe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R8k8TLe.jpg)\n\nThe crawler\u0027s path to the launch pad. Using a special stone so the emense weight doesn\u0027t spark the stones, as using gravel would cause serious damage to the crawler and rocket respectively.\n\n![3nttWNP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3nttWNP.jpg)\n\nThe VAB up close with mission control to the left.\n\n![rpoSGOG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rpoSGOG.jpg)\n\nA Launch Escape System that appears to be for further Orion missions. Fun Fact: The stripes on the American Flag on the VAB are 3 meters wide, and the blue area is the size of a basketball court. The roof of the VAB can hold a professional baseball stadium and it\u0027s parking lot. Only on the roof.\n\n![mOKTFXi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mOKTFXi.jpg)\n\nOnto the main attraction... the Saturn V. Here are the engines.\n\n![FnTuVbr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FnTuVbr.jpg)\n\nThe command module\u0027s engine.\n\n![C5b1PwB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/C5b1PwB.jpg)\n\nThe command module.\n\n![9IFPqW5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9IFPqW5.jpg)\n\nThe Lunar Landing Module.\n\n![ypQTY9X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ypQTY9X.jpg)\n\nBetter look at the third stage\u0027s engine.\n\n![loqqAhZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/loqqAhZ.jpg)\n\nMartin Marietta (a little hard to see) was the company that helped develop the parts for the Saturn V, and was the company that my late grandfather worked for at the time. \n\n![lSMopKQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lSMopKQ.jpg)\n\nAtlantis Space Shuttle.\n\n![wwAJSAX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wwAJSAX.jpg)\n\n![tXFfa4N.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tXFfa4N.jpg)\n\nBeautiful Pictures of the elevons. \n\nThat is it for my trip to the KSC. Enjoyed it to the fullest and it was incredible! Anyway, thanks for viewing, and I will see you when I see you. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T14:46:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prof. Endwalker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:51:20Z","Content":"Aw man...

Then it was it.\n\nI think they flew all the Saturn 1Bs, and then they had nothing left to put on top of the leftover Saturn Vs.

When missions get cut, you have leftover hardware.\n\nAlso, some of the stages at KSC and Huntsville are not actual flight hardware, but were ground test articles. The Saturn V at Johnson is made up of flight hardware, however they are not all from the same Saturn V.\n\nEdit:\n\nHunstville has a horizontal display made up of test articles. They also have a vertically stacked replica.\n\nKSC Has a bogus first stage, and the two upper stages are real.\n\nJSC has stages from three different Saturn Vs.\n\nThere are also surviving stages at the Michoud Plant in Louisiana, and in the Smithsonian. The later was the Skylab backup.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T02:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by razark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:39:15Z","Content":"Nice!
