If your starting image isn\u0027t to the same ratio, you have three options; resize to the longest edge, in which case part of your original image will have bits cut off the top and/or bottom; resize to the shortest edge, which will give you a white border to fill out to the right length; stretch your image to the correct ratio before resizing, but this will distort your image making the planet an oval.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T23:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow much of an oval?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T05:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout this much:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LvE3mRI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LvE3mRI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T14:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eugh, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E im probably never gunna be able to make the flags for my spaceship company \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T15:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d probably have to crop it to get good results.
