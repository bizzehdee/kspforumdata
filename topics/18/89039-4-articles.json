Thats why I prefaced my post and concluded my post with very similar sentiments. However I don\u0027t trust Richard Branson\u0027s intentions. Why is he pursuing such a risqu\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 foray into space when there are tried and true methods of getting into space. Yes people need to buck trends and get things going, and yes we def need the rich to lead the way. I think that all space flight is important and like I said I think the only thing Virgin will be good at is inspiring interest in space flight. However I don\u0027t trust Richard Branson because he has chosen a highly experimental and unproven way of getting into space. Now I am not a Space X fanboy by any means. However Space X is doing nearly everything right regardless of if you like their style or not. FYI I am not talking about you in specific I am talking about the anti Space X trolls. Space X has a goal of making spaceflight safe and affordable whilst being on the cutting edge. Branson seems only interested in attracting rich thrill seekers and being on the cutting edge. I say this because Space Ship Two, no way in its current configuration can be a point to point way of travel, forget about orbital flights. So yes Virgin is appealing for its suborbital flights where you experience zero gravity for 2 minutes for a price tag of $250,000. I will say it again, yes yes yes yes Virgin has a purpose, and if it inspires people to be interested in space flight then yes yes yes! I just don\u0027t like the way they are doing things, as I said I find solid motors inherently unsafe, even though SS2 uses a hybrid rocket motor, its still an untested powerplant. My issue is not with the cutting edge way of doing things. My issue is with the timeline, this rocket needs to be tested extensively over and over again because no one has ever done it like this. Not launching civilians into space next year.
