They would all share the exact same altitude, inclination etc. but would follow each other in a \u0022string\u0022, in this way they would only require minor tending to maintain separation/position.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe museum building itself would be a toroidal structure surrounding the exhibit \u0022string\u0022. In this way the main building can share the same orbit as, and remain stationary with respect to, the exhibits. Small changes in altitude would allow the main building to move up and down the exhibit string without perturbing them. (See Neal Stephensons \u0022SevenEves\u0022 for where I got this idea)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost importantly, the exhibits are *still in orbit where we left them*. Not in the exact same orbit, but still *in* orbit, in their \u0022natural habitat\u0022 if you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds neat, no?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T11:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most interesting historical objects in NEO should require an oceanarium.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat air drag...\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of less interesting would self-destroy on a rarity hunters approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-03T11:38:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2016 11:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
