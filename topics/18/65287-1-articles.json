As with all new things, doubtless it will be some time after the tech is released that it starts to be integrated. Heck, NVidia\u0027s GPU-based PhysX system is \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E not supported by Unity... so really, I wouldn\u0027t hold your breath. Unity tends to keep old tech for cross-compatibility, but there are newer alternatives which work for pretty much anything, not just vendor-specific modules like PhysX or Mantle. OpenCL, I believe, is an OpenGL based thing similar to both Mantle and PhysX, as I understand it, but will run on both types of cards (and likely many others too). As such, it\u0027s likely a better option, as it won\u0027t exclude either branch of users.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maddmatts","CreatedById":21071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T18:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMantle reminds me of ATI\u0027s TruForm hardware tessellation feature way back when.
