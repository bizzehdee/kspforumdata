Orion is meant to be an vehicle for BEO exploration, but to go anywhere useful it needs a propulsion module and a shielded hab module which are not planned. So yes, it would have been better to concentrate on a space-only exploration vehicle based around a shielded hab and high-Isp (NTR or SEP) propulsion module and use a cheap CCDev vehicle to ferry the astronauts to and from the space ship.
