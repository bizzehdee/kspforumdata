That wing suit is amazingly fun to fly. 2 though had a better story and a much more epic final mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd those cheesy one-liners. \u0022Try transporting fuel NOW, jerks!\u0022 when you blow up an oil pipeline.

I\u0027ve not dug into it, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s an interesting story there... and a view to the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb1969","CreatedById":36984,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-04T19:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI liked these games, I remember playing Just Cause 2 and going on a complete rampage with the minigun because it had infinite ammo. I also loved shooting gas canisters and watching them shoot off skywards like miniature rockets and then seconds later see them blow up in the air (which usually for fun I would tether an enemy\u00A0to a canister and shoot it off and watch as the bad guy flies off and eventually seeing them either get exploded or plunge to their untimely\u00A0but hilarious death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
