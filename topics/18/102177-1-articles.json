I never install such things. I could understand the need to reveal crude location data (country, city) for statistical purposes, but device ID and call information? My photos? Some applications even require device and application history. Gestapo would be proud.\n\nIf you remove these, I will gladly test it. Until then, no way is this entering my phone."},{"CreatedByName":"johnsmith27","CreatedById":139616,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T12:12:09Z","Content":"Aw there is nothing I can do about this :/ , it\u0027s from the html5 Wrapper I\u0027m using (cocoonjs), they know about the permissions problem, but they still havent fixed it yet....\n\nBut I can assure you that my game absolutely wont use any of these, it\u0027s like some ghostly permissions that remain because I couldnt remove them."}]}
