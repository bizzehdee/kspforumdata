This is intended to be a debate thread of things that need fixing in the world around us. I\\\u0027ll begin with a general rant I\\\u0027ve taken the time to write up, and then the debate can ensue. Basically, every once in a while I get fed up with something or other and decide to write about it. My arguments are far from flawless or all-knowing, but they are as solid as I could make them at the time. I have not edited the rant since. It has been spoilered because it is so damn long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wish to participate, I ask only that you read the entire thing (which, I realise, is quite lengthy) and that you contribute to the discussion in ways that are constructive. That is, argue calmly and pointedly. Do not flame or try to stomp out others\\\u0027 arguments or ideas, but feel free to tell anyone (including myself) if you notice misreported facts and suchlike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\\\u0027ve laid down the law here... I\\\u0027d like to say one more thing before I proceed straight to the rant and the ensuing debate (no, two things). First, this debate has previously been conducted on a small forum. My general way of responding to everything there was to quote everyone and reply in a single post. I\\\u0027ll do that here if it\\\u0027s at all possible, and if the post is too large to be reasonable (this happened on a small forum, so I predict it may happen even more so here), I\\\u0027ll snip out pieces that I am replying to, rather than the whole post, and if necessary just spoiler the whole post so you don\\\u0027t all have to scroll through it if you\\\u0027ve already read it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, feel free to contribute your own thoughts about what\\\u0027s wrong with the world. This is the first of three rants I\\\u0027ve typed up so far. If you wish to view the others, head over to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://rantagainstsociety.tumblr.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://rantagainstsociety.tumblr.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat there is my own blog. It only gets updated when I get insanely annoyed at something or other, something which has (thankfully) not happened for a while. Even so, it makes for some \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E interesting debates, which is why I\\\u0027ve put it up here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final thing. Do not argue for the sake of it. That is, have an argument, and know what you\\\u0027re arguing about. Know the background information, to as much of an extent as necessary for \u003Cstrong\u003Eintelligent\u003C/strong\u003E discussion.

I have three, but only the first is going to be discussed at this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and the rant ensues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world is a strange place... and we have made it stranger. Lording it over everything else, humans are either the smartest or most abominably stupid of all creatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that we know what we\\\u0027re doing... but no human can hope to understand the planet itself. We guess, we simplify, until we get it to a point that makes sense to us, and then we play with it, poke it until it can\\\u0027t take it any more, often leaving us more confused than we began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople are often too obsessed with money -- people who work in advertising have a job centered around how to make their audience spend money, how to buy their products. People in the public relations departments have the job of trying to explain away the higher ups\\\u0027 greed and appease those of us who are skeptical, as well as preventing us from banding together and deciding to tear it all down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans have the capability for a pack mentality. Most of us love our individuality, but in order to accomplish something, we sit down and talk about stuff. The more effective plan of action would be to go accomplish it all as one, but we all go our separate ways and try and do what we can, often hampering the others of our group in the process. A pack thinks as one, and accomplishes a great deal. If the pack splits, the outcome is (more often than not) disastrous... and even if successful, never reaches its full potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernments talk too much and are too afraid of what people will think in the short term to look at anything in the long term. When people invented cars, we all though \u0027Oh! How wonderful!\u0027 -- and now, we\\\u0027re thinking \u0027These things kill the planet.\u0027 We should have looked at what they do and puzzle it out before we abused it. We never live in the present, always looking at the future; but never far enough!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople who invented cars thought it was such a good idea; the people that came along after abused their ideas and tried to make money off them. Nobody ever looked at what problems these things might cause. We are too blind to negatives; looking at the upside all the time makes us blind to the downside -- that which offers the highest upside often delivers the largest downside in turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESight is something we all lack. By banding together and just looking at things properly, we can see what we need to. Laws are overcomplicated and often hamper punishment of the perpetrators. Sure, we must be certain who did it, but there are other ways to ensure that than a thousand restrictions. If the penalty for murder was death, and the system of judgement more about finding out who did it than money, we would have a lot less murder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point in history, laws and the judgement system began to be abused. Doubtless it all began a long time ago. If they were caught, they probably would have been put to death, or punished horribly. Some probably were. Many weren\\\u0027t. The result? Lawyers are more concerned about winning and their clients more concerned about beating the system than actual justice. This system is a joke; the people involved often have the resources to ensure that they win, and the person who is probably right generally turns out to be the person the \u0027evidence\u0027 stacks up against. Why? Because they don\\\u0027t have the money and connections to be able to create evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoney has corrupted the human spirit; we are competitive, but in all the wrong ways. We compete for money, but the more we get the less we\\\u0027re happy. The more famous we become, the more harassed we are. The world is backwards and wrong. We all say we\\\u0027re trying to help each other, but most of us only say that because we don\\\u0027t want the common people making an enemy of us, because we still fear the power or single-minded cooperation, and we fear to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernments are the same. They fear everyone else, because everyone has their own say in who gets to be in charge. Again, it\\\u0027s more about winning and money than getting anything done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like screaming right about here. It\\\u0027s physically and mentally painful to see so much potential dashed on the rocks by the sea of our unselfishness. We waste too much of our potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumanity needs to take one step to cut all this down in one fell stroke and build towards something better. We need to be less selfish. That\\\u0027s all. Having a sense of self is important, but never forget to share what you\\\u0027ve got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027re smart, help anyone that asks for your help or advice. If you\\\u0027re strong, help those who aren\\\u0027t. If you\\\u0027re tall, don\\\u0027t patronise shorter people, just help them. Short people are just as important as tall people, smart people as well as strong ones. We all need to know our own mind, and most of us do. However, we also need to be able to work together, to stomach each others\\\u0027 differences and counsel the ones we do not like in why this is so. If you have extra food, don\\\u0027t eat it for the sake of it, give it to someone who does need it. There still won\\\u0027t be enough food for everyone; there are far too many of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly by working together and thinking far enough ahead can we save us from ourselves. Our selfishness causes us to be short-sighted: we care not for what happens after our deaths, for we will not be around. Those who believe in reincarnation only care for the future in the belief that if they don\\\u0027t, they\\\u0027ll still have to deal with the outcome. It\\\u0027s like a self-imposed threat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I have a solution. Yes, it changes many things. YES, IT IS DIFFICULT. Nobody ever gets anything without trying. In order to change the fate of the world, much must be sacrificed, but much will be gained in return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I am cynical. Yes, I am not easily able to be optimistic. No, I do not like the way the world is. Yes, I would love to change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nobody ever changes anything on their own. Little by little, the world must change. If it remains as it is, nobody will ever be truly happy with the world. Instead, we find happiness in each other. What\\\u0027s wrong with that? Nothing. Nothing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is but one facet of happiness, and if the world was a better place, we\\\u0027d all be better off. Less disease, less plight. Nobody can honestly say they want the world to be a better say... but nobody wants to give up as much as it takes to achieve it. Nobody cares enough to do so. Even so, we must try. In trying, we will find a way. No one person must guide the rest after it begins... we all need to know the way for ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECynicism is highly painful. Most likely, it\\\u0027s despised for its power to both destroy and create; one cannot come without the other. To create a new world, one has to be destroyed. The ultimate trade-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise how much of this sounds somewhat insane... but I suspect that may be down to the mental conditioning we all go through as we progress through society. We are taught what to think in school, and we either accept it or reject it. We rarely question that original decision again. If you constantly did, nothing would get done. When it comes down to it, our lives and decisions are governed by those that come before. If we make the wrong choice when first given a choice, it may chase us for the rest of our lives and we may never be free of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem? There is no right choice. There never is; only some options that are better than others. Nobody is perfect, we all know that. However, we are all capable of finding the best option at the time, and that is all we should do. We shouldn\\\u0027t look at the past and look for better options if we made a good one already, we should look at what decisions we can make now and judge for ourselves whether they are good for everyone... or just selfish decisions that benefit ourselves... because if they are, the good will never last, it will be hollow, and the backlash is often dreadful, in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarma, some call it. I call it logic. If you do some wrong to someone else, almost certainly you will feel some backlash. Every person is cared for by at least one person in the world unless nobody knows them. If you kill someone, chances are someone, somewhere, will hate you for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not use logic as an excuse for anything. Use no excuses whatsoever. Everyone has their secrets, but if you make excuses for them, they break and shatter like glass. If someone discovers them, tell them as much as necessary, but unless you really want to, tell them no more than that. Do not make excuses... we all do it, but in doing so we hamper our ability to learn. If we do not feel the backlash, cushioned by our excuses, we will never learn to do better in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could say much more, and I probably should. This is enough. This will have to be enough. Actions speak louder than words, they say... so should I act, or should I wait for people to wake up? I do not know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know too little to make a proper decision. All I can do is make the best one that can be seen. That is what I will do. That is all I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027m cynical. I can\\\u0027t help it, it\\\u0027s part of me... but I don\\\u0027t have to like it. Nor do I. It is possibly the greatest curse I will ever know, save for one. A nameless curse, more terrible than all the rest. Its touch can mean death, or life. The journey under the curse is worse than anyone should have to endure, and some choose death instead. Are they right? I cannot know. Not until it is my time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch is unknowable. Much cannot be seen. That which can, is rarely good. The trouble is, we never look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDreams never came easily to me, I often saw nightmares instead. I don\\\u0027t know if I\\\u0027ll ever know why. These days, I don\\\u0027t even know if I still dream. If I do, they never stay in my memory. Perhaps I am too anchored in this world to find another. It may be a boon or a curse, I cannot say. Dreams that still remain often simply retell the future as if it has already happened, as if I were simply remembering it. How? I cannot know. Not yet. Perhaps not ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this world, people have many notions for dreams. One is daydreams. Those occur often enough. Another is a goal of some form, a wish to accomplish something. As to that, I cannot speak for myself. I do not know what I mean to accomplish yet, but I sure hope it ends up being worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dreams I talk about tend to be the ones the mind offers up, the ones I rarely see at all. The future may be shown in the dreams, or the past. Both are often shown cryptically, but puzzling them out is like the word association game; follow the meanings until they match up with each other and make sense on some level. The future is almost always clear to me, although its often hidden away in my memory until the vent happens, and I realise I\\\u0027ve seen it happen before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is insanely long, and if you have taken the time to read it all, I am very thankful you have. Writing down thoughts is more infuriating than most would have you believe, but perhaps it is time I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in time for what? Only dreams can say until time does the telling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ELet the Grand Debate (v1) begin!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to introduce your own ideas for discussion as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-16T13:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could say much about what you have said (A good opinion article, by the way).

Yet it\\\u0027s unlike the hive because each of those individuals have the ability to live solitary lives (theoretically) yet CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE to sacrifice some of their individuality for mutual gain. By contrast, a bee is constrained to their role in the community. In \u0027Bee Movie\u0027, one worker challenges his[1] role; in reality that role is programmed into the individual in such a way that they can no more challenge it than you or I can challenge the fact that we must breathe air rather than water. A 2 day old bee cleans cells. A 10 day old bee feeds larvae. A 15 day old bee builds combs with wax. A 40 day old bee forages for food. A queen lays eggs, a drone mates with a virgin queen.

By contrast, a bee is constrained to their role in the community. In \u0027Bee Movie\u0027, one worker challenges his[1] role; in reality that role is programmed into the individual in such a way that they can no more challenge it than you or I can challenge the fact that we must breathe air rather than water. A 2 day old bee cleans cells. A 10 day old bee feeds larvae. A 15 day old bee builds combs with wax. A 40 day old bee forages for food. A queen lays eggs, a drone mates with a virgin queen.

Once they\\\u0027re up where ozone is, they become much more reactive, due to the UV light there. The chlorine in them is the main problem -- it is split off from the molecules (usually because of the UV light hitting the molecules), and then undergoes a process whereby it converts ozone into oxygen, without using up the chlorine. It acts as a sort of catalyst, increasing the rate at which ozone forms oxygen. Ozone is an unstable molecule as ti is, and will readily break down to form oxygen. This happens because it absorbs some UV wavelengths, which provide the energy for this decomposition to happen. That is how it protects us from UV. The oxygen will then eventually be broken down by slightly different wavelengths, allowing ozone to be formed once again, as the now-free two ozone atoms join onto an existing oxygen molecule. Basically, by breaking down ozone, CFCs remove half the shield, and the most important half -- since ozone absorbs th much shorter UV wavelengths, the ones that do the most harm.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes we have good intentions and it goes wrong.

Its not that difficult to make, you can do that with solar panels and a mains tapwater supply. Many would say the problem with hydrogen is that we don\\\u0027t have the infrastructure. Truth is, no one has bothered implementing and setting up everything. With some enlargement of mains power cables and mains water supplies to petrol stations, you could have hydrogen fuel produced on site. That won\\\u0027t last into when hydrogen cars become widespread, but it would last until dedicated hydrogen manufacturing plants can be constructed, at which point the existing petrol infrastructure - petrol tankers, fuel pumps - can be used to transport and supply hydrogen fuel from the manufacturing plants to a petrol station. While towns and cities could easily have petrol stations routed their own electricity and water, with their tanks topped up by tankers, you could send the tankers to villiages that have less access to such developments. If said villiages are near streams or rivers or canals, however, I see no reason why they couldn\\\u0027t have some water diverted from those, and utilise solar power to generate the hydrogen fuel themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Honda gets to sell lots of \u003Cem\u003EClarity\u003C/em\u003Es.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E...

I heard it was toxic - something CFCs aren\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s nevertheless a better means of powering our cars over petrol. True, there are some people in a dry place in America working on a machine that would convert air into petrol, given that carbon dioxide and water vapour could be broken up and rearranged into a hydrocarbon if you had the means. However, that\\\u0027s a long time coming, and hydrogen is something we could move onto within years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not suggesting it all run off solar.

This means the National Grid for electricity in Britain. Solar is a nice way of doing it cleanly, but if you want quantities of hydrogen for a highly active petrol station, then you\\\u0027ll need the power and water to come from offsite. In my example of a quiet villiage, solar should be fine. And then there\\\u0027s the petrol tankers being used to carry hydrogen from seperation plants. Its possible.

If they decompose, then they form chlorine gas first and foremost, which is a real problem, but they thankfully do not tend to do that in the lower atmosphere. Also, we shouldn\\\u0027t be converting air to petrol. Why? Simple. Petrol releases CO2 as well as pure carbon and carbon monoxide when burnt, especially since in a car the combustion is never \u0027complete\u0027. There\\\u0027s no easy way to separate CO2 out of the atmosphere -- it takes a lot of energy to do. We\\\u0027re just wasting our time with that.

You can think of hydrogen as a \\\u0027battery\\\u0027. It is a relatively practical way to STORE energy, but you need to spend more energy separating the hydrogen from water than you get burning the hydrogen. That means that you need another practical source of energy to produce it. Producing enough hydrogen to power all the cars in the world from solar power would require covering the area equivalent to a few countries with solar panels, which are (at this time) pretty expensive to make. Another solution would be nuclear, but it is not very popular at the moment. I like the things I am hearing about thorium reactors since they appear to be much, much safer than present ones with thousands of times less radiation and lower reaction temperatures. Bill Gates has invested a lot of cash into the development of thorium reactors. Also, Caddilac made a concept for a thorium powered car (appropriately called the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.myperfectautomobile.com/alternative-fuels/cadillac-wtf.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWTF\u003C/a\u003E - World Thorium Concept) that could travel something like 30.000 km on 100 grams of thorium (presently, 1kg of thorium costs around 50 USD and it is thousands of times more abundant and easier to extract then uranium). However, I believe that the public will be against any sort of mass nuclear power generation since \\\u0027nuclear\\\u0027 has become a word to scare children with... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYes, the replacement for CFCs is in fact HCFCs, which in turn are being replaced by HFCs, which are still something of a problem, so we\\\u0027re going to have to look for other things to use. Also, no form of nuclear reactor is ever safe. Ever. Yes, \u0027it\\\u0027s a word used to scare children.\u0027 So what? it should be. No matter what you start with, there\\\u0027ll always be some undesirable end product with that form of energy generation. The best way to do it is a fusion reactor, but we haven\\\u0027t quite worked those out yet. And anything put into a car needs to be foolproof. It needs to be safe enough that it will not release ridiculous amounts of energy and/or radiation in the event of a catastrophic collision. Neither fission nor fusion reactors can do that. They are too unstable to be used in cars, at least while people are driving them.\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, while hydrogen is renewable, it takes the same amount of energy to get hydrogen out of water as it releases when hydrogen is burnt. Thus, you may as well not even bother. It\\\u0027s the same with petrol. It takes the same amount of energy to re-form petrol molecules as is released when they\\\u0027re burnt.

The chlorine in them is the main problem -- it is split off from the molecules (usually because of the UV light hitting the molecules), and then undergoes a process whereby it converts ozone into oxygen, without using up the chlorine. It acts as a sort of catalyst, increasing the rate at which ozone forms oxygen. Ozone is an unstable molecule as ti is, and will readily break down to form oxygen. This happens because it absorbs some UV wavelengths, which provide the energy for this decomposition to happen. That is how it protects us from UV. The oxygen will then eventually be broken down by slightly different wavelengths, allowing ozone to be formed once again, as the now-free two ozone atoms join onto an existing oxygen molecule. Basically, by breaking down ozone, CFCs remove half the shield, and the most important half -- since ozone absorbs th much shorter UV wavelengths, the ones that do the most harm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, in many cases our intentions are not \u0027good\u0027, they are selfish or geared to wards making money.

That right there is most of the problem. If it produces waste we cannot deal with, it should not simply be discarded as an \u0027oh well, we can work something out later.\u0027 That sort of atittude is, in my opinion, what brought the world to its current pitiful state. Faith in those who come after you is all well and good, but carelessness for something that could be deadly is quite foolish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry. I tend to get a little out of sorts when people start talking carelessly about things that can easily endanger millions of lives.

Sure, it goes back, but that\\\u0027s AFTER it\\\u0027s been used. In order to make it work, there must be a tremendous amount of hydrogen stored, either by individuals collectively or the government (to be distributed) in order to start it off. This basically means that in order to begin using it, we must displace a certain amount. It\\\u0027ll go back into the world, but then we are again taking more out to produce more hydrogen as we burn it. Basically, this means that the \u0027displaced\u0027 amount will permanently be lost to the world, forever in circulation in engines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than two thirds of the planet\\\u0027s surface is ocean, in some places reaching many miles deep.

All I said was that you were not providing solutions, and you were giving less than adequate responses to offered solutions, which gave a naive impression. I do not intend to start a mudslinging session - I intend to point out that like myself, you do not have perfect knowledge, and in many cases your arguments were flawed. I used the same/similar level of criticism that you used for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopulation limiting is difficult. In countries where it is a problem, it is very difficult to police.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat lead to the Chernobyl disaster was poor reactor design on the part of the Soviets. No one assumed that it was entirely safe. It was not a result of a stupid viewpoint, it was the result of a city needing a lot of power and a nuclear plant being the most efficient was of providing it. The Soviets just didn\\\u0027t put enough research into it. Also, failures such as Chernobyl have lead to the exemplary safety of nuclear plants today. Natural disasters are difficult, but the Fukushima plant is on the side of Japan that has the least tsunamis. it should also be noted that gas-cooled reactors such as widely used by Britain are less susceptable to flooding than water cooled reactors. Fukushima\\\u0027s containment building was damaged by hydrogen explosions. The reactor\\\u0027s primary containment was undamaged and there were no large radiation leaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplosions in a nuclear power plant are never caused by the fuel having a nuclear detonation such as a nuclear warhead could have, they are usually hydrogen explosions or sudden increases in pressure. Radioactive material is more likely to melt its way out of a reactor than make it explode, and it is usually the coolant that causes explosions. Under standard running operation of a nuclear power plant, a containment building \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E contain fallout during a meltdown. That Fukushima\\\u0027s containment building was damaged was unusual, but it was handled, and less than a tenth of the radiation of the Chernobyl disaster escaped Fukushima. No more than 100 people around Fukushima are said to have increased cancer risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadioactive waste is not an \u0027I\\\u0027ll deal with it later\u0027 problem. We have dedicated treatment facilities, such as Sellafield [ironically, a renamed Windscale] which process nuclear waste, and store it in a way safe for the environment. True, its still \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E, but if well maintained the site could keep the radioactive waste contained indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m 16, and my sources are varied, though they include UKTV History, Wikipedia, Bang Goes The Theory, TVTropes, BBC documentaries and numerous Internet sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say my problem is blindly following people who say nuclear power is safe. I know the risks, I know the problems, and I know the scale of the problems. What I say is that your problem is that you are one of the majority who believe the ideas formulated by ecowarriors, politicians, oil companies, and Hollywood, who all for their own reasons are biased against nuclear power. Because these beliefs have majority, believers can use that as evidence. There is so much propaganda against nuclear power, and so few sources to defend it \u003Cem\u003Ebecause\u003C/em\u003E the majority believe it to be dangerous.

It was just research that was abandoned in favour of uranium plants so that the US could discover more about it for its nuclear bombs.
