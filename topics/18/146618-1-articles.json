Because my computer overheats faster\u00A0because its summer and i can barely play KSP now, it shuts down after 20 minutes, so i get bored quicker.

Fun fact: Ameschland all started in a Minecraft world when i was younger, i named it Ameschland, just a random name with no meaning at all.

I just wrote a story about an asteroid, and decided to spice it up into something more than just an average mission report. A couple days later I had an idea for a really sweet, romantic screenshot, and this turned into chapter 2.\u00A0At this point I realized if I was going to do this, we needed a danger element... and chapter 3 happened. But chapter 3 isn\u0027t entirely original, it was inspired by and based on\u00A0an old Johnny Quest episode called \u0022The Robot Spy\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the story just kept building from there, and still is. My point is you don\u0027t have to have the entire thing in your head before you start... not at all. Might be good to figure out how it will end,\u00A0eventually, but don\u0027t get stuck on the idea that you need to have it all figured out first. Just start writing it out now, and see what happens. I can\u0027t tell you how many times I was writing a chapter down, and while I was, a great idea came into my head how to follow it up in the next chapter.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same thing goes for most of my stories, i dont know what i am doing, but it ends up a good idea. The Ancient Chamber was just that, i was just thinking of random stuff, and i came up with the idea. And i also get alot of inspiration from other stories, the Moon mission one is inspired by 2 movies: Apollo 13, and Le Voyage Dans La Lune. Be cause in Le Voyage Dans La Lune people discover aliens, wich fits well with the mixed story idea. And Apollo 13 with the realistic feeling to it, Apollo 13 happend in real life, but my story is going to be a Sci-Fi story that feels like it happend in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story building thing is what i do with the ASA history story, it is pretty fun. But i also like stories with an end, because then i could maybe turn it in to a book or something, if i later wanted to. And i do not have an entire story in my head from start to end, most of it is just the plot, and that is good. I dont want an entire book in my head, i have other things to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really love your Ekimo station story, even though i havent read much of it.

Because my computer overheats faster\u00A0because its summer and i can barely play KSP now, it shuts down after 20 minutes, so i get bored quicker. And i have a couple of idea\u0027s of stories i could write: (They are not going to be real\u00A0books, just a file on WordPad that you can read)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Voyage to the Moon, a realistic but fictional mission to the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Ancient Chamber, a story about explorers discovering an ancient chamber, were weird paranormal stuff happends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A fictional journal, a story with a journal point of view, probably about a persons daily life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are just a bunch of ideas. But im not just writing a story. Alot of people like my cartoony way of drawing people, i have my own style, its not too realistic, or too unrealistic, it is not to Japanese either lol. This means im actually going to draw pictures of things that have to do with the story if i want to, so it might be a bit childish, but a story\u00A0without pictures feels so boring to me, even though pictures in books and stories\u00A0are for little kids. I just love drawing and i dont want to scrap that away. Drawing is life man.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i am writing a story, what do you think?
