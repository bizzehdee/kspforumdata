It could go one way or another, and the outlook can be very grim if it goes in the opposite direction. I\\\u0027m talking about the SOPA and PIPA bills, of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMind that what follows is my personal ramblings and (hopefully) paranoid ranting, It\\\u0027s not Squad\\\u0027s official stand on anything. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter going through the webs yesterday, looking at the net-wide protest we proudly took part in, I\\\u0027ve realized that this threat is here for a very understandable, though nonetheless evil, reason. Ultimately, this is a battle for the intellectual freedom of humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook back 30 years ago, before the webs existed. All the content you\\\u0027d see on the media was produced and deliberately controlled by a very small, very powerful group: the content providers (no names named here). Those were in charge of all the information the masses would ever receive, and that is a position of dangerously great power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens then? The internet comes along, and the people start taking content production and dissemination into their own hands. This gradually rises, until the very nature of the mass media channels starts to become threatened. We start claiming the right to view what we want, when we want it, and to not be subject to 4-minute-long interruptions every 5 minutes. We are perfectly entitled to that, and now we have a way around the canned, pre-digested content mass media feeds us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind though, I\\\u0027m not making an apology to piracy here, far from it. I\\\u0027m saying we are witnessing the birth of a new way of delivering content. One in which the public is no longer a passive spectator, but an active, decision-making, opinion-wielding entity. One which the content providers saw not as a humankind-improving trend, to lead us out of an intellectual dark age, but as a threat to their ways and, powerful as they are, took actions to destroy it. Instead of embracing the new way of things, they mean to push us back down into their idiocracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a time where we are slowly realizing we don\\\u0027t want to be fed a pre-digested goop of content, insterspersed with ads that tell you how you should be living your life. We want to make those choices ourselves, and we want to make ourselves heard. That is an undeniable right of every living human being: The drive to learn, make decisions and improve oneself. They mean to take that away from us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we are seeing then, with these SOPA and PIPA bills, is nothing less than a cultural holocaust. The systematic demolition of the free flow of content and information, disguised as an anti-piracy law. It becomes VERY easy for them to take down any \\\u0027subversive\\\u0027 offenders, by simply having them closed down on an accusation of piracy that doesn\\\u0027t even need to be proven. It\\\u0027s an Intellectual Inquisition, meant to take down the freedom of our new ways. To regain control, and put us back on track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought this up yesterday, when I was feeling pretty grim about all this. This morning though, came a surprise, which lifted me up quite a bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71618.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71618.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems we have made ourselves heard after all. It\\\u0027s very little, but it\\\u0027s a start, and although the enemy is far from being dead, we are standing our ground, and they\\\u0027ll find we\\\u0027re not so easy to push aside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can change the ways of the world here. We are at the brink of a very important shift in society. If they win, there\\\u0027s no telling when we will see such a golden age again. But if we win, we\\\u0027ll have changed the world. We, the small guys, sitting at our computers at home, are taking a joint stand against the mass media oligarchy. We are saying we don\\\u0027t want to feel brainwashed anymore, and we are free to enjoy the things WE decide should be enjoyed, and to shun the things we dislike. We are fighting for a world where everyone is free to dismiss advertisements they don\\\u0027t care about, where we can truly be free in choosing when and what we want to watch, play, or listen to. Where no one is fed the same goop as everyone else. Where the cats freely roam the tubes, and the things we like are sent across the length and breadth of the world for everyone to share and enjoy.
