Obviously I\u0027ve chosen this one... :-P\n\nI\u0027m buying some used parts to build a better PC then the one I currently have. I just started my own company so money is really tight but I\u0027m sure this setup will blow my current computer away (I\u0027m currently playing on a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC500 laptop from 2009). \n\nSo the thing is.. The parts that I\u0027m buying are:\n\n- [Gigabyte P35C-DS3R (Socket 775)](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2749#ov)\n- [NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450 (1GB DDR5)](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gts-450)\n- [Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600](http://ark.intel.com/products/29765/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q6600-8M-Cache-2_40-GHz-1066-MHz-FSB)\n\nThat plus a random case and PSU will go for just under \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC100. My issue now is the following... If you check the MB page you see that I have the option to install 8GB of DDR2 or 4GB of DDR3 so for this price I have the option to use 4GB of DDR3-1066 or 8GB of DDR2-800.\n\nMy indecision is obviously about higher bandwidth with lower capacity vs lower bandwidth and higher capacity. I also posted this question on one of FB\u0027s KSP pages and people seem to prefer 8GB of DDR2 and pointed me to this\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWgzA2C61z4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\nI totally forgot about.\nSo what is your opinion? 4GB clocking at 8533MB/s or 8GB with just 6400MB/s? Keep in mind this would be mostly to play a well modded KSP (that\u0027s why I\u0027m posting this here).\n\nI\u0027ll use a poll to make it easier to read the general opinion but I would appreciate if you could further elaborate."},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T11:44:35Z","Content":"Memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck in games. Especially if you use mods you should take 8 GB. If you have only 4 GB operating system and other softwares take something and KSP is not able to use maximum amount of 32 bit program (practically about 3.8 GB).\n\nI recommend also Linux and 64 bit KSP if you want to use many mods, especially graphical ones. Probably Squad gets also 64 bit Windows version to work at some day. You get a huge advantage with 8 GB if you use 64 bit KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T12:04:19Z","Content":"I doubt memory bandwidth will make any difference to KSP, as it\u0027s CPU bound, So I\u0027d go for 8GB of DDR2 myself. Unless power consumption is a really big thing for you, or DDR3 is significantly cheaper, which it is where I am.\n\nIf you\u0027re running 32bit KSP, you cant use more than 4GB anyway, if you\u0027re running 64bit those extra 4GBs will make it all worth while - AKA moar mods ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOn a semi-related topic, and not to say that 6600 isn\u0027t a good chip - they\u0027re excellent bang for buck.
