The goal is to fly out and just explore the solar system, finding everything you can. This might entail doing real science, Flying around, landing on planets or their moons, and exploring everything the planet has to offer. It\u0027s not really that much like KSP. There\u0027s some orbital mechanics, but you\u0027re pulled on by every planet, while the planets are only pulled on by the sun. You don\u0027t have to worry about Delta-V and usually you don\u0027t have to worry about thrust, so you can brute force everything. (In fact, the autopilot automatically uses a Brachistrone transfer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also some fun things to explore on Timber Hearth(The home planet), such as a model spaceship and a museum full of cool stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s something I didn\u0027t find until after around my 8th playthrough. (8th time booting up the game, not 8th time respawning) People have noticed the black hole/white hole of Brittle Hollow, and the Anglerfish inside that gnarled thorny one, but one thing I didn\u0027t see for quite some time is a celestial body that appears in orbit around other planets, but where it is is constantly changing whenever you change your view. It doesn\u0027t show up on any computers. I had to do a full approach, but when I switched to landing view it moved again. I once even saw it orbiting the home planet of Timber Hearth. I finally decided to just brute-force it. Found where it was at that time, thrusted directly towards it until I crashed, and I just sort of fell through. When I came out, both it and I were in orbit around a different planet suddenly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s related to that strange sculpture in the Observatory Museum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I now kind of want someone to do a planet pack in KSP that resembles the planets in this game in a Kerbal scale. But this is probably impossible, because several places are hollow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T16:52:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T04:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis reminds me of Little and Big: Grandpa\u0027s Leftovers (The early version), Overgrowth, Tower of Guns and things of the like from my early days as a PC Gamer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, memories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T07:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egreat game. played it several times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe moon you were mentioning is the quantum moon BTW. you can land on it, I managed to once.[/sPOLIER]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T09:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I remember playing this, lots of easter eggs and good replayability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne time I approached a moon called Dark Bramble.
