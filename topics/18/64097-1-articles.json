One method is to just instantly apply any mousedown or mouseup event from any user for all three mouse buttons. But I don\u0027t suspect it would be possible to hold the mouse for very long, making the vab basically impossible. To alleviate that, we could have the program hold the mouse down if more than some percentage of the audience is holding it down, (for each button) and release it when that percentage rises above the threshold. Setting that threshold would be a bit tricky, but one could adaptively change it so that the average ratio of time the system\u0027s mouse buttons are down is equal to the ratio seen in normal KSP gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the keyboard, many of the keys in KSP are sensitive to hold time, so using adaptive thresholds again like the mouse buttons might be fine. Or maybe we could come up with some hybrid of that and just applying every single button press immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hotmailcompany52","CreatedById":21696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T21:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be sorta more in the style of TwitchPlays if the commands where entered on the chat. You would need to have a large stylised cursor. For clicks you could have leftclick and rightclick commands that do just that. And a rightclickhold and leftclickhold. And for the cursor you can have move up, down, etc which moves it up 10 pixels or more. You could also have anarchy and democracy modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T07:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could have it be in super-rapid succession format, where a randomly chosen person in the chat gets control for 30 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T08:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh, guys?
