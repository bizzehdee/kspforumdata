Exception is if its an SSD and you only have room for one HD, then an extra disk makes sense.\n\nFor backups this is not true. One disk is never safe. More disks are safer, though other factors come into play too. External disks are preferred too, as they are less vulnerable to simultaneous power surges, virus infection, cryptographic malware, RAM failure and a whole host of other failure modes. Two drives inside the same system are a lot less safe than one drive inside the system and a secondary separated drive, as most mishaps can take out both drives at the same time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Remember that external discs tend to fail far more often than disks in computers, they get bumped around a lot for once.\n\nIf you just use it around the house, not really. Besides, HDDs can actually take some abuse as long as they are not running. When powered up, yes, avoid knocks at all costs."}]}
