I\u0027ve watched ISS passes for a couple years now, since I discovered \u003Ca href=\u0022http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States\u0026amp;region=Florida\u0026amp;city=Orlando\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States\u0026amp;region=Florida\u0026amp;city=Orlando\u003C/a\u003E and because it\u0027s so exceptionally bright, like an unblinking airplane, that you just can\u0027t miss it. I use \u0022DroidSat\u0022 on my phone to help me look in the right spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tonight HTV-5 is my first sighting of something that wasn\u0027t ISS. It was extremely dim, and I only saw it because it was exactly trailing about 10 seconds behind ISS. I would have completely missed it, otherwise. It was like a really dim moving star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s so weird to see actual orbital mechanics in action like that. Thinking \u0022those are two spacecraft in matched orbits, about to dock soon...\u0022 and it\u0027s actually true is just a bit of a gobsmacker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T04:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow lucky.
