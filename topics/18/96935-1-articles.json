I would be interested to know what people think. (Ideally without getting into the political issues that it raises.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that it was extremely well done. It had a compelling story and beautiful cinematography. I hope that its nomination draws attention to the need to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Virunga, despite it being located in such a politically volatile part of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T05:57:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aningaaq","CreatedById":99814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T08:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat documentary.
