And, of course, using it on your top stage makes perfect sense, because the structural loads are probably about as low there as anywhere (less mass to support on top of it), and every pound shaved out of an upper stage trickles down to several pounds saved in the lower stages...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOddly enough, the Falcon 1\\\u0027s second stage is not considered pressure-supported at all.

A interferometric radar ground station would track the rocket during launch and send updates to the rocket to make corrections. The military pushed for an independent fully-inertial system which was implemented in Atlas E and onwards, but the technology developed for the Azusa system saw continued usage in the spaceflight industry, with related ground-based tracking and command systems being the favored system right up to the Shuttle era, and even today to some extent (complimented by GPS and TDRS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey used an RD-180, not a 170.
