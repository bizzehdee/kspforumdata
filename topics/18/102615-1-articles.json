I looked a little deeper into it, and I wondered...why?\n\nNow I am not going to touch on the matter whether GMO itself is good or bad - that is something we can discuss intelligently over science lab with academic sources and such. I am talking about the social phenomenon that is Monsanto the GMO boogeyman, which is harder to discuss academically and thus placed here.\n\nFor some reason, despite being only one company that use GMO seeds, along with Dupont, Syngenta, Bayer CropScience, Dow AgroSciences, and some others, Monsanto has been the one company under such heavy fire for all these recent years when others barely get a spark. \n\nI feel like there is some sort of conspiracy theory lovers that like to paint this image of a megacorporation ([they are smaller than Starbucks](https://www.quora.com/Is-Monsanto-evil/answer/Franklin-Veaux)) that control the world\u0027s agriculture economy through GMO ([they only have like 35% market share compare to other top plant biotech patent holders](https://www.justice.gov/atr/public/workshops/ag2010/015/AGW-14383-b.html), see [figure 5](https://www.justice.gov/atr/public/workshops/ag2010/015/AGW-14383-b_f5.jpg) in link). \n\nI don\u0027t think I am going to defend them on whether they are evil or not either. I think they are just as evil as other corporations doing sometimes dubious things to make profit. And that is not right. But I feel like tagging the whole GMO concept behind a company then have a whole Anti-GMO movement that basically use that one company as strawman to burn for all the evils of GMO feels...too convenient. Like there is something wrong here, something that people skip over to just have something to angry about, a conspiracy to gossip over.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?\n\nReminder again : Not discussing about what GMO is, or its effect. We are talking about Monsanto, and why it is being the most \u0022evil\u0022 corporation for using GMO when there are others doing basically the same thing. Its business practices are bad and we don\u0027t need to defend it. I am just wondering if this whole \u0022Mosanto = GMO overlord\u0022 on the same level with conspiracy theories. If we want to hate on some entities, at least we should hate it for the right reasons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T05:05:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:12:02Z","Content":"There have been a few cases in which Monsanto has gone after farmers for intellectual property reasons, I believe that is one of the reasons people get upset.

Agent orange was developed by the military, thanks to the work of Arthur W.

The manager of the grocery store I worked at in college was a scout of some sort in Vietnam. (To hear him tell it he was part of a sniper/spotter team.) He was up in a tree when they got Orange\u0027d, and managed to cover everything except his right leg. Somehow, and I\u0027ll never understand how, he got to keep his leg. It wasn\u0027t anything more than skin, bone, and chemical burns, about 1/3rd the size of his left leg. It eventually killed him. \n\nNot many people draw a distinction between Monsanto the Rainbow Defoliant chemical giant and Monsanto the Agricultural entity.

While there wasn\u0027t any chromosonal-level modification being done (as with some GMOs) it was certainly the result of selective breeding. (Which Wikipedia counts as genetic manipulation.)

I\u0027ll give corn as the perfect example.\n\u003E \n\u003E Agent Orange isn\u0027t pretty. I personally know too many who suffer from exposure, and a few whom have passed because of it. I think Roundup only exists because of people\u0027s laziness.\n\nWhile it is true that man has been modifying plant life for thousands of years through selective breeding, man only recently started directly engineering genetic code by injecting specifically designed virus into the cell nucleus. This is how Monsanto is able to achieve the death of all the \u0022weeds\u0022 while allowing the modified corn to survive. This also encourages the planting of only one type of corn. Round-up ready corn. If we loose lose crop variety, we also loose lose our \u0022safety net\u0022. See Irish potato famine as an example.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T05:04:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Otis**\n  \nlose, not loose. good greif."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T04:11:16Z","Content":"The primary issue I have with Monsanto are the patents it holds on living organisms. They did not actually engineer genetic material AFAIK, they only selected genetic material from other organisms that had a natural resistance to RoundUp, then \u0027pasted\u0027 that genetic material into the crop. This is basically like a programmer copying bits of code, or even entire classes, from someone\u0027s project, and pasting them into his/her project, then claiming that they engineered that piece of software."}]}
