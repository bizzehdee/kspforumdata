As for Houston this is a major hit that most aren\u0027t even aware of yet; The federal flood insurance program is some 30\u002B billion in losses already as I type this, and Houston (alone) has the projection at around 50\u002B billion.

Many people I know, friends and such, living right up on the beaches, were not so lucky; Some of them, it took years to recover and rebuild. They did so knowing it will happen again at some point.
