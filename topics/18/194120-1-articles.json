You can find them in a bunch of places online, and the cheap ones are probably pretty much all the same model. I popped the back off of mine (much more easily than I anticipated, which was nice) and found this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002267.99\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022Cuqm6LU.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Cuqm6LU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at all those places I can put a voltmeter on! \u0022PWR\u0022 is where the coax cable plugs into the TV box, and \u0022LNB\u0022 goes to the LNB, which is the detector part of the radio telescope. There\u0027s a potentiometer in here, which on the front of the box is a knob that changes the sensitivity, which is kind of annoying because I have to know which sensitivity is good. The voltage across the potentiometer directly is also really noisy, so it\u0027s not much help to bypass it. Then there\u0027s the dial, which on the front of the box points from 1 to 10 depending on how strong the signal is. In my experience, the change in signal is actually really minute and only moving the potentiometer can make the dial change from 1 to 10. On the back, though, there\u0027s a couple really helpful pieces of metal where I can measure voltage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the buzzer, which seems like maybe the nicest place to use as an analog input on an Arduino. I found that pointing it at the Sun changed the voltage from about 2 volts to maybe 2.1 volts or something, a really small nudge on the voltmeter dial but still enough that it would probably produce a somewhat useful number in a computer program. I\u0027m thinking that if I remove the buzzer and replace it with wires that plug into an Arduino\u0027s analog pins, I can get the radio signal as a number in the serial.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003EI bet it would actually be way better if I could pump the numbers into a MATLAB script instead, then I could average a bunch of readings and croup them into a nice array and make a picture all in one place\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve learned so far.

Even if it takes only one second to take a measurement, it will\u00A0take a while to scan\u00A0even a 100x100 pixel image, and the Earth will swing away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-24T20:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, I\u0027m aware of those things.
