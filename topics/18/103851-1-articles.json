The only bad outcome, at least for me, is that some uploaders will ultimately put a few videos behind a paywall (whether the contract forces them to or not), which will make me slightly irritated - about as much as some uploaders banning their videos in certain countries (which can be proxied, but it\u0027s still annoying).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T19:40:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T22:31:29Z","Content":"That\u0027s what I think it actually is - meant more for large partners than everyday Joes. Really need to see more details from Google regarding the uploader side of things before I light fires and turnover dumpsters. \n\nAs for the subscriber side? I think YouTube (as it currently is) is long overdue for exactly that feature. Even with the 55% \u0022processing fee\u0022 taken by El Goog, I\u0027m more comfortable with them handling subscription money than I am with direct donations to random foreign nationals and folks unknown. (Such as the age-old PayPal donations some channels used to accept.... I don\u0027t really have an opinion on Patreon being used by YouTubers.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Unless your channel has thousands of subscribers (or more), you will probably be considered \u0022not that popular\u0022.

My channel is unimportant, but my Google\u002B account might be over whatever \u0022common folk\u0022 threshold they have. Still in the \u0022not that popular\u0022 camp, especially since I\u0027ve been actively avoiding G\u002B for a couple years now, but algorithms don\u0027t always care. If I share something on G\u002B it can reach a not insignificant number of folks, several of which are in the \u0022big guys\u0022 ballpark. Exactly the sort of thing their billing robots might look for. \n\nWhat I\u0027m more curious about is whether this move (in which actual money from subscribers is changing hands) will criminalize the use of Ad blockers. I \\_think\\_ you could already argue that some of the things Ad blockers do are theft under current laws (though insignificant enough to not pursue), but establishing two classes of YouTube users - those with ads and those without - might mean using an Ad blocker is considered escalating access to a remote computer system that is engaged in interstate commerce - ie: a CFAA violation. If so, I\u0027d probably just end up blacklisting YouTube on my PCs (which I try to keep clean) and only watch it through tablet, smartphone, set-top box or TV-dongle apps. \n\n[Yeah, I\u0027m a little paranoid.
