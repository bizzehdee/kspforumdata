Not photographic, but the next best thing, I guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1980s I was running an IBM mainframe. Outside my office was a wall of 3\u0022 binders with literally 100,000 pages of printed manuals. I used to routinely do tricks that\u0027d leave everyone\u0027s jaw hanging open. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe computer is having a problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I remember reading something that could be helpful...I have no idea when, where or what, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalked over to the wall of binders, and without looking I\u0027d pull down a couple of them based solely on muscle memory of their location. I didn\u0027t even check the titles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarried them back to my desk, and started flipping pages as fast as I can, until I run across the \u0022right\u0022 page and stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt freaked people out! What I remembered was the \u0022shape\u0022 of the paragraphs and headings and whitespace on that particular page. But I\u0027d have no idea what was going to be ON that page until I found it. In fact, I think I still remember the \u0022shape\u0022 of most of the pages I ever read in my first 30 years, though there\u0027s no way to tell how many are actually just \u0022memories of memories\u0022 now. Creepy, huh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the superpower started fading away, my wife had to teach me how to take notes. For obvious reasons, I\u0027d never bothered. These days I put everything into Evernote, and keep an Evernote-dedicated tablet next to my laptop. I bought the tablet specifically for KSP, in fact. Alt-tabbing several times a minute was getting too awkward. Between that and Google, I manage okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease nobody accuse me of bragging or respond with cruelty. This was hard to share. Yes I was a freak and yes it gave me some unfair advantages in life. And when I lost it I fell into a deep depression for years, and very nearly committed suicide. All I have left from that gift are detailed memories of exactly how much I\u0027ve lost, and frequent reassurances that I \u0022still have a pretty good memory for a guy in his 50s.\u0022 Thankfully, the reasoning and creative parts of my brain have held up somewhat better. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what have I memorized? Darned near everything I encountered back then, whether I wanted to or not. Much of it\u0027s still in there, though to add new things I have to practice over and over just like everyone else.
