Why can\u0027t the connection be P2P, and simply send location/orentation data of the other player(s) debris/craft at all times, regardless of warp? (If you\u0027ve ever played trackmania, you\u0027ve experienced this in action.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, Player x is in LKO, burning for the mun, I\u0027m already orbiting the mun. Player x completes his burn, and accelerates his ship to coast to the mun. Meantime I continue adjusting my munar orbit, waiting for him to arrive. All physics/time acceleration happens locally on player X\u0027s computer. I just see his ship come at near-light speed towards me while he\u0027s using warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows both of us to time warp at our leisure, but as well as if we want to fly close together/interact, we can both opt not to use time accel and do some cooperative flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only cons that I can think of for this type of MP system is that inter-player collisions might be difficult to account for, though I think if both players are in realtime simulation, the physics could just ignore player collisions at anything other than 1x mode. The other con would be that communicating several ships/bits of debris would be kind of cumbersome for bandwidth... but surely a distance/trajectory based approach (don\u0027t render/transmit ships or parts that you won\u0027t be seeing anytime soon) could clear a lot of that up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the event that players would want to compete in a \u0022race\u0022 the time accel issue isn\u0027t unfair. Both players have independent access to warping, and it will still increase their relative mission time at the same rate. If player X lands 4 minutes earlier in physical world time, that doesn\u0027t mean that I can\u0027t land 2 minutes sooner than him in game time with a better mission plan. Our game time\u0027s would be calculated independently, but some sort of trigger for touchdown on a celestial body would then have the client report current mission time for scoring, warp compensated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Gamah","CreatedById":42887,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T18:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh derp, I meant to post this in the OT section, not challenges... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease move.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T18:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this in challenges, if anything it should be in Off-Topic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd does Track mania have time warp, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you do while your friend is warping to Jool?

Very, very messy. You also neglected to take into account the problem of planetary orbit, non-player-controlled orbital objects, etc. Who\u0027s debris is who\u0027s? Does the debris move at that person\u0027s warp speed too or only the warp speed of the hosting player? Which system has final authority over the position of what? When one goes down that path, one sets oneself up for a completely incoherent system. (It\u0027s much the same reason why computer systems that need to work together are kept in sync with each other.
