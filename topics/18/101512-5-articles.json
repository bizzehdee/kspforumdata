We are seeing the effects with glaciers melting, sea levels rising, methane being released from melting permafrost, and more violent meteorological events than ever. The positive feedback loops are measured, explained, and predictable in models. The entire scientific community agrees that there is a climate problem and that it\u0027s getting out of control. And no, the entire scientific community is not part of a Greenpeace-driven conspiracy.\n\u003E \n\u003E You might debate whether climate change is due to human activity or not. So we really have two options here:\n\u003E \n\u003E - Either it is due to us burning stuff, in which case we should probably stop burning stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E - It is due to some other unexplained natural cause, but burning stuff is making it worse, in which case we should probably stop burning stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E Other than that, there are plenty of other reasons for us to stop burning stuff (burnt stuff residue isn\u0027t healthy to breathe, the more stuff we burn, the less there is to burn, and the more expensive it gets, we need to import stuff that burns from countries that are run by bad people, etc...)\n\u003E \n\u003E I see absolutely no rational reason for us to keep on burning stuff, other than \u0022I sell stuff that burns, so I don\u0027t want people to stop burning stuff\u0022 and \u0022I want to keep on burning stuff because I don\u0027t care\u0022. \n\u003E \n\u003E Funnily enough, the only place in the World that has influential decision-makers who are constantly denying scientific results also happens to be the only place in the World where politicians are openly funded by people who sell stuff that burns and are elected by people who don\u0027t care. What a coincidence !\n\nWhether it is happening is absolutely up for debate. So is the existence of human affect on it or anything other level of argument. Everything is always up for debate. Sorry, but the fact that a person does something does not mean it\u0027s harmful(at which point the argument that affect of humans is not up for debate has it\u0027s end. Beyond that you can still argue there is 0 affect. No argument every stops to exist and in a serious manner. EVER.). You do not know wiping out the rain forests is even bad. How do you know we are not part of the ecosystem and it expects us to do it!? How do you know the planet won\u0027t turn into Venus if we don\u0027t cut it all down and it\u0027s vital we do it? How do you know the data you see is not part of something larger, or some other misconception, and it is not something good or vital?\n\nYou are almost, if not literally, assuming perpetuity is the norm. Or any other endless combination of logic. It is too complicated to say with the current arguments being thrown around what is what. Maybe the destruction of the rainforest is the most important part of the lifecycle of the rainforest?! That is actually very normal with plants and ecosystems. The fact is most people don\u0027t know and don\u0027t have the knowledge or information to know this sort of thing or anything like. That is why I refered to people not having a background with plants or having one sufficiently. The more you learn about plants the more you learn about their complexity and diversity. It changes per plant. There is no simple set anything in regards to them and what is good bad. It\u0027s all over the place! And talking about an ecosystem is that much more complex. There is nothing you can say easily, if ever, is good or bad for them in the end in any way.\n\nIf you don\u0027t beleive me.

And these scientists, from hundreds of organisations from all over the world, aren\u0027t all subsidized by large industries.\n\nUsually, when you certain that you are right and the entire world is wrong, then either you are a misunderstood genius or you are wrong.

I started putting LED bulbs in my house, when they were running $80/each. So yeah, I was ahead of everyone on that as well. I make furniture out of recycled wood, I compost, I don\u0027t throw out my grass clippings, I let them serve as a natural fertilizer as they decompose. I buy minimal packaged food, or canned food, which is why I generate less trash than anyone I know. \n\nMy next house, is designed to be earth covered on 3 walls and the roof, and it will be heated with direct solar energy, and supplemented with geothermal. It also means that I won\u0027t have a roof that\u0027s radiating heat, and I can keep grass/plants growing on that footprint and sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. It\u0027s also designed to be gridless, so my energy bills and usage will be almost nil.

His MONTHLY energy usage is more than all of my company\u0027s employees energy usage for the ENTIRE YEAR - combined! Yes, I asked them to bring in their energy bills. So even though we are \u0022in denial\u0022 or \u0022ignorant,\u0022 my entire company is doing less harm to the environment than Al Gore - the prime example of hypocrisy. That doesn\u0027t even take into account his private jet usage to fly around and tell everyone else how they should stop flying around. So yeah, hypocrisy is way, way better.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T16:59:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EdFred**"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T17:17:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nSo you\u0027re half way to being a hippy.

Hey, I get that our current \u0022global climate change\u0022 is man-made. No argument from me there. But where do you possibly get extinction of humanity from it? I see a few trillion dollars of economic disruption, spread over a century. I see mass migration of around a billion people, with numerous regional wars resulting. \n\nThat\u0027s an ugly century, but it\u0027s a long, long way from extinction! Sh\\*t happens, and then people fight over whatever\u0027s left. It\u0027s the sad story of our species.\n\nAs I see it, very little can be done to stop it without having a world government. As long as nation-states each get to pollute internally as much as they like, and global economics is played like a zero-sum game, this is an inevitable outcome of the industrial revolution. We\u0027ll do what we always do: Put off any action until the last second, fight some wars over resources, then adapt to the new conditions.\n\nMy hippie family does what we can. We buy carbon credits for the car (blame us for the ocean algae-bloom experiments if you want), and pay extra to get all our electricity from wind and nuclear. And vote liberal, naturally. But China and India, and soon Brazil, intend to become first-world economies, and I don\u0027t think I can stop them, and am unsure I even have the right to try. They aren\u0027t doing anything the US didn\u0027t do first. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nBy the way, what\u0027s Canada\u0027s plan for when the US Midwest dries up and we come take your newly productive land?

There are similar effects at play with melting glaciers interfering with warm and cold ocean currents. These are called positive feedback loops and explain why the whole climate is getting out of control. Some of those effects are indeed natural, and much stronger than any man made direct influence, but they were triggered by human activity.\n\nFusion is still science fiction at this point. Even if a working model was invented now, it would still take at least 20 years to start the first production fusion plants, and many more decades before it becomes a significant power source.\n\nNuclear has its own problems, but at least it doesn\u0027t produce Methane or CO2. The problem of nuclear waste will have to be dealt with at some point, but the problem of greenhouse gasses has to be dealt with now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T10:21:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 10:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"}]}
