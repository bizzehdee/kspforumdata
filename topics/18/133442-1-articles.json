No doubt this will cause a momentary rise in activity, however as the series fades, so will the hype. I personally feel that as he struggles, he may scare off the players who have not\u00A0played KSP, as they will see it as difficult and not as interesting as other games, since they don\u0027t feel the achievement and freedom of doing it themselves. It\u0027s very one sided.
