A planet such as Nibiru would create noticeable effects in the orbits of the outer planets.[20] Some counter this by claiming that the object has been concealed behind the Sun for several years, though this would be geometrically impossible.[12] Amateur photographs supposedly showing Nibiru near the Sun are usually the result of lens flares, false images of the Sun created by reflections within the lens.[21]\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think sedna is eather of those two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spearka","CreatedById":12271,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-27T17:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2 reasons why Nemesis does not exist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1:it would emit some sort of radiation which we would have detected eons ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2:there would be more objects like sedna orbiting the sun, maybe even those with closer orbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.Sedna is roughly half the size of the moon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-27T18:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould a moderator PLEASE lock this thread?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-27T18:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll lock thread up..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
