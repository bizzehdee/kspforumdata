I\u0027ve got an interesting theory about the story of FNAF4.\n\nTo start with, I believe that the bite that happened was the Bite of \u002787. There\u0027s some confusion on whether the game takes place in 1983 or in 1987.\n\nSecond, It\u0027s quite possible that the bite victim is the Purple Guy\u0027s son, and the Purple Guy committed the murders as an act of revenge. However, he never saw who caused his son\u0027s death, which would explain why there were more than four murders. The Purple Guy hunted down anybody who was at the party.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible that the bite victim becomes the spirit that haunts the Marionette. In one of the minigame rooms, you can see pieces of the Marionette scattered around the floor. Also, looking at the victim\u0027s face in the minigames, his tears match the appearance of the Marionette\u0027s face paint, which may just be a coincidence.\n\nAs for the victim\u0027s brother and his friends, I think they die later, around the time of the first FNAF. They become the spirits that haunt the four animatronics of FNAF. The Purple Guy is clearly sick-minded enough to kill them, even if one of them is his own son. However, it\u0027s more likely that the four were so ashamed of what they did that they committed suicide.\n\nThat\u0027s my theory. If there are any inconsistencies, let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T00:41:16Z","Content":"Ugh. Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s.
