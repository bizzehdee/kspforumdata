For my math class, I have to draw a picture using [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). I would like to set the bar pretty high for my class, and I want your help. I plan on making THIS:\n\n![Space-Shuttle-Atlantis.jpg](http://www.astronomytime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Space-Shuttle-Atlantis.jpg)\n\nThe background is irrelevant here. What is important is the shuttle stack; ie the SRBs, External Tank, Orbiter, and smoke.\n\nI don\u0027t know all of the functions I need for this to work, so I\u0027m hoping that you can help. If you find a function which will solve for a part of the picture, please post it here. I\u0027ll put them up in order and you can copy and paste to see what has already been done.\n\nIf you\u0027re interested in helping, let me know on this thread and I\u0027ll put your name up, along with any details you would like to draw.\n\nThanks in advance for everyone\u0027s help!\n\nContributors:\n\nFunctions:\n\n-1.225x \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 15.6 {-26.4\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-4.5}\n\n-1.225x \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 4.6 {-20.4\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-12.4}\n\n-1.225x \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 4.6 {-6.8\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A40}\n\n0.04x\u002B4.1 {-14.5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-7.5}\n\n0.04x\u002B4.1 {-6.8\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A40.5}\n\n-2.3x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015312 {-7.6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-6.9}\n\n-(2.3x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015312)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01536 {-0.21\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A40.8}\n\n-2.3x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015313 {-8.04\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-7.3}\n\n-2.3x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015330 {-15.05\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-14.569}\n\n1/8x\u002B6.5 {-15.05\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A40.2}\n\nx=-15.06 {7.5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A5y\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A54.6}\n\nx\u002B22.55 {=15.06\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-8.4}\n\nx=-8.4 {14.14\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4y\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A415}\n\n-2x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01531.9 {-13\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4x\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4-8.4}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T13:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dman979**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:38:43Z","Content":"anybody want to help?

The Parabola**\n\n![85ac4123cd14f706f40f3750c82be7ac.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/a/85ac4123cd14f706f40f3750c82be7ac.png)\n\nThis is a great way to create curved lines in your picture. I would suggest just plugging in this exact formula into Desmos and use the sliders. Play around with it for a bit and see which variable does what. (If you switch the *x* with the *y* you can alter the axis of symmetry and have it reflect along the *x* axis versus the *y*).\n\n**2. The Circle**\n\n![e9326e126151d2fb2e0573e8b5f57310.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/3/e9326e126151d2fb2e0573e8b5f57310.png)\n\nYou are going to need circles to draw in your boosters and the Shuttle\u0027s main engines (or the Saturn V\u0027s depending on what you plan on drawing) as well.

Inequalities**\n\nI don\u0027t know if you need to shade in certain areas of the picture for your project, but if you have to these will for sure help you out. It seems to me that you already know how to do these since you have been limiting the length of your line segments.\n\n**5. The Linear Equation**\n\nThis also seems to me that you know about these as well.\n\nI hope that this helps, or at least gives you some ideas for your picture.
