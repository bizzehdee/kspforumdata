I expect to be much less active in these forums for the time being, but that\u0027s all it\u0027s about, no nefarious reasons or disgruntlement or anything like that. KSP is one of the best games I know, and has one of the best communities I know, I have very much enjoyed my time so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only became active in the forum very recently after a very long time of lurking anonymously, but in that short time I\u0027ve tried to be a positive and helpful contributor, if not always with actual helpful stuff, at least by provoking a smile or two. I hope I succeeded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecent events have taught me it\u0027s important to express gratitude, which is why I decided to not simply fade silently: my thanks go to Squad for the awesome game, everyone involved in supporting the community, modding and non-modding alike, directly or indirectly. And thanks in general to the great community of KSP players - I\u0027ve learned a lot about KSP and Real Physics and engineering subjects from too many of you to name. Not unimportantly: I\u0027ve had a great deal of fun at the same time. Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I will be able to check in now and then to stay informed, and my intent is to get Life sorted out so I can spend more time with the game and the community soon again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nswjr-swis\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T13:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that job hunting goes well man!
