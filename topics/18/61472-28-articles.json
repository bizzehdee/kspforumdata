On the other end of the spectrum is something more like KSP, where you\u0027re just presented with total freedom, a big list of parts and engines and materials and all that, then you save your craft and go, and it\u0027s ready to fly. Or perhaps an optional construction time mechanic, where your workers descend upon the assembly rack with welding equipment and piece together your designed ship over the course of an hour or so, which would be made easier with a \u0022skip time\u0022 mechanic.

Researching found artifacts doesn\u0027t require you to look at them in a 3D scene; the player really just wants the tech advance that comes from the research. Same goes for alien autopsy: yuk! icky! - that would have been a huge amount of work to make \u0022interactive.\u0022 Intercepting a UFO is a largely hands-off affair, because the most important thing to the player should be: did I succeed in shooting down the UFO? It\u0027s not meant to be an air or space flight combat sim. The focus is on the turn-based strategy game, which comes next.
