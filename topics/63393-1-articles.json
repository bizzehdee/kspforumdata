Fitness is a very important thing in low-gravity environments, so the more energetic the better. Most of these sports would be inside the habitat, since watching people compete in big spacesuits wouldn\u0027t be too fun and would be very dangerous!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing that comes to mind would be a variation on rugby/soccer/football. Two teams on either side of the arena, and the goal is a hole in the opposite wall. Not sure if you could integrate American football rules like individual downs and yardage, and what would constitute a tackle unless you went with something like flag football. It would probably be timed play, rather than individual downs, with control of the ball passing back-and-forth as it is intercepted or wrestled from an opposing player. More like Association football or lacrosse. If the goal was large enough you could have a goalie, or it could be a smaller hole with no defender. A lot would depend on the level of violence in the game as well. If players are allowed to push off the walls, or groups of players can impart their momentum to the ball carrier, I could imagine the speed of travel could get pretty high and players impacting on other players could be brutal so a good level of protection would be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also imagine that games of dodgeball would be quite fun in a low-gravity environment. The existing rules would be just fine, except for the opening moves. You couldn\u0027t have the balls sitting in the middle of the arena, while players dash to grab them. I would change this to include some kind of system where the game balls are injected into the arena in random directions from random locations. Either that, or just let each team start with a number of balls. I like the idea of balls being shot into the game arena, because this adds an element of tactics. Do you push off the wall and go for that ball? What if you miscalculate the balls trajectory and end up in the open without any defense? This could be an enormous amount of fun! You could even vary the rules a bit. In normal dodgeball the ball is \u0022dead\u0022 when it hits the ground. You could have certain surfaces, such as the rear wall of a cube arena, keep the ball live, so bouncing the ball off of walls to hit players could be a valid tactic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA version of tennis might be interesting, played in a cube. The point would be to hit your opponents rear wall with the ball, that being scored a point. This could get pretty acrobatic, with players pushing and bouncing off walls to try and intercept the ball with their racket. It would be more like a 3D version of air hockey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStraight out of Ender\u0027s Game, I could imagine paintball competitions being pretty interesting. A large spherical arena with anchored obstacles would be pretty amazing to battle in. Having watched some paintball competitions on TV I would change things up a little. I would opt for precision of fire, rather than the current method of rapid-fire. Slow-firing weapons would make the game more slow-paced and tactical, valuing position and teamwork and using the full 3D environment to your advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of sports that I don\u0027t see as practical in this kind of environment. Golf wouldn\u0027t work, or baseball or hockey. I don\u0027t see anything involving distance as being practical, either. I mean, could you imagine a shotput or javelin competition on the Moon?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how racing sports would work, either. What\u0027s a 100yard dash when all the racers just push off a wall? Maybe pulling themselves along with handrails? I\u0027m also not sure how fighting sports would work. How would you pin your opponent in wrestling? And I can\u0027t imagine Judo or any of the martial arts being very practical, although you might have some interesting MMA fights in low gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you all think?

On the moon, you only weigh one sixth of what you do on earth; but your mass as a whole - and thus your inertia - remains the same. It would be incredibly easy to propel yourself to very fast running speeds (limits of your pressure suit permitting, unless it happens in a pressurized indoors environment), but the impact of your legs on the ground would grow to higher proportions than what we experience on earth. This would also be dramatically amplified by uneven terrain. If you think that less gravity means you won\u0027t tire as quickly, think again. Also, it becomes a game of figuring out how much you can push yourself - how fast you can go before you risk injuring your ankles or breaking a leg the next time you hit a bump or the track slopes up. Especially since low-g environments promote the weakening of bones and muscles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThirdHorseman","CreatedById":77825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T04:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kruleworld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kruleworld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit\u0027d probably be more like basketball, without the dribbling and water polo (eg throwing the ball to each team member to pass it forward).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea I hadn\u0027t thought of water polo.

It would be incredibly easy to propel yourself to very fast running speeds (limits of your pressure suit permitting, unless it happens in a pressurized indoors environment), but the impact of your legs on the ground would grow to higher proportions than what we experience on earth. This would also be dramatically amplified by uneven terrain. If you think that less gravity means you won\u0027t tire as quickly, think again. Also, it becomes a game of figuring out how much you can push yourself - how fast you can go before you risk injuring your ankles or breaking a leg the next time you hit a bump or the track slopes up. Especially since low-g environments promote the weakening of bones and muscles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich seems to make it a mandatory daily exercise on low-g worlds? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thing to take into consideration is the frequent cleaning that the arena will require. The players are going to get nice and sweaty, and you can be damn sure that after several minutes of play there are going to be sweat droplets floating all over the place.
