The MM config files include rules for what to do when color-changing isn\u0027t available, so please don\u0027t delete those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. ModuleManager thinks color-changing is available via Firespitter or InterstellarFuelSwitch, but neither is installed.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFix\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E: This is a little trickier to pinpoint. Either another mod has bad rules in it (for instance using \u003Cem\u003E\u0022FOR[Firespitter]\u0022\u003C/em\u003E instead of \u003Cem\u003E\u0022NEEDS[Firespitter]\u0022\u003C/em\u003E) and is therefore tricking ModuleManager, or one of these two mods is only partially installed. That could happen if you removed them via CKAN but the directories still exist, which ModuleManager will see as having them installed. To fix, either make sure both of those mods are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecompletely\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E uninstalled, or install one (or both) of them. Only the DLL from one of them is needed, you don\u0027t need the entire mod. But it needs to be running if ModuleManager thinks its there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. It\u0027s possible that another mod may be confused that changes how VAB/SPH tweakables or engine shrouds work.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 This is an odd case, but not impossible. When you don\u0027t have Firespitter or InterstellarFuelSwitch installed, the alternate paint jobs are disabled by turning them into \u0022engine shrouds\u0022 that correspond to an attachment node that is a kilometer outside the VAB. If another mod interferes with this, such as defaulting all shrouds to \u0022on\u0022 even when detached, then you might also see z-fighting. Sadly, the solution might be to simply not use the mods together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T00:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks I deleted the modulemanager files and it worked again.

I\u0027ll probably rework the SpaceY legs at some point, but for some time now I\u0027ve been avoiding legs just because the way landing gear of all kinds works will be completely redesigned in KSP 1.1. I don\u0027t know yet what\u0027s involved with that or how hard they will be to convert, so for now they\u0027re just continuing as-is. The travel and deployment height was sort of an artifact of trying to get them to work well with all of the SpaceY engines, but the wobbly aspect of all of them (including the stackable one) never really sat well with me. The only thing I was able to do was set a really high breaking strength so that they could wobble without tearing the ship apart, but we don\u0027t have much control over joint stiffness other than to just crank up the mass of the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T22:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see.
