Also I think it\u0027s oonly fair if smaller cannons get a corresponding reduction in power, one of the main issues for smaller is that you\u0027ll mount them on smaller vehicles and the recoil is enough to tip the vehicle if not in reasonable limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill to do a rocket launcher but I feel Baha\u0027s got them covered, same with missiles, though I do fancy a huge ICBM on a truck launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned the guns/bombs/rockets all use different methods to make them work, and as Baha is buried in requests etc it may be a while before it\u0027s possible , Unless i do dip my toe into plugin development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso requests are always welcome, as the real world stuff only provides so much inspiration, unlike some I have no problem dealing with the fantasy and theoretical sci fi weapons, so bring it on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime how about the Kerminov KS1? yes they are working cannon shell ammo boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2hGKuFE.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/2hGKuFE.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is one of the things I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T20:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the heavy gunpod .50caliber and the minigun mount (the smaller one) 30mm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when I have tweak scale installed and use part mirroring one side is the normal size the mirror is 200%\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damaske","CreatedById":60029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T20:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy is the heavy gunpod .50caliber and the minigun mount (the smaller one) 30mm\u003Cp\u003EAlso when I have tweak scale installed and use part mirroring one side is the normal size the mirror is 200%\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a tweakscale bug and has NOTHING to do with this mod, as it happens to a lot of other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T00:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Damaske\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Damaske\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is a tweakscale bug and has NOTHING to do with this mod, as it happens to a lot of other parts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei suspected as much but haven\u0027t seen it with any other mods so i figured it mention it anyway\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T14:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi re tweakscale, as mentioned it causes lots of issues for lots of mods mainly due to the fact that mirroring in it\u0027s truest sense doesn\u0027t work in ksp hence, Lofis\u0027 mirror module, and even that\u0027s a work around as it requires specially constructed parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe caliber no particular reason, could be any caliber.

Generally they fire a rifle round IE a 7.62 x 39 NATO. This is what you find mounted on helicopters or Humvees. Or they fire large round like 20mm x 102mm such as in us navy Phalanx CIWS or 30mm x 173mm like in an A-10 warthog\u0027s Gau-8. Miniguns are used for volume fire not precision because if you have ten thousand rounds it doesn\u0027t matter how many times you miss if you get a few hits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost anti aircraft guns (which is what I assume the heavy gunpod is supposed to be) are larger 20-40mm rapid fire flack guns or even larger (88-150mm) flack cannons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany vehicles mount chain guns rather than mini guns because ammo is heavy and precision is more important oftentimes when using heavier calibers.
