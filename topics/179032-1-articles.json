You can then just put a Heat shield on the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the service bay I just used the SM-18 Service Module. Really the only thing I omitted was the bottom of it where it gets wider on the real one. Only reason being because I couldn\u0027t get it to look right with my fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T10:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep a 1.875m Soyuz capsule would be really nice to have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
