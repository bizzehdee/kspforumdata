I need a method to combine uncoupling and docking at the same time, because of an odd bug in KSP. And to solve this problem, I have to understand what exactly happens when I decouple and what exactly happens when I dock so that I can pack this into a single step. And to understand this, I want to build the function myself and see if after calling my function the game is still working or completly crashing (in this case I could assume, that I\u0027m missing something) ... does this explain it good enough? ... not? ok, why the hell do I want to \u0022decouple and dock\u0022 at the same time? ... fine, I\u0027ll explain it also. Have you ever tried to grab payload in your payload bay with a robotic arm and then \u0022decouple\u0022 it from the vessel that delivered it? ... what happens? ... right... everything blows up... or in the bether case the payload starts drifting away, because it loses the connection to your robotic arm... it even loses fix connections made with docking ports... you cannot do anything... it\u0027s even starting to fly through other parts and ships and you cannot grapple it anymore... impossible... to solve this problem, I thought, I\u0027d have to figure out what should be done by functions like uncouple and what is done\u00A0at the moment\u00A0and maybe I could write my own function doing it the way it should be... good enough explanation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-01T18:12:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2017 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rudolf Meier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
