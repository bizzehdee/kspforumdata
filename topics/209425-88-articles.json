After recently realizing I left off a zero in my net gain of cash this month I have made the decision to build a computer! And I have little experience with this.

Your PSU seems a bit overpowered for the build. Modern nVidia cards are very efficient and I think you could quite easily get away with 550W, although you might want to check your overclocking doesn\u0027t do something ridiculous to the power levels. However I would suggest going for a GTX 750 TI rather than the plain 750. The price difference isn\u0027t huge but the performance is apparently significantly better. The GTX 750 Ti is seemingly the best mid-range card around. But I can understand if you want to just stick with a 750, as when building a PC it\u0027s easy to get carried away with making every component slightly better, and before you know it you\u0027re at twice your budget. Maybe by getting a less powerful PSU you could afford it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am slightly surprised at the price. Your processor is a little better than mine,my graphics card isn\u0027t overclocked and you\u0027ve got an extra 1 TB, but it only cost \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3435, which is around $690. And that was around 8 months ago. I thought things in the USA were cheaper?
