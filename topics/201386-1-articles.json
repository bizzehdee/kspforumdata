My modpack project still exists, but is on hold until my motivation shifts back to it at some unpredictable point in the future. I have a few things planned and in various stages of progress as I learn to make parts and gradually get used to doing increasingly complicated things, so these plans will be realized starting with the simplest things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EVarious Greebles\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent focus at the moment. Shall consist of various nonfunctional simple structural parts for detailing purposes, as well as several structural adapters for specific parts (e.g. QBE to 0.625 payload adapter).

I\u0027ll be fleshing it out at some point and probably making a series of multiple command pods not based on real spacecraft, but that won\u0027t come until I\u0027ve finished a lot of the simpler parts for the greeble project. I wanted to get the gist of the model done now though. The orb is the pod itself, is 1.5m in diameter, and will probably have several different crew capacities paralleling Vostok/Voskhod. The lower aeroshell that the pod sits in has a 1.25m base and a maximum diameter of 1.875m, and will house batteries and (with appropriate mods installed) life support supplies (though not food, as this must will be stored in the pod). The upper aeroshell will have an integrated launch escape tower, though I have yet to model this. The part that sits on top of the orb is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack, which will house its own supply of monopropellant and will probably also have antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
