This is mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy space program is called Uuuokozetistan\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E(Ooh-oko-zet-ih-stan)\u003C/em\u003E Space Program, Uuuokozetistan being a fictional country that I created when I was a kid. The country was referenced in a couple of ways. For one, it existed when me and my friends drew \u0027drawing wars\u0027. (Large battles shown from the side view of stick figure soldiers, tanks going head to head in all out combat, usually drawn on the back of our algebra homework.) In order to be \u0027in\u0027 in this group of friends, you had to create your own country and have your own uniquely designed military. And my country, was of course, Uuuokozetistan. When I got older, I started (and I still do) draw and imagine these relics and items. Often with unusual or even magical properties, such as a three-spouted teapot that an only be used if you have three teacups and is meant to symbolize mother, father and child, and be used in that context. So I called it the \u0027Three spouted Teapot of Uuuokozetistan.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong Story Short, Uuuokozetistan is a weird country that I made up as a kid. Obviously, even the name sounds weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the flag I\u0027m using. The country has had a couple of different flags in the past. I was trying to make one that would look like the three U\u0027s, I wound up with this three colors meeting thing surrounded by a circle. I like it, and it\u0027s set to a transparency and looks pretty nice on the side of most of the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jecqoS3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jecqoS3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing, I probably won\u0027t be using TOO many screenshots. Uploading screenies and linking them can be annoying, particularly when there\u0027s a lot. So the format will be partially written with maybe a screenshot or two filling in where I was too lazy too. If someone requests I show off a particular rocket or something else \u003Cem\u003E(I doubt anyone will since most of my rockets suck pretty badly.)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not right at the beginning of my playthrough, because, though I haven\u0027t looked at too many other career diary threads, I know that people aren\u0027t the biggest fans of the ones that start off with a picture of an RT-5 stuck to an MK1 command pod. Particularly because this is HARDCORE career mode and for the most part, It was just a grind for me to get enough cash for space center upgrades. I\u0027m completely lost without having the VAB, Pad, Tracking Station, Astronaut Complex and Mission Center at T2. I need the VAB/LP upgrades to build anything reasonable. I need the Astronaut complex for EVAs and the Tracking Station/Mission Center mostly for Maneuver Nodes. (At this point, I already have all of those upgrades)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of that money grind was me doing part test contracts. Any part that needs to be tested on the launchpad, in flight or suborbital, I take. I have an unmanned rocket and I just strap whatever it is I need to test onto it and fly to the correct altitude. If it\u0027s suborbital, I pop the chutes and let Stage Recovery do the rest. If it\u0027s splash down, just fly an arc a kilometer or two out over the ocean and test there. I do my best to recover all of these rockets. Stingy? Yes. Effective? Yeah, Kinda. (That little bit of science you get from part tests make them even more worthwhile)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest was tourist contracts. I actually have a screenie of the beast I used to fly these. I called it the Pelican, since the Kerbs were stuffed inside like Sardines. Using the MK1 Passenger cabins, i made a pseudo command pod continuation with aggressive clipping into a structural fuselage. (I only use part clipping if one on the parts is structural or areodynamic, on the logic that structural parts can always be cut and shaped to fit onto/into things. Fuel tanks and what not cannot be clipped otherwise it would lose functionality.) I was surprised that this rocket was safe, reliable and under 30 parts thanks to some semi-OP gimballing SRBS that I think come from SpaceY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O9rx2Qj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O9rx2Qj.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have yet to lose any Kerbals. I\u0027ve been playing it pretty safe, either flying unmanned missions or making extra sure that the pod has a chute and a sheild, so all my orange suits are still alive. Now that I have tracking available, I can start getting rescue contracts. I usually like to Rescue out a Krew that owes my space program a life debt, and use them in favor of keeping the orange suits alive for particularly dangerous or groundbreaking missions. It\u0027s also a good way to get some funds and a bloated roster of kerbs. That will be my objective when I get on tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough today, i had my most ambitious mission yet. I had been trying to avoid leaving LKO, but I started getting some pretty tempting contracts for Minimus, and the only thing left to upgrade was the Astronaut Complex. The wonderful \u0027explore minimus\u0027, a Fly-by contract and an orbital survey graced my mission control screen. So instead of going to the Mun first like a normal person, I went straight for Minimus. I sent Jeb and Bob in the two man 1.25M caupsle. Originally I was planning on having them land, but fuel was really low by the time I got out there, and settled on an eccentric orbit that I could easily eject from. (I also unlocked the ability to go EVA midway through the mission, very useful for resetting my science experiments.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than not actually landing, the mission was a massive success. I still got a ton of science, and funds to burn from all the contracts. This second screenie is of Bob and Jeb on EVA for the first time in high kerbin orbit, and the only one I took from the mission. The big thing that I managed to unlock from this were solar panels. This means that I can start putting up satellites and flying longer-duration unmanned missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iNJnaPL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iNJnaPL.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo next time, hopefully less wordy, I plan on:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E-Going back to Minimus, and Landing!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E-Rescuing a Krew of recruits.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E-First orbital Rondevouz/Docking.

I had some leftover tourists still waiting for LKO, so I loaded up the Pelican one more time. Should have been a walk in the park, no? Well it turns out there was a staging error on the Pelican and it finally caught up to me. So I wound up dropping the orbital stage and finding myself sub-orbital with nothing I could do about it. Fortunatley for me, I was able to just reenter from suborbital and nobody was killed in a firey explosion. (So an expensive mistake, but thankfully not a deadly one...) \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a Hardcore Career so it is only a matter of time before there is a catastrophie that leads to some poor kerbal meeting an explodey demise...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ThUzh2U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ThUzh2U.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to re-fly that mission with fixed staging and somehow still pulled a slight profit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext order of business, I needed to rescue some kerbals so that when there IS a real disaster and someone DOES die, I have some backup ready to go. I built this rocket called the \u0027Guardian\u0027. A pretty simple liquid fueled Xfed orbiter with a probe body for auto pilot. It\u0027s not the prettiest rocket I\u0027ve seen, but it\u0027s cheap and it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time I did this, I also got that orbital Rendezvous contract out of the way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022npSthGt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/npSthGt.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did three of these rescues. Algan, Jenise and Misei became members of our Krew. But I needed a scientist, and I didn\u0027t get one right away. But I\u0027ll get back to that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Improvement Idea #1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA contract type to rescue a whole team of Kerbals.

I threw some sounding rockets into the ocean until I had enough science to unlock the RWPS antenna from Dmagic. This opens up this contract type called \u0027Magnetic Feild Survey\u0027, that requires a probe in an inclined orbit. I also have the ScanSat plugin and wanted to use the low-resolution mapper. The science payout for transmitting a complete map is pretty good as well. So with this, I can kill two birds with one stone. I can have a surveyor for contracts and make planetary maps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QjEZ161.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QjEZ161.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put one of these babies in orbit of Kerbin and the Mun and put them to work both mapping the magnetic feilds and making maps. For now, I don\u0027t have one around Minimus, but Minimus got plenty of love from me already today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TEZJxlN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TEZJxlN.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPathfinder 1 was the name of the first rocket that I sent to Minimus. Bob and Jeb were on it and they didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land. I decided this would be Pathfinder 2. Totally re-designed with a 2.5M launcher and 2-kerb lander. But wait, there\u0027s only bob in there. Well, I got one more rescue contract, but the catch is, the Kerbal is in orbit around Minimus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002221wj1kO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/21wj1kO.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after transferring out there on the world\u0027s most robust transfer stage (still halfway full of fuel), I picked up Haigela K. And she was another scientist! Yay! And I know it\u0027s a rescue contract, but Bob and Haigela had a job to do...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DEWol9x.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DEWol9x.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis of course meant Landing on Minimus. I think I went to about 6 different biomes. This screenie is from the Highlands, the third biome they visited if my recall serves. I remember it was just after I had set her down. I also had to go back to KSC, take the advance funds on a couple of meaty Duna/Ike contracts and upgrade the R and D center before I could start taking surface samples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after Biome-Hopping for awhile, Fuel got low and it was time to head home. I was seriously worried that I wouldn\u0027t have enough and would find myself in high orbit above Kerbin awaiting rescue or worse, sub orbital on Minimus with only a few minutes to save myself from crashing to my doom. Luckily, everything went according to plan. I had just enough to areocapture at Kerbin. (20km Peri) and came down east of KSC. No problems. Reentries never fail to make me nervous, particularly when there\u0027s a ton of science involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TQnn5Ct.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TQnn5Ct.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OeygPOU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OeygPOU.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission gave me an almost overwhelming amount of science. I gutted the 90-level nodes on the tree, and still has over a 1000 science points to burn. (Should I maybe take one of the strategies at the admin building and convert that to sweet, sweet funds) But that\u0027s a decision for another day...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I have contracts to do science and explore Duna and Ike, and the transfer window is only 74 days away now... I\u0027m not sure what the mission profile is going to be, but I suspect it will be one way, and unmanned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext time:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E-Send some Kerbs to the surface of the Mun, I have yet to land there...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E-I got a few more contracts, (Science Data, Flags) That are asking for me to go back to Minimus.

The astronaut complex is at double capacity. I\u0027m trying to get scientists so that I can crew labs.

I plan on taking a large crew out to Duna when the Transfer window rolls around. (And perhaps another crew to Eve.) Crew cabins are pretty light. (Hitchikers or MK1s), and if I can stuff enough Kerbals into my landers when I head out there, I can hold mass landings and bust out the 3, 4 and 5 star Kerbals. The only downside to this is that if something goes wrong in that sort of landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, I figured out a way to rescue 12 Kerbals at once. How is this possible, you may ask? Well with this abomination, it (sort of) is. Essentially this is a station with small spacecraft that can decouple, fly unmanned to the kerbal, and take them home. This saves me the trouble of having to launch a new rocket every single time I want to rescue a Kerbal. And for a busy college student like me, time is a valuable asset when playing this sort of game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LAjxkpr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LAjxkpr.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing I did was arrive at Eve. I\u0027m lacking a lot of screenies from this mission but it was quite a fun one, even if it was unmanned. I didn\u0027t meet the same fate when Areobraking here (since I didn\u0027t attempt to areobrake to begin with.) This sattelite paid a visit to silly lil Gilly before going into a polar Eve orbit and started scanning it.

Sure, it\u0027s farther than the Mun, but its gravity is more forgiving making it easier to land things like this... I also had a contract for a base there, so I could get paid a little extra. I then got a context contract to expand my outpost from the initial 10 crew capacity to 17. I then got another contract to expand the crew capacity to 25. There are only four kerbals at the base right now, so I can rest assured they have plenty of space to stretch inside that base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one problem I have is that (thanks to the memory ceiling), I don\u0027t have access to mods like USI Kolonization or PBS.

That bothers me more than it should.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did learn something. I had a strategy for base building that I would send the modules with no crew in them. Then send the crew in a separate lander capable of returning to Kerbin. (You can\u0027t see the lander in this pic so just imagine a really cool lander is near the base, OK?) This turned out to be smart as I had quite a few expensive mishaps getting this base launched and assembled. If I remember correctly, at least 3 rockets undergoing rapid unplanned disassembly during launch, so I ended up paying for two bases when I only got one. So I don\u0027t think the base was necessarily a profitable venture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we still have yet to kill a Kerbal.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both. A manned Duna mission would be tougher. More Dv to transfer and land on either body in the system, and the window is sooner giving me less time to prepare. But it would offer two bodies that I know I could land on. Eve window is a bit further out, but if I take a crew to Eve, I could for sure take a training mission to Gilly. But that\u0027s only one body, since I have neither the funds nor tech for a return from Eve\u0027s surface. (Granted, I get experience for both.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I might end up doing is sending smaller crews to both planets.
