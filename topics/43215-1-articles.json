If a Moon-Mapping Satellite is a Moon Mission, the GPS Sats and plenty of other satellites revolve around Earth, literally and figuratively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps one exception to this is the Moon-Mapper LRO and the ISS which mostly is devoted to experiments revolving around zero-weight and long-distance space travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...And of course there is Curiosity rover, which is a recent mission to Mars, and all of the satellites and landers deployed there in the past 15 years. (there aren\u0027t that many truthfully)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven some missions that don\u0027t literally revolve around the Earth still do figuratively. The B612 Foundation\u0027s Sentinel Spacecraft may be in a heliocentric orbit looking for asteroids, but this is done to protect life on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s stuff WAY out there, like Cassini-Huygens, Voyager I and Voyager II, and the most recent New Horizons. (Well, Voyagers are not really recent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could argue that even the Moon Missions are Earth missions because the Moon Orbits around the Earth, is made of the Earth, and the missions were done for politics on Earth more so than for science on the Moon (well, aside from Apollo 15-17).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the fact that the LEO is barely even space, it\u0027s certainly not deep-space, that would be out past the Moon. (Even so I hear it is utterly amazing to EVA using a jetpack around Earth because when you let go there is nothing at all between you and the Earth, and you just don\u0027t get that feeling in Kerbal Space Program.
