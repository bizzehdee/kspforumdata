It would be nice if there was an official parts pack so I could make and release things legitmately. Just the structural /fuselage/adapters MK3 not the engines etc. Thank you for your time.\n\nHere it shows one of your ramps combined with Airplane Plus Mk3S1.5 formfactor.\n\n![K7XU63z.png](https://i.imgur.com/K7XU63z.png)![6T1c0Ju.png](https://i.imgur.com/6T1c0Ju.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-23T05:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2021 05:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by ColdJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Staticalliam7","CreatedById":216180,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-30T17:04:27Z","Content":"Finally!
