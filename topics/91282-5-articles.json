It won\u0027t be visitable. Most of the equipment inside will by permanently destroyed by the vacuum and temperature. Gravity gradient is a pretty weak force for station-keeping, so pretty much anything could mess it up, including a leak from a pressurized fluid line or an MMOD strike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept for melting it down for scrap metal in 100 years, I really don\u0027t see what the point would be. And I\u0027m pretty sure that it takes more dV to boost it into a 15Mx15M orbit than deorbit over the pacific.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T04:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, yeah, 15M is a bit much. 5M would be only a touch more fuel than a clean de-orbit, though.

Yeah, there\u0027s a chance that it will expire or get knocked out of alignment by something. Might even have a leak that will cause it to spin up until it falls apart. But if it doesn\u0027t, you\u0027d get to keep using the station for whatever observation and comm caps it would still have unmanned, and it might make a nice museum piece some day. I\u0027d like to think we\u0027ll get capability to retrieve some old space ships in the future the same way we do with sunken ships today. Why throw out something that\u0027s such a big part of space exploration history? That\u0027s really the main point here.
