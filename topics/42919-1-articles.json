I\u0027ve visited all planets within the Kerbol system, and I\u0027ve built robust rockets that have served me well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when it comes to planes, I fail terribly. It used to be that I crashed every single plane (even non-spaceplanes) that I built immediately, and that\u0027s if I managed to get it off the runway. So I stuck with rockets, and I still had a blast with KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with all this talk of Career Mode and \u0027economics\u0027, I\u0027ve started to waste fewer spent ships and build at least semi-reusable spacecraft, such as interplanetary ships that can make multiple trips. I\u0027ve even made a replica of NASA\u0027s future Orion MPCV and SLS for short deep space missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I feel perfectly fine with launching a space station module or interplanetary starship aboard one of my heavy lift rockets, I feel a bit of guilt when using a massive rocket to simply transfer 3 kerbals or so to my orbital stations. Even downsizing the rocket to the bare minimum delta-v required to rendezvous with an orbital station, I still feel bad about returning only the crew capsule to Kerbin, dumping the orbital maneuvering system and the lifter rocket along the way. Now, I\u0027m not the type to start reusing every spent stage or devoting all my time into SSTO designs, but I felt that something more economical might be in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do, until I saw the recent news footage of DreamChaser\u0027s testing. I said to myself: \u0022Say, that looks like something cool I could build in KSP!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I looked it up, and learned that it was a Commercial Crew Transport vehicle, which launches vertically and lands horizontally on a runway, sort of like the Shuttle but much smaller and focused on crew, rather than cargo. So I went to the Space Plane Hanger, and built myself this beauty:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/uy7yyx3af/screenshot198.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot198.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it looked at least something like the real DreamChaser, and so I tested it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: it flew like a brick, smashing into the ground whenever I tried to land. The reason behind this, even though I wouldn\u0027t figure it out until much later, was that after burning all the fuel in its tanks like it would during normal orbital operations, the centre of mass shifted too far in front of the centre of lift. While a good plane does in fact have the CoM in front of the CoL, if it\u0027s too far ahead the plane wants to pitch down a lot and makes aerial maneuvering quite difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried another design. And another. I even loaded up my few successful spaceplanes to see if I could learn any tips from their designs. Nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was very close to giving up on this venture, and just continuing to use expendable launchers for my crew vehicles. However, something inside me made me keep going at it and eventually it occurred to me to look up the mass of the MK3 cockpit I was using, which is actually quite huge. So, diverging from the DreamChaser design I was emulating, I built something like to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s11.postimg.org/6acve2ktv/screenshot232.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot232.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a change, my design actually flew! Not only did it fly, but it handled like a dream! Its small wings were a boon for putting it on top of a rocket (I had built a \u0027lifting body\u0027 by clipping a pair of wings inside the cockpit), and it danced around KSC like a small bird in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, the moment had come. I didn\u0027t want to have to tailor the delta-v requirements of a lifter to this craft, so I simply slapped it on my \u0027Moho II\u0027 launcher and took off to a station that badly needed crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s18.postimg.org/edgu3cvrt/screenshot240.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot240.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvousing is old hat for me now, and even though the docking port is placed on the rear of the ship, I handled the maneuver without much trouble at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/bahzyuqqv/screenshot241.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot241.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when the crew had been transferred over, it was time to complete the most crucial part of the mission--return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, I had only tested the integrity of the plane in subsonic flight around KSC. I had absolutely no idea how it would perform coming back in through the atmosphere at several times the speed of sound. (Fortunately, KSP doesn\u0027t model supersonic flight much different than subsonic flight; good thing I don\u0027t have FAR installed) Regardless, upon the deorbit burn, I was a little nervous; as all my time and energy put into designing this thing would be useless if it didn\u0027t deliver on its promise of reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/6yte9ujtz/screenshot245.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot245.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, I was able to keep it pointing prograde during reentry, and nothing broke off (always a plus!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/gea1fe54b/screenshot247.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot247.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had carefully set up my burn so that I could hopefully land on the runway at KSC, so that the techs could just refuel the ship and place it back on top of another rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/ccsy9qctn/screenshot249.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot249.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason behind my nervousness was that I had never successfully landed a plane on the KSC runway before, let alone brought one in from orbit. I kept my cool though, and gently nudged the ship onto a landing trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/uiai1j1pn/screenshot250.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot250.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnbelievably, I actually managed to set down in the centre of the runway! After landing successfully, I felt like someone in NASA\u0027s Mission Control after a big mission like Curiosity has landed--I let out a big whoop and was so happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it is these moments where one accomplishes something huge like this that make KSP the game it is. You build and fly your dreams, which can take on any form, and often are things that you could have never imagined yourself doing when you first started playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you SQUAD for making such an amazing game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T23:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd congrats about landing them back safely. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T23:39:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats, I know how you feel with space planes.
