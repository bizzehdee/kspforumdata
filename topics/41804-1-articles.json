Bought the game three days ago and have been glued to it since. Which probably isn\u0027t productive, but there we go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight. I know that I need to balance my mass with my thrust to get my ship into space and do cool things with it. So far I\u0027ve been able to successfully put a small craft into orbit and got a lander on the Mun. However, I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back. My design was based on the video tutorial by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvdAZFq1ik\u0026amp;hd=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epebblegarden\u003C/a\u003E, with the difference being I used a 3-man pod rather than a 1-man pod. The difference in mass was clearly the issue, given that my fuel usage was relatively similar to the tutorial but I didn\u0027t have enough thrust to achieve escape velocity from the Mun. Which is most unfortunate for Jebadiah Kerbin\u0027s mother...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the actual question after the ramble: \u003Cstrong\u003Eis there a way to check the total mass of your vehicle?\u003C/strong\u003E Or is this something I have to estimate from the parts I\u0027ve bolted on? I\u0027ve got a rough idea of how much thrust/fuel I need to move a something, but I\u0027m not yet experienced enough to optimise this for my payload. Of course, every time I add a fuel tank, I add mass, which required more thrust, which requires an engine, which requires more fuel, etc. I\u0027m sure through trial and error I can calculate these ratios, but it would be much easier if I could tell quickly my total mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help on this would be appreciated.
