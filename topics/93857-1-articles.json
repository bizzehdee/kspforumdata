Especially if you want to OWN Duna, with colonies and bases everywhere, as opposed to being confined to the relative few and isolated depressions. I mean, what\u0027s the point of being able to fly there if you can\u0027t land anywhere but in a canyon? That means you\u0027ll have to drive for hours to get anywhere. But being able to land out in the dune fields is complicated not only by their hilliness but also because that terrain averages about 2500-3000m elevation, which is about equivalent to 16km on Kerbin in terms of air density. Yet you have to sustain controllable flight out there at no more than about 35m/s to land safely in the dunes. This requires an obscenely huge amount of wing for very little weight/payload, and that in turn makes the plane difficult to get off of Kerbin to start with. It\u0027s all difficult enough to be worth a challenge thread (see my sig for the link).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3.
