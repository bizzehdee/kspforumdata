Love the concept of this mod. Played around with the drive in Sandbox; definitely a keeper. I\u0027ve never used CTT before (it might just convince me into even more of RoverDude\u0027s mod family), but I also really like the idea. I\u0027m having a few tech tree concerns though. First, if you just use the stock tree, the warp drive never can be unlocked. Is this intentional?

However, with my other mods installed, the 3-5 nodes (depending on path taken) prior to Ultra High Energy Physics (unlocks warp drive) are totally empty. I don\u0027t mind make warp drives super end-game, but is there something I am missing to flesh out the prereq nodes a little better? Are those KSPI items that flesh those out?
