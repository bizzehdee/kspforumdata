I also thought while learning about the universe why we have the dimensions we do and thought that maybe there is an infinite amount of dimensions, that didn\u0027t have order, just like pi, i thought that our universe just so happened to form in an area of 3 space dimensions and one time dimension.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other day i bothered to research string theory and found it follows similar premises to these to separate ideas i formulated, i was pretty stunned at how close i was with some of my other thoughts as well, it helps you to see what the scientist were thinking when they came up with such theorems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T19:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EString theory is a direct result of math though iirc. Don\u0027t assume that because some of your ideas are similar to those in science that the scientists had the same thought process to get there. Often coming up with similar ideas is coincidence (see also: Bible apologists who point to all the \u0022amazing\u0022 scientific theories the bible predicted).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also not sure how close you are to string theory as I don\u0027t really know a whole lot about string theory.
