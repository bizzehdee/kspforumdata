shout-out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not an Aerospace Engineer.\u00A0 I\u0027m a Planetary Scientist.\u00A0 So I help to design robotic missions to other planets at the front end, and to use the data from them at the back end to learn new things about planets.\u00A0 I work with the engineers who actually do the designing, providing requirements, and evaluating their ideas for whether or not they can answer our questions.\u00A0 In the end, then, I write the first section of a giant Discovery or New Frontiers mission proposal and contribute obliquely to the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means in the end though is that while there are some jobs designing rockets, there are many more for engineers designing \u003Cstrong\u003Epayloads\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Planetary missions, helioscience missions, astrophysics space telescopes, Earth-observing satellites.\u00A0 And that\u0027s just within NASA\u0027s Science Mission Directorate.\u00A0 There\u0027s also designing crewed vehicles and their support, communications satellites, LEO constellations, GPS systems, and the like.\u00A0 So there can be more to rocket science than the first 8 minutes of fire!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI myself have always known that I wanted to study planets, since I was like 4 years old.\u00A0 And yeah:\u00A0 it\u0027s awesome!\u00A0 There are always those parts of the job that are less fun, like planning your budget from now until 2038 and answering an endless stream of email.\u00A0 But I don\u0027t think that there\u0027s a way out of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour first step is to get an undergraduate degree in an appropriate major.\u00A0 Engineering works.\u00A0 Elon Musk majored in Physics, though, remember, which I think gives you a better sense not just of how to build things but rather of what things haven\u0027t been built before but COULD be built.\u00A0 I was an Astronomy major, which ended up being nearly indistinguishable from a physics major.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there you can get a better sense of what to do next, but it\u0027s important to spend your time as an undergrad seeking out opportunities, be it at NASA, or private companies, or other universities.\u00A0 Get a sense for what your job would actually be like, and then figure out whether you want to do a mid-course correction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grew up in suburban St. Louis, Missouri myself, so there\u0027s no impediment for contributing no matter where you\u0027re from so long as you\u0027ve got the background!\u00A0 Good luck, and let me know if you have other questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote

himself an engineer because he owns the company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt my company, if you get an engineering degree, you get hired as an engineer. If you get a physics degree, or a math degree, or some non-engineering degree, you get hired as a tech. And it\u0027s much better to be an engineer than a tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if we\u0027re talking PhDs or something, that\u0027s entirely different. A PhD in physics is very, very different than an undergrad degree in physics. But if you want to be an engineer, I highly recommend you get an undergrad degree that says \u0022engineer\u0022. Because at least for some employers, that makes a difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alternate method besides either getting an engineering degree or founding Paypal is to pass a Professional Engineer exam. All states have them, in various disciplines. First you pass an exam called \u0022Fundamentals Of Engineering\u0022 (aka the EIT exam, for \u0022engineer in training\u0022). Then you pass the PE exam in your specialty. This is required if you want to go into business for yourself as an engineer. But if you have an engineering degree and want to work at an engineering company, it\u0027s not so important to pass this exam. (In some engineering disciplines it\u0027s more important than in others.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/what-pe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/what-pe\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-05T08:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2018 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
