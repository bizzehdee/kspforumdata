It seems a bit silly that with no fairing everything works fine. Is there any way to mitigate this?\n\nNot sure why you think they cause drag.. The only problem I see with them is that the mass is in the coupler and not the fairings. So when you pop the fairings you keep the same amount of mass.\n\nDon\u0027t use fins. They are generally not a good idea. Start your Gravity turn before or around 100 M/s (speed) and keep your target recticle in the little yellow circle that is droping (called the prograde marker).\n\nIf it falls to fast (IE can\u0027t get space) you started the gravity turn to soon. If it falls to slow and you end up spinning out or entering orbit with a massive -400 PE.. Then you started it to late.\n\nPractice.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"n.b.z.","CreatedById":130888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:42:16Z","Content":"Use big fins - I recommend aircraft wing parts.\n\nAfter a bit getting used to the new aero, my rockets fly fine now, and are much more fun than ever before.

The rule of thumb that I\u0027m finding for 1.0 is there\u0027s no such thing as too much control authority. Fins are your friends.

(Because in real life it all depends on the actual shape of the draggy bits sticking out into the flow. Fairings often can be so much better in Cd that they help a lot.)"}]}
