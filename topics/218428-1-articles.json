Maybe not for simple repairs, but for build mode I think they have to be. As far as repairs, you first equip the repair kit of your kerbal, i.e., remove the parachute from the inventory and add 1-4 repair kits. Then if you EVA near the broken part, you can right click it and repair it if you have enough repair kits in the inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor things like batteries, I don\u0027t think those can break in the standard game(?) so maybe the mod has different procedures. I would think you just go to build mode, install a new battery on the station, and remove the old broken one though. When you\u0027re in build mode, you need to have the container with the spare parts close enough that its inventory shows up in build mode, plus the kerbal needs to be close enough to where you\u0027re going to attach it on the station. I\u0027ve found getting the kerbal, the broken craft, and the repair craft all close enough to be the biggest challenge in satellite repair missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll these things said, I\u0027ve never used DangIt, so possibly there are different procedures required by that mod. It\u0027s worth checking out the mod page to see what it says.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
