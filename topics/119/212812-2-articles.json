And yes, \u0022Funds\u0022 are being dropped in favour of resources. Science is linked to tech progression, however how resources work and how we collect them - especially when in early game, when we have none - is well and truly anyone\u0027s guess at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow I see it working is that we start in a barebones, un-upgraded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E - which is essentially our starting colony on Kerbin. Whether or not there will be others, or we can build others, is also anyone\u0027s guess. Though from Matt Lowne\u0027s interview with Nate and the dude whose name escapes me (used to be a modder, now works on KSP2), I get the impression there will be up to 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-type areas on Kerbin during Multiplayer so potentially, this will be mirrored across the Exploration mode. But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur initial tech will likely based on the same tech we start with in KSP1, though I would like to see a \u0022pre-manned rocket\u0022 beginning (such as Sounding Rockets) - perhaps as an in-game \u0022hidden tutorial\u0022 on managing craft and resources in Exploration mode. I\u0027d also like to see more of a focus on unmanned flight first (mimicking our beginnings of space flight) before we start throwing Kerbals up there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will likely be encouraged to explore Kerbin itself initially - to locate basic resources and to conduct basic sciences, allowing us to unlock more advanced technology and upgrade our facilities before the \u0022space race\u0022 starts in earnest. I believe there will be a narrative interwoven into Exploration mode, to get us to focus on setting goals for reasons as opposed to \u0022Let\u0027s just do this thing because we can\u0022 - I believe the easter eggs (such as the Mun arch) will play some part in this narrative. When we get to the Mun, we begin the process of exploration, survey, colony building and resource gathering - not all at once, we\u0027ll need to gather science data, acquire the technology and resources to support them first. Getting to the Mun and Minmus are the early game - we break into the mid-game with Duna and Eve... Though because of Eve\u0027s unique properties, I would prefer that maybe Eve was left for later. Before finally setting our sights on Dres, Jool and Eeloo - though, as teased in the trailer, I see Jool being a sort of end-game ship production area for interstellar vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think a Life Support-esque mechanic will play a part in KSP2 though, from what I\u0027ve read in the Discord and such, it won\u0027t (or at least there\u0027ll be an option to) be life and death, but it will affect the Kerbal\u0027s performance (however it will work in KSP2) if their life support is low. Due to this, long duration manned missions will, or may, not be advised early - relying on unmanned probes, landers and rovers initially (again, mirroring our own space exploration).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that, as we explore these planets - whether by orbital satellites, landers or rovers - we will come across unique sites/locations/points/areas we will need to research over time and discover unique resources to extract, necessitating the construction of colonies on each planet and moon we visit to continue these. For example, if the Mun arch does indeed play a role in a narrative in Exploration mode, then our initial \u0022science\u0022 at/around/on the site gleans very little progress - yet when we visit with more advanced equipment and/or more often, and/or set up a colony devoted to studying this artifact we gain larger chunks of actionable \u0027science\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time we have the technology to go interstellar, I believe there will be a narrative reason - in addition to our desire to simply explore - for us to go to Debdeb (confirmed to be the first star system added). By this time, we will also have a number of colonies across the Kerbolar system and be extracting the various resources we need to build the rockets we want. From what I also understand, as we discover these resources we, as players, will initially need to do the heavy lifting to extract these resources however at some point we are able to automate these - though what that looks like I do not know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will, eventually, be able to build ships in orbit, or at orbital colonies/space stations - so we\u0027ll need significant resources and automation to achieve this - especially given the scale of the interstellar ships we\u0027ll need to design and the sheer size of the parts we must attach to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m like you, \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
