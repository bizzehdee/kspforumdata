Intercept was still hiring people and figuring out how to WFH on KSP2 in early 2020, and the EA released in early 2023.

We had a CTO who saw the writing on the wall with the pandemic back in January and started preparing for it. We had 1/3rd of the studio running a WFH trial a week before state lockdown order came in. We weren\u0027t as ready as we wanted to be, but far better prepared than most other studios. Engineers, designers, and most of the artists already had a console hooked up to their work PC set up to stream across the network (and over VPN). And our game was releasing for Stadia, so we got Google to provide access to everyone at the studio, so that our QA could run using the Stadia build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe still lost equivalent of a few weeks of work as we figured out how to adjust our work processes, sorting out some of the access problems, finding ways to deal with latency, expanding our VPN bandwidth, etc. Studios that didn\u0027t prepare in advance? Most of them lost a month of work with a large chunk of the studio being unable to work at all. It was a very chaotic time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFactoring all of this in, if we were to compare this to KSP2 project being started at an established studio, the equivalent KSP2 start date would be around early summer of 2020. So from then to February of 2023 is how long Intercept had to work on Early Access. A little over 2.5 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-14T11:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224389461\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715627517\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe quote was specifically \u00227 years, 70 people,\u0022 which implies that they had 70 people working on the game for 7 years.

The issue was that the game got heavily rescoped, sending dev cycle back to pre-production, and very little ususally survives that. Code would have been restructured, art pipelines changed... A lot of the ST assets would basically only be good as placeholders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what we saw was consistent with that. UI and audio work carried over. Some 3D models from ST pre-alpha footage have resurfaced in some of the early teasers. But most of the ships we were shown upclose got a visuals uplift, materials changed, and planets were completely redone. I can only speculate about the code, but it sounds like ST was sticking close to KSP1 code, and what went out with KSP2 EA was drastically different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, I am pretty sure that all work was transferred over, and relatively little of it could be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-14T15:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224389677\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715698101\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022193460\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flush Foot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, Flush Foot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho said they were authorized to \u0027relocate\u0027 it?

In reality, we know that ST would only start work in late 2017 or early 2018, and were off the project by late 2019. Intercept was still hiring people and figuring out how to WFH on KSP2 in early 2020, and the EA released in early 2023. So Intercept had less than 3 years to scale up the team, redesign the project, sort through stuff ST built to see what they\u0027re cleaning up and what they\u0027re throwing away, and building KSP2 almost from scratch to release Early Access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E. I don\u0027t think people who never made a game realize how much was really done and how little time there really was for actual work or how little of ST\u0027s progress would transfer over to the new team with the new scope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does help that a chunk of the team at Intercept came out from ST, so they were at least onboarded and could hit the ground running, but then we also had the pandemic which would have pretty much nullified that advantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some context, I was working at a AAA studio in early 2020. We had a CTO who saw the writing on the wall with the pandemic back in January and started preparing for it. We had 1/3rd of the studio running a WFH trial a week before state lockdown order came in. We weren\u0027t as ready as we wanted to be, but far better prepared than most other studios. Engineers, designers, and most of the artists already had a console hooked up to their work PC set up to stream across the network (and over VPN). And our game was releasing for Stadia, so we got Google to provide access to everyone at the studio, so that our QA could run using the Stadia build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe still lost equivalent of a few weeks of work as we figured out how to adjust our work processes, sorting out some of the access problems, finding ways to deal with latency, expanding our VPN bandwidth, etc. Studios that didn\u0027t prepare in advance? Most of them lost a month of work with a large chunk of the studio being unable to work at all. It was a very chaotic time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFactoring all of this in, if we were to compare this to KSP2 project being started at an established studio, the equivalent KSP2 start date would be around early summer of 2020. So from then to February of 2023 is how long Intercept had to work on Early Access.
