It has liquid water-filled craters, some lakes, and a Kerbin-like atmosphere. It also has a ring system in which its moon is forming. The rings themselves were a product of a collision with another planet, creating rings from the debris. This planet recently had undergone planetary impact, hence the rings and the moon, but has since cooled down to normal temperature. This impact mirrors Earth\u2019s collision with Theia. Likely had a temperature, mass, and radius similar to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonk - Donk is a moon of Gurdamma, currently in the process of gathering material from Gurdamma\u2019s rings to form further.

Due to tidal distortion from their distance to each other, they have many spots with magma, due to a distorted surface. The rest of the these planets\u2019 surface is has a brown and cratered surface. The surface of rask and rusk is seen to have lava lakes and rivers due to the tidal forces, making them both extremely hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerda - Verda is a potentially habitable world with liquid water oceans and a breathable atmosphere.

It is likely to be much brighter than Kerbol, and possibly more massive.

Estimated to be only 5-50 million years old, Debdeb is a relatively young star. It has a reddish appearance, meaning it could possibly be a K type star. It will also likely have a visible planetary disk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCharr - Charr is a heat blasted rocky world, rich in iron.

It has liquid water-filled craters, some lakes, and a Kerbin-like atmosphere. It also has a ring system in which its moon is forming. The rings themselves were a product of a collision with another planet, creating rings from the debris. This planet recently had undergone planetary impact, hence the rings and the moon, but has since cooled down to normal temperature. This impact mirrors Earth\u2019s collision with Theia. Likely had a temperature, mass, and radius similar to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonk - Donk is a moon of Gurdamma, currently in the process of gathering material from Gurdamma\u2019s rings to form further. It looks very much like our own moon, with a gray and cratered appearance. It likely has similar heat, mass, and radius of the Mun, although slightly less radius and mass, as some mass is still in the rings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLapat - Lapat is a rocky planet with a rusty, red surface, along with vegetation and a blue, cloudy atmosphere.

It also has two moons, Noj and Merbel.

Due to tidal distortion from their distance to each other, they have many spots with magma, due to a distorted surface. The rest of the these planets\u2019 surface is has a brown and cratered surface. The surface of rask and rusk is seen to have lava lakes and rivers due to the tidal forces, making them both extremely hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\uFFFC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVerda - Verda is a potentially habitable world with liquid water oceans and a breathable atmosphere.
