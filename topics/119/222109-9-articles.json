If you\u0027re worried about the tediousness of a new science save, you can just add extra science points at the start- or play sandbox, but it seems like you want some form of progression. And if you want to hurl a spaceplane through an atmosphere in a pillar of fire there wouldn\u0027t necessarily be anything stopping you. But for the sake of mission planning and science gameplay depth I\u0027d appreciate being able to gather that data and make it useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate, I\u0027m not saying the game should withhold parts from you until you\u0027ve performed a very specific action like sampling an atmosphere. To keep up with the example, I\u0027m saying you shouldn\u0027t know the atmosphere\u0027s characteristics until you\u0027ve sampled it. No in-atmo trajectory display*, no parachute planning*, no resource survey, etc. But if you have played the game before and want to just go for it, then by all means do so!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003EAssuming these features will be in the game someday.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly, I haven\u0027t thought it through. Perhaps there\u0027s something obvious that I\u0027m missing. Currently, we get Science Points for doing science actions. So would the list of things I just laid out also be purchased with Science Points? I suppose not right? We get resource overlays in KSP1 by using the orbital scanner, not by doing \u0022experiments\u0022... so perhaps the stuff I\u0027m wanting is instead provided to the player once they\u0027ve used the part that would yield that information? And those parts are unlocked using the science system that is now implemented? I don\u0027t necessarily have any problems with that.

The game should no-more land for you than it should design boosters for you. That exploratory process IS the game. Many of these learned processes though gain from the option of automation once they become old hat. We can save pre-designed booster and launch assemblies and re-use them. We should be able to automate re-supply missions to colonies after a proof-run. The sweet spot is taking the time to learn and achieve these kinds of tasks and then earn the ability to automate them so they don\u2019t become mindnumbingly repetitive.
