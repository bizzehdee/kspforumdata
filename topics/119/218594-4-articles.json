around.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn addition it took me 5 min to figure out how to check how much fuel is still remaining in a tank, this fairly proves that the entire interface has been changed

This was beneficial in being able to manipulate manuever nodes while not needing to be pressured to do so quickly. This does not exist in this build and needs to be put back in ASAP. This is made even more problematic by issue #3...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Manuever nodes are just not great right now. You create a node, but then have to click on it to get the option to start manipulating. You have to then click off the node and onto the PE or AP to see what value your manuever has been mvoed to, then click back to the node to adjust. Repeating this more than once is a test of sanity. This makes quick noding impossible as it stands and is game breaking for me at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Quality of Life issue #1.

Minor issue, but someone should have picked up on that in Beta.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. The manuever node can sometimes be wildly incorrect. A node set to arrive in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 25km, when exectued had the arrival at 120km. Missed it by that much. And no it wasn\u0027t because of an underburn. Everything ran smoothly, however it stated it was at 25km on the readout below the navball, but only as approaching the AP did it update to 120km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Plane control surfaces seem glitchy. At one point all the control surfaces were \u0022spazzing out\u0022 (no other way to describe accurately). In addition to this having a surface actually lift a plane seems much more difficult with the current build than in KSP1.
