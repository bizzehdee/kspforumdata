Plume expansion is almost solely a function of nozzle geometry (fixed) and ambient pressure (dynamic), and so for any given engine the plume will expand and change its efficiency strictly as a function of pressure, assuming ideal flow and no reverse flow shenanigans. That being said, I think you may have your terminology wrong, and not quite understand the fundamentals, but dw its a super common mistake so I\u0027ll explain it here! The term \u0022Underexpanded\u0022, \u0022Overexpanded\u0022 or \u0022perfectly expanded\u0022 is actually somewhat deceptive compared to the actual shape you see: When a fluid flows through a bell nozzle like a rocket engine, as the ExitArea(AE)/ThroatArea (AT) increases the velocity of the gas rises with it. This is why sea level engines tend to have smaller AE/AT than vacuum optimized engines: for a given throat area, a bigger exit area means a faster exhaust which means higher efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, as this velocity rises, the internal pressure of the gas actually begins to drop off rapidly. If the internal pressure of the flow matches the surrounding (ambient) pressure, say at sea level, then we call it \u0022perfectly expanded\u0022 because it is at exactly the right pressure to be ejected in a perfectly straight line out of the back of the engine. However, if the engine bell is too large/small, things get wonky. If the engine bell is too large, the internal gas pressure drops below the surrounding ambient pressure (IE, the gas has \u0022expanded\u0022 too much), which causes the surrounding atmosphere pushes inwards towards the flow and causes the classic \u0022shock diamond\u0022 effect\u0022 seen in an overexpanded flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversely, if the engine bell is too small, the internal pressure of the gas will be considerably higher than the surrounding atmosphere, which will cause the exhaust to push \u0022outwards\u0022 and create that classic expansion plume I attached earlier. This is exactly why plumes go from over-\u0026gt; perfect-\u0026gt; under when you see a rocket rise through the atmosphere; as the pressure drops, the relationship between the internal pressure (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) and the ambient pressure (Pa) goes from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026lt;Pa to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E=Pa to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026gt;Pa.

That being said, this scenario where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026gt;Pa is called \u0022under expansion\u0022 because it is not expanded *enough* to eject its fuel optimally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can probably tell its a very weird concept, but TLDR an \u0022Under-Expanded Nozzle\u0022 has a higher exit pressure than its surroundings, causing that outward expansion you saw in my post. And while yes, that effect will be dramatized further in space, that doesnt change the fact that it will still be under expanded in a vacuum. (Not to be rude, just trying to be helpful) So, I was correct in calling it under expanded at sea level in my previous post, as the engine they had shown was clearly underexpanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Why Nozzles On Vacuum Optimized Rocket Engines Are Bigger Than Those On Sea  Level Engines - Headed For Space\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.03\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://headedforspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Under-Expanded-Ambient-Overexpanded-Nozzle.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as a heads up, I take my profession very seriously, and while im sure you meant no offense, starting a comment with \u0022As an aerospace engineer, you should know...\u0022 could comes across as quite demeaning.

Since the flow is supersonic, having a low/zero pressure boundary causes the flow to turn, causing all sorts of annoying-to-model oblique shocks. To make it worse, this changes drastically based on the fuel mix and exit characteristics, which makes answering all of these questions in one go tricky, but I will do my best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately after the fuel leaves the diverging portion of the nozzle, we have extremely high pressure gas, moving super fast. Since the surroundings are much lower pressure, the edges of this flow are bend outwards, causing an oblique shock and large pressure \u0026amp; velocity losses. These ripple out as we move further from the exit, and pretty quickly that high pressure region starts to drop off\u00A0 to (what I am going to call) a medium pressure region shown in red/yellow/green. As more and more of this flow turns outwards, it reaches a point where there is almost no pressure in the center, which causes the flow to turn back in on itself, creating a new (smaller) high pressure region. This continues until the flow is no longer moving supersonic and is as a steady equilibrium, but I honestly don\u0027t know how long it takes to reach that point, and that would be on an engine by engine basis. It is important to note that while it is expanding and supersonic, the exhaust velocity is actually still increasing, since the \u0022upstream\u0022 flow has a higher pressure than the \u0022downstream\u0022 flow. This is where that magic acceleration comes from that causes the classic curve, basically converting high Pressure, Temperature, and Density into velocity. That being said, as it approaches equilibrium, the outer shape of the flow at \u0026amp; beyond will slow to almost nothing, and will be functionally linear (or conical if you\u0027d prefer it in 3-d). While it will still be slightly changing in trajectory, it will be extremely small, practically unnoticeable, so its totally fair to call it linear/Conical as y-\u0026gt; infinity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to the internal pressure pushing the flow outwards, you are absolutely right, and technically the flow can even bend backwards during initial ejection:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Typical plume flow regimes of thruster in vacuum. | Download Scientific  Diagram\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 width=\u0022416\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seung-Baek-11/publication/253683878/figure/fig1/AS:651923199901705@1532442011280/Typical-plume-flow-regimes-of-thruster-in-vacuum_Q640.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note, this is just the initial expansion, in the 0-0.1D distance from the engine, this is not representative of the entire shape)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, the more the flow bends, the higher the shock, and so the slower the flow actually will be travelling in these extreme backflow regions. in some situations, its so sharp that the flow literally cannot turn that far without having an absurd number of oblique shocks, and so it\u0027s practically stopped by the time it does so. To make it worse, those edge cases are sporadic, and fluctuate a ton with the pressure, so while yes they are technically there, they are so slow and so small that theyre basically non-existent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had to guess, the reason that high altitude test shows such a perfectly straight line is twofold: 1) I suspect it has been sized to *not* have a plume, just to fit within the test bed without burning it, and 2) it likely does expand like this a bit further down, and we just cant see it because the camera view is too short.

That being said, streamlines can be misleading, especially when youre dealing with supersonics and visuals. Any time a supersonic flow turns, even if it is 0.0001 degrees, there are shocks, which lead to a massive pressure drop and deceleration of the flow, which leads me to believe that these streamlines are likely not representative of what it would actually look like, but I cant say for sure so I wont say anything concrete. All of the information I have given so far is just based on my current understanding of supersonic flow, but I am still not convinced it would not be parabolic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother potential hole in that thread you sent is the strange behavior from transitional -\u0026gt; Vacuum.

That being said, streamlines can be misleading, especially when youre dealing with supersonics and visuals. Any time a supersonic flow turns, even if it is 0.0001 degrees, there are shocks, which lead to a massive pressure drop and deceleration of the flow, which leads me to believe that these streamlines are likely not representative of what it would actually look like, but I cant say for sure so I wont say anything concrete. All of the information I have given so far is just based on my current understanding of supersonic flow, but I am still not convinced it would not be parabolic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother potential hole in that thread you sent is the strange behavior from transitional -\u0026gt; Vacuum.

I have no idea though, that is a total shot in the dark cuz I know very little about those electric magic machines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nooooh more fun things to read, well guess I know what im doing instead of going to sleep tonight....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad I could help! Its a really complicated topic so i was honestly expecting to do a terrible job haha. But yeah, that\u0027s really the best answer, it depends on SOOO much, but generally its a bell that turns conical, with the size of the bell being dependent on the exit pressure of the flow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick question: I didnt see any that fanned out in that paper you sent, would you mind telling me what figure you are talking about? The only ones I see that actually seem to \u0022fan out\u0022 are ones that simulate a collision, like a lander near the surface or an engine right after stage separation where the flow is hitting the lower stage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is almost entirely over my head, but what little I do understand is really interesting.

As I understand it the devs are always on the lookout for more in-depth information on things like this, so I hope they see your AMA question and/or this thread. While I\u0027m sure it\u0027s near the very bottom of the priority list at the moment, I\u0027d love to see them continue to develop the plumes to make them even more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
