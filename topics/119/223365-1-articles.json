Don\u0027t know what that mission even is for. There\u0027s no push to build rovers, to make them seem useful. Same goes for \u0022activate a jet engine on Laythe\u0022. So I can pack a tiny methane tank, attach an engine to it, slap it on a lander probe and send it there. Boom, 3000 science points for free and I learned NOTHING about the ability to fly planes on Laythe. The objectives are very vague. I have only made one rover, for Laythe, because aiming exactly at the discoverable was impossible (Trajectories implementation when?). So I drove there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth Minmus and Jool discovery missions had introductory missions - in form of putting probes in orbit. That could be useful for all other missions, not only main but secondary as well. Maybe, let the players find where the signals are coming from, instead of\u00A0 giving straight away the exact location? Also, the science rewards are not exactly in line with difficulty.

Nor did I return from Eve at all, let alone with a 10-Kerbal sized vehicle. And the game asks me to do that now. For new players, and many of the old, these missions will sit incomplete for a long time, if not forever. The takeoff from Eve to low orbit only requires 8k d/v, and that must be done with a vehicle brought in one piece from Kerbin and safely landed.

While it\u0027s reasonable to do Mun and Minmus missions with direct returns, by the time someone is doing a Duna mission they really should be thinking of doing something Apollo-style with a separate \u0027mothership\u0027 and lander. It\u0027s just so much easier when you don\u0027t waste energy bringing an entire return trip\u0027s worth of fuel to the surface, but is so involved I wouldn\u0027t expect a new user to A: figure out how to build following the Apollo style, and B: actually execute docking, without some guidance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d expect some tutorials for docking and rendezvous, ideally covering elements of both in-orbit rendezvous (I\u0027m at 80 km, the space station is at 100 km and at a totally different orbital phase \u002B inclination, what now?), launch-to-rendezvous (I\u0027m on the surface of the Mun at some high latitude and my transfer vessel is in a similarly inclined orbit, how do I launch to meet up with it?), and the whole docking process with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E translation controls. From there, it would be important to also have missions that explicitly require docking to encourage everyone to get practice in. Ideally, there would even be some missions to practice good Apollo-style missions (even something as open-ended as \u0027Split any vessel in two in orbit of a CB, land one part of the vessel on that CB, then rejoin the two\u0027, though I can imagine that\u0027s more than the current mission system can handle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is such an important set of skills to have for any interplanetary mission, and I\u0027d say my inability to pull off a good Apollo-style mission is why I personally \u0027never left Kerbin-Mun-Minmus in KSP1\u0027 (I did learn eventually, but not from material presented inside KSP1 itself!) With the future of interstellar vessels and cargo deliveries, I can only imagine docking becoming an even more important skill, so we really should teach it as early as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steveman0","CreatedById":64580,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-31T04:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224363191\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221706652384\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219461\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Emanuel01\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Emanuel01 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019d enjoy if\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eaerobrake\u003C/strong\u003E and\u003Cstrong\u003E gravity assists \u003C/strong\u003Ewere covered by missions/tutorials.

I choose to target the mission of leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. This event triggers a mission for sending a survey probe to accomplish initial duna encounter and orbit accomplishments. These trigger missions for landing kerbals on duna, sending probes to Ike, and maybe exploring the next celestial body \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Lead us through the progression of our agency\u0027s capabilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 2: I built the fuel station side mission. This should be followed by a docking mission. Followed by a space station build up type mission. Followed by a remote fuel station / space station. Could cover probe, docking, multi-launch modular construction, refueling / resource management, resonant orbit maneuvers, Commnet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 3: Build my rover as we have currently, land a rover on the moon, retrieve science with a rover, and I would expect as colonies progresses we\u0027d have more mission types for rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 4: Build a space plane, have a space plane leave kerbins atmostphere, mun/minmus, kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 5: Might be a new concept, but missions which have me building custom subparts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, using more of the parts available to me in outside the box ways to accomplish tasks. As an example, I\u0027ve read a lot about people using cargo bays to build custom command modules to accomplish the 10 kerbal eve landing challenge. That sounds really awesome, and it\u0027s something I should play with. That said, in my 400 hrs of kerbal space play, I have barely used many of the payload, structure type parts that allow for more open ended construction. I\u0027d love a build up of mission types that have me \u0022re-inventing the wheel\u0022 using a subset of parts that when put together make a wheel.

I shouldn\u0027t be asked to find the minmus monument before I\u0027ve plated a flag, collected a surface sample, discovered multiple biomes, returned science, etc. I should not be asked to land 10 kerbals on eve, if I\u0027ve never collected an atmosphere sample.

This is totally where I would love build up missions to that have me landing on eve and exploring it\u0027s atmosphere, as well as where I am gaining experience building customer crafts that might be similar to one which would hold 10 kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3.
