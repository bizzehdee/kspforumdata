I would estimate that the quantity of negative reviews for KSP 2 will surpass the quantity of negative reviews\u00A0 for KSP 1 within a few days of now. Also, not\u00A0to mention the fact that The actual percentage of positive reviews is less than 50 % for KSP 2, meanwhile it\u0027s 95% for KSP 1 (its definitley worth accounting for the fact that KSP 1 is a mature game, but still these numbers should be closer to one another in an optimal launch scenario, even for an EA).\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, the first game really shouldnt be more popular in player count than a newly released sequel.

It seems like this game is getting a lot of negative publicity, and people who know a lot about programming seem to be worried about the code base for the game. Could this launch be a detriment for the long term health of the game? I really want this game to be in a better state.

This is expected in an EA title, but such an anticipated title is going to get way more attention than might otherwise be warranted for an EA release. So a lot of people bought it expecting way more, letting hype and anticipation overcome the warnings about the games state. So a lot of people have likely done what many of us have done, which is \u0027enjoy\u0027 the bugs, review as to how they felt about the current state of the game, and then put it down to wait until whenever it looks better before seriously diving in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t speak for everyone else, but I was running a heavily modded KSP1 leading into the release, and I\u0027m still playing that save now, just because its got the content I want. When KSP2 starts to have more of the content I want, I will probably pivot over for the last time. Until then, I\u0027m booting it up here and there to get kraken\u0027d and participate in the journey, just like I did back in KSP1, playing on and off since before the Mun was released (I actually played the VERY first version way back when, for like 30 minutes which hardly counts) right up until Career Mode came out, then I started playing seriously. I would hardly argue that Pre-Mun KSP1 wasn\u0027t very fun, just that there wasn\u0027t much to actually strive for - a very important difference. KSP2 is in much the same state, There is fun to be had when you do things - there\u0027s just not much to do, and doing any of them doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite all that, the fact the game already has 10% of the reviews of KSP1 in less than a week is actually a really good indicator - not only are there a lot of buyers, but a lot of them are invested enough to feel that they need to get their opinions out already. Its got a rough rep out the gate, but I\u0027ve seen worse launches do better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
