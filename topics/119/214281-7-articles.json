The very reason there\u0027s so much nerd radge over the disapointing EA will bring them back. They want it to succeed, and they want to see it! If some of the improvements are on the performance end, that will bring back players who want to see if their potato plays better. So, sure, EA with bugs and poor performance, and missing features, and limited to sandbox mode will only hold your attention for so long, but that\u0027s only to be expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T03:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverlapping threads have been merged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RaBDawG","CreatedById":206005,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T12:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678324018\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002211227\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RayneCloud\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, RayneCloud said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know you\u0027re like the 3rd or 4th person to post something like this?

And it was the same money, same release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you ask me, it was a hard cake to eat programming this stuff. When KSP2 was announced, it had a date\u00A0 of release in 2020 with interstellar travel promised, multiplayer, etc... We are 4 years from announcment and game has less content than mid ksp1 had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope that KSP2 is repairable. It really gets to the core of the game. If base programming model and architecture was well made, than ok.
