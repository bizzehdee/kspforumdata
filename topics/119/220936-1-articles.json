However, if you were orbiting with the rings, they would appear stationary to you because you are orbiting with them, right? Is this intentional or a simple oversight? Is it just not fixed because it would be too hard? Am I wrong entirely?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also it would be nice if Jool had a ring of dust or something)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicat","CreatedById":228085,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-22T19:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes they are definitely wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think those are just placeholders because all the rocks are the same model. So it will likely be fixed in the future. I think they should improve rings before (or at the same time as) interstellar, because there will be other ring planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-22T21:09:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2023 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 22\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spicat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimera Industries","CreatedById":216952,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-22T20:11:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224342079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220936\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221700679742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228085\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spicat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Spicat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think those are just placeholders because all the rocks are the same model.
