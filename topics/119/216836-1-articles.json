branches. In fact, I\u0027d be confident in saying that most of the dev depots are probably coming from the same branch, but it would also be an absolute nightmare to manage if everything there came from the same branch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also depends a bit on what version control Intercept uses. For example, we see 0.1.0.0 and 0.1.1.0 depots. Under P4 or SVN, these almost definitely correspond to branches. Git, in contrast, has a good tagging systems, and both of these could be coming off something like release branch tagged something like 0.1.0.0 and 0.1.1.0 respectively. And, of course, if Git is used for code, there\u0027s probably still P4 or SVN for content, which would still be branched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there, things get interesting. The thing that makes git so fantastic for working with code is that you can switch between branches very easily in the same clone directory. If there is an experimental feature being worked on, I can throw it in a branch, and simply check out to it or back to main or dev whenever needed without having to re-download the entire repository. With P4 and SVN, it\u0027s more painful. I would actually have individual directories for each check-out on these. Consequently, creating a branch for an experiment is a complication. On P4, I\u0027m much more likely to simply work with an experimental shelf than a branch. So the branching strategy is going to be very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a typical P4 game project would have branches like: trunk, release, release_0_1_0_0, release_0_1_1_0.... and individual developers might have shelves off of any of these to work on experiments and fixes, wile\u00A0 git project would typically have main, release (with tags 0.1.0.0, 0.1.1.0, etc) and then a whole bunch of branches that individual developers created for patches and experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224276545\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216836\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682357977\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154477\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeSchmuckatelli\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, JoeSchmuckatelli said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately - I\u0027m wondering how studios handle a situation like this - where presumably some teammembers are working on Science and Colonies content - at the same time that basic functionality is getting tweaked during SB updates.\u00A0 At some point they have to have a merger of the two, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor bigger features like that, you usually have them in the release branch and simply disable it for specific versions.
