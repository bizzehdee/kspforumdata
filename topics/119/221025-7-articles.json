The rovemax TR-L2 wheels are pretty big, bigger than a kerbal, and look like they are suited to moving heavy, 20\u002B ton loads up and over hills and valleys at a slow but steady pace. Right now,\u00A0they are geared to do 58m/s, which is 130mph! That\u0027s fun for a small buggy, but when I want to move and dock heavy assemblies on the hilly ground, I\u00A0don\u0027t need to do that at 130mph. I\u00A0would really like to have 2 new sliders for the rover wheels. One is gear ratio to allow me to decrease top speed but increase torque, and the other slider is power, so I can increase the overall power at the expense of increased electricity consumption.\u00A0Right now, 4 of the the TR-L2 wheels just rolled my 20 ton\u00A0lander to the middle of a shallow depression and did nothing after that. This definitely needs fixing for colony\u0027s.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe maneuver plan\u00A0is very hard to adjust correctly.

I would like the ability to set and adjust the maneuver node while the game is paused, or maybe even better to have a few time warp options below 1x speed, so we could have 0.5x, 0.25x and 0.125x warp settings. This would give us more time to adjust the node but also seeing things happen in slow motion might help us understand why the blasted large landing legs are exploding when landing at 2m/s!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new closet approach windows are better than in KSP1, so thank you for that. However, the closest approach keeps disappearing despite adjusting to get it closer. It will do this even though I\u0027m not getting an encounter yet. Then when I\u00A0get it to reappear the window is gone and I\u00A0have to reopen it again, which usually means closing the maneuver plan I\u0027m working on, only to re-open the closest approach window, then I have to hope that it stays open when I\u00A0reopen the maneuver plan.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe maneuver plan I\u0027m working on closes when right clicking the PE to keep the PE\u00A0displayed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt can be hard/impossible to select the right thing when zoomed out in map view.

I think whatever the EVA check box thing is, it\u0027s too large, and it would be nice to be able to see that hit box while building. Have it be toggleable on and off of course, it could be an option that appears when you right click the command pod/seat to show EVA check box,\u00A0and have anything that clips into it be shown in red.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nin the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, the way symmetry works can be confusing. If i place two radial fuel tanks then i go to strut between the tanks and the main body, sometimes it will put two struts on one tank. the symmetry of the one side tank I click on is respected over the symmetry of the whole ship.\u00A0It would be nice to have different symmetry modes to select between part symmetry or whole vessel symmetry, or select which part build symmetry is applied to. Also, bring back remove from symmetry option.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen moving up/down ladders, sometimes I have to place the small three rung ladders in weird places/angles to get a claimable path back to the command module door. However, when attempting to climb these ladders, when pressing F to go to the next ladder the kerbal hops back to the previous one. In these cases it would be nice to be able to right click any ladder and have a \u0022grab\u0022 option on the selected ladder.

There I suggested that maybe there should be two or three time warp setting below 1x speed, so there would be 0.5x, 0.25x and 0.125x speeds. This would allow more time to setup the maneuver nodes, but I think would also be easier to implement, as the game will still be as it is now, they just have to add a few more time warp speeds. That can\u0027t be too hard right? Also, it would help the player to problem solve issues, like why my bloody large landing legs are exploding even after touching down at only 2m/s, or some other such problems which normally happen too fast to really analyze like you can in slow motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-24T21:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/27914-vanamonde/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002227914\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vanamonde\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anywhere to honor \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
