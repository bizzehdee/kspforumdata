It supplied the number of seconds of burn required to achieve that DeltaV. Players then learned to calculate a burn solution to achieve the desired DeltaV.\u00A0 A bit of crude math, but it works well enough, I never had issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 has \u0022Burn planning\u0022. It figures out exactly when to start/stop a burn based on your spaceship (engines/staging/fuel). This is a cool concept using some improved math, but it DOES NOT REPLACE the original DeltaV planning - mainly because it doesn\u0027t work if the vessel doesn\u0027t have enough fuel, or isn\u0027t stage correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started playing KSP2 again with Exploration mode now out, and my ship ran out of fuel and will need a rescue for Valentina. I discovered since I was out of fuel that I couldn\u0027t even create a maneuver node anymore. This is really frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 still needs to have DeltaV planning.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EI suggest coming up with a way to plan DeltaV changes, and then on top of that a mechanism to \u0022calculate engine burn solution\u0022.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone playing KSP2 loves space and exploring it in their own way, but I can\u0027t be the only one who finds this new system to be lacking something. I might learn to adjust to the new system (I have other frustrations though), but it still \u003Cu\u003Eneeds to have a way to handle the \u0022not enough fuel\u0022 case\u003C/u\u003E and still let me play with maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I will refuel a ship or jettison shuttles, or a multitude of other things, some of them possibly irrational (but not all of them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I feel I\u0027m on to something when I say \u0022DeltaV planning\u0022 and \u0022burn planning\u0022 are two separate things though, and that might be the root of the problem here. In KSP1 players could do the burn planning approximation without too much fuss, but in KSP2 you\u0027ve taken away the ability to do open-ended DeltaV planning with the tools available, and this is supposed to be VERY open-ended and fun (it is still a game after all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-04T22:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to be suggesting a mode or screen where you can freely place maneuver nodes, with whatever \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust, to plan out a journey?
