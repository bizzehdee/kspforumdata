I\u0027ll also put out there that if we don\u0027t have \u003Cstrong\u003Eproper transfer window and flight planning tools\u003C/strong\u003E the devs aren\u0027t going to see a substantial portion of the the player base going interplanetary let alone contemplating interstellar flight. Its the same as adding all these dope discoverables and not giving players the in-game tools to find them.

I need to be able to add to prograde instead of having to swing my camera around like crazy trying to find the specific bar to grab and pull; 2.)

Thus it makes far more sense to have the colony in place first instead of putting in designs that either don\u0027t fit in the long term design.

the current tech tree leaves a bit to be desired.\u00A0 With an ideal tech tree, everything you unlock would grant some new capability that you didn\u0027t have before.\u00A0 Each would be something you\u0027d be excited for and working towards that would let you do something you previously couldn\u0027t or something that was better than the previous parts you were already using.\u00A0 This tree isn\u0027t that.\u00A0 There are a bunch of techs that are just sorta strewn about that you unlock just because they\u0027re on the way to whatever else you might want or that are just a different version of something you already have.\u00A0 There\u0027s a bunch of things that are just longer tanks or different structural bits or trusses or what have you and those just don\u0027t seem like exciting things to unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t necessarily easy to fix though.\u00A0 \u00A0Part of the problem is that you need a good portion of the parts to be available pretty early.\u00A0 Tanks and engines need to be available basically at the start.\u00A0 There is a progression to larger capsules, tanks, and engines - and that works but doesn\u0027t necessarily make sense for early progress.\u00A0 So instead you have techs that unlock longer tank sections or structural trusses and stuff which just aren\u0027t especially exciting - the game should just give you those.\u00A0 You could start with *bad* parts - engines that are especially inefficient and tanks that are heavy - and then unlock better stuff.\u00A0 KSP1 did a little bit of that by starting with the solids and the engines that didn\u0027t gimble.\u00A0 But there\u0027s already enough parts - we probably don\u0027t want engines that are just bad.\u00A0 I could totally see something like engines being limited to 50% thrust until you unlock a tech though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP seems to think kerbals are an important part of the experience - so they want to start you with a capsule and parachutes.\u00A0 I understand that - but that\u0027s also a mistake for a good tech progression.\u00A0 It\u0027d be much better if we had to start with a probe that had limited comms and battery that could barely survive a quick hop.\u00A0 And then we\u0027d have to research to unlock batteries to allow orbital flight and solar panels to allow more than a few orbits, and then either comms and a comm network to get out orbit or would need to research capsules and parachutes and heat shields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere too we\u0027re stuck with the progression just being to bigger parts, but not necessarily better.\u00A0 Unlocking better solar panels and batteries and more capable probes and whatnot would be nice -
