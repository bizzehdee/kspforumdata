If it takes a year for each item on the roadmap it might literally not be done by the year 2030. But the update is pretty good, the tech tree is well designed, the missions are fun enough, and it\u0027s good to have some sensible structure to the gameplay for the first time since 2013.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the game is just too buggy, it has been buggy for a year with little to no sign of improvement, urgency, or caring. So I\u0027ll make a list of the biggest gripes I have right now which is keeping the game from being fun or playable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe parachutes, why do they not deploy? I had to do a descent 5 times just now simply to get the parachutes to deploy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe stages, why do they not respond? I often press space and nothing happens. I had a stage of sepratrons which I was going to use in case of parachute failure, of course you have to fire them at just the right moment, and if the stage does not go off, then you can imagine what happens. Even a backup using a totally different game system is non-functional. This most critical mechanic being unresponsive and unpredictable makes the game simply awful to play. Staging needs to happen consistently and immediately, without any uncertainty or doubt.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, after using it for some time it will just start to bug out, maybe you can recover it by reloading or maybe you\u0027ll have to start a whole new campaign (which with this update just became \u003Cstrong\u003Eunacceptable\u003C/strong\u003E.) you just don\u0027t know. You can sometimes not rearrange or edit\u00A0stages, you can sometimes not move parts, you can sometimes not set the launch assembly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe delta-v calculator is all over the place, it\u0027s nice to have a built in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reference, but it is totally useless if you cannot see what your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E actually is. Sometimes it is stuck at 0 and will not update until you rebuild the entire rocket. The stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E disagrees with the assembly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is correct?\u00A0Sometimes removing and adding the same part in the same place will give different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readings,\u00A0at that point not having it would be less confusing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe save system, just why? I don\u0027t understand the point of having a different name for the \u0022workspace\u0022 and the craft, that is just confusing, as far as I can tell they should always be the same name. And your list gets polluted with random autosaves that delete the description.\u00A0There was nothing wrong with how saving craft worked in KSP1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuilding a rocket and pressing \u0022launch\u0022 DOES NOT SAVE THE ROCKET. If you do not remember to\u00A0manually save before launching, YOUR BUILD IS DELETED. What the actual love? In KSP1 you would always get your last build back whenever you went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E unless you specifically pressed \u0022load\u0022 or \u0022new\u0022. This is just a blatant disregard for the users critical data. If you\u0027re lucky an autosave might have happened in the last 10 minutes but it does not save the final state of the craft, so good luck with that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhy is there no interstage fairing? You can\u0027t make apollo.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitching the launch assembly loves up your staging,\u00A0each assembly should really have it\u0027s own set of stages. Autostaging in general is terrible. In KSP1 pressing the reset button you could generally expect a reasonable result as long as you weren\u0027t being too clever in your build. Here you HAVE to adjust staging every time you make a change because the default staging is so bad and obviously wrong, main engines at the bottom of the rocket will appear at the top of the staging list, endless empty stages get created.\u00A0All in all building is a horrible nightmare due to all these issues.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u0022landed\u0022 bug after taking off with a lander and being unable to see your trajectory in the map has been there from the start.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBetween the light bug where you can\u0027t turn on lights and the lack of helmet lamps on kerbals means night time or even landing in a crater in shadow\u00A0is a no-go.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEverything being \u0022default-name-2734\u0022 and having the capsule icon means I have no idea what anything is. As soon as you detach or dock something like a lander it loses its name, and everything has the same icon. It\u0027s easy to get lost. Again this was not a problem in KSP1, with auto-naming and icons being mostly sensible and only rarely you had to manually fix it. You can\u0027t even change the icon in KSP2.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only describe this as a state that makes you feel that\u003Cem\u003E\u0022nothing works\u0022.\u003C/em\u003E I fear I\u0027ll have to wait another year \u003Cem\u003Eor more\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for things to improve. And releasing a major early access update just before the holidays knowing full well it may have issues is such a genius move, making any kind of rapid response to a buggy update impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T03:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s a concise list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat troubles me is that Intercept \u0022explains\u0022 the 10 month period by saying they had to prioritize bug fixing. \u003Cem\u003EBut we expect the other roadmap updates to be rolled out much quicker\u003C/em\u003E.
