The rest that wasn\u0027t, was already added through mods - so his \u0022creative vision\u0022 was, apparently, modded KSP1. With a worse UI. It\u0027s also his responsibility to collaborate with other departments like production and marketing. In other words, it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Ehis job\u003C/strong\u003E to make sure his \u0022visions\u0022 are a possibility, not the other way around. This entire notion that a CD has a team of people running after him \u0022reigning his dreams in\u0022 is absolute krakens. Further, if, for some reason or another, there is no one to collaborate with, it falls on \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto make due, you can\u0027t just shift the blame to \u0022well nobody told me that ain\u0027t possible, what do i know\u0022.

Imagine a banker not knowing whether or not a cheque is authentic, and just cashing it in anyway because no one was available to confirm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese things don\u0027t\u00A0 happen (well the first one does in the US, but generally leads to settlements). The reason these things don\u0027t happen is because people are being held responsible. Yet here we are, in the industry where this is \u003Cem\u003Edesperately\u003C/em\u003E needed, we have people simping for professionals that should (and i bet, DO) know better, making up all kinds of excuses as to why they can\u0027t be blamed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate and be crystal clear. It isn\u0027t Nates job to \u0022dream up\u00A0 art n design n creative ideas n stuff\u0022, his job is also to ensure that these are possibilities. No one elses. If there is no one to double check with like a TD, you go to the programmers/production directly, or you simply pull the brakes and pester T2 until the issue is resolved. I bet it\u0027s a comfy life as a creative director if all you need to do is to say \u0022well i want interstellar stuff, also make the UI look unreadable on certain resolutions, and colonies would be cool to - cheers guys, i\u0027m off\u0022. Which is what some people here are implying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what Emily Short has to say in this regard, Creative Director at Failbetter Games when asked what\u0027s the hardest thing about this role.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The greatest concepts and coolest gameplay will never get in front of players if you don\u0027t finish and ship the game - \u003Cu\u003Ewhich means you have to respect budget, scope, and production schedules, as well as your team\u0027s energy and workability\u003C/u\u003E. If you don\u0027t respect those concerns, you wind up demanding a lot of overtime from your team, which is an endemic problem in this industry and very bad practice. It\u0027s the producer\u0027s role to keep the calendar and be on top of who is doing what, \u003Cu\u003Ebut the creative director needs to work alongside the producer and make sure that they\u0027re not demanding the impossible\u003C/u\u003E. So that means there are many, many individual choices to make about what to keep and what to discard. Sometimes those choices involve things that people on your team care about passionately or that you personally love.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is no \u0022producer\u0022 as such, then you have to find another way to ensure that you\u0027re not demanding the impossible, rather than demanding the impossible and then have others lay the blame somewhere else because \u0022nobody told you it was impossible\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t care whether or not Nate Simpson feels bad or is sad. I certainly (and i said this before) hope that he\u0027ll never work as a creative director for a game again - even disregarding all emotions i might or might not have, just in the purest objective sense, he failed in his job.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve written the $50 off, it\u0027s what it is. I am certainly still passionate about KSP1 (unlike others here who argue that KSP1 is awful, and now act like they knew that this was always gonna happen to KSP2 but they don\u0027t care - why the heck are you even here then?), KSP2 certainly is dead and will never see the light of day in a shape that would satisfy people, unless a billionaire with no sense of money throws enough budget for an entire do-over at it, which is highly unlikely. Poach Johan Pilestedt, while you\u0027re at it - a CD who failed \u0022his community\u0022 before as well, but owned up to it. The main thing that irks me in all this is that Nate doesn\u0027t have the stones to come out and apologise for his own personal shortcomings. No \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E can prevent that. Maybe Pilestedt is the reason that i don\u0027t cut Nate any slack - i know that his job can be done so, so much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that all said: \u003Cu\u003Eof course\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0T2 holds the bigger share of the blame. No discussion here. We (well, most of us, i guess) always knew that T2 was inevitably gonna bite us in the butt. In fact, many (including me) called it immediately when it was announced. We didn\u0027t get the way they gonna bite us quite pin-pointed at times, but we knew that there wouldn\u0027t be a happy end with a Top3 worst Publisher in the industry next to EA and Activision. That doesn\u0027t make Nate blameless. The only people that potentially are, are the coders. There\u0027s no one blameless in Management.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd i wish we could start actually calling it out as it is, rather than trying to buddy up to people. Nate is a professional. He isn\u0027t your friend, he gets paid to do a job. He failed this one (and others). That\u0027s it, there\u0027s nothing else to it. Call it as it is, don\u0027t make up excuses for someone who won\u0027t remember you next week - and most importantly, don\u0027t enable failures like this over and over again. This is as much on us as it is on Nate or T2 (that includes me, i did buy the game despite better knowledge because i\u0027m weak).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T12:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716644637\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meecrob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/25/2024 at 2:43 PM, Meecrob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be 100% honest, and I know I speak for more than just myself here, For Science! simply was not \u0022good enough\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFS! felt like I bought KSP1 off of Wish.com or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my interpretation, but I read that quote as being more about the update being \u0022polished and bug-free\u0022 rather than \u0022feature-heavy and full of content\u0022.

A lot of the fixation on Nate seems like wanting to yell at the manager of a \u00A0restaurant because the food isn\u2019t great, without realizing you\u2019re at a chain restaurant and the foods not great because of bad ingredients and bad policy dictated by corporate. You should be yelling at upper management, but they aren\u2019t there or visible to you so you take it all out on the highest up person you\u2019re aware of. I think K^2 is one of the few people here with the relevant experience to understand the dynamics here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts pretty obvious T2 surely did want to make money on KSP but never really understood the product because no one apparently paid any attention to the existing community. It was widely understood that KSP1 while incredibly compelling as an idea was a bit of a cobbled together mess with a lot of fundamental flaws and tech debt in the base code and really couldn\u2019t be brought forward without major re-writes. I know issues with axial tilt, acceleration under warp, and multiplayer were widely known to be practical dealbreakers on this forum going back to 2017. Im actually really happy Nate by force of his shear enthusiasm was able to convince them that for KSP to succeed it needed a bigger budget really big changes. Had KSP2 been released in 2020 as a half-baked reskin I think the result would have been just as disastrous as what happened in 2023.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I personally am not as convinced that multiplayer KSP would be as enduringly fun as folks think. I think the version of multiplayer KSP that might be fun is basically kithack model club\u2014making cars and planes and other vehicles and racing and smashing them about with friends in real time. For reasons that have been discussed many times on this forum this doesn\u2019t really work in space because of time-warp. Its not that there aren\u2019t solutions to how people move through time, its that inevitably you are for the most part not existing in a real-time experience with your friends. You\u2019re talking about a much slower, much less interactive cooperative game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leads me to believe that if KSP2 was actually to work T2 aught to have brought on the KSP1 team much earlier and started with a ground up rewrite, understanding it was going to take 5-6 years and 40-60 million. Its not just the code though. KSP was always a fun sim but its a terrible\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E. If they really wanted to compete with Minecraft and Roblox they needed the fundamentals of science, progression, colonies, and most importantly resources. \u00A0Thats what creates the fundamental loop of fly-gather-build-fly and a dynamic set of non-proscriptive, player driven goals. If all you could do is fly around and build the Taj Mahal minecraft would been forgotten in 2009. It\u0027s the free and open crafting system that makes it the slightest bit interesting. With one generic ore and the inability to build off-world KSP would never be the kind of open and expansive free-flowing building game it needed to be. I think multiplayer and interstellar should have been considered as they re-wrote the code but the initial release really needed to include that fundamental core game loop to be something new and compelling enough to warrant a sequel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-28T23:28:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2024 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 28\u0022\u003EMay 28\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-28T13:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716812173\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259429\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/27/2024 at 8:16 AM, GluttonyReaper said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my interpretation, but I read that quote as being more about the update being \u0022polished and bug-free\u0022 rather than \u0022feature-heavy and full of content\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, if For Science! is supposed to be \u0022polished and bug-free\u0022 I maintain my opinion of \u0022it\u0027s not good enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716812173\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259429\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/27/2024 at 8:16 AM, GluttonyReaper said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnever played\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut it is absolutely full of bugs.

We also know from their earliest dev blog videos that they had outside consultants such as \u0027Dr. Joel Green\u0027 acting as talking heads to give them scientific credibility. Therefore the idea that there was a complete veil of corporate secrecy doesn\u0027t ring quite true.
