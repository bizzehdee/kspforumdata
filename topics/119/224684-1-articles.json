Feel free to merge this into another thread, I have a feeling I\u0027m not the only one who\u0027s going to make one of these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember first watching the trailer for KSP2 in 2019. I don\u0027t know if I knew KSP even existed at the time, and if I did I only ever knew it as the simulator I\u0027d watch people doing heavily modded missions in on YouTube. I still remember watching a video someone made on a crewed flight to Pluto in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember finally being able to play the first game on a work laptop, when exactly I can\u0027t remember but I remember becoming hooked to it. Through the pandemic years I would play it instead of attending most of my online classes, probably not good for my education but I have no regrets. All the while I, like many others, waited for any good news on the second games development. The trailer also introduced me to M83, now a favorite band of mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo say the current situation hit hard is an understatement. Especially since it seemed like there may have been hope for the game to recover from its launch. As corny as it sounds Kerbal really did help me through a hard time in my life and many others through a low period in our history. I wanted and still want this series and this game to survive and give us all a chance to keep having new experiences for years to come. Not to mention introducing new fans to the games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still want to believe so badly that this will somehow pan out but with almost no proper communication and the writing seemingly on the wall I think this is the end of the road for Kerbal 2. Maybe I\u0027ll be proven wrong and I definitely want to be but I don\u0027t think I will. I just wanted to make this post to say how much this world means to me. That being the community that grew around this game. Speculating on the game and all the things we\u0027ll be able to do when it finally releases (and becomes playable) has genuinely been some of the most fun I\u0027ve had online.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wanted to get my feelings on this out, I seems I\u0027m not the only frustrated one. But I love this community that we\u0027ve all become a part of and it\u0027s a good feeling to know that through all this we\u0027ve (mostly) had each other\u0027s backs. I look forward to all our usual tomfoolery in the first game if push really has come to shove here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-03T09:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis franchise changed my life too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first learned about KSP2 in 2020. I had heard of KSP long ago (in like 2015 or 16) from a YouTuber called PhlyDaily. I had guinea pigs from 2015, but in 2020 one passed away, followed by another just weeks later. This hit me very hard. I did not have any human friends at the time, due to a combination of mental health issues and moving around due to my parent\u2019s divorce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2016 was the darkest year of my life so far perhaps. I was struggling immensely in school and in a few months would lose my the last of my human friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would sit on the couch with one of my pigs in the evenings, and he would look up to the ceiling a lot. I interpreted this as him wanting to go to the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso at this time I was interested in Soviet history. So through a combination of being enamored with the Soviet mass song \u201C14 minutes to start\u201D (the refrain of which is in my signature) and my pig\u2019s desires, the seeds of a new interest in space travel were born. I had originally been interested in space during elementary school, but dropped it after my parents divorced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the dark times continued. I was bitter, neglected to spend time with my pigs, and focused on war and conflict.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings changed in 2020. I lamented how I was never able to take all of my pigs to space (I planned to make a cardboard rocket and blast off with them to the \u201CMoon\u201D and let them run around on the surface). Now two of them never could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI became interested in spaceflight again at last. I revisited Wikipedia articles for the first time in nine years about rockets and missions. But it wasn\u2019t enough. I wanted to be able to go to space myself, just as I \u201Cpartook in combat\u201D virtually through video games during my interest in historical wars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recalled that rocket game, called \u201CKerbal\u201D or something from that PhlyDaily video so long ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked it up and lo and behold, not only was KSP thriving, a sequel was in the works called KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was blown away by the trailer. The dreams of my childhood, going to the Moon and then interstellar, returned to my mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 seemed out of reach for my computer. KSP2 promised better graphics. I was hyped. I still ended up finding a work around to play KSP1 and learn the ropes in the meantime, but I remained highly excited about KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, the (still rumored) death of KSP2 does not bother me much. It\u2019s what happens to the franchise that does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I bought KSP, I was able to go to orbit, land on the \u201CMoon\u201D, and I even attempted to go to \u201CMars\u201D (I played stock and simply imagined it was the real solar system, because my computer couldn\u2019t handle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E). But it was something that seemed like magic, like stepping into a real life spaceflight simulator, compared to what I did in my elementary years: drawing rockets and then cutting them out and playing with them as toys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP fundamentally changed my life in that it gave me a positive hobby. So many video games involve some degree of violence, and yet this one is peaceful (although I did build an SA-2 Guideline replica once lol). As a result I was able to have a really good pandemic experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of time I spent playing dropped in 2022, as another of my pigs passed away, and I so strongly identified KSP with being with him, while also lacking coping skills to deal with his passing. But the interest in space exploration remained. Through all the ups and downs, I feel I have been a much happier person in 2020-2024 than I was in 2012-2019. KSP was a big part of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only played sandbox mode through these past four years. In 2024, simultaneous with starting college, I will be starting my first ever science save, with a goal of building a space program during my time as an undergraduate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat will happen now? At first glance it seems like it should be fine, but KSP social media accounts and even this forum moved very heavily into promoting KSP2 (as an example, the KSP2 section of the forum is above that of KSP, despite the game not even being finished, and the only creations showcased on Twitter now are all from KSP2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill they make an about face and return to promoting KSP content? Will Private Division want to continue supporting KSP if it just makes people think about how they failed to deliver the second one, thus hurting their brand name and reputation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI certainly hope not. I voice my fears not to sow panic, but in search of solace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-04T02:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224385258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224684\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714727868\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill they make an about face and return to promoting KSP content?
