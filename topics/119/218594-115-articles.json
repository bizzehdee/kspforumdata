Actually, it\u0027s \u0022only highly probable\u0022, I can\u0027t see the future. But even if they pursue the dev one more year to release 2-3 patches to fix the remaining main bugs, even if they push to the Colonies Update because it\u0027s 90% done, it won\u0027t achieve anything. Colonies need resources, need interstellar, etc, to be relevant. It\u0027s only a brick of a whole wall. And I don\u0027t see why they would push to this update, because this last hypothetical 10% is always the hardest and would require some fix after that, some patches : more work, more financial debt just to finish an ark, while it won\u0027t improve sufficiently the Steam Feedback, won\u0027t trigger new purchases ? Nah, I don\u0027t see how / why it would happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, let\u0027s assume, if you will, that this is the\u00A0 end of the actual KSP2 game. What now ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, the only possible positive outcome would be a new Dev team, a pro one, not amateurs, willing to make money of course, that would announce a \u0022The Real KSP2\u0022 in a year or two, knowing that if they actually meet the people requirements, it would be a million sells. \u0022Just\u0022 need to be economically viable, which means something less \u0022big\u0022 (well...) than KSP2, more rational, more pragmatic, the keep the dev time low and thus the cost low. What would it looks like ? Well, exactly what I expected KSP2 to be : a from-scratch, pro-developed KSP1, embedding all the news techs that appeared the last decade, taking benefits from the new hardware, the news skills, etc. A MASSIVE technical update of KSP1 and that\u0027s it, nothing more. Yeah, I know, it\u0027s probably already a big work haha, but it\u0027s far more doable, to me, than what the actual KSP2 tried to make, while failing at every part of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, a big technical update, ready to host, then, for a whole new decade, some updates, be they minor or major, but without any promise, just like we had during 12 years with KSP1. But at least something which would be running well on our machine, and worth to get mods and new official contents along the year, thanks to a clean from-scratch basis. This announce would need to come quite soon, like in a year or two, so that KSP don\u0027t get buried too far in all memories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your opinion about this ?

That probably didn\u0027t help it attract customers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only vouch for my personal experience, but I decided to wait to buy the game until it offered something that KSP1 didn\u0027t. After all, KSP2 came with a steep price tag and stability issues, but also the exact same planets and gameplay as KSP1. It was a setting I already had explored. It truly felt like I wouldn\u0027t miss out on anything by not buying KSP2 just yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decision to try to get a stable version of KSP1 to run in the engine first was probably sensible from a development point of view, but it also meant the sequel had nothing new to offer returning fans. KSP1 offered the exact same gameplay with fewer bugs and more mods available, for a lower price, able to run on older computers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt baffles me that they didn\u0027t try to implement something to give KSP2 a unique draw. Giving Kerbin a third moon, or changing some of the planets in the solar system, or adding more planets, something like that. Sure, it would probably have added yet more to development time, but it would also have made the sequel stand out a bit more, and possibly attracted enough buyers to make continued development worthwhile. It\u0027s hard to make sales without selling points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-07T13:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224387308\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715074109\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022233146\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robertbozic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Robertbozic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds like quite the adventure in Kerbal Space Program!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the first release version who was legendary bugged to the level that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E could follow you up into space \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NexusHelium","CreatedById":230359,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-07T13:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224387340\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715087620\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the first release version who was legendary bugged to the level that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E could follow you up into space \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should\u0027ve stayed in the 1.0 release\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;p\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/971609041_P.png\u0022 title=\u0022;p\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-07T13:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224386898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714988351\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163815\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Codraroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/6/2024 at 10:39 AM, Codraroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, it would probably have added yet more to development time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly the opposite of what KSP 2 needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having enough draw wasn\u0027t its problem, the real problem is that there were obviously setbacks due to a corporate krakening judging from the initial 2020 release date.\u00A0 Either they had nothing in the months leading to a full release, or (more believable IMO) they had a more complete project where a 2020 release was appropriate, but it was disrupted by T2 poaching Star Theory.
