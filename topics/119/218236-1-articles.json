I am writing this open letter as a dedicated player and modder in the Kerbal Space Program 2 (KSP2) community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, we have become aware of the possibility of Digital Rights Management (DRM) being implemented into KSP2\u0027s upcoming multiplayer feature.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPost by Dakota\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k6suDCeDPV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002216.41\u0022 height=\u002286\u0022 width=\u0022524\u0022 src=\u0022https://linuxbad.com/k6suDCeDPV.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe current multiplayer code uses\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://playfab.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://playfab.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0this points to no self hosting options.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe firmly believe that such a move could potentially undermine the very aspects that make KSP a remarkable game: the thriving modding community and the possibility of self-hosting (see DMP and LMP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Modding Community:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOver the years, the KSP series has been greatly enriched by the work of talented modders, who dedicate their time and effort to enhancing and expanding the base game. These modifications range from realistic physics changes to new rocket parts, missions, and entire star systems. They have allowed us to explore beyond the limits of the base game and customize our experience to suit our individual preferences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe introduction of DRM has the potential to create a significant barrier for these modders. DRM often complicates the modification process and can deter new modders from taking up the task. It could lead to a decline in the creation of new mods for KSP2, which would greatly impact the game\u0027s diversity and longevity. We worry that by adding DRM on multiplayer this would restrict modding to single player only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Self-Hosting: The KSP community has shown immense interest in self-hosting multiplayer servers, an option that allows players to host games on their hardware, be it a colocated server or a spare laptop. This fosters a sense of community, allowing us to manage our own multiplayer experiences, set our own rules, and cater to a variety of play styles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy imposing DRM, there\u0027s a possibility that we lose the freedom to self-host. This restriction can limit our multiplayer experience to official servers only, possibly subjecting players to overcrowding, latency issues, and limitations on customization. In effect, the personal, curated multiplayer experience that many players value would be jeopardized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine Minecraft with the only multiplayer option being realms.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to this, having no self hosting option will limit the games lifespan. When Intercept games/Private division/Take 2 decides after 5 - 10 years that the cost is too high to keep the servers running we will lose a big part of the game.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe understand the necessity of protecting your creative work and preventing piracy. However, we believe that a balance must be struck between these valid concerns and the freedom that has made KSP 1 such an engaging and dynamic game. If DRM becomes a hindrance to the modding community and self-hosting options, then the game risks alienating its core fanbase, who have been instrumental in KSP 1 success and the future of KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn lieu of DRM, we propose exploring alternative methods to combat piracy. This could include leveraging community goodwill, offering unique benefits to legitimate owners, or enhancing user experience to a level that pirated copies cannot compete with. Many successful games have thrived without DRM, and we believe KSP2 can do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur love for KSP2 runs deep, and this comes from a place of wanting the game to continue to flourish and evolve. We appreciate the work that you\u0027ve put into this game and the ongoing dialogue you\u0027ve maintained with the community. In keeping with that, we kindly ask you to reconsider the implementation of DRM for KSP2\u0027s multiplayer update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShadowDev\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChadDude","CreatedById":229755,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-06T00:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting point to bring up, definitely something the KSP2 team would take a while to develop but it seems like a more investor thing to be decided, not the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Space Peacock","CreatedById":224498,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-06T01:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad attention is being brought to this early on!

Self-Hosting: The KSP community has shown immense interest in self-hosting multiplayer servers, an option that allows players to host games on their hardware, be it a colocated server or a spare laptop.
