Time-based research clearly doesn\u0027t work as a driver in a game like KSP where you are encouraged to time warp at will with no real penalty, so we really only have some variation on points to work with, and for a game like KSP you must actively go out and collect them somehow in order for them to drive gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not opposed to the idea of arbitrary points unlocking whatever on the tech tree, that gives me agency in choice on how to proceed, which is fantastic. More agency is always better IMO. The collection part in KSP has always been the real worrying point because the whole right-click a part to receive a little reward box which you then game is just tedious AF. Even mapping actions to collect all the science has its issues, especially with parts that are not reusable in the mix and trying to remember where you\u0027ve been before to gather science... That kind of thing should have been axed early on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose one option could be something like an allocation of research percentage to individual part categories and then the activity of going out any actual parts in certain situations accumulates research points in each category. Maybe the science parts, locations, and biomes all influence the increase you gain for activities. In that way science \u0022activity\u0022 is sort of a background thing, you set it and forget it and then just go about doing things actively, playing with spaceships and colonies and doing the other parts of the game loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other things the community has done to make the collection less tedious as well, I\u0027m sure, I haven\u0027t kept up on those things. I just don\u0027t think arbitrary \u0022science\u0022 points are necessarily bad for this game, provided the collection mechanism makes more sense and has more imagination than \u0022go place, right-click part, get loot box\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-30T17:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there should be more \u0027long term\u0027 experiments, a bit like the\u00A0 seismic sensors in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs in....\u00A0 You leave an experiment running and it sends (hopefully useful)\u00A0data periodically.\u00A0 Such as take a temperature reading every hour and send the results every 10 days, on receipt you get a few science points, the amount of which would diminish over time, depending on the nature of the experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
