Set a date and end up late? Bad! Underpromise? Bad! How else are we supposed to react?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, they should call a duck a duck, and say, \u201Cthis is a true early access, which means we are letting the community into our development process\u201D, and give us an actual appraisal of the state of each of the planned features as they stand today. Then there would be no need to set dates- and the community\u2019s reactions would be less severe because they have visibility into what is actually going on instead of being left to wonder for long periods of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, let\u2019s apply this principle to an alternate universe version of the initial EA release, to see why it would have seen a better community response:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of promising the game to be released in 2020, they could have been honest about the state of the game. This is probably too early to be super transparent about the game, but there is a basic level of honesty involved in setting a release date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward to the years of several delays. Instead of delaying the game and blaming COVID, they could have been transparent about which technical feats were proving challenging, where the features stand, and if they had to start over and why. In this universe, the KSP community, many of whom have tech jobs, would have understood that KSP 2 is a technical game requiring many complicated systems and even innovations. There would have been no swings of high expectations, then letdowns in the face of delays, because just as development flows slowly but surely, so too would the communication, and the community would see in real time what was happening, rather than building up anticipation only to receive a vague message about delaying the game for quality\u2019s sake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this universe, when the EA released, the community would already know exactly what to expect, and people who weren\u2019t interested in that level of bugginess and poor performance wouldn\u2019t have found themselves feeling scammed out of $50.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forwarding to today, we wouldn\u2019t be speculating on the forums about whether or not the game will be completed, because we would see how advanced each of the features are, and I\u2019m sure we would all be satisfied (right?). Science update would not be a mystery, and there would be no pressure for them to set a date, because the community of thousands of people who spent each $50 on the game would know what was still left to be done for science before the update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this assumes, of course, that if we were suddenly able to peel back the curtain and see what the devs are doing, and see the state of the game, that our concerns for the future of the game would be alleviated. The flip side of the transparency game is that if the team is incompetent and if the game is as much of a mess as we\u2019re worried it might be, then that would become apparent, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question to the devs is this: why not take this approach? The optimistic view is that they still want to act like how they think a AAA studio is supposed to act, and be secretive about game features so that we wait with baited breath. But I\u2019m that case, they shouldn\u2019t have released such an undercooked, broken game! You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too, release into super early access and ask for community feedback, and treat new features with the type of secrecy one would expect from a game that doesn\u2019t even have an early access, only a full release. That ship has sailed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Infinite Aerospace","CreatedById":230192,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-14T07:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224312176\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691991277\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Periple\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Periple said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trouble is that from their PoV it\u2019s a lose-lose proposition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose they\u2019re really careful and decide to go with \u201Cunder-promise and over-deliver.\u201D That means that they\u2019ll give their internal milestone date plus so much extra that they\u2019re confident they\u2019ll make it even if something goes horribly wrong like a key developer quitting or what not.

You won\u2019t have a lot of open bugs until you get into QA, and after that the number can get very high without it meaning much. You can have 100 cosmetic bugs that most players won\u2019t even notice, or 3 that ruin everybody\u2019s day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GGG-GoodGuyGreg","CreatedById":226561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-14T10:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t find any thread discussing patch 0.1.4 that was announced for Aug 22 (way over the promised update cadence) so gonna post here as any such threads appear to be merged here for some reason although the topic is this one patch itself, not the entire KSP2 EA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears this patch comes 2 months after the previous one, so in total this accounts for one third of the total dev time from launch, and I couldn\u0027t find concrete information about what this patch contains (also there appears to be no dev announcement about this and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/app/954850/eventcomments/5590708606427447124/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI could only find one on Steam\u003C/a\u003E but not here for some reason), and I don\u0027t know how this is still a problem after this bad communication style has been many times criticized countless times already by the players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWonder if in the upcoming AMAs this will be clarified and we will find out if this patch that took so long was worth the wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only good outcome is they finally somehow admitted it may have been a tall order and said they are going to think twice about the future of Multiplayer, which IMHO is much better than dropping KSP2 entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-14T10:22:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2023 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 14\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by GGG-GoodGuyGreg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-14T10:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224312221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221692007660\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Periple\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Periple said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, more seriously, the numbers don\u2019t mean anything\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue.
