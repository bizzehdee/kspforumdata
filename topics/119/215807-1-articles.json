Two. It comes after the first one being out for a decade, with all the feedback and the knowledge it brought. This is a professional team, quite a lot more staffed than KSP1 at its prime. We are in 2023. Price is 50$.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOF COURSE it\u0027s an EA, that\u0027s obvious, things will get better, etc etc. But the state of this game is definitely not a KSP1 0.13. Clearly not a KSP1 0.18. And only perhaps something like KSP1 0.24 as I proposed. It\u0027s just honesty, good faith, please don\u0027t go hyperbolic for no reason. KSP2 is advertised as an EA that will grow with us, not a random solo project from a solo Mexican passionate guy. KSP2 is sold damn expensive because they believe it\u0027s worth it (it\u0027s not, but that another story), because they consider it as well established version that can be used as EA at this price. A base for all the upcoming feature. Editors choose too rush it, probably against the opinions of Dev Team, and it was not ready, 3 weeks short of Patch1 which address quite a lot of major issues it had. But anyway : everything here leads to the conclusion that this is at least 0.24, to me. Feel free to argue differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd again, that\u0027s just a small part of the discussion. Even using an elderly version of KSP1, it\u0027s based on OLD computers (please, really, consider this aspect), with OLD technologies (Game development wise), by a team, money, organization that has nothing in common. And after 4 (\u002B ?) years of dev. Soooo yeah, obviously, what its awaited is a game that runs better than a 10 yo indie game on 12yo low end laptops, it\u0027s common sense. And since, it does not runs better or just equally bad, well, that\u0027s no good. At the same state, both game should definitely not run the same, neither twice as good, but way more. And then only, it would improve to get vastly superior, as advertised to reach 1000 parts counts crafts at decent framerate. Yeah, 20 FPS would be good enough probably. But with the actual base, the actual start, it\u0027s probably a 10-15 times gap performance to fill, does not sound possible to me, as a candid player that just played a lot with KSP1 and knowing that they apparently re-used quite a lot of the fundamental pillars if the first old opus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-24T15:30:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2023 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Dakitess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T16:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite honestly, it\u0027s too early to tell.
