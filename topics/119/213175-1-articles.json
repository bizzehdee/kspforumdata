It may be something they open up down the line. However since the current career mode is a sandbox by default, it\u0027s functionally the same as the simulator, sans graphical flavor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RabidSmurf","CreatedById":180026,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T18:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a simulator mode is a neat idea. I like to play campaign/career on hard without revert, or kerbal respawn. In the past I would do basic design validation in another save set to sandbox mode, then fly it \u0022For real\u0022 in my career mode once I thought I was ready, accepting whatever consequences or designing rescue missions as needed. I even had a kerbal memorial at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with a flag planted for every kerbal that died in the program, planting flags became tedious, but one or two kerbals survived the entire program somehow. This meant I had to transfer craft files between saves manually, not a huge problem but would be nice to have a built in mechanism, for me that could be as simple as the ability to move crafts between saves. Ideally a mode (simulator mode) where you can launch your craft with revert enabled, but you don\u0027t get any rewards, progression or persistence if you leave the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Izny","CreatedById":137814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T19:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit would be awesome to be able to test rovers on a different planet, before i actually bring them there only to find out that... it doesn\u0027t really drive as smooth as it does on kerbin XD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\non the other hand... it would defeat the idea of KSP wouldn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
