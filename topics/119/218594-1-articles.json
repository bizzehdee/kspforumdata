Everything went wrong with the mission itself, once I got to orbit I accidently decoupled the capsule from the upper stage and Jeb was hurled into the void trying to push the capsule down himself. But I don\u0027t even care, I had a blast during the flight testing the limits of my poor computer and seeing all the weird kraken attacks unfold before my eyes. This game may have it\u0027s problems but at it\u0027s core it\u0027s just GETS what makes KSP such a beautiful series. From Jeb smiling through his eternal solace in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to actually beautiful moments where you see the (incredible) new skybox as the ( also incredible) soundtrack plays. I could gush on and on and this was just my FIRST mission. I hope this game overcomes the challenges that it faces now because hidden under the bugs and bad performance there is something truly magical in this games spirit.

I understand the frustration and I am a little let down that the game is in this state myself but all I can do is have fun with what I have and hope it gets better.
