KSP2 looks to have entered preproduction around 2017 or so, ramping up to full production around 2018-2019. Assuming preproduction was two dudes and a pizza, they have been funding a full sized team on the game for five years now, over which the team evidently got one extension via the studio shuffle, one extension when they delayed the release date, and another near indefinite extension with the Early Access program. While cost is certainly a factor, the bigger concern is when that cost stops accumulating, and when the recoup period begins and ends. Despite all the extra time given, the project is still woefully behind both community expectations and likely corporate expectations, and there is no sign to either party that things are improving. There\u0027s no evidence that giving them another one, two or three years of funding would actually get us to a stable product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other side of that table, the evidence is that much of what\u0027s already been done is not fit for purpose. We\u0027re already talking about replacing major guts of the rendering and simulation pipelines, the entire UI has a developer and community sentiment of needing to be reworked, and the bug pipeline is still fighting fundamental issues from before launch, when we got that early media build event. None of this indicates \u0022we just need more time and money\u0022 because all the prior time and money got them to barely nowhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts hardly cold corporate dickishness to cut it when you look at it from that space, compared to most of their other projects and studios this has been an absolute disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-02T20:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224384928\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224689\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714677047\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222320\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stephensan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Stephensan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, its worth a shot at least, with the most recent news I have been thinking of actual realistic ways microtransactions could be implemented without directly harming the game with some suggested prices to go along with it..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of the box thinking should be cheered but I do see a few challenges with the proposal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENot having micro transactions was a promised feature\u003C/strong\u003E.
