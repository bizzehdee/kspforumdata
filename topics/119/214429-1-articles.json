Invariably, they want to show up on the airstrip, and not on the pad, even though they\u0027re oriented vertically and include all the normal rocket types of things you\u0027d expect them to have. In one case, the top most stage is a Mk1-3 Gumball. These things look like rockets, fly like rocket, and ought to take off from the pad. I\u0027ve tried making sure the Workspace Orientation is vertical (nope, doesn\u0027t help - still tries to launch from the airstrip). For sure, they\u0027re stacked up vertically, and are much taller than they are long or wide. In the case of one where the top most part is a Bulldog rover capsule, there\u0027s also a Mk2 Drone Core and it\u0027s configure to control from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something obvious I\u0027m missing that will force a craft to launch from one pace or another? Or is this possibly a bug and I should report it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind: Found it:\u00A0I\u0027ve got Launchpad 1 selected in the popup menu above the Launch button and that seems to work now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-04T22:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2023 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
