I think there could and probably should be an expanding set of skills and buffs for kerbals but these should be applied colony wide or game-wide. We wouldn\u0027t want a game thats about building multiple colonies and multiple resource mining and science gathering and operations to lend itself to just a few kerbals we grew attached to personally. I think it\u0027s very likely we\u0027ll have dozens, and tracking XP on an individual basis means a lot of time spent fussing in crew roster menus rather than building and flying spaceships. To apply these kinds of skills colony wide or program wide would just mean adding a specific module or unlocking a skill on the tech tree and it could apply for all your kerbals. We don\u0027t yet know how kerbal skills might play out but that would be my recommendation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224383190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714306595\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meecrob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Meecrob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTHANK YOU!!!

I\u0027ve been following KSP for many years and a lot of the information about how KSP2 will be different was out there long before the EA release. We knew money was out and there was no mention of careers or XP so I personally assumed they were out too. I (my opinion) feel as though those decisions--given the eventual scope of KSP2 and for the reasons mentioned above--were actually really smart and gives me much more confidence that when resources are introduced and the game really takes shape it won\u0027t be an utter slog to play. KSP2\u0027s scope is much bigger and that means a lot of the fuss needs to get cut so bigger things have room to breathe. Of course I don\u0027t agree with all of their decisions. I think the LoS comnet system is actually a really great spatial and navigation puzzle that really exploits KSP\u0027s unique nature to give depth to gameplay. Its one of those unique gameplay stories that \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E KSP can tell. I also think not implementing a planetary scanning system similar to SCANsat is a mistake for the same reason. Maybe it will be added with resources, but even now it could be a great way to gather information on biomes and discover anomalies in a much more natural way. It would also greatly improve pacing and the mission tree as right now we\u0027re sent on a pretty linear path from site to site and the order doesn\u0027t really match up well with actual landing difficulty. It would both be easier for new players and deeper for old players to be asked first to put a satellite in a polar orbit and that would create the natural choice of visiting the discoverables in whichever order you prefered. One of the dev\u0027s key goals was to smooth-out\u00A0 the learning curve and this would help immensely with that. I also think the lack of interest in life support is probably a mistake as time and living off the land are so critical to the future of space exploration and it\u0027s a very obvious way to leverage what KSP has going to create great game dynamics. But! Thats just my 2c.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-28T21:30:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2024 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 28\u0022\u003EApril 28\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-28T23:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224383220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714316872\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the modding community would disagree with you considering they gave us colonies, interstellar, resources, extra-planetary launchpads, and a whole host of other things KSP2 is supposed to provide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of those things are the things he mentioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224383220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714316872\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Sid Meier would disagree with you, what with his genre-defining game Civilization using money as a basis for most of what the series does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd GTA uses car theft as it\u0027s main gameplay loop...

Even if multiple means \u0022Two\u0022, we\u0027ve seen a trend of months between material updates, which could still put that release out way late into the year.

The Science update only brought KSP2 to \u0027significant\u0027 gameplay parity with KSP1, and colonies will be the update that objectively makes it mechanically superior. Technically or gameplay wise is still debatable, but KSP1 even with mods didn\u0027t handle colonies well - Closest we got was WOLF that just pushed everything offscreen. However, if that milestone is only reached when we\u0027re closer to two years of early access than not, I\u0027m going to be very disappointed. We were told that content updates should speed up after For Science, as all the parallel work the teams put together starts paying off, but setting a precedent of a yearly major milestone update would break that expectation, and would put the realistic multiplayer gameplay window with my friends into 2028 (December 2027, plus the requisite bugfix patches for it to actually work \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E).

From a personal perspective, I find it disappointing and frustrating that a fully funded and well staffed studio full of professionals are struggling to meet the standards that indie early access games set in the early 2010\u0027s, before anyone even knew how to do any of this. There was this indie game called Kerbal Space Program managed to make frequent and meaningful communication updates to its users, while also having frequent and meaningful content patches and enhancements.

That might be cool, but its completely irrelevant to the roadmap we want to hear about. The last thing I want to hear is \u0022We\u0027ll provide updates on our plans to provide updates two weeks from now\u0022 and then come back in two weeks to hear \u0022So we\u0027ve discussed the initial plans to create a cadence for communications that\u0027ll provide details, but we\u0027re pushing out that information a few more weeks, check back later\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is in a bit of a do or die scenario - Not the game as a whole but its communications. You need to decide publicly and vocally, whether you will actually provide more meaningful information and details on a meaningful schedule, or will you prefer to work quiet and just roll in whenever you feel your ready. Trying to play the middle ground of \u0022we\u0027d love to we\u0027re totally working on it and doing it\u0022 without delivering is just making the whole thing look worse and throwing a lot of doubt on it. You\u0027re setting yourself up No Mans Sky style, nodding along to nice sounding things that people ask about without the seeming ability to deliver. You can look at is as \u0022Look how much damage a single comment about development streams has done to expectations\u0022 as a reason to clam up, or you can look at it as a reason to speak more to explain what context was missing from that comment as to the actual development streams. But you need to make a decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s the end of my rant from a community perspective. From a personal perspective, I find it disappointing and frustrating that a fully funded and well staffed studio full of professionals are struggling to meet the standards that indie early access games set in the early 2010\u0027s, before anyone even knew how to do any of this. There was this indie game called Kerbal Space Program managed to make frequent and meaningful communication updates to its users, while also having frequent and meaningful content patches and enhancements. These updates were relatively small, simple, not particularly heavily edited, and even included stuff that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/developerarticles.html/the-024-update-goals-post-r96/#:~:text=Multiplayer%27s%20First%20Steps,progress%20being%20made.\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eultimately didn\u0027t come to pass\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that still informed the community as to what the focus at the moment was, and where things might be going.
