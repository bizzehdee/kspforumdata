I also don\u0027t see a need to do a full scan for biome information, you should be able to get enough from a camera on approach.

Its no biggie to land on the flats on Minmus, but on bodies as heavy or heavier than the Mun it would be really helpful to guide yourself down onto a nice flat landing zone. Some players may find an altitude overlay more intuitive--if there\u0027s a big zone where the altitude doesn\u0027t change then that area is going to be pretty flat. Maybe especially for new and learning players this would be a big help, not landing weird or tipping over because they didn\u0027t realize they were on a 40 degree slope until it was too late. For anomalies I honestly think they\u0027re entirely irrelevant to gameplay if you can\u0027t find them with a special scanner. You\u0027re still going to need to learn to land precisely and/or scout around in a rover, which is in itself a key challenge that KSP1 was missing.
