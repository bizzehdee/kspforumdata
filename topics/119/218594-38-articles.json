I fully expected the game to go on sale shortly after they eventually hit 1.0, right before the release of the first DLC pack (which is a guess on my part, as they have neither confirmed nor denied the potential existence of any type of DLC).\u00A0 I expected that.\u00A0 But during EA, at a time when the player count and overall numbers showed that things were bleak?\u00A0 Not a good look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso during this time, we got a few AMA\u0027s from Intercept.\u00A0 And not one of them was with an actual coder/engineer.\u00A0 Art department, Nate, designer.\u00A0 So the questions we asked regarding the actual coding of the game didn\u0027t get answered, and when we asked about it we had people stand up and tell us that of course they weren\u0027t getting answered, no coders were on the AMA, we should shut up and deal with it.\u00A0 Ok, understood...but when can we get an AMA with an actual coder?\u00A0 I literally posed the question to Dakota, tagging him on the forum...and got no response.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t even \u0022We are looking at the next AMA\u0022.\u00A0 Nothing.\u00A0 Silence.\u00A0 From a guy who admitted he hasn\u0027t been as good at communicating here on the forums as he should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to your point about showing better results?\u00A0 Yes, we should have better results.\u00A0 HarvesteR and Squad did far better with far less on KSP1 than a fully-funded corporate studio is doing on KSP2.\u00A0 Whether we deserve better or not is not the point.\u00A0 The studio should be doing better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
