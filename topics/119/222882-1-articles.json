I align the ports, and get within 5 cm of the target docking port with mine, but alas, no connection. Docking Alignment Display is a great help, but I can\u0027t get the ports to actually accept one another, and yes, they are facing eachother. The fuel tanks and tug is about 500 tonnes, the station is about 500 tonnes, so it\u0027s as graceful and as lethargic as it gets.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022veyyj8W.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/veyyj8W.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd please, Intercept Games, give us bigger, badder \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.
