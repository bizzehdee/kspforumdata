My struts had disappeared. I think I\u0027ve hit the problem where merging craft causes struts to have the wrong base vessel, so at one of my decoupling points all the struts dissappear...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-09T20:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh dear.
