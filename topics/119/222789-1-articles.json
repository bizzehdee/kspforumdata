Something official that had templates pages where you could write the mission name, key numbers, designs, etc. Staging notes to remember, descent logs, notes on how to improve the ship for the next mission. Perhaps a cheat sheet on the inside cover with optimal transfer windows and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E calculations. Feel like it would be an awesome merch idea that would actually be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RUD Everyday","CreatedById":228396,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-08T01:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod but it is outdated at the time of writing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EngineeringWaffle","CreatedById":218949,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-09T05:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo I mean a physical physical notebook.

I\u0027ve fallen in love with them for keeping notes for roleplaying games (I prefer the A5 size, perfect for bullet-pointing), really high-quality and a joy to write in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
