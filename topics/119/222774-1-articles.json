It removes some physical bugs on some parts but still leds parts bend a little. Dynamic joint system doesn\u0027t allow parts bend at all which might give some weird results when you except gravity to bend some parts but they stick straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wazup85","CreatedById":222110,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-11T21:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim using grandparent but\u00A0 ya the auto struts do feel a little over powered right now they might need to be lowered a little i would like a little flex right now even the biggest rockets stay lazer stright\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Audaylon","CreatedById":228158,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-14T22:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am trying to understand, we can use the previous patch\u0027s joint connection via setting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
