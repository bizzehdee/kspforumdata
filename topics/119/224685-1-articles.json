Turns huge parts of the game towards a much more involved and invested crafting and combat system that encourages inventive and new forms of play. The highly tiered production chains also heavily encourage exploration for the purposes of scavenging, and by extension all the support infrastructure to keep people fed, as advanced stuff like walk in refrigeration becomes something you often enough can\u0027t afford to set up right away.

None of the off the shelf engines do a great job at the sheer scale of a KSP style design, and Harvester isn\u0027t an engine dev, he\u0027s a game dev. And speaking from personal experience, game devs don\u0027t usually like retreading the same problem spaces over and over, he\u0027s probably done what he wants to do with spaceflight sims as a whole, probably for a long while. Why square up for yet another terrain rendering fight for planetoids when you can explore a new problem space you do find interesting. And while Harvester isn\u0027t exotically wealthy, he\u0027s well off enough from KSP that he can go off and explore these things and not worry about market limits or the like too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NH4Cl Enthusiast","CreatedById":230798,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-02T15:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224384788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224685\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714662470\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227275\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fizzlebop Smith\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Fizzlebop Smith said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not but it looks pretty awesome.\u00A0 I imagine there are setting to fine tune difficulty?

It is slow paced regardless but if you don\u0027t actively engage in any wars yourself the major NPC factions are happy to all just trade with you and be friends. There are some villain factions and pirates that may cause trouble (sometimes big trouble) but part of the gameplay is that you will lose ships and even stations occasionally to them and have to solve economical problems like wares being overproduced or not available at all and stuff like that. The Xenons (evil robot faction) sometimes get a bit too aggressive but that\u0027s pretty much the only time you\u0027re not in control and every other faction will also fight them so it\u0027s a rare event. They still provide a good amount of fighting since they also drop good loot and you\u0027ll probably want to protect your own stations against them so it won\u0027t be boring either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe combat is not particularly difficult and as you progress from small fighters up to having fleets, it becomes more and more a game of logistics and fleet composition. Even in fighters it\u0027s more a question of who has more and better ships than any kind of microing or twitch skills. It resembles much more of management game than 4X type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can play just as a trader, space trucker, industrial magnate, pirate, affiliate with a faction and participate in their war efforts or go full on war maniac against someone by yourself and conquer the galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean it can sometimes be frustrating and the AI does dumb things a bit too often but overall there\u0027s no other game like it. Plus there\u0027s always a mod for most problems. For DLC you probably want in this order: split vendetta and cradle of humanity (both very good and worth getting on day one), tides of avarice, kingdom end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-02T15:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224384784\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224685\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714662049\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184633\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TLTay\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, TLTay said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, I think this kind of missed the mark on the premise of being a model building game.
