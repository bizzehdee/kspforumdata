Personally I\u0027m more \u0022trying and testing\u0022 the game at each update, I\u0027m not playing KSP2 because the stuff I want is not out yet, maybe I\u0027ll do a long-ish run when science drops, but no more than 20-50 hours in it (Just like I\u0027m not playing Factorio because I\u0027m waiting for the Space DLC or DSP because I want the war and enemies update).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing altogether is the forced negativity, having to declare that every single sentence said from the devs is a lie, that everything will go bad, that everything sucks, arguing for weeks and weeks about how bad the situation is. That isn\u0027t helpful, makes the forums (here, discord, Steam, Reddit) practically useless, and isn\u0027t healthy for anyone involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you think the devs scammed you, that they\u0027re untrustworthy liars, then refund the game, leave your negative review and go on, why are you even wasting your efforts on something you don\u0027t believe will ever be good?\u00A0 Or is it that the endless arguing, the flaming, the controversies are more engaging than actually playing the game, any game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s the answer, log off social media, disable all notifications, remove the apps from your phone if you have too (I personally have strict time limits with the digital well-being feature of my phone, and I delete my Reddit account every 2 months) and read that book you never have time to read. Write down that Plot Bunny that has been bugging you for weeks, built that Lego set that\u0027s sitting on the shelf, unopened. I\u0027ve written and posted 20k words worth of Fanfic in the past year, it was a way better experience than staying here wasting my time endlessly arguing about nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like the game gets updated even if I don\u0027t check every day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-30T13:57:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2023 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 30\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Master39\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
