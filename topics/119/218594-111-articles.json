Performance feels fine, but its still early in the save and I haven\u0027t launched anything with higher part counts. I\u0027m really liking the QoL of experiments just gathering and not relying on me having to constantly monitor \u0022can I trigger it yet\u0022. Thermals mechanically are fine, although it feels a bit overtuned with the lack of starting heat shield option. Don\u0027t like how the science point counter is permanently glued up in the top right though, it covers up part of the resource menu, and I really don\u0027t need to see that when I\u0027m trying to fly a mission, hoping its just a UI oversight/bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do gotta say though, these thermal effects kind of suck. Visually they look very goopy, the sounds no good, and parts lost to thermal stress just sorta go *poof* with a tiny sound and no real flare. They\u0027re not covered in artifacts the way the KSP1 entry effects were, but I almost feel like they\u0027re too static and sloppy now - Goopy is what I used, because it looks like there\u0027s just a vague smear of \u0027hot\u0027 as opposed to an actual feeling of a fireball. The glow the smear gets is nice though, I\u0027ll give it that. I\u0027ll absolutely take it over nothing, but this really feels like it falls flat compared to the presentation we get with things like the engine plumes. Good first step, but needs more work - Being a visual aspect, I\u0027m less worried about this though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all this does feel like I actually have some incentive to keep playing and progressing a save, so we\u0027ll see how the rest of the game stability and bugs holds up as I start to actually run the campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-19T19:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224348659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703010657\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, LameLefty said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLordy, I can\u0027t remember how to disable P.A.I.G.E. ...

Performance feels fine, but its still early in the save and I haven\u0027t launched anything with higher part counts. I\u0027m really liking the QoL of experiments just gathering and not relying on me having to constantly monitor \u0022can I trigger it yet\u0022. Thermals mechanically are fine, although it feels a bit overtuned with the lack of starting heat shield option. Don\u0027t like how the science point counter is permanently glued up in the top right though, it covers up part of the resource menu, and I really don\u0027t need to see that when I\u0027m trying to fly a mission, hoping its just a UI oversight/bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do gotta say though, these thermal effects kind of suck. Visually they look very goopy, the sounds no good, and parts lost to thermal stress just sorta go *poof* with a tiny sound and no real flare. They\u0027re not covered in artifacts the way the KSP1 entry effects were, but I almost feel like they\u0027re too static and sloppy now - Goopy is what I used, because it looks like there\u0027s just a vague smear of \u0027hot\u0027 as opposed to an actual feeling of a fireball. The glow the smear gets is nice though, I\u0027ll give it that. I\u0027ll absolutely take it over nothing, but this really feels like it falls flat compared to the presentation we get with things like the engine plumes. Good first step, but needs more work - Being a visual aspect, I\u0027m less worried about this though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all this does feel like I actually have some incentive to keep playing and progressing a save, so we\u0027ll see how the rest of the game stability and bugs holds up as I start to actually run the campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the overtuned heat, I kind of agree we have no indication of heat until\u00A0 suddenly it is\u00A0 very close to dangerous level.
