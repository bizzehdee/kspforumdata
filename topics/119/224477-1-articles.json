My opinion though, reading between the lines of how this launch went not as well as expected, is that I think that Take Two has an emphasis on adding to the player count. People like us who bought the game and are frustrated with the bugs are not going to purchase another copy if they fix the bugs, but if they can greate some hype (like they did for For Science!), they can move a few more copies to people new to the franchise.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure Take Two has done the math on how players like us, who are frustrated with the bugs currently, might reccommend the game to others if they fixed the bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ll admit I\u0027ve never run a games publishing studio before, so I could be totally wrong, but in the jobs I have had where the task was to sell a product to as many customers as possible, we didn\u0027t sell objectively broken merchandise at 80% full price with capybara stickers all over it, lol.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-30T12:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224382262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221713963701\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meecrob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/24/2024 at 3:01 PM, Meecrob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... are not going to purchase another copy if they fix the bugs, ...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is where they are wrong in my opinion.
