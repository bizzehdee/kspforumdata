Let\u0027s take re-entry heating: the mechanics of \u0022part gets hot, part goes boom\u0022 with a simple heat gauge or flashing parts or something could have probably been integrated a lot earlier than what we got with \u0022For Science\u0022 with all the pretty plasma effects etc. Of course it looks cooler, but with the simple \u0022show me just a gauge of what goes wrong\u0022 mechanic you could have tested the math behind it and verify if your assumptions about how which parts will behave under thermal load. The way they did it was that everything had to be \u0022complete\u0022 before shipping it. Also kind of misunderstanding what Early Access should be. I don\u0027t know who made these calls for re-entry heating.

Health insurance, unemployment insurance (paid to the state to cover support payment should the employee be terminated), taxes, the overhead of hardware (as you called out), all factor into this. At Amazon, I believe we used an internal number of $300k/year average for the FBC of any \u0022professional\u0022 (non Fulfillment Center) employee, as the median total compensation (salary plus bonuses plus stock) for all employees below VP level was probably $225k/year (I could give breakdowns by role/experience level, but it\u0027s easy to Google or check on Glassdoor). Game engineers (and PMs, and UX folks) tend to be paid about 60-70% of the market rate for the same role in a non-entertainment company, based on my 25 years in software development in and out of games (that is to say, if I were to survey all the game studios at which I\u0027d worked, people made, on average 1/3rd less than they could have made at a non-game company in the same role).\u00A0 In case someone wants to nitpick, at the time Amazon \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E had a salary cap of $160k/year, but salary was a small percentage of total compensation for anyone approaching that cap, as stocks and bonuses could equal multiples of base salary at the Senior or Principal Engineer or Engineering Manager level.
