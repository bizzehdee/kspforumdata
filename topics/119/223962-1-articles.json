But I wonder, what if they\u0027re already teaching us something. Reports from at least three moons hint to some kind of exotic material. Minmus is ceramic, Gilly is \u0022sticky\u0022, Laythe has radioactive water. I can\u0027t remember any others off the top of my head. But now I\u0027m wondering if they\u0027re hints for resources coming in the explore update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my guess would be,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCeramic on Minmus, required to build high temperature rocket nozzles for water cooled solid hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe, radioactive water, can I dare to hope there will be a fissile salt water engine? If not then just a good place to build and refuel RTGs and reactors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what the sticky Gilly material could lead to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also guess the Moheart might give something specific. Maybe a metal that allows for powerful electromagnets, required for magnetic nozzle engines or perhaps magnetic contained fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m willing to bet that at the very least, Eve, Dres, and possibly Eeloo and more Jool moons would have something. Anyone remember seeing any material hints in the reports or mission debriefs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-06T00:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could see that.

My expectation is that the Mun and Minmus won\u0027t have anything too special, and will just be a local option for whatever resource supply Kerbin gives you for free, but perhaps in higher quantities. Idea being to kickstart colonies and orbital shipbuilding with local resources, much like how a \u0027real\u0027 industrialization of space would go. So structural metals, fuel components, and whatever else is required for that early game tier of parts would be relatively abundant, but radioactives or exotic stuff would be trace or absent - Enough to build ships that use nuclear power generation or small nuclear core engines, but not orions or similar nuclear heavy options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStretching past the immediate Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, things get pretty foggy as we don\u0027t know a lot about the latter part progression or colony materials yet. What I find unlikely is the idea that a world will have any material \u0027exclusive\u0027 to it, as opposed to just being the highest richness, or one of a set. Making the part tree a case of \u0022You cannot use your new engines because you haven\u0027t built a mine on the north pole of Tyloo\u0022 would go against a lot of the freedom that the game encourages in how you play and engage. Meanwhile, having the only real economical source of a given material be the Jool moons as a whole would be in line - Perhaps you can pull traces of it off Duna still, but if you want to be using this new material and its parts all over the place, you\u0027d have to start branching out. This way, you have options, and can pull out the \u0022expensive\u0022 engine for far flung missions like that, and once you\u0027ve established sites on those worlds, that engine goes from being the rare, expensive one you use conservatively, to one of your main drives for the game. A system that rewards without hardline mandates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also expecting a category of materials to be restricted almost entirely by colony development, and not just resource extraction. As of last we knew, Colonies would do more than just exist and launch ships, but would have their own sort of internal production and refining, such as the fuel buildings we saw. If I were in their shoes, there\u0027d be a whole chain of parts materials that isn\u0027t mined, but instead manufactured, to offer a consistent high performance but expensive option on the design charts. Exotic metamaterials, carbon nanotubes, antimatter production, metallic hydrogen, the sort of stuff that you\u0027re not just going to dig out casually from a world but instead need to invest significant time, energy, and colony development into building up a supply of. This provides both a reason to expand existing colonies beyond just \u0022its cool\u0022 and offers an escape valve for a player who feels truly stuck with the tools they have vs the challenges they face. If you just can\u0027t make a given mission work with your current material flow, and can\u0027t get out where they\u0027re more abundant, focusing your efforts on industrializing and bringing out that synthetic material option provides another path of advancement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall the player should be encouraged and incentivized to expand their space holdings and worlds they visit, but shouldn\u0027t be actively punished for not being \u0022good enough\u0022 to make a crazy mission on lackluster parts, and shouldn\u0027t feel like there\u0027s only one viable progression path for materials, worlds, and colonies. A theoretical \u0022Duna Rush\u0022 should be an option because it rapidly expands the players stocks of a given material, rather than because Duna has stuff the muns lack completely, that you need to colonize Eve, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only exception to this might be a form of unobtanium, right at the very end of the final interstellar tech tree. Providing something ridiculous at the hardest planet to reach in the hardest interstellar system to reach as a capstone for the entire gameplay experience wouldn\u0027t be a problem, as once you can do that by skill, effort, or advanced part selection, you\u0027re clearly at the \u0022Just having fun with it\u0022 stage of the save rather than the progression stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-06T15:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224370570\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709736860\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I find unlikely is the idea that a world will have any material \u0027exclusive\u0027 to it, as opposed to just being the highest richness, or one of a set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d definitely prefer more spread resources also. Actually, one of the things I find most interesting in real life are stellar distributions. I\u0027d love to see heavy metals be the most common in the inner system, slowly replaced by silicates through the middle and then water ice further out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely agree the basic resources will be available everywhere. Based on how they talk about setting up a base, I think every body will have some kind of base building material. Stuff like water, fissiles, carbons, I for sure agree will be available almost everywhere in varying richness.\u00A0I would like to see some stuff locked behind a large developed colony too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0But, I also expect those resources I mentioned weren\u0027t brought up in game for nothing.

Maybe available on only one or two planets in the Kerbal system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
