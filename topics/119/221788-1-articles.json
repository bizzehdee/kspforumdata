KSP 2 is probably never going to come to 8th generation consoles (let\u2019s hope that it does), but that means the game\u2019s systems and functionality (colonies and interstellar travel) were designed around the weak laptop cores from that generation and since the game is primarily CPU limited there is definitely a ton of room for optimization until the final release if it is ever going to ship to consoles and for many PC players to enjoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-23T04:55:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2023 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 23\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by yashasmaka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T01:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plans have changed. The old gen was barely enough to keep up with KSP1, with 2 you\u0027d see a bonfire. PS4 is already a decade old. The current gen is with us for 3 years now. By the time the game reaches consoles, roughly estimating, PS4 will be 13 years old.
