Steam has no realistic method to recoup any financial implications - Once a developer has collected their payout the only funds steam has theoretical access to is future purchases, which presumably they\u0027d also be banning in the case of a violation. So There\u0027s no money for them to take and refund. Steam would be stupid to refund out of their own pocket, as it\u0027d become an easy scam to sock buy games made with a throwaway company, get the payout, then get the refund later. And trying to debt it forward on the studio just means you\u0027d ditch an indebted studio name, at best - at the worst, you\u0027d be financially punishing a failed developer to discourage ever trying again. Whether you think that\u0027s a good thing or not is up to your discretion, but it will objectively reduce the ability for developers to bring games to the market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttempting more aggressive contractual terms for early access will just discourage developers from ever touching it - Why would you sign a document saying that the mob can bankrupt your company in two years if things go sideways and EA doesn\u0027t work out? You might think \u0022Oh but the terms will define what is and isn\u0027t acceptable\u0022 but then at best it\u0027ll be gamed to irrelevance and at worst it\u0027ll harm the unfortunate but natural failures. Besides, you can\u0027t really squeeze blood from a rock, and most EA failures are studio failures as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs awful as cases like KSP2 can be for EA, every other outcome is it doesn\u0027t exist and many projects die lacking that early financial lifeline. The only and most drastic action steam could take would be to forbid a developer from publishing further early access titles, but studio drop and rebuild would negate it anyway. Going after a publisher is no better as it\u0027d all but guarantee publishers drop EA options entirely, which again constrains projects as an entire avenue of early funding and market testing is just removed from their toolbox. It sucks to say it, but nebulous \u0022accountability to spirit\u0022 is just translated in business speak to \u0022Someone can arbitrarily torpedo a project based on how they feel\u0022, which is a contract you never sign, no matter how confident you are that you won\u0027t intentionally screw someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve me, my KSP2 review has been like 6\u002B paragraphs documenting how terrible the state of the game is for the last year, with edits over the science update, and only just got another paragraph edited in to explain the studios dead and shuttered.

For every KSP2, you have games like Project Zomboid, Manor Lords, Cosmoteer, Blade and Sorcery, Nebulous: Fleet Command, Terra Invicta, Valheim, and thats just the ones in my library I\u0027ve played since the start of the year \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
