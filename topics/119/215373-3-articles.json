We\u0027ve just barely started to see the tip of this with the addition of the SWERV, which currently renders the NERV near-obsolete.

Realism in mechanics can lead to more fun and emergent gameplay, but it can also discourage both new and experienced players who become overwhelmed by the complexity There\u0027s no consensus on which of these features would actually benefit the game, or how they should be implemented; ask 10 players which is which and you\u0027ll get 11 different answers.

Stuff like realizing your suicide burn was more suicide than planned for, and the Rapid Unplanned Disassembly that somehow didn\u0027t end the mission, but made the return trip fun in the Dwarf Fortress sense of the word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T13:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225122-dakota/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225122\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225122-dakota/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dakota\u003C/a\u003E will you record the questions and answers then publish here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheehaw Kerman","CreatedById":223516,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T14:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Will you be bringing the Kerbal personal parachutes back? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Big_Sad","CreatedById":228051,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T15:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any plans for a Career Mode?
