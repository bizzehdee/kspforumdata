The $50 price tag set expectations for quality which were not at all met at the time of release. They disappointed their user base to the point it is going to take a No Man\u0027s Sky level of effort to get them back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarn it (Finally, For Science) is a giant step in the right direction. It\u0027ll take longer than one release to rebuild the confidence the community has in Intercept, but it\u0027s encouraging that the product is moving in the right direction. I think it\u0027s still a bit early to declare victory:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow solid is Exploration mode which is basically a tweaked Science Mode \u002B Exciting Contracts? Everyone loves it \u003Cem\u003Eright now\u003C/em\u003E, but we\u0027re like a thirsty man in the desert at this point. It\u0027s easy to satisfy a community starved from \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E game play with \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E game play. I hope it has staying power\u2014and the Easter Egg missions certainly look promising\u2014but half a week of play is not going to tell us how it will be in the long run\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug\u2013wise the game has progressed from unplayable to unenjoyable to \u0022ok-ish with some annoyances.\u0022 Some of the biggest dealbreakers are gone, but others are still there. My fear\u2014likely unfounded but still there\u2014is that we now get a \u0022mission accomplished, let\u0027s put this on the backburner\u0022 approach to bugs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations to Intercept are deserved. Good job \u003Cem\u003Ebut keep it up\u003C/em\u003E. I think everyone agrees that where we are now is where we should have been 10 months ago before severely upsetting a large part of the community. But keep in mind that that community was in fact expecting \u003Cem\u003Ea release that needs work\u003C/em\u003E (just not the S-show we got). And that\u0027s what we have now. 0.2 still needs a lot of work to be \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E. But it\u0027s a whole lot better than what we had before and if progress continues like it has in the past 3 months we\u0027ll end up with a great game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-22T03:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224350228\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703214606\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBug\u2013wise the game has progressed from unplayable to unenjoyable to \u0022ok-ish with some annoyances.\u0022 Some of the biggest dealbreakers are gone, but others are still there.

I tried my Mun rescue mission in Sandbox in .20. This was the first time I was able to complete it because only one of my landers fell over at physics load instead of both of them. The one that stood merely spun 90 degrees and wobbled. I spent half an hour trying to get a ladder to work on a Gumball lander before giving up. I\u0027m worried a lot is going to get swept under the rug in the push to move forward because people won\u0027t be looking at these systems while engaged in Exploration mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
