Meh.\u00A0 Unless they were unlockable as a new type of character instead of kerbals, then what would be the point?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been thinking about what HarvesteR said in his MattLowne interview and other comments from LGG et al. in the ShadowZone interview as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Kerbal Colony Program would be a new start, way forward, even prequelish?\u00A0 The story line lore could be colonies existed in the past but in game establishes no reason these were abandoned, but ruins can be Easter eggs to find.\u00A0 The game is set after an eon when kerbals start to rebuild a space program initially with what is found on the side of the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame play wise, the KCP should be a zoning city builder type game, kind of like Boca Chica but without the locals.\u00A0 You starting with zoning accomodation, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and a launchsite .\u00A0 You select a landscape where you then zone areas for launch sites, buildings, etc.\u00A0 There are some sort of investment costs, perhaps based on rep or number of workers. Procedural building types perhaps?\u00A0 You need infrastructure, houses, amenities, R\u0026amp;D, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Launch pads.\u00A0 Workers are a resource. More workers, faster builds, but you manage requests for jobs against ability to house workers.\u00A0 Speed of rocket builds, reasearch etc based on number of workers and resources.\u00A0 Don\u0027t do much building or reasearch, or it gets too crowded, workers go away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can even select WHERE on Kerbin you locate the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to get rep, show you are doing something... build sounding rockets, orbital rockets etc.\u00A0 Build a racetrack and test rovers.\u00A0 Using parts should contribute to science/research points too, but cumulatively somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonies elsewhere would work in the same way.\u00A0 You land, and start zoning.\u00A0 Once buildings are set then you have to attract workers for a colony.\u00A0 There is always a minimum number of workers who just want to be there, but using a colony more will mean more workers will want to go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the zoning mechanic is like a first step.\u00A0 Building rockets is a second step.\u00A0 You should be able to fly, drive around your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 For an Early Access possibility, start the colony on the Mun. Focus on getting this mechanic good without having to worry about atmosphere (or planes). Add in Kerbin and other planets in milestone update so that you have the atmosphere stuff to deal with.\u00A0 Add in other planets even later.\u00A0 R\u0026amp;D colonies by Easter eggs should be bonues for research and attracting workers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, my thoughts on this.\u00A0 Peace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-25T18:44:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2024 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 25\u0022\u003EMay 25\u003C/time\u003E by theJesuit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
