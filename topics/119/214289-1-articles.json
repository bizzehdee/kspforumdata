Assuming the first EA release had no bugs and performed well.. what is there to explore in the game? Well, not a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe celestial bodies look good when seen from far away / high orbit, which really makes them unique and interesting. But when you get closer the terrain is not great. It will probably be improved with higher resolution textures and more polygons when the performance budget will be available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I have done complete visual orbital surveys of all the planets and moons searching for anomalies or special terrain features that stand out. I have found very few.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems that, at least for now, there is not much creative content in the game. I don\u0027t see reasons to hop a lander or drive a rover or fly a plane around looking for interesting stuff. It\u0027s just not there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou basically have 1.. or maybe 2 interesting and unique things to see on each planet or moon. Other than that, yes there are some biomes like craters, hills, valleys, mountains. But there is nothing special there, no interesting scatter, no fascinating natural objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planets and moons feel as barren and empty as KSP1... for now. And this is a surprise because the devs always said in the feature videos (paraphrasing): \u0022the planets are great, everyone\u0027s gonna love the planets\u0022.. \u0022exploration is a much bigger motivation now\u0022 .. \u0022some of the things the creative team is cooking up.. it will blow you away\u0022 etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just feels like a great waste of space, with no real reason to go exploring over the next hill. There should be more \u0022wow\u0022 moments than just arriving at a nice looking planet with beautiful music and landing once. Hopefully more content will be added (the Duna and Tylo anomalies are very high quality and the Vall place is very interesting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease limit the camera zoom-out when in low orbit\u003C/strong\u003E. We can basically zoom out and move the camera close to the ground anywhere. It kind of spoils the fun of landing and roving. The zoom is limited when landed, I think this should also apply in low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-03T16:27:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2023 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T15:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I was hoping for more scatter like in the show and tell video\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TqmdNgah4Co?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 Show and Tell - Terrain Progress\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is more than the original stock KSP 1... but it still feels barren\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T15:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol is the best for now.
