Once upon a time, the regulars of the forum proved to me here that professionals with serious funding from one of the largest game publishers got down to business. And the first part was developed by only a few people from the advertising company, I don\u2019t even know if they had the necessary education.

The scope expansion and associated delays would have also put management pressure to get out and get something. KSP2 was starting to threaten to look like a money pit from which nothing was coming. Lockdowns would have amplified this, cratering productivity for 2-6 months as teams suddenly learn a new way of working and coordinating, and team members develop techniques and spaces to properly focus while working at home. Eventually, it snapped, and the call was made that its gotta release by a drop dead date. This call was probably made too late for the team to prioritize away from building \u0027all the things\u0027 and shift over to \u0022Ok we just need KSP1 functions\u0022.

Which is why my litmus test of how much of a disaster this is will come from the first couple patches - both cadence, and focus. If they\u0027re relatively prompt (Measured in weeks, not months) up to the science release, then it indicates they were really just spread out and only had to focus on polish and the \u0027start\u0027 point very recently. If they\u0027re also of good quality and fix more issues than they introduce, then it reinforces the idea that they just didn\u0027t focus much on the quality at the time - it was \u0027good enough\u0027 implementation to support the other core pillars they were working on, so the assorted issues weren\u0027t as important as getting X working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe got what we wanted, a huge game super early in development, and its a disaster.

It makes for wobbly rockets, things being ejected at light speed and the Kraken. It\u0027s what made Kerbal the game it is, probably the most realistic space engineering simulator game. It also made KSP 1 very CPU bound, KSP 2 is like a heavily environment moded KSP 1 which has finally started stressing the GPU too, the fuel system also is part of the physics. In KSP 1 it was having issues as well, years after release, it\u0027s easy to find the posts, as were part counts, which often went up and down according to the latest patch, or fairings glitching, wheels not working correctly, they had a whole release just around adding a\u00A0 new wheel plugin and then spent forever tuning it.
