In Kopernicus, you can make planets pretty quickly if you have a height map and a surface texture on hand. Over the years of development, artists could make many hundreds and thousands of planets. But they would be rather boring and monotonous, if you do not add any interactive objects to them. Well, in life, for example, the satellites of the giant planets are rather boring and monotonous round pieces of stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-04T21:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224269004\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216193\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221680640260\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor maybe they refused because they knew what working with Intercepts poached management team was like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that 2/3s of them left makes me feel like this wasn\u0027t the case for most of them.
