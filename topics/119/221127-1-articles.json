approachability, both in terms of features but also yes in terms of tone too. It\u0027s like the \u0022losing is fun\u0022 mythos of dwarf fortress where when you start out it\u0027s ok that everything is going very wrong because that\u0027s part of the charm of the game, and then you get to a point where you can though brute force achieve anything, and with the end game of once you get really good, you\u0027re able to play out things seriously and impressively and in the way you want. The big difference being that the UX kinda made doing a lot of high concept things easy to eyeball rather than being made out of two jumbled up typewriters and requiring a wiki to turn the game on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2\u0027s UI has a bit of a way to go to become as dumbass friendly as KSP1, and honestly KSP1 has gotten pretty cluttered the last few updates. I feel like both games have also drifted towards the assumption that the playerbase understand the underlying stuff what the game is doing a lot more as a result of trying to provide better tools for veteran players, and that might be true or it might not be, but it\u0027s still pretty good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chefsbrian","CreatedById":41508,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-19T13:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea, this is probably as close to a like for like comparison as we\u0027ll have anytime soon. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E resource harvesting is the only directly ship related mechanic that\u0027s missing for an apples to apples comparison, and assuming it arrives at the same time as the general resource system, we\u0027ll have colonies and interstellar parts making a like to like near impossible. Alongside the general content depth comparison. For what its worth, I don\u0027t see depth as a problem - I\u0027d much rather 5 science parts in a science system that works, than 50 in one that\u0027s broken. Because if the system works, adding more parts to it later is a relative breeze, and if I don\u0027t want to wait, modding can take advantage of a system that actually works already. Meanwhile if the system just doesn\u0027t exist or doesn\u0027t work right, then it doesn\u0027t matter what you add to it, its still too scuffed to actually use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine Colonies and orbital construction will single handedly put KSP2 well outside of easy comparison to KSP1, just from what that opens up. Right now, the game chugs trying to launch massive nightmare ships through atmosphere, and we lack a variety of heavy lifting tools to really put stuff into the stars. Orbital assembly neatly sidesteps that entire ball of yarn and puts your NERVA stack into space wholesale, no docking ports or launch reinforcement required. Trying to draw design comparisons at that point is gonna be moot, as the possibility space changes so radically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
