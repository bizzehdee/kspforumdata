Been gone a long time but, as they say with smokers, nobody quits forever. It\u0027s been nice to see so many familiar screen names still here; and just as nice to see so many new players as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor myself, after 4,000 hours or so, I finally moved on from KSP and decided to tackle the dozens of games I have and never even tried (a lot of them I never even downloaded). Some of them were really good, but KSP is the ex you just can\u0027t stop thinking about. And ever since KSP2 was announced, the rocket launching bug was in my brain and just wouldn\u0027t let go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I violated my own, long-standing, personal rule to never, under any circumstances, buy an early access game. The moment it was announced I said I would do so, and even the bad word of mouth on the forum didn\u0027t stop me. Though I didn\u0027t buy KSP until the official 1.0 release, I bought Making History the moment it was released (which I thought was worth it). I did the same with Breaking Ground (which was excellent). This is to say that I\u0027m a long-time fan, and I don\u0027t mind spending money to support my rocket habit; as well as the people who make that habit possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I bought this game. And, honestly, I don\u0027t regret it. I don\u0027t even regret the crazy, spur of the moment, decision to finally leave laptop gaming behind and take MicroCenter up on their 3 years no interest for new PC\u0027s. I wanted to experience this game (and others) in glorious 4k. I spent more than I would\u0027ve liked, but I definitely got my money\u0027s worth (and only 32 more payments\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the game? I\u0027m running at 4k, all settings on high, so everything looks really good. And, as everyone seems to agree, the sound is great. The bugs? I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to sugarcoat it; they\u0027re bad. You can work around a lot of it, though. And patches can take care of those eventually. But the actual game play? That was what did it for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a plane or spaceplane guy, and I\u0027ve never played anything but career mode, so I find that there\u0027s surprisingly little to do. I can go to any one of the planets or moons I\u0027ve been to literally hundreds of times to see their new face-lifts, but that doesn\u0027t really excite me as much as it probably should. Without any progression or incentive, I found myself completely listless. Since Jool is the easiest planet to eyeball a transfer, I decided to send a lander to Bop. Couldn\u0027t tell you what the surface looked like, cuz I flew right through it. Ended up at negative 5km when I killed the mission and started over. Kept it simple and went to Minmus (my favorite refueling station in my early days). There, I can at least tell you what the surface looked like. Absolutely beautiful. Icy was my first thought. But there was no real feeling. Very anticlimactic. And there was more of that to come. I set off for home and hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and... nothing. I knew that reentry heating was not enabled yet, but it was still a serious disappointment. I think we all get that feeling after a successful or really difficult mission, when you hit Kerbin and see your ship cooking on the way in. Wondering what\u0027s going to burn off and blow up or whether you\u0027re gonna survive reentry at all (my personal record is just over 8km/s; nail-biting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough it seems a bit strange, I can get used to the new UI (especially with key mapping). The look and feel of the game is surely going to change over time. I\u0027m looking forward to Thursday\u0027s patch as much as the next guy, but I\u0027ve played enough now to know that the next\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epatch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0isn\u0027t gonna help me. I need the next\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eversion\u003C/em\u003E. One in which they add some of the missing features. A mode other than sandbox (some kind of progression), reentry heating (a must), and preferably colonies and additional solar systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, I\u0027ve got the itch again. So I went online, found a bunch of visual mods, and loaded up KSP1. Just the music on the title screen (which I\u0027ve literally heard 1,000 times) put me in a good mood. Started a new career, launched my first tiny rocket from the burnt patch of ground that you start with, and I was having fun again. I honestly think I would\u0027ve paid 50 bucks for a KSP1 remaster with all the glitzy new graphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy feeling is that, when enough bugs have been squashed and features have been added, player count will start to rise. My plan is to check in on each new update to see what\u0027s what, then probably had back to KSP1 til it\u0027s been surpassed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich finally brings me back to the point. Did you revert back to KSP1 also? If so, what was the deal-breaker? The performance? The bugs? Missing features? All of the above? Or something else entirely? And if you\u0027re still on KSP2, what keeps you going? Other than sights and sounds, what do you feel is better than the original? I\u0027m having a hard time seeing anything, but maybe I\u0027m just missing. Lemme know what you guys think. And sorry for the long post. Been reading everyone else\u0027s posts and trying to\u00A0 think what I wanted to say. Took me a while to put it together.\u00A0 Thanks for reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RaBDawG","CreatedById":206005,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T01:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with everything said in this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T01:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPer steamdb, KSP1 has seen a noticeable bump in daily players roughly since the launch of KSP2.\u00A0 Could be the advertising, could be what happened with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T01:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.

I\u0027ve already freely conceded that the graphics of the sequel is better than the original. To that, I would also say that the effects in the new Star Wars trilogy is superior to that of the original Star Wars trilogy (yes I realize 35 years is not 12 years, but you get my meaning). When you consider the advances between the releases (not to mention the money spent), than they absolutely should look superior. But that doesn\u0027t make them necessarily better. I\u0027m not saying that this game won\u0027t surpass the original. I absolutely believe it will, eventually. But I\u0027m wondering what you think is better right now.

KSP2\u0027s entire experience ruined KSP1 for me and that\u0027s due to one reason:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sound design of the rockets (Which no mod comes close to KSP2\u0027s) and the music.

Same with the rocket plumes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe overhauled planets. Again, modded KSP2 looks good, and when it comes to surface scatter, Parallax beats out KSP2. However, each planet has more distinct features and they\u0027re a bit more unique. I still get a kick out of it every time I land on the Mun or Minmus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, it\u0027s the overall feeling and experience that KSP2 offers that, in my opinion, blows the original title out of the water. Yes, it has some serious issues but they can be worked around. Not going to lie... 8 fps launches reminds me of the good ol days of KSP1 during 0.20.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I tried going back to KSP1, I just couldn\u0027t enjoy it as much.

Only ever played KSP1 in career for this reason - and that feeling of progression massively lacking for me in KSP2 when I can just build whatever I want with any parts, and have no real reason to go anywhere yet. Exploration is cool and all, I get the motivation, but it\u0027s just not enough for my tastes. Like you, the lack of reentry drama really does detract something important from the sense of returning from a hard, dangerous mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, often I found when I was exploring, I\u0027d notice interesting things and want to check them out - yet also get a feeling that I wanted to \u0027save\u0027 the exploration for a proper structured playthrough. Weird, maybe, but it almost felt like I\u0027d be giving myself spoilers by exploring things in a full sandbox mode. Like, I want to visit the other planets and see what they\u0027re like. But without any constraints on my actions it just feels, to me, almost like I\u0027d be cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 does have just so much more \u0027stuff\u0027 due to the modding community. More parts than you could ever need, interesting new components and mechanics to give even more structure / reason to launch missions or visit the worlds. Comparing the two games might be unfair, given how long the community has developed mods, but it is a big difference all the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, KSP2 does have a lot going for it too (without repeating all the arguments about the current state). I\u0027d forgotten what it felt like to have a KSP game load up in a few seconds, there\u0027s a range of quality of life features so to me it just feels more \u0027comfortable\u0027 (for want of a better word).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see the appeal of going back, modded KSP1 is just so much \u0027more\u0027 right now, so much bigger, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil the science / progression systems arrive, I\u0027ll probably not be putting a ton of hours into KSP2, I think - just bits here and there. But I also don\u0027t feel too inclined to return to KSP1 either. I have other games to play, and will play them instead - while dropping back in on KSP2 from time to time to keep up with updates and so on, until I feel there\u0027s enough there for my personal tastes to do a proper playthrough. Whilst trying to contribute to the community if I can.

In KSP 1 ion engines were near unusable since you would have to leave your computer running for half an hour to complete one burn. With KSP 2 though, I can easily complete an hour long burn in roughly less then a minute, making ion engines way more practical for actual use. KSP 2 still has a long way to go, but they seriously nailed this feature at the very least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T01:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258941\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215006\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678810447\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223516\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wheehaw Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Wheehaw Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly went back to KSP1 to check framerates on my new machine. \u00A0I\u2019ve been almost everywhere and done a lot in KSP1. \u00A0There\u2019s very little novelty and challenge there for me anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is pretty funny, cuz I actually did the same thing.
