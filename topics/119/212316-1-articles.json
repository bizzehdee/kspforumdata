In addition, at some point during development, I think around the time comm networks were added, that the devs mounted a community bug-hunting contest and those of us who had submitted detailed bug reports that provided usable info to correct the bug got entered into a random drawing to name a Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my questions is, did those legacy names get kept \u201Cin circulation\u201D to appear when we recruit random new Kerbals to our crew in KSP 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
