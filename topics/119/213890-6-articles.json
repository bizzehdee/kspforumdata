It should have been pretty obvious that the release would be rather bad and that people would be very negative - so im concerend because the release was done anyways especially since the game is funded by a rather big Publisher so the use of EA (usually for funding etc.) doesnt make much sense to me. For example they\u00A0 could have just released the game at 1.0 in the future and used things like open/public alpha etc. to get feedback - or pre-orders with beta/alpha access, or EA release at an EA price etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont think that you are in the right - when people are dissapointed and its about their hobby and a franchise they are a fan of for years their dissapointed obivously will become a bit emotional and exaggerated - i wouldnt assume that thats in bad faith - its just people beeing emotional about their hobbys and games they like. I also dont think that there is clear communication - we neither know the actual state of the game (is the EA build released just a part or everything except unused models etc?), we dont know what realistically is a timeframe for a release at all?, we dont know how much time and money is planned to be invested so we have no idea how a final product can even look - obviously they cant give definitive answers but some clues would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in the end - isnt that what makes a hobby a hobby and a fan a fan?
