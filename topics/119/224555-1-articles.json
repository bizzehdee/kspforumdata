Now I do understand higher speed is require to cover greater distance, but keep a satellite in orbit shouldn\u0027t have anything to do with coverage, your distance away from the planet is what allows to cover more/less.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth polar orbits/equator orbits should be covering the same amount, and maybe a little more at the equator because of the earth rotation, now why I\u0027m pretty confused about is that the earth\u0027s equator has\u00A0 a way higher distance around it then a polar orbit so technically it should have a way higher velocity to keep it in orbit.\u00A0 The only thing that I can seem to think that would be the answer to this is an angle on the satellites trajectory, but it would need to be corrected over and over and over to even maintain it in orbit, and it wouldn\u0027t even have anything to do with drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif anyone can possibly answer this, it would greatly be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-23T05:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere are you seeing different speeds?

I soon learnt a better way\u00A0 is to launch due North (or South), and perform a similar launch profile as for an equatorial orbit but with a different direction. This brings the spacecraft on an orbit close enough to polar so that correction maneuvers are cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe optimal launch profile is to compensate for the planet\u0027s rotation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
