I often have my camera transported to some unhelpful place while tediously trying to move to some part of the vehicle because I accidentally middle clicked somewhere I shouldn\u0027t have - it doesn\u0027t even seem to have to be on a part!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn that note: Middle click \u002B drag is an awful way to have to move up and down the rocket. I\u0027d rather the scroll wheel just be used for scrolling up and down, maybe with a modifier key to zoom in/out when that\u0027s needed. I think changing scale as you\u0027re working on something is going to be useful less often than changing position, so the position controls should be more convenient than they are now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving the part manager\u00A0as one big window with all the parts sorted by type isn\u0027t actually useful for what the part info is usually being used for. For instance, if you\u0027re clicking on wings you typically are trying to focus on aerodynamics, trim, control surface deflections, etc. You don\u0027t need electrical charge or reaction wheels in the same menu.\u00A0If you\u0027re clicking on fuel tanks, you want to organize them by stage, not by the ID of the parts. The menus in KSP1 were intuitive by pointing info to all respective parts with little lines...Having all the parts nebulously pop up into a single generic window off to the side is unintuitive.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEverything \u0027jumping\u0027 or \u0027teleporting\u0027 around when you click stuff is unintuitive as to what you\u0027re doing. In KSP1 things like the stages in the staging bar would glide along with your mouse as you dragged them along. In KSP2 it\u0027s hard to tell where something is going to end up when you try to drag it, and you only find out after you\u0027ve moved it there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to move individual parts around in the staging menu, for instance trying to set up asparagus staging with 4x symmetric boosters. The menu is really strange about letting me split up those engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlacing fuel lines and struts is really weird, for some reason I find the fuel lines much harder to place than in KSP1. The struts and fuel lines are also kind of hard to delete/\u0027throw away\u0027 sometimes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs I was moving a set of parachutes to a different stage, the set \u0027collapsed\u0027 in the staging menu to show \u0027X number of parachutes\u0027 together in a single box. I needed to click on it again each time to show the individual parachutes before I could move another one, and that slowed me down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on the staging menu is too small a font, it doesn\u0027t give itself enough pixels on my screen to show itself well and I really have to squint at it to figure out what it says.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMap view kind of goes nuts if you look down from the north pole, I have to watch out for that when looking at phase angles\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe map view scrolls really slowly for some reason when you look up from the south, and doesn\u0027t let you get all the way to the south pole with the camera. I don\u0027t see a need to prevent us from going there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAscending and descending nodes not showing up if they\u0027re underground/behind me on a suborbital trajectory is unhelpful, because I still want to manipulate and keep track of them during flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe parts manager lists all the fuel tanks but doesn\u0027t seem to be able to show how much fuel is in them. I\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or if I\u0027ve just missed some other way to get that information. I haven\u0027t been able to tell which fuel tanks are being drained on a complex vessel. If it\u0027s not a bug, then why have the fuel tanks listed there, taking up space?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe targeted object\u0027s orbit line should be highlighted like in KSP1. I have a lot of things in low equatorial orbit and it\u0027s hard to pick out the line I\u0027m trying to match.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe targeted vessel should show its relative distance at all times when clicked/highlighted in map view. Otherwise I don\u0027t get that information quantitatively until it\u0027s within 50 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s difficult to change the order of stages in the staging menu. Again, weird teleporty elements needing to be brought to unclear locations on the screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScenes like the map view and flight view don\u0027t remember how far zoomed in or out they were, or what direction they were facing. This leads to a lot of unwanted scrolling while doing things that require switching in and out of map view frequently, like landing on a planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen I click on an \u0027intercept\u0027 for a targeted vessel and hover over it, the first digit of the distance value tends to be covered up by my mouse.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of random things I\u0027d like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere should be a display for the phase angle between planets somewhere in the map view/tracking station. Even if the game doesn\u0027t reveal what the ideal phase angle is for transfers, or dates when transfer windows occur, displaying the phase angle would finally free me from having to literally hold up a protractor to my screen to go to other planets in stock KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen I was working on my Duna transfer today, I had the idea that the maneuver creation tool could get some more \u0027smarts\u0027 to it. Instead of blindly inputting a maneuver vector, you could simply tell it to set up a Hohmann transfer from Kerbin to Duna based on your current orbit around Kerbin, and it could line up the timing based on your thrust and whether you want to transfer on the next orbit or at the most optimal time, or someplace in between.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-29T02:29:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2023 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 29\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T02:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be making more specific critiques over the next few weeks but I will say Im not a great fan of the pixelated aesthetic.

The whole point of a maneuver \u0022plan\u0022 in my view is that it\u0027s just a plan, not a precise program that must be executed exactly. As an example from my KSP1 campaign, I captured an asteroid and set it up in a 60Mm Kerbin orbit as a refueling station for interplanetary travel. If I wanted to plan a trip from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to Duna, I\u0027d look for an intercept path that also brought me close to the asteroid, but finding such a path naturally requires creating a maneuver node with a longer burn time than the craft can accommodate without refueling. Once I have that plan, I can then refine it to add the refueling stop, but I need a way to make the rough plan in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBetter fine control over maneuver vectors is needed, whether scrolling on the handle icons like in KSP1, a numeric vector editor, or some other interface.
