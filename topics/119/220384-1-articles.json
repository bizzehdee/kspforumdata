I appreciate both Matt for asking some tough questions and Nate for his straightforward responses. I\u2019d like to affirm his comment that the negativity and worry was directed at the game and not at any individual, at least from me. And if science does the show part of show don\u2019t tell I\u2019m fairly confident they\u2019ll win back most of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy one little gripe is that it was said EA was chosen for player feedback. This still doesn\u2019t make sense to me, I really feel they had to know how broken the game was at launch (heck the previews weren\u2019t early access keys to the game but come here and play on these very powerful and known spec computers) but if science is good I can leave that in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy feedback would be if you really want EA for feedback please start taking some universal requests and also communicate a bit more before updates. The wobbly conversation I think has been directed by feedback and I appreciate that. And I like the parts manager, but please please bring back opening a specific part by right clicking. That I think is as near a universal request as exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it\u2019s much easier to steer development in line with feedback if the feedback is open before all the programming is done. By this I mean if you want feedback on colonies start telling us how colonies work sometime before it launches. That said, I see how until this point there hasn\u2019t been as much to have feedback on, and if balancing and ideas bounced off the community after science is released are impactful on development this gripe will mostly go away.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for this more open communication, thanks even more for going \u201Cunderpromise overdeliver\u201D as we approach the delivery part.

I don\u0027t work in the industry but I do work around Agile software engineering. I can see how 80% of big games out there are basically the same and how KSP2 is novel in many ways. That\u0027s why we love it and why we\u0027re excited about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlatformers, first-person shooters, open-world exploration, and real-time strategy. They\u0027ve been done many times before. I reckon an experienced developer could put a pretty good estimate in terms of sprint points on how long it would take to develop a new level in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E 14 (Modern Warfare 5) for instance, or to develop a new diplomatic feature in Civilisation 8.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, how long is it going to take (for example) to develop a new manoeuver system which (unlike KSP1) double-integrates the acceleration over time in two orders, taking into account staging and mass changes, and god knows how many other external dependencies, to figure out a predicted orbit after burn; present it in a user-friendly way; and provide tools to support execution?\u00A0 When you think about the engineering challenges, re-designing that particular system so that it supports long and slow interstellar burns (DAWN-like) is actually a real headache with a lot of dependencies and unknowns, which hasn\u0027t been done in gaming before. The KSP1 equivalent now looks trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s just one example - I\u0027m sure there\u0027s others. The mechanics for interstellar, time-warp enabled multiplayer while simultaneously supporting automated colony/resource routes are a bit mind-bending.\u00A0 And I suspect they\u0027ve been re-building all the base systems to support that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m not surprised that estimating on this job is an absolute nightmare. We had an equivalent in our business recently - on a multi-million pound programme, where we\u0027re supplying subsystems into to a high-profile larger system, we under-estimated by a factor of three the complexity of doing one particular work package because we didn\u0027t understand the problem well enough. And a supplier to us, to whom we\u0027d passed derived requirements, fluffed it even worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-29T12:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem with estimation is that it\u2019s basically guesswork until you know your team\u2019s velocity.
