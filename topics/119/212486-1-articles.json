Holding middle mouse and moving up and down pans along the length of the aircraft. But this seems to have broken the middle-click on a part scheme, if you middle click on a part and then rotate the camera, this will cause the camera to snap back to where the panning has placed the origin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new panning is great but I think the \u0022dream\u0022 for this UI would be both the middle click and the middle-mouse dragging adjust the rotation origin. I\u0027m thinking there is never a case where the camera snaps back when you rotate it and instead always rotates around what you\u0027re currently looking at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: as I use the new system more I think it continues to show issues. Since you are middle-clicking to move the camera around you almost certainly end up middle clicking on a part, this snaps the camera to it then you start moving the mouse which rotates the camera with horizontal movement. So the camera snaps almost every time unless you\u0027re deliberate to place the mouse somewhere besides ontop of the craft when you start the click and drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-16T23:37:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2023 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by adamzl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jup","CreatedById":184597,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T07:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this is the right place to bring it up, but I am having enormous difficulty even adjusting to the new mechanism.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI despise click-drag to change camera views and would really like to be able to change it to the KSP1 style of looking around!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
