If you watched the video, it\u0027s clear that communication about KSP2 progress was filtered\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0T2 and significantly throttled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNate was allowed to share his vision and enthusiasm with us. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027d be able to share the hurdles of the project even if he were fully aware and able to communicate them. Which, again, should have been up to production and technical leadership.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo please, go through and point at where Nate has been lying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevie_D","CreatedById":103007,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-24T20:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/112420-shadowzone/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112420\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ShadowZone\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I tried to help the algorithm by leaving a comment on your channel, but ill say it again here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you very much for the time, effort, dedication, impartiality, and integrity you gave to making that video.
