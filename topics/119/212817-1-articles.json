Dell XPS 8700. (u7 @ 3.6 GHz but I assume those are not todays gigahertzes) \u002B GTX 745. Laugh at me, I don\u0027t care. I also have a house and two cars to pay for, and a family to feed. And you know what, that potatoe runs as fine as frog hair for everything else I need. I did upgrade memory to 32 GB some time ago, and decided to be adventurous and order KSP2 because, well, I\u0027ll end up buying it somehwere \u003Cem\u003Eanyway\u003C/em\u003E. Besides, with some luck it\u0027ll appear on GFN and then I can run it on a chad machine anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, how does it run on that GTX 745? Well, I can tell you: absolutely atrocious. Even panning around is impossible; move the mouse one sliver, and by the time the screen is updated your view has rotated anywhere between 90\u00B0 and 180\u00B0 degrees. And then Scott Manley mentioned that performance really isn\u0027t that bad, even on older machines, provided they have a decent video card. I have no illusions on the decency of that tiny 745.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I did some \u0022research\u0022 (mostly Youtube) and what cards I \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Eput that potato of mine. Turns out a GTX-1660 Ti is just fine, and those are sor sale for just a smidge over $200. Maybe other cards are better, but I didn\u0027t videos of people running \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E on their 87, so a trip to Microcenter later and my desktop now sports, for my standards, a chad video card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd guess what? KSP2 runs buttery smooth! Sure, I launch small vessels (I always do), and I have no clue what the frame rate is. Could be 20 FPS for all I care, it looks smooth to \u003Cem\u003Eme.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose performance horror stories seem quite a bit overrated to me, thankfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
