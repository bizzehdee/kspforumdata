for about two years, because 1.0 was a train-wreck due to performance and interface. \u00A0Beta testing occurred in several rounds, where our game progression was volatile. \u00A0We spent about a week to two stress testing and bug hunting each round as\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efinished\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0systems were sequentially brought online. \u00A0When we were done, and Naoki was satisfied, then he asked us to renew our subscriptions, and I was happy to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom that experience, cross-referenced with videos and forum posts by my fellow Kerbonaughts, I suggest this game is in a very loose alpha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou cannot morally ask consumers to pay finished-product value for an unfinished-product, let alone a product that is still in alpha, or even beta. \u00A0Early access does not mean an alpha or beta release; it means you think the product is ready to launch. \u00A0We go through this every time we release an expansion in Final Fantasy; and sure we find some bugs, and a massive hot fix comes out in a week, but at its core it performs\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewell,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and is ready to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not agree that we can soundly compare KSP1 to KSP2. \u00A0Squad was a couple of guys in their garage (initially.) \u00A0It takes me a long time to do something, even after I decide to throw a whole week at it. \u00A0Take 2 is major league. \u00A0The expectations are justifiably different, and when you\u2019re this big, you don\u2019t get any passes, because you\u2019re supposed to know better. \u00A0I do not have the answer to this question, but I would be curious to know how many manhours went into one game versus the other. \u00A0That would be a nice datapoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this decision to request an exchange of value for alpha test was a financial one, and folly at that. \u00A0Here\u2019s what happens next, I think: they\u2019ll get what they have working, call it 1.0, then Interstellar and Colonies will be their own paid DLCs. \u00A0I hope I\u2019m

Those 2019 \u0022promises\u0022, assuming they said anything about promises, are outdated and invalid. Look at the up-to-date facts. They focused a lot more heavily on fundamental problems like high-speed collisions and calculating constant thrust trajectories, rather than taking the Squad route of adding mediocre feature on top of mediocre feature and keeping players interested through exploiting a short-term interest in novelty updates. Squad had 0 excuse to deliver planets six years before even thinking of adding a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator. Zero! You are entitled to think what you think but frankly the last thing I want to see is KSP 2 doing what Squad did and keeping a playerbase through novelty updates. Again, Squad added planets before they had the smegging readouts needed to determine if you can go to them. Half a decade before you had said smegging readouts! Half a decade of functionality \u0026lt; novelty! That\u0027s disgusting, frankly! And I\u0027m happy Intercept is focusing on these foundational features than things that are useless without that foundation! Just look at NERVs, Squad never added a different, less dense fuel source for them, and that ended up breaking them. NERVs could consume liquid fuel as if they were something a lot less dense, and could share it with other engines. That made them simply broken and frankly I\u0027m surprised that I nor anyone else noticed this nor were more fussed about this. Gross mistakes like that being avoided is PRECISELY why I\u0027ve been awaiting KSP 2 and I\u0027m getting exactly what I wished for. A foundation that isn\u0027t grossly undercooked.

KSP 2 is missing gameplay features, but at least it\u0027s functional unlike KSP 1 where people have gotten so used to all the places it\u0027s broken in that the slightest bit of criticism towards it riles up people and their sentimental attitudes to KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
