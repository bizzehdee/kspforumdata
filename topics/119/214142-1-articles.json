I won\u0027t rehash all of that now, and given the information we had at the time, I think my concerns were very reasonable. However, I just came across this reddit thread:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/11caznb/psa_from_a_dataminer_stop_calling_the_devs_lazy/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/11caznb/psa_from_a_dataminer_stop_calling_the_devs_lazy/\u003C/a\u003E, in which a person claims to have found a lot of promising things in the code. The spoiler-free, tldr, is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany (most? all?) of the key selling-point features of KSP 2 are in fact present in the code of the current build in an unfinished, but relatively advanced state. It seems as though the intention was to not have an early access, but a full release, at some point in the future, and thus, all of these features (including the ones in the current build) were worked on simultaneously, with the intention of them all being finished around the same time. Presumably, at some point before last October, an edict from T2 came down that something was to be released by March 2023, and so they scrambled to finish certain features more in order to push out a premature EA release. In other words: contrary to many other EA releases, which focus on perfecting more the core gameplay experience before touching the other, more advanced features, in order to release into EA in a timely manner, the intention wasn\u0027t, until recently, to release an EA at all, and so a smaller proportion of the devs\u0027 time was spent on the stuff that we are playing with now than is typical of EA releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also another thread:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/11b8s6f/comment/j9wocuy/?utm_medium=android_app\u0026amp;utm_source=share\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/11b8s6f/comment/j9wocuy/?utm_medium=android_app\u0026amp;utm_source=share\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0in which someone claims to have found that the physics engine in KSP 2 has in fact been rewritten, from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease correct me if I\u0027ve made any inaccuracies here- I wrote this up as quickly as I could after coming upon this information. If it\u0027s true, I think it\u0027s important for this content to be up on the forum, as many people, myself included, prefer this forum over the other places in which KSP 2 is discussed, and this information gives me huge optimism for the game moving forward, when I was just feeling the most pessimistic that I\u0027ve ever felt about KSP 2\u0027s future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s unfortunate that it\u0027s not really feasible for the devs to come clean about the bureaucratic process that seems to have led to this PR meltdown and botched release, but hopefully we as a community can put the pieces of the puzzle together and spread awareness of the facts concerning how the release came to be, in its current state.

I\u0027m sure it was internally, and the rest is basically just damage control over the Star Theory situation targeted primarily at the investors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that view in mind, we\u0027re looking at a delay of just a few months. If the science, colonies, and interstellar land in the next 3 months, and most of the bugs are fixed, then barring the multiplayer component, the rest of the game is on the similar 6 month delay overall. And yes, I think it\u0027s primarily due to scope being more than Intercept was anticipating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few bugs that I\u0027m surprised have made it this far, and suggests some sort of either a rush or poor QA on Intercept\u0027s part. Or maybe, if they are relying on Private Division\u0027s QA, some communication issues between the two. But outside of that, the core actually seems good. The only two core systems I would highlight as needing an overhaul is the symmetry/part sets system, as it\u0027s far more brittle than it should be, and the world origin relocation system - which looks like someone was trying to experiment with what they\u0027ll need for multiplayer, and left it unfinished, causing the craft to \u0022drag\u0022 other craft and even colonies with them while traveling. Between these two, it covers the majority of mission-ending bugs I\u0027ve seen people post. Including most of the Kraken visits, as these are tied to symmetry modes being a bit broken when you start moving parts manually or placing struts. The rest consists of a few bad states, some bugs in physics vs logical connection, and a ton of content errors. This is all very fixable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I absolutely might be too optimistic about it, because maybe I\u0027m suffering from confirmation bias, but so far, everything is lining up pretty close to the trajectory I was expecting from the time Intercept started publishing their first updates on progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Based on Linkedin profiles, we know that the engineer responsible for the physics changed late in \u002722. It looks, again, purely from work profiles, that the previous physics engineer left for a better offer, rather than indicating any sort of an internal problem, but someone new coming in and having to learn the setup could be another explanation for why some of the bugs slipped into the core systems so late. The person who took over doesn\u0027t have a lot of gamedev experience, but they have a solid background, so I hope they have been ramping up quickly. Obviously, a source of uncertainty, but could also be a more benign explanation to some of the issues we\u0027ve seen in the early access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-02T23:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2023 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T23:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250366\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677797589\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I absolutely might be too optimistic about it, because maybe I\u0027m suffering from confirmation bias, but so far, everything is lining up pretty close to the trajectory I was expecting from the time Intercept started publishing their first updates on progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m glad you can admit that.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0But to me, a project that has to announce multiple large delays - even if some of them are damage control, plus is dramatically feature incomplete, missing features that were part of the target from the outset, plus is in a very buggy state at launch that was clearly not well planned... that\u0027s a project that has been operating dysfunctionally.\u00A0 And sure, this moment might be the moment they solve thier dysfunction(s) but that\u0027s hardly likely.\u00A0 Sometimes release pressure does help sort things out - but we\u0027d see that reflected in the launch, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve been under pressure since the last slip.\u00A0 \u00A0 I guess we won\u0027t know until we see the ongoing trajectory, but so far the trajectory does not inspire confidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T23:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250381\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677798673\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut to me, a project that has to announce multiple large delays - even if some of them are damage control, plus is dramatically feature incomplete, missing features that were part of the target from the outset, plus is in a very buggy state at launch that was clearly not well planned... that\u0027s a project that has been operating dysfunctionally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy entire point is that this wasn\u0027t a dysfunction in the studio.

Stuff we\u0027ve seen over time, such as the dev diaries, show and tell segments, and whatnot pretty clearly indicated, usually with photo or video evidence, that all the systems that they were telling us about were actively being worked on, potentially at solidly progressed stages (not possible to make a definitive statement here. There was enough evidence to solidly make that argument, but also little enough of it that the counterargument of \u0022maybe that\u0027s all they had, and were just cherry picking to make it look further along\u0022 is, at the very least, still a valid possibility, which should not be dismissed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0 do think it is likely that a lot of the game is further along than many people fear, and they went the route of starting with just releasing the core piece, and getting it stable and performant first, then adding another and doing the same (which also gives more time to work on the unreleased stuff in the meantime). I imagine that if a larger percentage was released at once, at this stage of stability, having that many more pieces at once would exponentially increase the complexity of the the job and increase the time between updates, so they opted for stabilizing a piece, then adding and repeating, rather than trying to do it all at once.\u00A0 Sort of like (for a sloppy metaphor) taking a knotted tangled rope and starting at one end, doing a piece at a time, then moving to the next, rather than just dumping the whole mess in front of us and trying to untangle all of it at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I am absolutely not saying the complaints and issues are not valid, or trying to dismiss the many, real concerns, but also I suspect that early access is going to progress more steadily, and faster, than many people think (I\u0027m not going to guess, just...faster than expected, especially with how pessimistic estimates have gotten. Call it a reasonable and steady pace, not an interminable morass), especially once they get the core pieces sorted out. Now I may be totally wrong, but for what it\u0027s worth, the datamining thing here is at least another piece of supporting evidence (not proof. Just another little piece of evidence). Time will tell; the pacing and scope of the first few EA patches and updates will be very telling about how things are, and will go, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T23:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677799343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we look at some early updates from Intercept, along with hires they\u0027ve made early in \u002720, it\u0027s pretty clear that the game\u0027s production was started almost from scratch in the spring of 2020.
