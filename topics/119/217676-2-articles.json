You know what\u0027s best.\u0022 I did community moderation for about 3 years for a different role and so I can form guidelines that I think lead to the best discourse (like the new Discord rules), but enforcement is always best to be laid upon the shoulders of those most integrated with the community - the KSP forum mods and you all using the report system to flag rule-breaking messages to them. The only actions I\u0027ve taken personally have been on the Intercept Games Discord against hard-and-fast rule-breakers (transphobic comments for example), when I was around and saw the comment first. All other actions on the forums, subreddit, and Discord are taken by community members like yourself that work hard to create a space to encourage discussion about our games - for which I am, and I hope you all are, thankful. None of the community moderators on any platform are paid or in any way pushed to sway sentiment in one direction or another.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhile we\u0027ve made significant changes to our communication style over the past couple weeks/month, that is not a result of any one user or even a group of users.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAs the liaison between the community and the development team, I read basically everything posted on all of our community platforms and social media. And it\u0027s my job to come to other teams with actionable sentiment, but also not overemphasize the importance of one piece of sentiment over the other. People often blame community platforms (especially in gaming) to often be echo-chambers, just either repeating the same positive (or negative!) sentiment over and over, with the opposite opinion always being drowned-out by the most vocal. I\u0027m sure that some PhD student could probably talk in detail about what leads to this trend, but when it comes to actually bringing these messages to the development team, I work pretty hard to keep things equal to ensure the team is given the best insight into how the WHOLE community is feeling, not just the vocal majority (or vocal minority.) On the transparency note, I personally have been advocating for our new \u0022style\u0022 since the very beginning. That\u0027s not to place blame upon any member of the team; it\u0027s to show that we think very critically about everything we do here and, very often, popular complaints about any sort of action we take were first voiced internally by members of the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWe understand the current state of the game and we\u0027re working hard to meet your expectations.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThere seems to be this idea that our entire team is \u0022acting like everything is okay\u0022 and that we\u0027re all just blindly trudging ahead ignoring everything around us. I can tell you whole-heartedly that that is not the case. Every single member of our team wants this game to be the best it can be and we\u0027re all very attached to Kerbal as a brand as well. We want to see the game succeed, reach new heights, new audiences, and there\u0027s nothing more enjoyable than seeing someone have a blast with something you worked so hard on. That\u0027s why we often highlight some of the amazing creations created by members of the community internally and on socials. It\u0027s easy to get discouraged, especially with the vitriolic nature of some of the discourse around the game (more on that later) - and so we do our best to keep morale up and show how important KSP as a franchise is to you all. Just this past week, I got to share with the team a note sent to me from a community member about how critical KSP1 is to his relationship with his son who has a learning disability. The community team wouldn\u0027t be putting such a focus in this area if we felt like everyone on the team was comfortable with the state we\u0027re in. Outside of the actions my team is taking, there is a ton of work being done to progress towards each step of the roadmap because we know how important it is to you all that we not only get the game to a playable state, but also add new depth to the game through new features, parts, and progression systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EOn Respect\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Forum\u0027s guidelines exist to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u0022keep our community welcoming to all and to encourage mutual \u003Cstrong\u003Erespect.\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Discord rules say to \u0022treat everyone with \u003Cstrong\u003Erespect \u003C/strong\u003Eand politeness,\u0022 and to avoid \u0022encouraging or engaging in disruptive, aggressive, abusive, disrespectful, creepy, or inappropriate behavior.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of you have a deep connection with this franchise.
