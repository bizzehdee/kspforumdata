While primary and secondary boosters are already lit, I cut the throttle on the mains engines. The craft isn\u0027t going to space that day, so I have to at least save the kerbals. I\u0027m trying to save them by repeatedly staging until the top lander (which consists of two\u00A0 pods, a gumball atop a wanderer) is free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that I lose control of the craft completely. The camera is focused on a single cone/tank/engine that broke free (not from the lander stage). I\u0027m left helpless as the kerbals plummet to their doom.

I think I\u0027m having a problem with KSP2s habit of setting off stages on its own. For instance, if I stage the parachutes with an action group, the next stage (a separator) goes off on its own.
