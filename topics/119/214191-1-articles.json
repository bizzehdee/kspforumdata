Here\u0027s what I found, using a simple ion vessel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229b1pfws.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9b1pfws.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst here is what you see when you do a very slow burn (it\u0027s about a 50 min burn). Since my orbital period is still fairly fast as you can see a burn starting pro-grade will eventually crash me into the ground because it won\u0027t be pro-grade at some point anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good thing is that the prediction is on spot - when I executed the burn I was pretty much on the predicted trajectory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn important limitation however is that I can\u0027t plan a burn where I keep my ship aligned pro-grade, which would lead to a spiraling out kind of plot. Though it is important to remember that I also could not execute that kind of burn in time-warp, since rotation is disabled. If I wanted to do a 50 minute staying pro-grade burn I\u0027d have to do it in normal speed.\u00A0 As I mentioned in other posts I think this limits the utility of burning in time-warp to insertion burns or to burns where you are in an orbit with a very long period (e.g. around Kerbol), as then your heading would not change relative to the prograde and other markers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here is a more fun thing to do with time warp. My vessel looked like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DgJTZX9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DgJTZX9.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s bit hard to see, but I have two Dawn ion drives in a symmetrical configuration, but attached separately so I could easily control them individually. If I deactivated one of them and burned only with the other one my craft started to spin due to the off-center thrust, as expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if I start the engine and immediately engage time-warp rotations get disabled and thrust seems to work as if it in line with center of mass. Ergo, if you have an vessel with off-center thrust\u00A0 (e.g. due to collision damage) it becomes perfectly usable if you do your burns during time warp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this is a real issue - after all most of us don\u0027t build vessels with off-center thrust. What it does show in my opinion is that the ability to burn during time-warp is a pretty simple and naive implementation. I am not using naive in a deregatory sense, but referring to it not really giving much thought about how it interacts with the rest of the game and physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntldr; burning through time warps ignores assymetrical thrust configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
