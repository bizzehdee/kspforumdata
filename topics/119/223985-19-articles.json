That\u0027s just not how it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality KSP2 has the same engine as the prequel, the same middleware for some features, but a much heavier save system, and also a \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E heavier inactive-vessel simulation. KSP2 will be thwarted by that in the future. It also still builds and saves vessels as a tree, it still calculates fuel flow mostly the same way (something something \u0022inspiration\u0022 from the code of the previous game), it still handles the atmosphere like the previous game, but thanks to that passive simulation and bad saving system, vessels popping into range still kill your game, orbits change randomly, and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219210-ksp2-is-calculating-the-physics-of-all-parts-of-all-crafts-whether-they-are-rendered-or-not-reducing-performance-of-all-scenes-at-all-times/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Egame grinds to a halt with vessels and partcounts much faster than the prequel\u003C/a\u003E, to the point systems (like heating) have to be \u0022streamlined\u0022, and part-counts have to be hammered down with new, revolutionary \u0022all in one\u0022 science modules, station modules, and in the future colony modules too... or having the logistics layer be abstracted to numbers instead of seeing your vessels come and go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, saves are just a couple vessels for 99% of players, let alone making any vessel in the hundreds of parts for maybe the last couple missions, and most people play serially too (fully complete one mission before launching the next). So really, KSP2s limits haven\u0027t yet applied to most people and thus it\u0027s no wonder they really think the game is better off.
