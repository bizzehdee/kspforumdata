There may be oversimulation going on, and your extremely limited in your ability to run the calculations in parallel - So you end up with one thread on one core going pedal to the metal, and everything else chilling, because each part needs to walk through its physics operations, in order, and when they\u0027re all welded together they\u0027re all influencing and affecting each other,\u00A0 plus occlusion calculations for atmospheric resistance and drag, all of which get more expensive the more objects that both need to be calculated, and correctly influence one another. Get it wrong, and you end up with Kraken drives and phantom forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for why this affects rendered frames? It may be possible to decouple frame rendering from physics updates, but for a game like KSP its sort of pointless - you\u0027d smoothly rotate and observe a ship that\u0027s still chugging at 3 updates per second, with all the associated control input latency still. There\u0027s also an overhead to pay just from the decoupling, and its still only a \u0022may\u0022 - It could very well be that something in the physics calculations is being offloaded to the GPU where possible (And in fact, I think they\u0027re doing this with drag occlusion now that I put my brain to it) that could make it untenable as you need to sync the physics steps with the render steps at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there\u0027s always something that can be optimized a bit more, the only real way to see major gains on a real time physics simulation workload is to have higher single core speeds, less physics interactions, or simplified calculations. Replacing a complex drag and occlusion model with a simple \u0022Occluded yes/no\u0022 and fixed \u0022drag\u0022 value would vastly reduce the load, but would just as badly impact the accuracy of the simulation, the game would be entirely arcade physics just from that. Finding that balance point is difficult, and not really easy to work out on paper - you can theory craft a way to reduce a cycle, but the only real way to tell if it still behaves \u0022close enough\u0022 is to implement and observe/simulate it running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR Games running frames lockstep with physics, and physics scales negatively as part count increases, and there\u0027s not many options to improve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike S","CreatedById":224442,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-23T03:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224367449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223502\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221708403840\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/19/2024 at 9:37 PM, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR Games running frames lockstep with physics, and physics scales negatively as part count increases, and there\u0027s not many options to improve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to think that there would be a way to weld the parts as \u0022one\u0022 when going to the launch pad...an engine and fuel tank with a decoupler are now a single object rather than three separate.\u00A0 Probably way easier said than done.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said, a lot of the parts I use are mainly for reaching orbit for the very heavy craft I am trying to push out and the most powerful engine doesn\u0027t have a nice way to couple 2 or more engines on without it looking stupid.\u00A0 Limited functionality in the engine plates doesn\u0027t help, and the largest one available is too small for the largest tanks.\u00A0 It\u0027s more an OCD thing really, so I end up using multiple lesser engines to match the output power, but they end up increasing the mass and negating any benefit to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 And the complexity of the engines with gimbles doesn\u0027t help, the performance suffers with the additional animation and associated \u0022physics\u0022 for every engine added.\u00A0 This is where I am sure most of my issues lay.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I launch the payload portion of the ship without the launch vehicle, I do not suffer the severe performance penalties, and this despite a great deal of the 400 parts in this portion of the entire craft when I was using \u0022cheat\u0022 to test some things as I developed the ship.\u00A0 \u00A0Even on the pad with engines off on the launcher, the performance is horrible.\u00A0 At some point the devs will hopefully increase the tool box to include bi/tri/quad and penta mounts in the 5 meter space for the larger engines....I am hoping the mod community also addresses this and provide engine options for huge craft with multiple engines not unlike what SpaceX is doing with their heavy lifters. a bit like KSP 1, but hopefully not without the Kraken.\u00A0 \u00A0If I can simplify the launch vehicle, that would make a significant difference in performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
