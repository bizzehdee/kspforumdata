For example, while this likely wont be in game (as when we heard of it it was referenced as a part thats just been floated conceptually with the team), we know the team explored a science part that required you to fly through the rings of an astronomical body in order for the part to work. I think this concept gives you a glimpse of what theyre going for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal guess is some parts (im guessing mostly the first few ones we get) will behave the same as ksp2 as in they work everywhere (ie mystery goo), some parts will only work while in specific locations. For example the magnetometer makes a return and that only works in orbit, im guessing most of the other parts we saw alongside it in that lab art will also only work in space/in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTelescopes more ambitous then hubble/jwst technologically is also something that came up in the ama and i wont be suprised if we get a sgl (kgl?) \u00A0telescope or something similar, though this probably wont be until we get deb deb. I have a feeling that some parts will just be pains to fly/obtain but a lot of these parts are put on backburner because the systems to make them work arent there. For example nertea in the ama mentioned needing specific materials, i wont be suprised if theres a few science parts whose primary shtick is \u201Cneeds this specific material or loads of them\u201D, and since we dont have materials in the game, theres really no point in introducing that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah tldr: dont expect any radical changes outside of probably science generation over time, theres still gonna be generic science points. What you can expect is some parts to require you to either do specific mission profiles/work better in them (ie most parts probably wont work everywhere), or some parts require you to design your craft around them structurally (ie weird bulbous part) but probably dont expect a lot of these initially\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-26T15:10:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2023 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 26\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-26T15:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224316018\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693054361\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225696\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cocoscacao\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, cocoscacao said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSource?

There are lots of early access games with long release cycles, but very few with year\u002B long release cycles for updates. Those games generally thrive and survive on being stable, quality experiences people enjoy playing for a significant period of time. Starsector has had an extremely long development cycle, with 6-12 month update cycles seemingly the norm. The games also stable, feature rich, and playable for dozens of hours on a single save, before diving into the modding community. That\u0027s the sort of line that needs to be reached for long lifecycles to be viable. KSP2 lacks in the stability department, and has a content pipeline for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emost people\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0measured in single hours.

It gives mechanical incentive to engage and fly missions even if the part count isn\u0027t widely expanded, and it rations out the part count to stretch that content longer. Single hours of content easily hits the high teens of hours. That helps a great deal, as suddenly you\u0027re not done with the game in an afternoon, but in a few days - its a small paper difference but a huge perception difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224316203\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693111922\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/26/2023 at 10:52 PM, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty sure the hype train already crashed a couple times, we\u0027re on the third iteration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://media.tenor.com/mM8WUUykc24AAAAd/handcar.gif\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022handcar.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.tenor.com/mM8WUUykc24AAAAd/handcar.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis version has a low seating capacity, not very fast, and takes a lot of effort to get going - but on the other hand, it\u0027s fueled by pure stubbornness, so it\u0027ll keep going when all else fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy hype train has been reassigned, its barreling off towards starfield now.
