I\u0027m not quite sure how one could argue that player count doesn\u0027t matter, considering the trade-offs. No one playing means no one is testing (as we by now know). No one is \u0022advertising\u0022, or even talking about the game. Which means no further sales. Which, you guessed it, means ultimately no further development.

Successful by definition means accomplishing a desired aim. Having less than hundred players interact with your \u0022successful\u0022 work that you\u0027ve spent potentially tens of thousands of man-hours on, i mean.. Yeah, nah. That\u0027s just a dumb argument. Of course success is measured in player count. Low player count = low success.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how the rest of this argument is going to play out. I\u0027ll say: Baldur\u0027s Gate 3.

Not surprising so far, KSP2 of course had an established player base with KSP1, people were excited for a continuation of their (and my) favourite game.

Even if we just count additions to the game, it would still be 696 bug fixes in 6 months, 5 days from the start of Early Access to the release of patch 0.1.4.0, which is around 110 fixes per month. If we say each developer works something like 20 days per month, then the total amount avrages out to 5-6 fixes per day for the team dedicated to squashing bugs. And if we assume each developer takes a day to fix a non-critical bug (might be wrong in either ways) and larger ones caused by multiple causes such as orbital decay, then we can assume that there are 6-8 developers in the bugfixing squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving on, based on the public progress of feature and parts, I can say with somewhat confidence that at least one or tow developer(s) is/are working on adding new stuff to the game that will come out along with patches.
