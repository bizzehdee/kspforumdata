I\u0027ve been on projects that get re-started because pre-production dragged on and even started production that got scrapped due to scheduling. You\u0027d have all the same leadership with the access to all the existing assets, but with a completely new scope and schedule, and it\u0027s shocking how little ends up re-usable. Yeah, you grab some assets, but these are pre-alpha assets. They still need all the same polish to make them useful in full production that you would otherwise. And a lot of stuff has to be just scrapped. I don\u0027t think the work generated by the team while they were Star Theory saved them a lot of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other aspect I want to be clear about - I don\u0027t think Star Theory failed. I mean, I don\u0027t think they failed as developers. Obviously, I\u0027m filling in a lot of blanks, obviously, it\u0027s all subject to interpretation, and yes, this is likely the one that\u0027s most charitable to the developers, and you\u0027re welcome to think my judgement on this is clouded. But for the sake of presenting my argument in as complete of a timeline as possible, here\u0027s what I see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad was acquired by Take Two in the spring of 2017. Presumably, very soon after that, Take Two, via Private Division, contracts Star Theory games to make KSP2. Given an aggressive development schedule, since we know the initial plan was a late 2019 to early 2020 release, the original vision for KSP2 was a much narrower scope than the current plans for the KSP2. Best guess, a second star system, a colony management system, a visual update, and a new UI. Along with some fixes and improvements you get from updating the Unity version, this should be a big enough change to make it KSP2, but it\u0027s just past the threshold of being a couple of DLCs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the process of making ST\u0027s version of KSP2, an idea is pitched to make something bigger. Multiplayer, more star systems, overhauls of many key systems. PD is not convinced, at least not fully, until in 2019 a trailer is shown, and it\u0027s a much greater hit than anyone anticipated. PD sees an opportunity to make KSP2 a much bigger commercial success than just an update to a niche game enjoyed by a dedicated fanbase, and starts negotiations with Star Theory about expanding the scope. The initial signaling must have happened early enough for Nate to talk about the possibility of these features in some post-E3 interviews, although, still very vaguely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLate in 2019, negotiations between Star Theory and Private Division break down. We don\u0027t know the details and whether the disagreement has been about the timeline or the costs. A lot of fingers have been pointed at the Star Theory\u0027s former financial leadership who are not involved with Intercept. Either way, Private Division scraps the contract with Star Theory, spins up Intercept, and a lot of creative and engineering talent jump ship. Intercept starts working on a new vision for KSP2 with significantly broader scope and on a longer timeline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is roughly what I suggested as the likely timeline for the formation of Intercept back in the spring of 2020, when we were starting to get first news of \u0022additional delays\u0022 and some early snippets of the development progress from the Intercept. Since then, everything else has been aligning with this hypothesis very well. We have seen the delays eventually pushed out to what looks like a reasonable time to work on the game, we did see people being hired into the missing positions for a larger game scope, including specialists in multiplayer and physics, who were missing from Star Theory\u0027s original composition. And in general, while the creative leadership mostly migrated over, it comes off as them being dissatisfied with scope permitted under the Star Theory and starting completely new production under Intercept under a much more liberal scope and budget for the game. This is still a mid-studio\u0027s effort on a mid-sized game, but it\u0027s an experienced team working on a large project on an appropriate schedule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can try to find an alternative explanation, but nothing else aligns with what we\u0027re seeing. If we were really seeing results of six years of work of one mismanaged team on something that got delayed by years, we\u0027d be seeing a completely different monster in place of this early access. This early access is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egood alpha build.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Anyone who works in games that understands Unity and a bit of what goes into an open world and simulation games, will tell you that there is nothing wrong with KSP2 in it\u0027s current state\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efor an alpha build\u003C/em\u003E. This is a game in alpha. We should not be treating it as anything else. And I can\u0027t imagine a mismanaged team making something like this at an alpha stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T00:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250431\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677801465\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do realize that is\u003Cstrong\u003E probably at the same level of accuracy as reading the tea leaves\u003C/strong\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo someone found random words and code therefore XY - someone else said the code of A has been rewritten and was able to conclude that within days after release therefore XY ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a poker player.\u00A0 Pretty used to dealing with incomplete information and supposition based on probabilities.\u00A0 My reaction isn\u0027t based solely on the post of the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
