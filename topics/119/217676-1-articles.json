I browse a little in the KSP2 forums just to see what\u0027s going on, and I\u0027m gonna be real: thinly veiled tension or outright hostility seems to be the norm in the KSP2 subforums, and this has on occasion leaked over to the KSP1 or offtopic subforums too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook, I get it, I really do, KSP2 simply is very much not what it was announced to be all the way back in 2019. There\u0027s a ton of missing features on the early access alpha launch, which notably arrived 3 years after it was originally scheduled to release. Most computers can\u0027t manage 30fps right now. I myself, since the launch of KSP2, have been completely unable to even go to the Mun and back without some mission ending bug destroying the craft, squiggling my orbits, disintegrating my kerbals, or so many other tiny and silly things that somehow break a mission (for example, just last week, after planting a flag on the Mun, I simply was not allowed to board back into the craft). All of my recent forum topics are me complaining about KSP2 bugs. I too was a bit disappointed after paying $50 and not getting a stable experience that was reliably enjoyable. I too was real annoyed at the several missing parts and features that you can just find in stock KSP1. I do not play KSP2 regularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever. I feel like a schism is being driven in the KSP community about the state of KSP2 due to the incomplete state of the game. Tensions are rising specifically because some users feel cheated or scammed out of their $50 which they could\u0027ve used for better things. This tension wasn\u0027t there before KSP2 (obviously), and as a forum user who hasn\u0027t done a whole lot here since KSP2\u0027s release, the contrast between the lovely, unified, and supportive community of old KSP1 (i say \u0022old\u0022 relatively, I joined in like 2019), and the tense, warring community of modern day KSP2. This community doesn\u0027t feel the same anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of people blame the developers, which I think is definitely a little out of place. The developers have gone through some serious hardships (Take Two pulling the contract from Star Theory and causing internal stresses, as well as severe stresses from COVID, both happening at nearly the same time), and are still working hard. There\u0027s evidence in the game files and code that long-term future features, such as interstellar travel or colonies, are definitely being actively worked on. The developers have seemed like genuinely nice people over the forums and over live interviews and stuff like that, and they admit the shortcomings of the game and are actively trying to improve the state of things, so I don\u0027t think they\u0027re being superficial with their interactions with the community. (To me, their interactions seem more like they\u0027re going \u0022ah heck, this early access release isn\u0027t going great.\u0022 than \u0022I\u0027m going to maliciously convince every player to like the game even though it isn\u0027t good.\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, the choice to release KSP2 in early access in this kind of state, with these kinds of specs, with those kinds of missing features, was inevitably going to be controversial. I don\u0027t think this is the fault of the developers themselves though. I think it\u0027s the fault of the conditions in which the game was developed, and the circumstances and difficult situations the developers have gone through. But if it\u0027s the fault of anyone, I\u0027d probably blame the publishers, who choose things like release dates, pricing, announcements, and advertisement, and I don\u0027t think the individual developers had too much say in it (especially with how far the game was already delayed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother major contributing factor to this schism I feel has been lack of communication between the developers and the community before, during, and directly following launch, which I feel has mostly or entirely improved since then. This lack of communication did a lot of damage, convincing a lot of people that the developers were just trying to get a quick 50 bucks and a rise out of the KSP community. I genuinely do feel like things can be better now if we calmed down a bit about the state of KSP2 and listened to eachother and to the developers. Nate Simpson and his crew of dedicated and talented game developers genuinely seem like they\u0027re trying to interact with the community and make sure everyone\u0027s in the loop on all the stuff happening behind the scenes, and everyone involved seems genuinely passionate about their job, their project, the community, and the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I bought this game, my ideas was, \u0022if I buy this game now, not only will I save $10 in a few years, but also, I\u0027ll get to watch the game grow alongside me.\u0022 My goal was to watch the development of the game, interact with it hands on as it grew, provide feedback when I can, and sit there and witness it become the game we\u0027ve all been hoping for. I don\u0027t know what everyone else was expecting when they bought KSP2. I do know some people went in with the expectations it was a full, polished, addictive game the trailer promised which they could sink thousands of hours into. I don\u0027t mean to be blunt, but we all bought into a public early access alpha build. We shouldn\u0027t\u0027ve expected something completely up to triple-A standards. While the communication issues I mentioned perhaps hindered our understanding of just how rough this game was going to be, I still feel like \u0022early access\u0022 should be enough of an indicator as to how patient and tolerant we\u0027d have to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know a lot of people have expressed concerns relating to the future of the project, and don\u0027t anticipate the game fully reaching its promises. I, however, would like to note that Take Two, despite all their interesting and peculiar business strategies relating to KSP2, have indicated they\u0027re in this for the long run, and Nate\u0027s also indicated this project isn\u0027t dying any time soon, and has expressed confidence in the team\u0027s ability to (eventually) meet what they promised so many years ago. I don\u0027t anticipate this project\u0027s death. I don\u0027t expect it to be done any time soon, so I understand waiting a long time probably won\u0027t be super fun, but honestly, we kinda need to figure out this whole patience thing really quick. I don\u0027t think the KSP community as a whole is doing too great specifically because of this controversy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m gonna be honest with y\u0027all. A lot of comments on developers\u0027 updates have been short-tempered, cold, and all in all just kinda awful to the developers. This obviously doesn\u0027t include whatever\u0027s had to be removed by the moderators. I\u0027ve read things on the KSP subreddit (which is currently down for some reason?) actively vilifying the developers (often specifically Nate since he\u0027s the face of the team), which I see to just be completely unfair. Some people are going to the point of accusing anyone who doesn\u0027t blame the developers for stealing $50 from you as a shill, which is truly an accusation of all time. (I swear to whatever you want me to swear to that, instead of being paid to say \u0022KSP2 is kinda cool guys\u0022, I actually had to \u003Cem\u003Epay\u003C/em\u003E to say those words.) I\u0027ve seen YouTube videos accusing KSP2 of being a permanent failure and a disgrace because of its rickety launch, and I find that really quite awful. I\u0027m having fun with multiple aspects of KSP2, despite all its obvious yet temporary issues. I like spaceplanes now mostly because of KSP2\u0027s procedural wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI write this in the hopes that, maybe, just maybe, this post impacts the community slightly in such a way that helps us cool down and engage in civil discussion instead of arguing and bantering endlessly until we all get tired of hanging out here in this cool forum. I genuinely think the outlook for the forum\u0027s community as a whole, at least in present times (and maybe moreso a few months ago), is worse than the outlook for KSP2. At this point, the only thing we can do about KSP2 as a fanbase is to wait, listen, provide meaningful and constructive feedback for the developers to listen to, and be nice enough for the community to still be fun to hang out in once KSP2\u0027s all done. I\u0027m probably overstating the threat to the forum community as a whole, and I don\u0027t think many people will fully leave the forums due to KSP2 controversy, but it sure isn\u0027t fun to sit through, and it would be a way more pleasant forum experience if we all just stuck together, waited patiently, and made sure to keep things civil and calm for the time being. We can panic if huge and bad news on the game\u0027s forecast comes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(this took me an hour to write! i should go to bed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: Lads, lasses, everyone in between, can we for the love of heck cool down a little about the state of KSP2, and just wait a little?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-12T13:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201924-littlebitmore/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201924\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201924-littlebitmore/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@LittleBitMore\u003C/a\u003E, thank you for the post. \u00A0 \u00A0You obviously did put a lot of effort into it. \u00A0 I know it was well received by the rest of the moderating team and even some of the staff. \u00A0 It was pleasant to see a post encouraging such positivity during a quite rough patch in our community. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for what has or hasn\u2019t been removed by moderators, well, we don\u2019t normally discuss moderation, but I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what we\u2019ve been doing as a moderation team. \u00A0 \u00A0Let me state clearly that we, the moderators, are community members first and foremost. \u00A0 \u00A0We\u2019re volunteers who loved this community enough that we decided to help maintain these forums as a great resource for discussion about the game we love, and scientific debate in general. \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u2019t care what you think about the game. \u00A0 \u00A0 Our job as moderators is not to defend the game. \u00A0 We fully encourage constructive criticism of the game. \u00A0 \u00A0Even if you don\u2019t have a suggestion on how to fix something, merely pointing it out might spur the conversation that does come up with the solution. \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you don\u2019t have something technical to discuss, you still have an opinion of the game. \u00A0 \u00A0That is your opinion, and you have the full right to post it here. \u00A0 Personally, and not speaking as a mod here, I was disappointed, disgusted, and appalled at the condition of the game upon release. \u00A0 That\u2019s just my opinion, and it\u2019s not wrong. \u00A0 Some may disagree with that, and civil discussion over those differences of opinion is something we, the moderators, encourage. \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what we don\u2019t encourage is people who intentionally bicker, attack and troll those with different opinions than theirs. \u00A0 The moderators really don\u2019t care what your position on an issue is, but we won\u2019t stand for people attacking others because they\u2019re different. \u00A0 \u00A0This has already been applied in a number of instances, regardless of the point of view of the members involved \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we will absolutely not tolerate any flamebaiting or trolling. \u00A0 \u00A0Posting something to purely cause an argument is not something we do here. \u00A0 \u00A0 It\u2019s immature and should be left in the realms of 4chan and Reddit. \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know it sounds like I\u2019m laying down the law here (even though it\u2019s already posted under our guidelines), and I might be a little bit, that\u2019s not the type of post\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201924-littlebitmore/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201924\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201924-littlebitmore/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@LittleBitMore\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0intended this thread to be. \u00A0 \u00A0We want you to know you should not have to worry about posting your opinion here on the forums. \u00A0 Some discussion might occur, as reasonable minds can differ, but also, a reasonable mind can change their opinion on something. \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pat20999","CreatedById":229082,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-12T14:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-12T22:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, okay, this post got a LOT more attention than I was expecting.

I also want the old game to be still spoiled with the gifts of mods that can be revived from the dead or new mods (like Parallax 2.0) to be released.My message, adding on to LittleBitMore, to the community is to relax, give CONSTRUCTIVE not DESTRUCTIVE criticism to the devs so they can help us to that beautiful end goal, and keep loving our favorite little green men.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-14T21:45:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2023 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Cytauri\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moeggz","CreatedById":107035,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-13T04:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a few things.

In the chat we talk about the state of the game, how much we\u0027d like it to be better and lots of other stuff, and it is generally a very nice place to be.
