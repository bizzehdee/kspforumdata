The way I\u0027ve gotten around it is, supposing I want 6 boosters around the outside (3 sets of two), I put on 2x symmetry instead of 6x, and then place those 3 sets of two manually. That way, you can separate each pair of decouplers from the others. I hope this is fixed at some point, though, since it\u0027s impossible to line stuff up perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
