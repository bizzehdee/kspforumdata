Communications are vague (unfortunately an impossibility to fix in the world of bug fixing) and therefore discouraging to the average person. New content is nearly non-existent at this stage - Plenty has been promised, some has been shown, but the current nature of communications around these things have been a lot of window dressing with little promise of delivery. Not to say that they are actively not going to do it, but a dev update about how hard or complex designing for X or Y is does not assuage the concerns of a community wondering when they will get it. Efforts to increase communication have been unable to address this timeline concern, which have been leading to more speculation as to why not, which generally degrades into negatives, as people speculate as to why they can\u0027t answer these questions and provide timelines. From the business perspective, making promises you can\u0027t keep is a bad idea, and rightly so. From the consumer perspective, people just want X features per the roadmap, and in line with their general perception of what is reasonable, and failure to at least provide corrections on what reasonable should be just feels like weaseling out of the problem. This problem gets worse when the community was told that bug fixing isn\u0027t taking time away from milestone work - Now the community is under the impression that bugs still exist because features are being prioritized, but these features also aren\u0027t materializing, so what\u0027s going on? One or two mild comms \u0027mistakes\u0027 (Only mistakes by the context of whats happened since, to be honest) has really damaged the entire communications plan of the whole early access launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply put, nothing has gone \u0027right\u0027 in this early access launch for either timelines or communications, the developers cannot say with confidence when it will get better, and the request to trust them has either exhausted said trust, or never earned it in the first place for many. That\u0027s a recipe that\u0027s guaranteed to generate pessimism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the whole \u0022Why does KSP2 not get the leniency KSP1 had\u0022 debate back and forth, its apples to oranges. Consumer expectations for what early access is and means are wildly different - By the time KSP1 was in an era where early access was more \u0027normal\u0027, the game was also very matured, and wasn\u0027t hurting for expectations or defects in its update gaps. KSP2, meanwhile has launched in a period with relatively high expectations from games on the quality front in particular, alongside the expectation of more frequent content. Blame other AAA games for launching in such a horrible state that rapid bug patching of initial versions is expected and resented in equal measures. And blame the seasonal content model for people expecting content updates to be frequent, even if not substantial. KSP2 has peers right now in games like Sons of The Forest, maintaining much more active release cycles.
