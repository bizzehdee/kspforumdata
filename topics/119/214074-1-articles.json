For those who never saw the launch day update on steam, which was posted at 6pm on launch day, here it is:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch Day Update\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Kerbonauts,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst and foremost we want to thank all of you for joining us on launch day. We\u0027ve been thrilled to see the amazing crafts you\u0027ve come up with and the hilarious hijinks (and yes, we know some of those are from bugs, but they\u0027re still fun!).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow of course we\u0027ve seen and heard your complaints and the issues you\u0027ve run into as well. We want to emphasize again that all of this is being absorbed, organized, and prioritized in our systems so that issues can be addressed rapidly. We already have plans in place to improve performance, the more egregious bugs, and much more. So keep the feedback coming!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe also want to say that we do have a patch coming soon. At this moment we cannot give a specific date for the first patch, but it will be in the coming weeks. Thank you again for joining us on this journey and we promise these growing pains will be worth it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/app/954850/discussions/0/3772364949848364468/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/app/954850/discussions/0/3772364949848364468/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-01T16:50:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2023 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by twich22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
