The largest barrier to developing for OSX is usually the Metal API for rendering, which isn\u0027t even bad - in some respects it\u0027s better than DirectX 12, but it\u0027s very different. So if you want a game that runs cross platform, you have to have resources for developing for both. Or hire somebody to provide the port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity does support Metal, meaning making a Windows/Mac cross platform game is actually easier than ever. But you do still have considerable overhead. You still need to test on OSX, because not every bug will show up on Windows, you have to make sure all of the controls and key combos work as expected. There can be little problems with material shaders due to the differences between DirectX12 and Metal, and these have to be fixed. All of the performance bottlenecks are going to shift a little. There might be little hick ups in networking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re all fairly minor problems, but there are a lot of them, spread throughout the code base. It would easily require at least one engineer, one tech artist, and maybe one or two QA working on it full time. Would that be worth it? Possibly once the 1.0 is ready. Apple has a pretty big cut of the market, and at least their high end laptops should be perfectly capable of meeting KSP2\u0027s minspec. It\u0027s definitely not the overhead you want to take on while in the early access, though. So while I kind of expect an official Mac port, I don\u0027t expect it to happen at least until whenever the console release is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wpetula","CreatedById":209905,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-08T19:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003EHow Not to Argue: KSP 2 Edition\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003EPoor arguments to make\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u201CPessimistic\u201D arguments\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u201CI wasted $50 dollars on this game!\u201D\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile the current state of the game may leave much to be desired, it is your responsibility as the customer to do your research before buying the game.

Too many features were promised during KSP 2\u2019s development, and too many of those features were not present at launch. Now, the KSP 2 team is slowing down the cadence of new updates and patches in order to focus on significantly improving the game, perhaps like how the No Man\u2019s Sky team went silent for weeks after launch to work on their first big update. What happens next mostly depends on the passion and perseverance of the KSP 2 dev team.

The fact that everyone has been referring to NMS for many years only says that this is an exception to the rule. There the story was very different. The game was in development for three years, the office was flooded with a flood that damaged computers, the number of developers was very small, and the engine was specially created for an incredible number of huge planets. The game, even with a bad start, brought the creators a lot of money, which not only paid off the development costs, but also allowed them to finish the game for years. Of course, they could spend all the money on yachts and a beautiful life, but they chose the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
