However, the public news of layoffs, the review scores, the absolute denial and \u0022all is well!\u0022 \u0022just do another weekly challenge!\u0022 attitude is not helping. Not when 50% of the community has an extremely degraded gameplay experience,\u00A0 and the viewpoint is that there is a straight up refusal to address the communities fears and worries.

I\u0027ve been supportive, positive, and over all optimistic and I will remain so, but todays news of layoffs was an incredibly huge blow to my own moral and hopes and dreams of KSP2 as a player and a lover of this franchise.

We know about the lead engineer, but were there others?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is that it\u2019s really not OK for Intercept to announce this about individuals or individual roles that would let people figure out exactly who was let go (except executives). That\u2019s personal information. You don\u2019t do that to people.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I agree that a bit more communication could help, like, how many roles were cut? When did Intercept know about them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, what could they say to allay worries? I can\u2019t think of much TBH. They\u2019ve already said development continues apace and according to plan. You can choose to take that at face value, or not, but what more could they say to convince you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that fans aren\u2019t reasonable people you can talk to reasonably. You can share your internal roadmap with reasonable people because they understand that it\u2019s subject to change; the milestones can change and things can even be dropped from it altogether. You can\u2019t do that with fans because imagine the reaction if, say, they have wind, rain, and snow on it, and later on it gets cut. It would be just a continuous outrage machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really wish fan culture would change so there could be more direct and \u201Cadult\u201D communication between studios and fans but I just don\u2019t see that happening.
