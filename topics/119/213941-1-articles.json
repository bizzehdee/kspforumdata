You way more patience than me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m less than 10 hours in on KSP2, but I\u0027m already done and will leave the game unplayed until there is an update that fixes a lot of the bugs. Possibly I\u0027ll spend some time in parts I\u0027ve not looked at yet, with the aim of adding bug reports, but I\u0027m not feeling very motivated to do that currently. After all, I can spend time hunting down bugs in my day job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not as if I\u0027m expecting a perfect experience in order to play the game. Back in the day, when I started playing KSP (2014), it was normal practice to have to go into game save files and edit them, to free kerbals that had got stuck in bind pose and we unmoveable, or to free vehicles from docking ports that wouldn\u0027t undock. KSP2 however is different in that it\u0027s not just a number of known issues that have to be worked around, but a near constant stream of issues, many which are terminal for your vehicle and have no workarounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst thing for me are not the large number of now known issues, but the seemingly endless (and frequent) steam of random issue that crop up. So far I\u0027ve tried to get to the moon surface twice and both time I\u0027ve been thwarted by weird and serious bugs with no workarounds. That\u0027s not to mention the myriad little issues that came up along the way, that weren\u0027t catastrophic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope that enough of these issues can be fixed, before the publisher starts to get cold feet and consisders pulling the plug, at the prospect of the actual cost of getting the game into a respectable shape (which given the current state will be considerable). That would be a risky move for Take Two to make, given how high profile the project is and how large and vocal the fanbase, but stranger things have happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping fingers and toes crossed here though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Izny","CreatedById":137814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T00:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you can\u0027t deal with rapid unplanned disassembly and try until you succeed, you are not cut out to be a kerbal engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T01:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost games that come out are designed for about 20 hours of play time.
