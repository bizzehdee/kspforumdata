So this post is likely inflected with emotions, less rationality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I gotta say, the way Take Two, IG, and KSP team handle any and all communications, from the lack of any good ongoing dev updates for KSP development all the way to this absolute chaotic mess of Take Two\u0027s \u0022rationalizing it\u0027s pipeline\u0022 but failing to prep their studios to provide a proper parallel the announcement absolutely still leaves me skeptical about any possible good future communication from these companies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt blows my MIND that marketing and execs couldn\u0027t prep their studio heads for these announcements so that the moment they broke, KSP would already have something ready to go to tell us it\u0027s still in development. What an absolute joke. The irreparable harm that has been done in the last 24 hours due to bad communication is staggering. Also to be VERY clear, it is NOT the communities fault that the company failed to advise us all. ANY community for any EA game with these issues would have reacted the same way, and has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, let me know if you agree/disagree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-01T22:13:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2024 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 1\u0022\u003EMay 1\u003C/time\u003E by ChrisShourai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot image\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaxmed","CreatedById":185327,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-01T22:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah this is wild.
