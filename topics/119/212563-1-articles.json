When I managed to land the camera would drift inwards as if a part were floating away and the camera was trying to remain centred\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, in my opinion is a game breaking issue as it limits us to very simple designs to get the job done. Too many complex stages and we run the risk of botched physics ruining our mission later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any similar experiences or thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T02:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the stock Kerbal 2 not detach its second stage from its service module.

The core stage stays attached, like the decoupler is stuck to the bells of the Poodle engine. It seems like this is something that would be fixed. I was annoyed because I wanted to use the last 600 meter per second of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left in that stage for a transfer burn, and having to pause, time warp, then upause before continuing my burn was a real pain in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E-butt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Macenzie","CreatedById":65231,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T02:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI redesigned the craft, removing the fairing hiding the lander and it stopped the spinning issue.
