So while you can make the framerate on lower end GPUs a lot snappier for simpler planes and rockets flying through the atmosphere, there\u0027s not much you can do for the CPU performance bottlenecks on larger rockets outside of maybe custom parts, like larger tanks, that would reduce your total part count.
