Its rarely used by courts because companies dont typically go out of their way to commit crimes. And most companies go out of their way to not comingle personal and business assets and finaces. If a company is found guilty of a crime, but business assets and finances are separate from owners/officers/shareholders personal assets - no \u0022piercing the corporate veil\u0022.

An LLC business owner is no more likely to care about why a project failed than an incorporated business owner. Or a non profit business owner.
