I think something like research to take into account atmospheric drag isn\u0027t included simply due to the fact that it\u0027s a non-trivial problem and resources have been devoted elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as requiring an environmental survey before knowing things about\u00A0 the atmosphere or a planet, part of me thinks that\u0027s an intentional design choice to allow more streamlined missions. As a veteran player, I absolutely can understand and buy into the idea that I first need to send an automated probe to Duna before sending a manned mission, even if that means waiting literal years between missions for transfer windows to line up. I\u0027m not sure that newer players will have that same type of understanding or buy in. I might be totally wrong with that, but it feels like that\u0027s the direction that many of the decision makers are taking with the game. Provide a more streamlined (if less realistic) experience that\u0027s more targeted at newer players and have tweakable options or rely on mods to ramp up the difficulty for veterans/more advanced players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the Kerbolopedia, I agree it\u0027s an excellent idea but, at this time, it would primarily be fun in game background/flavor text. I can\u0027t imagine that the long term plan for the game would be to have the player *have* to read a literal in game encyclopedic to do the missions, that\u0027s the antithesis of what stock KSP has always been. So as much fun as it would be to fill in that information and have background articles on all the anomalies, I think the reason it\u0027s not in the game now is because it doesn\u0027t have gameplay value. It might provide cool motivation for some players to go to a certain biome (either to be a completionist or get more background story), but as something that wouldn\u0027t actually be a core part of gameplay, it\u0027s understandable why it would be lower on the priority list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on everything I\u0027ve seen and read about this release and the future roadmap, I think an important thing to keep in mind is that the version of science mode released in 0.2 is absolutely not expected to be the final version of science/career mode that is in the finished game. It will expand significantly in depth (more star systems) and breadth (colonies, resources, etc.). The idea does not appear to be that in KSP 2 1.0 you\u0027d have sandbox mode, science mode, colonies mode, etc. but rather sandbox mode and career mode. Maybe two types of career modes or maybe just one with configurable settings. Current science mode is not meant to be the final version of science collection, but rather the bones of how science collection and points will work in the final career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-02T19:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224354954\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704214294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180308\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ahres\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Ahres said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m reviving this post from Pthigrivi because I really want to know if there\u0027s anyone out there that doesn\u0027t want science mode to be like this.

That\u0027s really the easiest part to fix, as it\u0027s adding instead of changing. Another thing that\u0027s relatively easy to fix is \u003Cstrong\u003Eadd more parts\u003C/strong\u003E. I should be having to choose when I unlock anything, for example engines: do I want this or that fuel? do I want engines that can survive a re-entry or make them disposable? Do I want to go for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or high efficiency? and so on. Make the tech tree \u003Cstrong\u003Einto a damn tree\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the tree, my personal choice would be to \u003Cstrong\u003Enot display the tree\u003C/strong\u003E. You\u0027ll have to put up with me as I detail a bit more here: I wouldn\u0027t have \u0022science points\u0022 but \u0022interest points\u0022 generated. This \u0022interest\u0022 can be interpreted as both public and private eyes looking at your space program, bringing in sponsors, researchers, engineers and such. That\u0027s what those points are supposed to represent in abstraction and \u003Cem\u003Eso will decouple the process of science from the result, \u003C/em\u003Emeaning we no longer need to hear about \u0022applied science\u0022 theories where you need to land on the sun to discover heat and develop heat resistant parts and other dumb stuff anymore. \u003Cstrong\u003EWe discover cool stuff and thus more people join or fund our cause\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003Cstrong\u003E The points representing that are what gets invested\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, do away with the tech tree, and have those points be assignable to the different buildings in R\u0026amp;D, and have parts be unlocked in \u003Cstrong\u003Ea semi-linear but also semi-random way\u003C/strong\u003E. This\u0027d mean you don\u0027t have full agency over what you unlock, but still have enough control over where you want to point your space program, and with the inclusion of minimum investment milestones, you can actually control the progress as good as a tech tree whilst the player can\u0027t spoil themselves with the full tree in sight. Imagine you try to invest points into a specific department and get a \u0022we can\u0027t go further in our research with our current knowledge\u0022, so you actually need to go invest into other areas instead of beelining to your favorite part. Also, for player satisfaction, this system would allow you to invest interest points partially, so you don\u0027t feel like \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou pulled a huge mission to still not have enough for an unlock\u003C/strong\u003E,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003Esomething the current system fails hard at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIn conclusion\u003C/strong\u003E: There\u0027s a lot of ways to make a fun and engaging science feature. Sadly, they all require that effort actually be put into making new stuff rather than copypasting KSP1 science and changing a couple CFGs and MESH{} parts into each other to make the revolutionary concept of a part that does many things. Even better, they could actually put some effort into making the underlying systems a bit deeper, creating actually \u003Cstrong\u003Edeep variety rather than a lot of puddles.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we have right now is the minimum viable product and I\u0027ll eat my pants if adding a couple more tree nodes when colonies and interstellar arrives fixes anything. Resources will make it more interesting, but through extra limitations rather than actual depth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-02T19:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224354990\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704220426\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107383\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hatterson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, hatterson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as requiring an environmental survey before knowing things about\u00A0 the atmosphere or a planet, part of me thinks that\u0027s an intentional design choice to allow more streamlined missions. As a veteran player, I absolutely can understand and buy into the idea that I first need to send an automated probe to Duna before sending a manned mission, even if that means waiting literal years between missions for transfer windows to line up. I\u0027m not sure that newer players will have that same type of understanding or buy in. I might be totally wrong with that, but it feels like that\u0027s the direction that many of the decision makers are taking with the game.

Right now progression and experiment rewards are really leaning much more heavily on crewed missions which ends up making the process feel a bit rote and linear. If there were a couple other more viable paths it would create more diverse gameplay strategies.
