They always insist on the fact that they have to be \u003Cem\u003Ein charge\u003C/em\u003E, which inevitably results in hiring a large bloated team of staff, including many of their useless friends and cronies who always seem to end up on the payroll (notice how many of Nate\u0027s pals from Uber crossed over to Intercept as \u0027Game Designers\u0027 yet were unable to contribute anything of note to the game in four years).

The game you\u0027re thinking of, was Total Annihilation, created by Cavedog, of which John Mavor worked for, he created the engine for that game. Planetary Annihilation is the spiritual successor to Total Annihilation (Released 1997).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game (Planetary Annihilation) received Mixed Reviews upon release but after the release of stand-alone expansion TITANS, the fortunes of the game in the eyes of gamers changed and it sits with a solid 85% very positive reputation on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother game Nate worked on, at Gas Powered Games was Supreme Commander II, sequel to Supreme Commander, another spiritual successor to Total Annihilation (recurring theme here). Again, it was well received and sits with 88% very positive score on Steam.

But there were also a huge number of really smart and inspired decisions from the very beginning. But in the end the creative director is not the one who decides when a game is released. The entire executive structure at PD and many at T2 are involved. I have little doubt the folks at IG were essentially given a date and forced to make it work as best they could. Of course we have no idea for sure what the internal dynamic was and probably never will. Im just not willing to cast blame on one dude without knowing that.
