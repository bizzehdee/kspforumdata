For my part, I thought KSP2\u00A0 had actually made a lot of progress towards becoming a worthy sequel in the year since the initial EA release.\u00A0 Most of the really bad physics bugs were gone or at least occurred much less frequently, and although performance was still not where it needed to be, it was considerably better than it had been at the outset. And I for one appreciated the new visuals and the new content, such as it was. All it really needed in my book was\u00A0 more of that new content, more improvement in FPS, and the fixing of a number of stupid QOL issues that should never have been allowed to persist as long as they did. The game literally went from hair-rippingly unplayable to\u00A0 fairly decent over the EA period, but it seems like by the time it got there everybody had lost interest already. Basically, I think they shot themselves in the foot by doing a general EA release when it was still in such bad shape, to the point where recovering community trust is going to be very difficult. Whatever their reasons for that were, I think in hindsight it was a terrible mistake from the standpoint of overall revenue potential for the title, and if they truly abandon it now, I\u00A0 shudder to think how much good work will likely have gone down the toilet because of that mistake. Anyway, for me the core essential elements for a good successor would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) No absolutely game-killing bugs in any release, ever.
