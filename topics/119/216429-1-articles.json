We\u0027ve just barely started to see the tip of this with the addition of the SWERV, which currently renders the NERV near-obsolete. What are your goals with regards to balance for these new technologies? Is the intent for late-game parts to essentially replace early parts, or for lower-tech solutions to still be viable and necessary in the late-game? This also applies the other way: how do you intend to incentivize the use of certain \u0022Way Too Useful\u0022 technologies to their full potential? For example, torch drives should allow us to reach other planets in a fraction of the time, but there is currently very little advantage to getting somewhere quickly rather than simply time warping through a multi-year journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also curious about how you handle balance with regards to approachability, depth, and realism. There have been many requests over the years for more complex and more realistic mechanics in the base game, including life support, radiation, more realistic aerodynamics, part failures, interstellar material, relativistic effects, communication delay, and more. Some of these could make great additions, while others could be needlessly punishing. Realism in mechanics can lead to more fun and emergent gameplay, but it can also discourage both new and experienced players who become overwhelmed by the complexity There\u0027s no consensus on which of these features would actually benefit the game, or how they should be implemented; ask 10 players which is which and you\u0027ll get 11 different answers. What are your goals for gameplay balance here, and how do you decide what additions will or won\u0027t benefit the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_tunnel","CreatedById":227343,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-14T20:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long does it take to design a real world technology for Kerbal technology and still be realistic?

I have two semi related questionsL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) How do you and the Team learn about and imitate real world rocket and spacecraft systems, to ensure the realism of the game? For example how does the designers figure out or learn how an exhaust plume changes shape in different atmospheres or vacuum, or how a solar array\u0027s angle to the solar vector changes amount of power generated. I saw a video about the engine sounds, where a KSP2 team went out and recorded actual rocket engines being fired, very cool way of getting those sounds. Where and what resources does the Team use to gather the \u0022aerospace\u0022 knowledge to design parts, planetary science, orbital mechanics and the like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) In relation to \u0022game experience and content\u0022 as a Game Designer, are you and how are you seeing the development of the design of rocket/spacecraft system telemetry (status)? Not just from a single vehicle standpoint, but from a Mission Control view of multiple, concurrent spacecraft in operation? This is more than just the Tracking Station currently in the game, but monitoring multiple operating craft. Like NASA/JPL or ESA does from their Mission Control Centers. With Colonies/Mulitplayer this may be a huge benefit to managing and knowing the current state of all the players space assets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-14T22:49:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2023 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by LeroyJenkins\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cytauri","CreatedById":223905,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-15T00:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#1b1e1f;color:#c9c5be;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EA few questions here.
