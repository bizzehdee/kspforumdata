Wish it was under better circumstances. To be clear: as of the writing of this post, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP 2 HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY CANCELLED.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0Mostly, this is a response to a phenomena I\u0027ve noticed a lot on this forum: people making statements to the effect of \u0022They promised us they would finish the game, isn\u0027t this some kind of breach (possibly even legal)?\u0022 Some people are talking about lawsuits, others about refunds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact is, early access games are always a risk, both for the publisher as well as the customer, even when they are being developed by a major studio. KSP 2 in particular, is a relatively niche-interest game whose development was seeminly laden with difficult technical problems and other REAL CODING CHALLENGES which have the tendency to make development slower and more expensive than other reliable, mass-market games. Take Two may well decide that KSP 2 will either be unprofitable, or that the money will be better spent somewhere else. They may be right. Unfortunately, there is no known way to design an economic system that both 1) causes companies to waste money on consumers like us and 2) leads to the development of MRI machines, sufficient food to feed the population, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of the initial anger back when the game was released was in this context. The anger boiled down to two main points:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe game was way less developed than it ought to have been based on previews and pre-development communications. This could have many causes, among them:\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere were more engineering challenges than expected, or they were more difficult than anticipated\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDevelopment was being mismanaged\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere was dishonesty involved\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDevelopment was restarted due to some unknown reason, possibly some combination of the other bullets\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAll of which indicate that the game\u0027s development was significantly more risky (less guaranteed) than what one might otherwise assume, which was/is\u00A0upsetting to many fans of the game.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEspecially in light of (1), the asking price of $50 was extremely steep. Not only was the game not worth $50 at that moment, but the development of the game was full of risks and red flags that reduced the likelyhood of successful development even further below that which one would expect from an early access game, which should reduce the price.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the release, which many viewed as already involving several broken promises, more \u0027promises\u0027 or \u0027goals\u0027 have gone unfulfilled, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFrequent communication\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdates \u0022on the timescales of weeks, not months\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022Major content updates coming within months of each other\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd other such conditions which would alleviate risk and speak to a solid development environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake-Two\u0027s \u0022cost reduction plan\u0022 is not a monumental, rare, or unpredictable occurence. It is exactly the sort of thing we should expect companies to do: look to reallocate funds away from things that either lose money or don\u0027t make enough money, and towards things that do. We should have had, and should continue to have, the expectation that KSP 2 will be subject to such pressures,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EAND THAT EXPECTATION SHOULD BE BAKED INTO THE PRICE OF THE GAME.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s no surprise, then, that many of the same people who were fine with the price of the game and many other perceived sleights feel like they are owed some sort of recourse if the game fails. You are not owed anything- your \u0022recourse\u0022 was had a year ago when you purchased the game for less than it would eventually cost if it made it to release- you got a bargain, which doubled as your consolation were the game to fail. If you are unsatisfied with your recourse, then perhaps we are in agreement that the game should have been, for instance, $30.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAll this being said, I hope for the sake of the community, the devs, who I do believe worked hard to make this game succeed and care about the game, and the broader world which stands to benefit from the existence of games like KSP 2, that the worst has not come to pass, and that the game will continue to be developed, and one day release successfully.\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0I mainly wrote this post because it concerns what I believe to be a common flaw in the way people think/talk about \u0022cOrPoRaTiOnS\u0022 which irritates me greatly, and I\u0027m not a perfect person.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-05T05:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem IMO was that they put their roadmap on the store page.\u00A0 The promises for what would come in 1.0 were \u0022on the box\u0022, so to speak.\u00A0 That\u0027s against the EA rules, and for good reason.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad the release just been KSP1 without the bugs, I would have paid $50 for it despite all the new content being a future promise.\u00A0 But it wasn\u0027t, and I think a lot of people justified the price tag because of the promises on the store page.\u00A0 If the game is officially put into \u0022support mode\u0022, there could be legal trouble in the EU because of this, which may be the reason we\u0027re not getting an official announcement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a reason most EA games have the sense to leave their roadmap off the Steam platform.\u00A0 It shouldn\u0027t be part of the sales material for the game.\u00A0 The game needs to stand on what it has today for today\u0027s price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-05T16:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224386491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224746\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221714885733\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201273\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Skorj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem IMO was that they put their roadmap on the store page.\u00A0 The promises for what would come in 1.0 were \u0022on the box\u0022, so to speak.\u00A0 That\u0027s against the EA rules, and for good reason.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad the release just been KSP1 without the bugs, I would have paid $50 for it despite all the new content being a future promise.\u00A0 But it wasn\u0027t, and I think a lot of people justified the price tag because of the promises on the store page.\u00A0 If the game is officially put into \u0022support mode\u0022, there could be legal trouble in the EU because of this, which may be the reason we\u0027re not getting an official announcement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a reason most EA games have the sense to leave their roadmap off the Steam platform.\u00A0 It shouldn\u0027t be part of the sales material for the game.\u00A0 The game needs to stand on what it has today for today\u0027s price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat not against EA standards of practice.
