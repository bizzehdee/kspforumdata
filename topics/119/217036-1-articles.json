I\u0027m pretty new to the game and really struggling with something basic once I\u0027ve started making slightly bigger rockets like those required to go beyond the mun and minimus. See below, this rocket from the loading screen - how are all of those side engines / tanks attached to the main rocket? When I do something similar, they fall off at launch, shortly after launch, or at some point on my way to orbit. I don\u0027t see any struts in use on that picture. How do you add those tanks / engine combination radially to the main rocket and have them \u0022stay on.\u0022 ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings I\u0027ve tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Set radial symmetry to 6 and just put them where the selection tool allows them to go around the main fuel tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0-\u00A0 they tend to just fall off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Do that but then use the move tool to move them in slightly so they overlap the \u0022main\u0022 center fuel tank a bit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 - they tend to just fall off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

They will wobble quite a bit if you don\u0027t add struts, though. I would add at least one strut near the bottom of the side tank and one near the top, connecting it to the central body. All of this, starting with placing the decouplers, should be done in 6-way radial symmetry mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen a symmetry mode bug where physics joints just aren\u0027t created, but that tends to happen when you try to build a sub-assembly with its own symmetries, then attach the sub-assemblies in a symmetry mode. Hopefully, that gets fixed, as it\u0027s annoying.
