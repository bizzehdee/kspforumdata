The experiment would require 3 satellites be held in an orbit or in interstellar space with a 90 degree angle maintained on the central laser emitting/receiving satellite. When completed this experiment would obviously reward players with a massive science point haul or something similar and perhaps could reveal a new system very distant where a merger occurred and when visited could be prospected for extremely rare resources\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think having to set up a system like this would really test the meddle of players in the late stages of the game, it would be involving in a fun and testing way, and offer a point of advancement in exploration mode\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo everyone else please propose your ideas and if we get enough maybe I can make a poll to see which experiments people find most intriguing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
