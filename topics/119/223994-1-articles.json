Also I was also wondering (Because I havent been playing KSP2 and thus am not privy to its updates) if the DEVs have made EC go beyond just for transmitting science, meaning like for ship control it causes EC drain??\u003Cbr\u003E\nLastly, If not being able to see EC amount in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is a thing, its terrible (kind of like not being able to see what missions you are doing in editor) and was also wondering if there are any mods out there that can remedy this? Any response is welcome!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Jeff Melton\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
