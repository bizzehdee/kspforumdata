KSP2 seemed to be especially story driven based on its mission system and various anomalies. It seems like the story was inevitably leading to the discovery of another civilization located in one of the new systems. But, would anything have come from it gameplay wise? Would we discover another species of kraken/kerbal hybrids and would they be playable? Would we find established launch sites/colonies on these new systems that could be utilized? I even heard speculation that the Mun arch would become some sort of portal to another system. Or maybe KSP2 never intended for the story to be more than a narrative tool to make sense of the mission system and drive players to yield higher science rewards in certain areas. Either way, there was more story to unfold had the game been finished and I wonder how in depth it would have been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I\u0027m sure I missed or forgot additional clues about the KSP2 storyline.

A lot of these things are left to interpretation and future assessment based on new things that were added, and what the community responds well to. Maybe ideas went around the office, but KSP is extremely far from a narrative game, and the effort involved in that narrative would have been similar. Even games with major narrative bents both have narrative go public when they die, and verifiably have their narratives massively reworked merely months before release - Half Life Episode 3 with Epistle 3 is a great example of the former, and Half Life Alyx is a great known example of the latter.

I really like the gameplay loop of sending a satellite to learn the terrain and locate anomaly/resource locations, then sending manned missions to get on the ground and collect science. Some players probably see it as tedious but this method made it really rewarding when planning missions at specific locations with a purpose in mind.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, it kind of bothered me that the KSP2 mission dialogue essentially said , \u0022Hey, we did the whole exploration part for you and mapped out the exact spot where you need to go.\u0022 It totally took out the fun and control that I feel in KSP. Sure, maybe if the game was at 1.0 and I had entire other systems to visit and colonize I may feel that the expedited mission system is a good choice, but we all know how that turned out... Too bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was really excited for resource scanning parts and telescopes (which were said to be planned, but in hindsight I\u0027m very skeptical). These parts would have brought further depth and meaning to the exploration element of the game other than the main story missions. I wanted to have access to tools (science parts) that gave me the information necessary to find the optimal colony location on any planet or moon. But these features will never be seen and may have not even been planned for 1.0 the way I had hoped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, the game just was too shallow and incomplete to provide a more thorough mission system. Funny that you mention CommNet when they had no plans to even implement comm lines like in KSP1 to provide visual feedback to players. The infrastructure just wasn\u0027t there to provide a robust space program experience which limited the narrative to a fetch quest structure with little variance to offer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-02T03:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current mission system seemed to me to be exactly what it was: The first draft roughed out plot to a story they were going to eventually tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll never know if that\u0027s all they planned or it was the first of 100 steps of expanding each node of the story into little sub-missions, of course, but that\u0027s my opinion on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-02T07:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering KSP 2 was created under Take Two Interactive, it was almost certain it was going to end in disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
