KSP2 seemed to be especially story driven based on its mission system and various anomalies. It seems like the story was inevitably leading to the discovery of another civilization located in one of the new systems. But, would anything have come from it gameplay wise? Would we discover another species of kraken/kerbal hybrids and would they be playable? Would we find established launch sites/colonies on these new systems that could be utilized? I even heard speculation that the Mun arch would become some sort of portal to another system. Or maybe KSP2 never intended for the story to be more than a narrative tool to make sense of the mission system and drive players to yield higher science rewards in certain areas. Either way, there was more story to unfold had the game been finished and I wonder how in depth it would have been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I\u0027m sure I missed or forgot additional clues about the KSP2 storyline. What speculation do you have regarding the story and it\u0027s gameplay impact had KSP2 ever reached its vision?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"para 9","CreatedById":234380,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-28T15:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much gameplay impact would the story have had? My guess: practically none. I\u0027m sure they\u0027d have allocated a ton of resources to developing superfluous lore and story. \u00A0Based on the tutorials and promotional materials we saw, I\u0027m pretty confident there\u0027d be cutscenes.
