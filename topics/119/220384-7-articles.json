I guess the key here is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eintent\u003C/strong\u003E, which obviously I can only speculate at, that separates your proposed interpretation over mine. It appears to me though that the evolution of most core features involved developing them as \u0022game\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u0022simulation\u0022 aspects, then continuing to develop the \u0022game\u0022 aspects once the \u0022simulation\u0022 aspects became counter to them. I think that the presence of mostly \u0022game\u0022-ish features that don\u0027t really connect to \u0022simulation\u0022 at all is fairly strong evidence of that (i.e. career mode features), whereas if it were the other way around, I think we would see a lot more almost-pure \u0022simulation\u0022 features (e.g. part degradation, life support, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: This is all somewhat muddied by the fact that KSP1 arguably tries and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efails\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to prioritise these \u0022game\u0022 features, despite spending almost half it\u0027s pre-1.0 development on them - I don\u0027t think things like contracts and Kerbal professions ever really worked to be the engaging features they were intended to be fundamentally, which lead to a lot of people (me included) dropping them entirely for sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224336568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221699029497\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022230798\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NH4Cl Enthusiast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, NH4Cl Enthusiast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll ask this: If you remove any decision from your average play session which is not directly connected to either the workings of the physics simulation or aesthetics, how much is left?
