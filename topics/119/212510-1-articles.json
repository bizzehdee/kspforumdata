Nothing in real life is perfectly rigid and engineers need to design rockets to handle flexing and bending during flight. KSP exaggerated the bending to make it an obvious problem to the player -- a wobbly rocket is much more obvious than an seemingly rigid rocket suddenly and unexpectedly cracking in half as internal stresses from bending moments become too great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, wobbly rockets need in-game, real world solutions. and not a magic autostruct button, so what are they?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) \u003Cstrong\u003EStruts\u003C/strong\u003E - Additional cross bracing to stiffen a structure as a real world solution to excessive flex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u003Cstrong\u003ETruss structures\u003C/strong\u003E - You will have seen in the parts list a good number of new truss structures.

Currently (and in KSP1 without struts or autostrut), joints between parts feel like they\u0027re made of thick rubber instead of welded steel. If wobbly rockets, at least with the properties that they have now, are legitimately a design choice, I just disagree with it.
