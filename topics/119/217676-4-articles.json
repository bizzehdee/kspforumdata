I\u2019m not trying to point any fingers, I just genuinely feel like the publishing side (not developers, not CM, not QA) has soured too many fans too much and it\u2019s past the breaking point.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019ve flipped like 6 times in four months from optimistic to critical and I feel I have landed firmly on the critical side (again due to the publishing decisions, not any of the decisions made by any employee who has ever interacted with the community.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only reply to say that if all of your hard work in rebuilding trust is not enough and we never see KSP2 realized as we all want it\u2019s not your fault and all of you who genuinely did your best are appreciated; Take Two is who burned the trust of the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that I\u2019m out, just wanted to say thanks before I left. If you all are able to somehow keep the funding long enough to bring the game around I\u2019ll be back grateful to have been wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your kind words - it means a lot. This definitely matches the level of mutual respect that I advocated for a few pages ago. Appreciate you keeping up with us on this journey and hope to see you around as we reach our EA milestones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socraticat","CreatedById":176118,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-23T22:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ITji8wequWw?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 DOOM!\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shinya","CreatedById":184769,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-24T15:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224295835\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687472867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225122\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dakota\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/23/2023 at 12:27 AM, Dakota said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Eyou can look back on these past few months and see how much progress we\u0027ve made towards changing your mind.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who has been waiting for the game to be fixed before buying it, it has indeed changed my mind... negatively though.
