That motor, with it\u0027s gimbaling, should be able to handle an ordinary rocket just fine without even needing fins, or only minimal fins. Do you see fins on a Falcon 9? An Atlas V, or a Delta IV Heavy? Nope, nope, and nope again. And I can assure you they begin their turns a lot earlier than I can in KSP. I live in the Space Coast area of Florida and watch/photograph lots of launches. They start their turns early, and they don\u0027t have any stinking fins. If I build something that looks about like a Saturn V and use the so-called size MD stabilizers (looks about right scale-wise), that sucker\u0027s gonna flip. If I take off the so-called stabilizers and put on control surfaces that are about 3 -\u00A0 4 times bigger (visually speaking - though still Size MD), then I may get to orbit without it flipping on me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a shot of the LV with the rover and no fairing - this get\u0027s to orbit, but it\u0027s tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CKdo5So.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CKdo5So.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fly rockets. I mostly fly them to the Mun and Minums right now, and I land things on both targets. Lately I\u0027ve been landing rovers. I just put a large rover near the easter egg on Minmus, and that was fun! Interesting thing with that launch - I tried the LV with a fairing over the large rover and it flipped. It had more than enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the fairing was just big enough to encompass the rover and it\u0027s wheels. Picture something like what\u0027s shown above except with one less large reaction wheel and with Skippers for the strap-on engines - everything else the same except it had a fairing. It was not anything like the comically large fairing posted above. I made the changes seen above to the rocket and ran it without the fairing, but larger control surfaces, bigger strap-on engines, and double the first stage reaction wheels. With a very late gravity turn I got it to orbit, but it was a complete PITA on the way up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, while the new aero may be making things easier for those flying planes, in my experience it\u0027s certainly not making things easier or more realistic for those flying rockets. I\u0027m happy that the new aero works so well for planes. It\u0027s nice that it\u0027s easier now for those.
