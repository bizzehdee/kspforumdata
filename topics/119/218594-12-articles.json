I don\u0027t think the indie development really holds valid seeing as you had individual modders like Nertea coordinating the development of part assets and parts themselves far better than Squad was. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stretch to say that what\u0027s to be said about KSP 2 applies far more to KSP 1 than 2, especially seeing as \u0026lt;s\u0026gt; KSP 1\u0027s developers were so good at priorities \u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; that they spent a good chunk of developer time remaking the part assets to be just as mediocre and even more bland than the old part assets. Yes, I\u0027m bringing KSP 1 up for the 50th time. But I\u0027m not a big fan of double standards and seeing people take kind stances about KSP 1 when it had many issues much worse than the, as Vl3d would say, mostly \u0022cosmetic\u0022 bugs that I encounter playing KSP 2. On my first few weeks of coming back to KSP 1 towards late 2022, I had even small probes suffering from phantom forces and shaking themselves apart on successive rails warp \u0026gt; physics \u0026gt; rails warp cycles, all because I built a tiny bit of stuff around a tiny small cubic strut. You know, using a part built for part attachment to attach parts to places they otherwise can\u0027t be attached to. Again, this game in its entirety costs \u00A330 and that\u0027s not a kind price point for an insanely cheap and broken game - the game\u0027s look, even with all the eye candy mods you can find, is stuck in 2011 and the bugs and lack of critical features make it feel like an early access game. Even seven years after its early access ended. Sure, KSP 1\u0027s tenuous list of \u003Cem\u003Eplanned\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efeatures being checked makes it \u0022feature complete\u0022, but that\u0027s a frankly useless metric given that many features you should need for e.g. ion engines were seemingly never planned. Yes, KSP 2\u0027s parts list takes a second to load and things are a bit slow, but it\u0027s certainly better than KSP 1 directing all of its resources to getting the parts loaded, which becomes a massive problem when using mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice my tangent is getting longer so I will stop there. I just wanted to address how insanely pricey KSP 1 is for how broken it is, and that people seem to forget, ignore or get apologetic about KSP 1\u0027s Knock-Nevis full of problems when it gets brought up in discussions about KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, KSP 2 costs 15 quid more than KSP 1 (and is just about the same price as the full KSP 1 experience), and it\u0027s already dealt some serious blows in my eyes. I can\u0027t now go back to single-craft construction, a separate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, impulse maneuver editing and a navball that\u0027s afraid to be anywhere near the altitude readout, can I?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely ridiculous how some people keep \u0022dumping\u0022 on KSP1.

Whatever bugs or questionable design choices it may have (and I think you\u0027re severely overstating how serious they are, I\u0027ve never had nearly as many issues as you keep claiming to experience, except maybe when trying to figure out new mods) the fact is it still adds up to a wonderful, deeply enjoyable game.

I don\u0027t think the indie development really holds valid seeing as you had individual modders like Nertea coordinating the development of part assets and parts themselves far better than Squad was. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stretch to say that what\u0027s to be said about KSP 2 applies far more to KSP 1 than 2, especially seeing as \u0026lt;s\u0026gt; KSP 1\u0027s developers were so good at priorities \u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; that they spent a good chunk of developer time remaking the part assets to be just as mediocre and even more bland than the old part assets. Yes, I\u0027m bringing KSP 1 up for the 50th time. But I\u0027m not a big fan of double standards and seeing people take kind stances about KSP 1 when it had many issues much worse than the, as Vl3d would say, mostly \u0022cosmetic\u0022 bugs that I encounter playing KSP 2. On my first few weeks of coming back to KSP 1 towards late 2022, I had even small probes suffering from phantom forces and shaking themselves apart on successive rails warp \u0026gt; physics \u0026gt; rails warp cycles, all because I built a tiny bit of stuff around a tiny small cubic strut. You know, using a part built for part attachment to attach parts to places they otherwise can\u0027t be attached to. Again, this game in its entirety costs \u00A330 and that\u0027s not a kind price point for an insanely cheap and broken game - the game\u0027s look, even with all the eye candy mods you can find, is stuck in 2011 and the bugs and lack of critical features make it feel like an early access game. Even seven years after its early access ended. Sure, KSP 1\u0027s tenuous list of \u003Cem\u003Eplanned\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efeatures being checked makes it \u0022feature complete\u0022, but that\u0027s a frankly useless metric given that many features you should need for e.g. ion engines were seemingly never planned. Yes, KSP 2\u0027s parts list takes a second to load and things are a bit slow, but it\u0027s certainly better than KSP 1 directing all of its resources to getting the parts loaded, which becomes a massive problem when using mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice my tangent is getting longer so I will stop there. I just wanted to address how insanely pricey KSP 1 is for how broken it is, and that people seem to forget, ignore or get apologetic about KSP 1\u0027s Knock-Nevis full of problems when it gets brought up in discussions about KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, KSP 2 costs 15 quid more than KSP 1 (and is just about the same price as the full KSP 1 experience), and it\u0027s already dealt some serious blows in my eyes.

One tutorial, for a while, couldn\u0027t even be completed because of a mistake during its development. KSP 2\u0027s tutorials will probably do the job of bringing rocket science to a casual audience with its animated tutorials breaking everything down into everyday analogies while using understandable and fairly common works, but KSP 1 never held up to \u0022teaching them in a brilliantly \u003Ci\u003Eintuitive\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eway\u0022. The rocketry was simplified but don\u0027t confuse it for intuitive. Most people I\u0027m finding only learned the game through Scott Manley et al.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are at all going to call my criticism of a game \u0022low\u0022, at least provide me with actual counterarguments. So far I\u0027ve seen you putting KSP 1 on a pedestal, exaggerating and overstating its qualities, but no counterarguments to anything I\u0027ve said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m severely overstating the severity of a vessel \u003Ci\u003Eimploding\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0because its part tree got too complicated for the game...? I encountered this twice within a short span, on my Minmus space station and on my probe, which was barely any bigger than a small Mun lander, all because I relied a tiny bit too heavily on tiny cubic struts. Putting too much stress should cause the cubic strut to fall off with sufficient force, not cause the entire vessel to wobble, vibrate and shatter as if every attached part is being thrashed by an engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMhm? That\u0027s not going to stop me from calling double standards where I see them. I, in no universe, would pay $50 for KSP 1 knowing how barebones it is and how many features, often basic ones, are lacking that are needed. The tutorials are bad, the gameplay suffers from a lack of critical features, the parts list is full of gaps, the bugs tracker has too many bugs in it, and so on. It\u0027s not nearly the game people state it to be. People find it easy to complain about a game that\u0027s new and has lots of issues, but complaining about a game people have had 10 years to get used to and holds a sentimental value?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mind constructive criticism of KSP 2, I\u0027ve started on reporting bugs myself. But most of the criticism I see of KSP 2 is hardly constructive, and I do see the odd bit of criticism claiming KSP 1 is somehow better on a fundamental level even though you can see from some parts of KSP 2 that the developers are at least\u00A0thinking, and not just adding stuff on impulse; \u003Cem\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve got ion engines (and later interstellar ones), so we need persistent thrust. People are going to be doing burns in the background and colonies will be told to perform missions on their own, so we need to support resource transfers in the background. The KSP 1 UI was designed by five-eyed aliens who don\u0027t understand that humans can\u0027t perceive\u00A0the entire screen at once without bits going into our peripheral vision, so we put altitude and basic orbital info with the other navball readouts. People are going to be building space stations so we\u0027ll give them more than a pitifully small selection of girders to play with. The KSP 1 parts list was barely readable so parts are now labelled by size and are divided into subcategories.

There are very few parts of KSP 1 where I can see thought went into planning things. Forgivable when it was still mainly Harvester, sure. Forgivable over 10 years later, absolutely not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: People only forgive KSP 1 because they are only attached to it, from what I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not interested in joining a high school debate club with you. I\u0027m simply saying that I think it\u0027s crummy of you to badmouth a brilliant game in order to defend the launch of a sequel that\u0027s received some (perfectly fair) criticism. KSP1 made building rockets and going to space fun, and I learned plenty from it without bothering much with the tutorials, and despite the bugs and quirks the game does, indeed, have. \u0022Omg the NERVs are unbalanced! My strut broke! It didn\u0027t have features X, Y, or Z (that KSP2 doesn\u0027t really have yet either!) \u003Cem\u003EWorst! Game! Ever!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 is not an argument I\u0027m gonna spend tons of time or energy refuting. If KSP1 weren\u0027t a good game, you wouldn\u0027t be arguing here, and neither would anyone else, and there\u0027d be no such thing as KSP2 to argue about in the first place. KSP1 was more than merely a success, it was something that people loved, and still love, and rightly so. I don\u0027t like seeing people badmouth it in order to defend the sequel from well-earned criticism, is all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
