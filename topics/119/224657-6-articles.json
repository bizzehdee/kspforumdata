Even in my own small company projects have revenue cycles and often start with long periods of time in which we aren\u2019t billing much or at all. If you take short-cuts and screw up the process and deliverable product the result is you lose out on almost all of the potential gains. The decision to force a too-early EA probably meant a small percentage savings in initial dev capital but cost them essentially all of the potential profit. This wasn\u2019t a decision based on a 5 or 10 year profit analysis and certainly hurt both PD and T2 long term.

Judging things on the pace of their deliverables they\u0027d easily still be 3\u002B years out from being anywhere close to the roadmap features; let alone getting it optimized to a point to be able to port it to consoles. It is very easily rational that the long term costs were at or exceeding their revenue projections from PC and Console.
