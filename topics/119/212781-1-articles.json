I immediately tried to repeat the flight.\u00A0 \u00A0However, now, all tanks are empty on the launch pad even though they show as full in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Restarted the game and reloaded the save. This time, it partially was ok.\u00A0 On the launch pad, the fuel READ empty, but the rocket launched anyway.\u00A0 Perhaps it was always this latter cosmetic issue only and I did something wrong before the game restart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 2: Rebuilt the rocket as 2 ships in one, using docking ports, and couplers.\u00A0 \u00A0Launch as one ship, stage, turn around, and redock (sort of like they do in the Apollo missions with the LEM).\u00A0 At initial separation things were OK.\u00A0 [ ] keys transisted me from one ship to the other and back.\u00A0 \u00A0I had a bit of difficulties with targeting.\u00A0 \u00A0It seems you can\u0027t just target the ship, but if you get close enough and right-click on its docking port, the first time it opens in the parts manager, you do not get a \u0022Target\u0022 button.\u00A0 Close it and right-click on the other ships docking port again, and this time you do.\u00A0 \u00A0At the default docking distance setting, there is an unsettling jump as you get within about 3 meters and then suddenly you are docked.\u00A0 \u00A0Now, docking successful but that is when the \u0022bug\u0022 really starts.\u00A0 \u00A0Just after docking is complete the new ship begins spinning.\u00A0 \u00A0I opened the parts manager and started turning everything off.\u00A0 \u00A0No torque, etc on anything.\u00A0 \u00A0Spinning keeps getting faster.\u00A0 \u00A0I cycle over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, then to the tracking station and back to the ship.\u00A0 Still spinning.\u00A0 I hit Escape, then Save and Exit.\u00A0 \u00A0Restart the game.\u00A0 Turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability

have to exit the game and restart every time I dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: BTW, if you sit there and let the ships spin, they get faster and faster.\u00A0 After 3 minutes or so the ship explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 3: Randomly, and not 100% reproducably, After docking and turning engines on/off and back on, actually trying to use the engine explodes the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 4: Destroy button in Tracking station does nothing.\u00A0 Item remains on the menu and exists in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 5: No apparent way to transfer fuel between tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats it so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I just noticed that KSP2 only uses one of my 20 cores.\u00A0 \u00A0I assume this is intentional?\u00A0 \u00A0It maxes out that one core all the time.\u00A0 \u00A0Does not seem to be any issue though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
