Instead of just cooling their jets and giving it another year to bake and then actually making decent project with long-term prospects for growth they flushed millions of dollars down the toilet. Thats because the their stock has been in a slump and they need to show a decent body count to investors to restore confidence. Those investors don\u0027t care if KSP2 is good or not or makes money or not 5 years from now. They\u0027ll be long gone by then.

I have argued they should have taken 1 more year. One more year development doesn\u0027t really change what its up against. It\u0027s always going to be up against a range of niche titles with varying quality. What I\u0027ve said again and again is all that matters is how good is it when that time comes so it can hold its own in the pack. Would I expect T2 to wait 15 or 20 years for that?

Both games did one thing extremely well, but how to add to that with the same level of immersive magic is by no means clear to me. A lot of people around here expressed a lot of excitement about colonies and/or interstellar, but for my part I was having significant trepidation about how these additions might clash with various aspects of the original game to the point where the magic is gone for me.
