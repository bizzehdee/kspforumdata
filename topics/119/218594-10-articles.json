ten years now, so it felt like a no brainer to get the game day 1.\u00A0 I figured it\u0027s been in development for years now, so even if it\u0027s coming out in EA that it\u0027d probably be playable enough ---\u00A0 lacking some features from the first game but with a promise for those and more to come back down the line.\u00A0 I was excited for the improved graphics and tightened-up gameplay, and just all around looking forward to playing KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI basically spent the final hour before the game launched refreshing the steam page listing over and over.\u00A0\u00A0 The $50 price felt a little steep, especially compared to the $20 I spent on KSP back in its own Early Access days, but I figured why not.\u00A0 I buy it, launch it, and get ready to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately, I run into a bunch of issues, both game-breaking and quality of life alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E camera controls were very odd.\u00A0 No idea why they changed those without leaving a legacy option ---\u00A0 that kind of thing has been commonplace for ages when established games change their camera mechanics like that, hasn\u0027t it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nVarious issues with actually using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E cropped up.\u00A0 No easy way to view per-stage Delta-V, you can\u0027t shift click to move the whole craft, and the GUI is massive and clunky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen trying to use symmetry to put wings on my outer boosters, it did some strange 2x symmetry glitch so that all four boosters were given 2 wings:\u00A0 one where I wanted it, and one on the opposite side clipping into my core stage.\u00A0 I was forced to put them on one by one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFuel crossfeed just does not work like you\u0027d expect, and the GUI is awful for actually knowing when your outer stages run out, leaving your core stage just as likely to be spent and rendering fuel lines null.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance is abysmal.\u00A0 I can run KSP1 with every visual mod under the sun and have no issues (I have a 3050), but I can\u0027t even run KSP2\u0027s lowest settings and get a serviceable framerate if i\u0027m looking anywhere near a celestial body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I quicksaved and quickloaded around Mun, the Mun arch teleported to my craft and made my ship crash, destroying the mission I\u0027d been on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I made my Kerbal EVA, the pod he was EVAing from exploded and destroyed my mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShips are more wobbly than ever, even with struts holding everything together (about as well as scotch tape).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManeuver notes are clunky and uncomfortable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe orbital conics system is so hard to read and just doesn\u0027t work right in its current state when trying to plot encounters.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe camera requires painful amounts of dragging for the smallest motions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understood going in that the game was Early Access, but it is into its \u003Cstrong\u003Efourth\u003C/strong\u003E year of development, with a \u003Cstrong\u003E$50\u003C/strong\u003E price tag.\u00A0 Not only that, but Steam urges those releasing things in early access to release based on the promise and price of what currently is present, not what will be.\u00A0 I paid $50 for a glorified tech demo that broke whenever I even breathed on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI opted to refund the game and spend some of the money I got back on Taco Bell, which currently proved to be a more enjoyable investment.\u00A0 I\u0027ll watch from the sidelines and see if they can fix the game, and if they do then I\u0027ll probably get it when it\u0027s on sale or something.\u00A0 Until then, I\u0027m perfectly content playing KSP1, because my god there\u0027s so much content left for me to explore even after 10 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure the people at Private Division are working hard, but sometimes it\u0027s not a matter of hard work, but \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E work.\u00A0 You can spent all day digging a hole with a spoon, but I\u0027m not
