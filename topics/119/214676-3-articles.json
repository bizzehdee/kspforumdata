Note: This thread is not about the why or whether it\u0027s justified.\u00A0 Its just clear that from T2\u0027s expectations, the game should have released long ago, no game announces a ship in 2020 because they thought \u0022Oh, our business partners expected us to release in 2023, but jokes on them, we\u0027ll announce SUPER EARLY for no reason\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem is that the business side can\u0027t tell if the game is making legitimate progress or if money is being wasted endlessly by the creative types.\u00A0 This is due to many things, not all of them the fault of the business-side people.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, business people aren\u0027t always gamers - and if they are gamers, they aren\u0027t necessarily fans of a specific genre.\u00A0 Thus, it\u0027s typically up to some mediation between the developers/creatives and the business end - typically in the form of an executive producer.\u00A0 In KSP\u0027s case this is Michael Cook and/or Grant Gertz.\u00A0 These people are supposed to be telling the business people about the honest progress of their project, and sorting out budgets etc.\u00A0 And in turn, because those producers may be experienced with game development, but aren\u0027t developers themselves, they rely on the reporting from the developers themselves.\u00A0 This reporting can come in the form of meetings, various \u0027stage gates\u0027 like a green light demo, documentation, videos, gameplay show and tells, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a good developer, a lot of this song and dance to keep the publisher on-side is kind of a waste of time that gets you the development dollars, because it\u0027s often an effort to surface how well your game is doing.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, with a not-so-good developer, this song and dance can become a goal in and of itself - faked demos, faked screenshots, builds that look good in a video but are held together with duct tape.\u00A0 This gets doubly bad when marketting gets involved because this material gets encouraged and then sucked up as promotional material for the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd a bad publisher can also be responsible here - they can over-encourage useless reporting, delaying the team and wasting their time, or forcing the team to focus on unnecessary early \u0027polish\u0027 vs foundational work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also gets bad because the mediary, the producer, has some mixed incentives.\u00A0 Even if telling the business guys \u0027we should cut this project\u0027 is the best move, that producer may have been working with the developer for years.\u00A0 Their work is now tied up with that developers work.\u00A0 And you can\u0027t prove a negative, so if that producer says \u0027we need to cut bait\u0027 they have 0 to show for their time, just like the developer, even if it was the right move.\u00A0 So they also can help sell the lie a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is DOUBLY true if its an internal team - the \u0027external\u0027 publisher now also has a stake in the studio/team, and is even less objective about progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo eventually the business people say \u0027ok what the heck\u0027 they look at a game that\u0027s massively overdue, that had promises made and promises broken - and even if the trajectory \u0027seems\u0027 good now, it could be more song and dance.\u00A0 \u00A0And a \u0027hard\u0027 date can sometimes break loose a project that was stalled, or spinning due to changing features \u0026amp; scope.\u00A0 Sometimes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy guess is this is the scenario we\u0027re looking at with KSP2.\u00A0 It blew through too many deadlines, the business people said \u0027you have to ship now, no more extensions\u0027.\u00A0 And my read is that Star Theory and then Intercept are pretty adept at the song and dance marketting, and - proof in the pudding - not so adept at development.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd KSP2 did something even stranger, for a game being built in a traditional developer/publisher arrangement - announce multiple failed deadlines.\u00A0 (not counting indie games/kickstarters/etc, those often have weirder stuff happen)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nProjects RARELY announce a public release date and then blow through them, delaying by not just months but years, over and over.\u00A0 Fans often know a project is taking too long because they find out something is in progress and then wait for a public announce, but that\u0027s not what KSP2 did.\u00A0 Internal dates get blown through all the time of course, that\u0027s different.\u00A0 \u00A0And the star theory debacle is an ok excuse for it happening once - but that happening several times points to some serious issues with project management or project-to-publisher liaisons.\u00A0 Someone was telling someone either pack of falsehoods or had wildly optimistic projections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-08T09:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2023 09:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by RocketRockington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-08T09:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the ... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224254594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678256198\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only real insight I have on this is that Ive been involved in big complex projects involving tens of millions of dollars and some went great and some went poorly and some went medium.
