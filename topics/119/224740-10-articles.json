If you play KSP1 purely Vanilla, then the game is equal parts a simple rocket design game, with a flight simulator aspect and a mission planning aspect. These three elements mostly share equal weight in the balance of what a player is \u0027expected\u0027 to do. But once you start modding KSP1, its extremely easy to start shifting it so the game is primarily a rocket design and mission planning game, with a weak emphasis on the flight. Whether that\u0027s through abdicating flight responsibilities with tools like Mechjeb, or integrating them into mission planning and ship design with those programmable flight computer mods, or just making them less relevant with advanced parts and distant targets, like with the outer planets and Near Future propulsion - Your specific flight reactions become far less relevant than your careful trajectory planning and designing a rocket who\u0027s nuclear pulse drive doesn\u0027t melt during the prolonged burn. These are fundamentally very different ways to experience the game, where a player who prefers to engage with spaceflight as an equal partner to the systems will think everyone else is cheating themselves of half the fun, while the automation player who just wants to put together his mothership to go execute a meticulously planned and designed grand tour thinks the spaceflight player is just being stubborn and missing the \u0027good part\u0027 of the game. Neither play is wrong, of course, but its two very different design spaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a simple polish up of KSP1 to make KSP2, the problem wouldn\u0027t exist, its the same equidistant approach. But colonies and interstellar change this gameplay design equation heavily. You are now putting far more emphasis into the things that aren\u0027t the ship flight. Do you continue to promote ship flight as much of a manual hands on process at all time as before, at the risk of preventing more players from engaging with the entirely new systems? Or do you take the same systematized approach that colonies and orbital assembly promotes, moving more weight off hands on flight and towards design and tooling?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like Nate never showed a clear understanding of this design problem, or any potential solutions for it. And my simplest evidence for it would be his approval of Wobbly Rockets. Wobbly Rockets are 110% a space flight challenge and problem. There\u0027s no real engineering or mission design solution to them, nothing colonies or advanced parts or anything else would have done to help it out, just straight player piloting, literally. At the same time, we were being told of automated cargo routes for moving materials between sites once you\u0027ve made the flight. One is an extremely hands on, experience every wild moment yourself design approach, the other is an extremely systematized, play it safe to maximize efficiency style approach. These don\u0027t mesh well, and the fact that Nate continued to actively defend it when people were disappointed shows that he was both aware of it, and seemingly completely ignorant to its wider design implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a 100% creative designer decision point right there, how and why you expect the player to engage most with the gameworld, with a known problem space stretching back into the original game and its community discussions, and Nate somehow just didn\u0027t seem to give it any thought at all. The docking autopilot argument is just a downstream thread of not knowing what systems are pillars and which systems are branches to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-28T20:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716860228\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281754\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yaivenov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Yaivenov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest implementation would be a co-operative/limited multiplayer style with guest players tied to the host\u0027s instance, but able to look around and take control of specific kerbals or craft within the physics rendering area.\u00A0 Time warp is controlled by host and use is deconflicted through player communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah something like this could work, as well as each controlling a craft after a separation event (like air launch to orbit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be like soliciting a guest pilot to help with a specific mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see a MMO style multiplayer as viable\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-28T21:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716929555\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah something like this could work, as well as each controlling a craft after a separation event (like air launch to orbit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be like soliciting a guest pilot to help with a specific mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see a MMO style multiplayer as viable\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as you don\u0027t have multiple people hand-flying craft within the same physics bubble, it\u0027s actually straightforward.\u00A0 That limitation could then be addressed as a game design issue: make sure there are ways to avoid that while accomplishing all the game\u0027s missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-29T01:54:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393504\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716913631\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281754\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yaivenov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Yaivenov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps I can summarize in neutral language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chief director of game development should be intimately familiar with every facet of gameplay and game design and this should also be done without interposing any factors that could obfuscate their true state of these facets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr. Simpson\u0027s fidelity to this axiom appears to be in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Chef\u0027s kiss*\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I am ever at a loss for words in the future, I am messaging you, lol!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
