You can, technically, copy the game\u0027s folder somewhere before patching, so prior to this Thursday, to have as a backup, then you can launch\u00A0KSP2_x64.exe directly from that folder. That should bypass the patching and let you run an older version. It works for me on Steam version and I think it should work with the EGS version as well. However, there can be incompatibilities with the save games or some additional server version checks that would render the old version inoperable - it\u0027s unlikely, but it can happen with some games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re really worried, you do have this backup option, but in most cases, if there\u0027s a severe bug with a patch, the studio releasing the game will either fix it quickly or roll back the update for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T00:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah Steam will just update, and frequently you can go back multiple versions to stick with a version and not update immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the website, I\u0027ve no clue.

But if PD invested in their own launcher, they might have invested in the storage and the rest of the backend for rolling out patches as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of a game where it makes sense and is used heavily is Warframe. When you DL it from Steam, you get the most recent baseline, and then the launcher will get the patches directly from Digital Extreme\u0027s servers. It\u0027s actually pretty good about collecting the diffs you need, and doing it as a single patch, even if you\u0027re several behind. For a live service multiplayer game that already has to juggle a ton of storage, where you want\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to be playing on exactly the same version, and where you might roll out fixes quite often, because, again, multiplayer live service, you kind of want a more direct management of how your patching is handled than Steam provides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a game like KSP2, as a one-off, it makes zero sense not to just do everything through Steam. But then you don\u0027t really need your own launcher, either. Once you have a launcher, and you\u0027re using it for a number of games, and you have the funding of T2, and especially if you can borrow some technical backend talent that got their battle scars making Social Club work, well, then maybe you can build your own patching backend and get some convenience out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, not saying this will be the case with KSP2 now or in the future, but PD fits the profile of a publisher that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so I don\u0027t want people to have the wrong kind of expectations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I would much prefer for it to be handled through steam, in which case I can create a shortcut directly to the game, and never have to worry about the launcher.
