It\u0027s everybody who owned KSP buying the game at full price on release. Plus some new people who earlier bounced from game\u0027s difficulty, but are now lured in with shiny trailers and kept with better tutorials. That\u0027s the big prize, and the reason why publishers like sequels and why KSP2 got started in the first place. But you also want to know the worst case. When you\u0027re just starting the work on the game, your worst case is always $0. Project fails, you have nothing to sell, and you lost your investment. The initial, Star Theory budget for the game was probably in the $20M-$30M range. With the game changing hands, increased in scope, and getting further delayed, that budget has potentially as much as tripled. The worst case scenario went from, \u0022This stings,\u0022 to \u0022We\u0027ve had to sacrifice other projects (we haven\u0027t even announced yet) to keep funding this, and now it\u0027s all gone.\u0022 This is when you start wanting more concrete data on what the worst case scenario is, and this is when you start seriously considering Early Access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in some ways, the fact that EA was so broken and unfinished gave T2 the best possible data. It really was the worst-case scenario. We got to see how many of these potential buyers would go out and buy the game at full price pretty much no matter what. And there are zealots out there who\u0027ll be saying the community has failed. We didn\u0027t buy EA in sufficient quantity, and T2 lost faith in us. I think that\u0027s stupid for two reasons. First of all, T2 wanted an honest answer and they got an honest answer. They now know exactly what the floor for KSP2 sales is - it\u0027s EA sales. But more importantly, I don\u0027t think KSP2 EA did poorly. The estimates vary from 240k to over 500k. I\u0027m inclined to believe that various factors typically resulting in overestimates are hitting KSP2 particularly hard, so lets go with that lower number. Quarter of a million is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot bad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for early access. Not at all. And given that a lot of that would be at full price or close, that\u0027s around $10M in sales. This doesn\u0027t turn into $10M revenue, because Valve takes a cut and there are additional costs on just getting EA out and maintained, but it\u0027s respectable and it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then, if EA went smooth from the sales perspective, why is this not good enough? Well, that\u0027s the thing, I think it is good enough. And I think it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehelped\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a lot. We have to look at what\u0027s going on with the US economy. Brace yourself, I\u0027m going full nerd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake Two purchased KSP from Squad in 2017. We know that talks on getting KSP2 under way have started immediately, and it\u0027s likely that by late 2017 or early 2018 Star Theory started work on KSP2. US federal rate was around 1%. In 2019, the game was announced at E3, and KSP fans went nuts. Coverage was fantastic, excitement was in the air. Nate promised way more stuff than likely was in the original 2017 plans, and got an ok from T2 to expand the scope. (I never really learned in which order these two things happened, I think it\u0027d be kind of funny to picture Nate just running rogue here, but the reality is that there was probably already some sort of an agreement that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the game\u0027s news are well received... But I\u0027m speculating here.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLate 2019, T2 is in talks with ST to get the game scoped up, including how much it\u0027s going to cost to hire more people, extend development time, etc. We don\u0027t know all the details, but T2 doesn\u0027t like what they\u0027re hearing, they cut ties with ST, spin up Intercept, and use the fact that Star Theory\u0027s basically ruined to hire a bunch of people over. It\u0027s effectively a hostile takeover. Pandemic hits full force. Notably, fed cuts rate to basically 0% to keep the economy from tanking. Nobody\u0027s quite sure how developing games in the pandemic world will go. We enter the uncertain era. But there\u0027s light. Turns out, game development working from home is not bad, and game sales are booming. And that 0% fed rate? Oh, that\u0027s a gold mine. Suddenly, you can start new projects, expand scopes, and pay for it with borrowed money. So long as the game ships eventually and is good, you make profit. The more games you make this way, the more money you make as a company. This is when we get delay announcements, and behind the scenes, Intercept Games is growing and what I would call KSP2 Mk2 enters its new pre-production. This is a bigger game that\u0027s going longer to develop, but it\u0027s ok, because T2 has taken out credit to make the game, and based on the community reaction, they expect it to sell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward to mid-2022. Fed rate starts climbing. Suddenly, what was free no longer is. Now, if you\u0027re not offsetting your costs with revenue and you keep borrowing, you\u0027re paying interest. This is likely what pushed the Early Access decision. Take Two needed to be sure they aren\u0027t going to be loosing all that money\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eplus interest\u003C/em\u003E, and also to offset the costs, so that the interest isn\u0027t costing as much. Keep in mind that fed rate announcements are made fairly early. By the end of \u002722 the rate was at 4% and it was probably expected by the time EA decision was made internally. Game entered Early Access in early 2023 and odds are, that helped keep the development going for the next year and change. By late 2023, fed rate hit its current value of 5.5%. It hasn\u0027t been this high since\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E2007.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EEvery publisher out there that took out credits is bleeding, and that\u0027s basically everyone. Studios and projects are getting shut down left and right. My honest expectation is that if EA never happened and didn\u0027t generate $10M, we\u0027d see Intercept closed half a year ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now we\u0027re getting into the current situation. Yes, KSP2 EA did pretty well. Yes, there are tens of millions of USD still on the table for the full release of the game, and the game can probably make that if the tech issues are sorted, which I\u0027m sure they can be with time. But T2 needs money to pay for the project right now, and they can\u0027t borrow it. Their heavy hitters are still burning cash and aren\u0027t going to generate revenue for a bit yet, so every dollar the company makes from other titles has to go to feed that. KSP2 can make good money, but only once 1.0 and some DLCs ship, and that\u0027s a year out at the absolute best, possibly longer. So based on the information T2 has and on how the project is going, it has to be shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the money-making potential of the game is still there. When restarted, KSP2 won\u0027t have to be started nearly from scratch like with Star Theory to Intercept transfer. It can truly be restarted, continuing the development. Whatever work is left to ship the game, that\u0027s what will still need to be done. Some time will be lost onboarding a new team, but it\u0027s not a huge amount of time overall. The moment additional funds are available, I would expect T2 to want the development to resume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr In current market conditions, continuing development of a game that\u0027s more than a year out from being able to sustain its development with revenue is a huge risk. If you have a sure thing with huge ROI, yeah, you keep pouring what resources you have into it. But anything less than certain or only marginally profitable has to be shelved. It doesn\u0027t have to stay shelved forever, though. New revenue streams are going to become available soon and the forecast for the market is positive. At this point, I expect T2 to circle back to KSP2 in a few months at best, after GTA VI release at worst. It does mean that the most optimistic, rose-tinted glasses forecast for v1.0 release is late 2025 (with some scope cuts and if PD already has a new team in mind) and 2028 in the worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we probably will have a better picture after next week\u0027s earnings call.

It\u0027s everybody who owned KSP buying the game at full price on release. Plus some new people who earlier bounced from game\u0027s difficulty, but are now lured in with shiny trailers and kept with better tutorials. That\u0027s the big prize, and the reason why publishers like sequels and why KSP2 got started in the first place. But you also want to know the worst case. When you\u0027re just starting the work on the game, your worst case is always $0. Project fails, you have nothing to sell, and you lost your investment. The initial, Star Theory budget for the game was probably in the $20M-$30M range. With the game changing hands, increased in scope, and getting further delayed, that budget has potentially as much as tripled. The worst case scenario went from, \u0022This stings,\u0022 to \u0022We\u0027ve had to sacrifice other projects (we haven\u0027t even announced yet) to keep funding this, and now it\u0027s all gone.\u0022 This is when you start wanting more concrete data on what the worst case scenario is, and this is when you start seriously considering Early Access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in some ways, the fact that EA was so broken and unfinished gave T2 the best possible data. It really was the worst-case scenario. We got to see how many of these potential buyers would go out and buy the game at full price pretty much no matter what. And there are zealots out there who\u0027ll be saying the community has failed. We didn\u0027t buy EA in sufficient quantity, and T2 lost faith in us. I think that\u0027s stupid for two reasons. First of all, T2 wanted an honest answer and they got an honest answer. They now know exactly what the floor for KSP2 sales is - it\u0027s EA sales. But more importantly, I don\u0027t think KSP2 EA did poorly. The estimates vary from 240k to over 500k. I\u0027m inclined to believe that various factors typically resulting in overestimates are hitting KSP2 particularly hard, so lets go with that lower number. Quarter of a million is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot bad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for early access. Not at all. And given that a lot of that would be at full price or close, that\u0027s around $10M in sales. This doesn\u0027t turn into $10M revenue, because Valve takes a cut and there are additional costs on just getting EA out and maintained, but it\u0027s respectable and it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then, if EA went smooth from the sales perspective, why is this not good enough? Well, that\u0027s the thing, I think it is good enough. And I think it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehelped\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a lot. We have to look at what\u0027s going on with the US economy.

The more games you make this way, the more money you make as a company. This is when we get delay announcements, and behind the scenes, Intercept Games is growing and what I would call KSP2 Mk2 enters its new pre-production. This is a bigger game that\u0027s going longer to develop, but it\u0027s ok, because T2 has taken out credit to make the game, and based on the community reaction, they expect it to sell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward to mid-2022. Fed rate starts climbing. Suddenly, what was free no longer is. Now, if you\u0027re not offsetting your costs with revenue and you keep borrowing, you\u0027re paying interest. This is likely what pushed the Early Access decision. Take Two needed to be sure they aren\u0027t going to be loosing all that money\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eplus interest\u003C/em\u003E, and also to offset the costs, so that the interest isn\u0027t costing as much. Keep in mind that fed rate announcements are made fairly early. By the end of \u002722 the rate was at 4% and it was probably expected by the time EA decision was made internally. Game entered Early Access in early 2023 and odds are, that helped keep the development going for the next year and change. By late 2023, fed rate hit its current value of 5.5%. It hasn\u0027t been this high since\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E2007.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EEvery publisher out there that took out credits is bleeding, and that\u0027s basically everyone. Studios and projects are getting shut down left and right. My honest expectation is that if EA never happened and didn\u0027t generate $10M, we\u0027d see Intercept closed half a year ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now we\u0027re getting into the current situation. Yes, KSP2 EA did pretty well. Yes, there are tens of millions of USD still on the table for the full release of the game, and the game can probably make that if the tech issues are sorted, which I\u0027m sure they can be with time. But T2 needs money to pay for the project right now, and they can\u0027t borrow it. Their heavy hitters are still burning cash and aren\u0027t going to generate revenue for a bit yet, so every dollar the company makes from other titles has to go to feed that. KSP2 can make good money, but only once 1.0 and some DLCs ship, and that\u0027s a year out at the absolute best, possibly longer. So based on the information T2 has and on how the project is going, it has to be shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the money-making potential of the game is still there. When restarted, KSP2 won\u0027t have to be started nearly from scratch like with Star Theory to Intercept transfer. It can truly be restarted, continuing the development. Whatever work is left to ship the game, that\u0027s what will still need to be done. Some time will be lost onboarding a new team, but it\u0027s not a huge amount of time overall. The moment additional funds are available, I would expect T2 to want the development to resume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr In current market conditions, continuing development of a game that\u0027s more than a year out from being able to sustain its development with revenue is a huge risk. If you have a sure thing with huge ROI, yeah, you keep pouring what resources you have into it. But anything less than certain or only marginally profitable has to be shelved. It doesn\u0027t have to stay shelved forever, though. New revenue streams are going to become available soon and the forecast for the market is positive. At this point, I expect T2 to circle back to KSP2 in a few months at best, after GTA VI release at worst. It does mean that the most optimistic, rose-tinted glasses forecast for v1.0 release is late 2025 (with some scope cuts and if PD already has a new team in mind) and 2028 in the worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we probably will have a better picture after next week\u0027s earnings call.

In fact, part of the reason 2023 was so great for revenue is because the rates were so low the previous years, and more good games were being made. Turns out, the market\u0027s not saturated. If you make more good games, people will buy more good games. However, when a lot of the hires were made in late 2021 and early 2022, the publishers were counting on all that projected revenue\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0were expecting to continue borrowing money. But now borrowing money is more expensive, money that already has been borrowed needs repayment (because a lot of loans are flexible, and new rates apply to money already borrowed!) and well, revenues are great, but the bubble was simply larger. So cuts are being made, and over the next couple of years, we\u0027ll see revenue drop back down because of it. It sucks, and I wish companies would budget for the money they have and not what they might be able to borrow, but without some major changes to laws regulating all of that, it\u0027s not likely to change much.

It\u0027s hard to know how much experience either one of them had with game physics outside of the industry, but it is definitely a weak spot.

I actually have two patents on game physics from one of the games I\u0027ve worked on. So this is familiar territory for me, and in my opinion, the people Intercept hired to lead physics for the game would be capable of delivering on quality, but could be partially responsible for it taking longer than anticipated due to their inexperience with the specifics. The fact that the first one left and had to be replaced, means that time was lost twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do kind of understand the decision to hire from academia.

As far as I know, the major ones have been addressed. It\u0027s hard to say if they were addressed in a timely matter, as all of my information on it is second-hand. It is possible, that there have been systemic failures on the side of the leadership, resulting in what would be fair to call \u0022studio\u0027s fault.\u0022 But this is speculative. We do not have clear evidence of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, T2/PD failures are evident. IG\u0027s are speculation, but plausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-11T21:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^Definitely. I personally think the scope was really ambitious but great given what KSP1 was. I, personally, have little interest in multiplayer but I see the appeal. I also think while interstellar is cool getting the basic game down first with colonies and resources was the most important thing to making a really compelling play experience. If T2 \u002B PD weren\u0027t comfortable funding the full scope just rebuild KSP1 with colonies and respources and add GP2. Make interstellar as expansions. Obviously we didn\u0027t even get to colony parts before IG got liquidated but again to me thats because T2 needed cash and wasn\u0027t willing to wait for a viable product and forced a premature EA. I think he was wrong on wobbly rockets and maybe some of the way workspaces played out but as far as the overall tone, ideas, and general design goes Nate did a great job. Thats me though. I always thought removing money and skills to make room for colonies and resources was smart.
