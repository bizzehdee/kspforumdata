I did follow the development of KSP2 about as closely as was possible. Nate is the creative director. He oversees the look, feel, and overall design of the game. I personally think those aspects of the game were really pretty great. He got the tone and look of the game right, the overall scope was ambitious but definitely worthy of a true successor to the game. It\u0027s a little more controversial but I think eliminating money and simplifying heat were the right moves. I also think folks who say rockets should have been 100 rigid and shatter like glass are wrong, though obviously the amount of wobble at launch was also way overboard. Im also not personally crazy about the lore aspects of the game but I think with a more fleshed out mission tree and the ability to map points of interest from orbit the overall science gameplay would be a big improvement over the original. In short I think he did a great job at the things that were his job. He was also really personally passionate about KSP and that made him a good spokesperson in the videos you saw. Keep in mind there are lots of other people who had more power than he did, you just don\u0027t know their names or faces so you\u0027ve latched on to Nate because he\u0027s a face you can focus your anger on rather than an amorphous megacorp and the social climate that allows them to abuse employees and customers alike. Those are the people who set unreasonable timelines, ignored technical challenges, and forced out an EA that was clearly not ready for prime time. Those decisions cost us the game we were promised, the people at IG their jobs, and in the end cost T2 and their investors money.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-03T14:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomebody has to be an anthropomorphic personification of evil, otherwise whom to blame?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-03T14:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224395334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224984\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221717424260\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t follow those other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy that logic, I didn\u0027t follow KSP1 until it was already at 1.8, so the history of the devs and Squad and whomever else was involved doesn\u0027t matter, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that Nate\u0027s history is working against him.\u00A0 Whether or not it is right to blame him for whatever shortfalls KSP2 had, he was the public face of the game AND he has a history of making these kinds of promises with games that failed.\u00A0 That all works to his disadvantage, right or wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-03T14:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNate Simpson is an incompetent Manager who has run every game he touches into the ground is libelous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel Nate Simspon Is an extreme Narcissist and my personal opinion paints him as completely incompetent.. is not\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat isn\u0027t to say somebody couldn\u0027t CLAIM the latter is as well.\u00A0 It would involve a lengthy process involving a chain of causality with my \u0022stated opinion\u0022\u00A0 proven to have impacted bottom line, reputation in some meaningful way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever since inam a nobody without significant period in the industry establishing my opinion as something of merit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really is as much about who is doing the \u0022saying\u0022 as \u0022what\u0022 is being said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-03T15:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224395221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224984\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221717385199\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227522\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WatchClarkBand\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, WatchClarkBand said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want to point out that everyone at Intercept only knew what they were told by PD and T2.
