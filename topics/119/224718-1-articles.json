We-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean the new planets. New star systems. Interstellar travel. Colonies, mister developer. Are you making the kind of features that would make this game a worthwhile purchase?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have some new 3D models of orbital colony modules.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do they work?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They don\u0027t explode 35 seconds after being placed anymore.

Can you demonstrate to me how this colony would work for the player?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, we have a flowchart here. See, the players input would be-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, not the concept. The implementation. Open the debug menu and place a colony in-game. Show me what a player can do with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, it\u0027s just a 3D model for now. We haven\u0027t started on the implementation itself yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And why is that, mister developer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh ... well, you see, we kind of worked off the code base on KSP1, where colonies weren\u0027t implemented, and when we got the same code running in KSP2, and colonies didn\u0027t work there either, and after that, we sort of changed focus to work on engine exhausts instead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe meeting room is silent for 36 seconds, until the colony 3D model placed in the game explodes violently and the game crashes to desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you haven\u0027t even started yet, is that what you\u0027re saying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have some new concept art of a fusion rocket ...\u0022 the developer nervously opens Blender, but gives up when the auditor glares at him again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How about the new star systems?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, I can tell you a bit about those. See, Kerbal Space Program was coded to have the Sun at the origin of its coordinate system. Everything in-game happens in relation to the Sun. Everything orbits the Sun. Every planet needs the Sun as a central body. So if you want more star systems, you have to make a new coordinate system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How is progress on that front?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, to start with, we copied over the code from Kerbal Space Program 1, and made that work okay-ish except for a few bugs, and now we realized we would have to start anew if we want more solar systems, because we\u0027re under the exact same limitations as the previous game. So we went to work on clouds instead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you\u0027re saying that, essentially, you have spent five years trying to make an inferior copy of Kerbal Space Program 1, with prettier graphics, without getting even \u003Cem\u003Ea little\u003C/em\u003E closer to making it \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E to add the features that were the whole reason why players wanted a sequel in the first place?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhh ... we have some nice concept art too! We have many ideas!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How close are you to bringing those ideas to reality?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you give us, say, five more years, and a hundred million dol-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe auditor gets up and leaves.
