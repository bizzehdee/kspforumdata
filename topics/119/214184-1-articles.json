Evidence for this idea is that manoeuvre nodes are incomplete and buggy, and the huge number of bugs in physics, staging, docking etc. Meanwhile the Kerbals animation is done and looks great, the art assets in general are high quality, nice effects with the sun shining through the atmosphere etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think this means the art had a higher priority. I expect both the art side AND the basic gameplay mechanics, were expected to be complete by the 24th Feb. What happened is the devs working on gameplay had a lot of unexpected complications and took longer to complete work than expected. Meanwhile the artists completed their work on time, since there were no hidden complications in what they were trying to achieve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re solving problems, you can\u0027t really estimate very accurately how long it\u0027ll take you to solve it. You really don\u0027t know how long it\u0027ll take until you\u0027ve done it. Much of what has happened with KSP2\u0027s development/release history can be explained with this. In interviews I\u0027ve seen the development leads say the existence of multiplayer, and all that it implies, has massively complicated basically every feature they\u0027ve added to the game. Simply keeping track of where the spacecraft is, and where it\u0027s going, in a way that scales to interstellar distances, was a massive challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s also an assumption going around that what we can actually see in the game right now is EVERYTHING the devs have worked on for the last 3\u002B years, and anything we can\u0027t see will have to be started from scratch. This does not seem to be the case. I\u0027ve heard (I forget where, Scott Manley?) that multiplayer is almost done and the devs are testing builds with it. Some systems were nearly done and not yet enabled in the build like heat. I get the impression that once the base game stabilises, the features on the roadmap might be added quicker than we\u0027re expecting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case lets not be so quick to harshly judge the developers for their speed and ability to deliver features and a working game. There is far, far too much we don\u0027t know to make any accurate judgements. We\u0027re not even sure how long they\u0027ve been working on the codebase, and none of us have ever developed a game like KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T10:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking shiny stuff is easier than coding the shiny stuff to work as intended.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249655\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214184\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677753347\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022106937\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mutex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, Mutex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened is the devs working on gameplay had a lot of unexpected complications and took longer to complete work than expected.
