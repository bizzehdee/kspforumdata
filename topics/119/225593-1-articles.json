I think not. Since GTA series began in 1997 this looks like art immitating life. Immitation, it is often said, is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor plot purposes in film game has a dark secret being (fictionally) built with stolen code. I am not suggesting that is immitation, just a plot necessity and trope for low ethics. The audience must \u00A0decipher what is satire and what is fiction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntwan was the thief, in order to prevent his dark secret being revealed and save his money (which is where real world satirical parallels reemerge like new born butterflies drying their fragile wings in the dawn light) he destroys his own game... by hacking the servers ... with a fire axe, of course ... its Hollywood, anything is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wonderful metaphor, I thought, a fire axe in the back of a server, for the destructive act of stopping KSP2 mid development for the sake of mere money, oh where is the humanity? Anyway it made me laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wondered, with all this extraordinary satirical reflection going on... considering Free City was produced in 2021 and today looks like a prophesy of the subsequent destruction of Private Division in 2024, it makes one wonder if life is now immitating art?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo big dev studio bosses feel encouraged to behave like on screen stereotypes? Is Taika Waititi\u0027s Antwan a voice in their head like his imaginary Hitler in Jojo Rabbit? Is that how it works?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question I really want to ask is this, does Antwan dress like the guy who shut down KSP2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be glad to hear of any more game related satire out there which might give as a laugh about the KSP2 situation and perhaps poke little fun at our friends in TTWO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QIxejem.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002284.25\u0022 height=\u0022934\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QIxejem.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"para 9","CreatedById":234380,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-29T16:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is so cringe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Corpo suits = movie villain bad.\u0022 lol. ok.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022creatives\u0022 at PD and Intercept did a great job in authoring their own destruction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-29T17:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, this thread is coming up at the right time for me.\u00A0 I started watching Tron last night on Disney\u002B, which is effectively \u0022corpo suits = movie villain\u0022.\u00A0 For those of you who haven\u0027t seen this, the plot is effectively that Jeff Bridges is a great software engineer who wrote multiple video games that were then stolen by David Warner and pawned off as his own, which catapults Mr. Warner into the executive chair.\u00A0 Warner then writes a program that somehow is able to pull Bridges into the computer world, where Bridges has to try and survive all while attempting to find proof of the theft AND bring down Warner\u0027s program.\u00A0 That\u0027s a massive over-simplification, but there you have it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, I started watching it last night (for the billionth time, I might add), and that kind of fits into this thread here.\u00A0 Sofware devs are hosed by other corporate entities - in this case, another dev - and don\u0027t get the credit they deserve while watching their original creation do something that wasn\u0027t intended.\u00A0 In the case of Bridges, he writes multiple video games that go on to become massive successes, but he gets no credit while Warner does.\u00A0 In the spirit of Hollywood, there are multiple other storylines going on, such as the MCP trying to take over the world, and other programs written by end users - such as TRON, written by Bruce Boxleitner - being either shut down, forced offline, or destroyed because they pose a threat to the MCP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the movie is pure early 80s cheese.\u00A0 But I dig it, and I think it fits into the spirit of this thread.\u00A0 And when I\u0027m done with Tron, I\u0027ll rewatch Tron:\u00A0 Legacy (but I refuse to watch the animated TV show; I can\u0027t get behind Bridges\u0027 program CLU being the bad guy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-29T19:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBig bad bullying poor little creatives is bound to fascinate decent folk like us.
