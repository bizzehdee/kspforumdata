It seems kind of weird to me that anyone would expect them to. Within those constraints there\u0027s so much people can say. I work for a 6-person firm and those rules are true for us too. Everyone came into the KSP2 EA with expectations about that would look like and it\u0027s pretty clear the product in that moment way underperformed. All you have to do is look at the Steam rating to see that. I\u0027m honestly surprised it\u0027s as high as it is. And to me thats the entire problem: the game is much buggier than an EA release should be. No amount of corporate happy talk or axe-grinding public flagellation will change the fundamental fact of the matter, so I find all the backseat complaining about Intercept\u0027s PR misplaced, pointless, and tedious. When we see Nate or Chris or Dakota or anyone from the actual dev team chiming in they\u0027re being good soldiers, trying to maintain a hopeful, positive attitude for the game and Im sure to a certain degree for themselves. Obviously they know what the reality is and that folks aren\u0027t happy so I see no utility in rubbing it in. But yeah, you\u0027re gonna have to take everything you read with a grain of salt, understand statements in the spirit they\u0027re meant, and not let yourself confuse subjective interpretations and unfulfilled expectations with malintent. The actual headline, main assertions--no microtransactions, none of the roadmap content on the way to 1.0 will cost extra, etc. are all pretty firm commitments and aren\u0027t just subjective interpretations about what \u0022soon\u0022 means. I have no reason to believe they\u0027d go back on actual promises. The actual people making this game are trying as hard as they can to push this game uphill so that it can be something really great. I feel like its okay to see them as people and let them do their jobs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-25T21:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2023 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 25\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moeggz","CreatedById":107035,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-25T21:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey just delayed the re entry heat video, not the update, the video.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuntil after summer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndelayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntheir apology was meaningless they can\u2019t even just screen record their wip vfx for the next\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethree weeks.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I wanted to anger a community and burn most of the goodwill I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do differently then what they are doing now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-25T21:48:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2023 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 25\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by moeggz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-25T22:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
