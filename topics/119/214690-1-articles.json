I haven\u2019t bought the game yet so have no idea how it actually runs on my computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Other:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore than Sandbox is my main requirement. I had plenty of sandbox time in KSP1 and whilst a prettier sandbox is always nice, I\u2019m unlikely to plunk down my money just for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext requirement (and this might sound trite) is for the good bits of the game to outweigh the meh bits or plain bad bits. I haven\u2019t been following KSP2 development with bated breath but I\u2019ve read enough about it that there are planned gameplay elements that I think I\u2019ll like and planned gameplay elements that *as written*, leave me cold. Time will tell but I\u2019m not expecting to love everything about KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Incidentally, I\u2019m not fussed about all promised features being included. Promises change, can be harder to implement than expected, and can get quietly dropped.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - a well thought out interface that works well with whatever new features get added. As KSP1 acquired expansions, I often felt that the UI didn\u2019t really grow to accommodate the more elaborate features very well, especially stuff like robotics and rotorcraft, which felt kinda wedged into UI paradigms that didn\u2019t really work very well for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of that is no doubt down to me but on the other hand, I do only have finite time and patience for figuring out UI quirks. I have plenty of other things to be doing and hobbies to be enjoying rather than beating my head against the wall of any one computer game. That\u2019s a general observation - I\u2019m not singling out KSP2 here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"caipi","CreatedById":119538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-08T21:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI left a negative review because I think -from experience with other EA games- that this game is in an (pre-?) Alpha state, worse than KSP 1 at 0.23 (when I first bought KSP1), not worth the money, and has been \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edisimproved a lot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t care about performance and \u0022promised features\u0022 in an EA. Bug fixing and performance are something for a Closed or Open Beta. So Fuel Flow is currently completely broken (even without landing legs etc.), so what? Easy fix. Kerbals count as Debris and cannot EVA if persistent debris is set to 0. Well, that sounds like an easy fix as well. And all the other tiny and large bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do care about is that it feels like the devs barely played the original game and made lots of changes which are worse than the original. To name just a few:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire interface is way too big, takes up too much screen space (I think a modder in this community once said that screen space is very valuable real estate and should not be wasted - was it LGG? I don\u0027t remember), and centralizes a lot of things which makes it hard to compare or access multiple stuff simultaneously. Individual Part Windows are gone. They have been split among Resource Manager, Part Manager, etc. I can\u0027t just click on a part and see its fuel content and click on another part and see its content.\u00A0 In general, the idea of a Resource Manager is good. But why not make it an addition to the individual part window? Same for Part Manager. Why do I always have to open such a big, chunky Manager just to do something tiny? And having to hover over 20 tanks (so that it gets visually highlighted) by the same name just to find the one I\u0027m looking for is just such a bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsparagus Staging is apparently not as easy as in KSP1 anymore because you cannot separate parts in staging anymore (e.g. if decouplers have been added in symmetry mode). Why? It is also a bother having to add all fuel lines one by one. Previously you could just symmetry add them and remove the last two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n/edit: I completely forgot that fuel flow priority has been completely removed for no apparent reason. Yet another disimprovement over KSP1 - why? /editend\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost annoying: If you, the developers, want people to test your product so that they help you in developing a bug free product, don\u0027t make them pay for it like a AA game. I remember the time when players were invited and paid (in one form or another, even if it were only cosmetic ingame goodies worth 0) to help developers. Now I have to pay for it an absurd amount of money (for the given broken state of a ported game based on its predecessor)? Thanks but no thanks. I finally refunded the game and don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll buy it again. It looks too much like a cheap cash grab right now and KSP1 offers much more user friendly content which hasn\u0027t been disimproved by a single-minded developer vision of a narrow and centralized gameplay. I fear that with the current direction of the development, KSP2 will miss out on the great diversity that KSP1 offered and which made it so successful. KSP1 had so much possibilities for mods. KSP2 seems to close the door on many cases already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-08T23:01:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2023 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by caipi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
