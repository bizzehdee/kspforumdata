It doesn\u0027t neccessarily mean that foundation is fragile, but it just happen to not account for certain edge cases that planners/developers/testers didn\u0027t think of when they were working on a system. This is where 80/20 rule comes from - it takes a relatively small amount of time (\u002220%\u0022) to implement a system, and then the bulk of work (\u002280%\u0022) goes into ensuring it works over the entire range of cases which it\u0027s supposed to work. The first stage (\u002220%\u0022) is usually referred to as \u0022initial development\u0022 (or simply\u0022 development\u0022), and the second one (\u002280%\u0022) is \u0022stabilization\u0022. There is also a rule of diminishing returns - meaning that you tend to get the most gains in the beginning of stabilization stage (\u0022low hanging fruit\u0022), but as it goes on, it takes progressively more effort to achieve the next step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArmed with this information, you can actually get a rough idea of where on this journey each sub-system is - if you see a lot of bugfixes in certain sub-system, that means it\u0027s just entered a stabilization stage (and it\u0027s got a long way to go), but if you see developers wrestling with the same issues for a long time - that means this sub-system is closer towards the end of stabilization.

The current trajectory bug that makes interplanetary transfers difficult is a great example of a lack of accuracy, as well as the orbital decay bug.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAccuracy\u003C/strong\u003E is where we see the effects of the game\u0027s foundation most of all. And like you said, I hoped that the foundations underlying accuracy would have been the ones improved in a new game built from the ground up. The most notable improvement here is the ability to use engines under timewarp, but other foundations were not significantly improved on compared to KSP1 such as spring-based joints and drag cubes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the part-based physics system is the foundation of KSP\u0027s vehicle behaviour, and is primarily responsible for performance quickly getting worse when building vehicles with higher part count and many flight bugs as well as phantom forces (aka, the kraken) also originate here. There have been calls on the forum to get rid of the wobbliness or at least rein it in, as well as enabling scaling to high part count vehicles. Both of these come down to this foundational system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-28T13:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224296600\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687560966\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/23/2023 at 7:56 PM, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone said you should skip it, but they did warn their viewers to expect a less than perfect game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem I see with this statement is that a less then perfect game is something we already have with KSP\u00B9\u2026 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople was expecting way too more from KSP2, and I think this is their only really big problem for now (everything else is just going to be fixed as time goes by).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakitess","CreatedById":89253,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-28T14:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was clearly expecting something else than what we have right now, and even without the whole bug mess, the performances issues, etc : a \u0022perfectly\u0022 working KSP2 as it exists theses days is far far below my expectations.
