The following are just some personal views and observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing a long-term player of KSP, I was excited at the announcement of a sequel. But I was also apprehensive as to the direction the game would be taken. I had been playing flight sims on and off since 2004, so when I came across KSP it was the perfect union between a simulation game and physics sandbox I didn\u2019t know I needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 has the potential to take that unique formula and expand it, unshackled by it\u2019s predecessors roots as a simple unity project. It is my understanding that KSP2 was written from scratch, and does not borrow source code from KSP1 (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). This should have left the doors wide open for a radical re-imagining of what KSP (and space sims as a whole) could be. Instead, the developers chose to make Kerbal Space Program, again. Albeit, with some very welcome quality of life improvements and graphical upgrades. Because of this approach, I\u2019ve seen bugs and physics problems have either been solved or alleviated in the original for years, re-appear in the sequel. For example, wobbly rockets, which is an inherent problem of a vehicle made from dozens of interconnected parts, was worked around in KSP1 using struts and later auto-struts. KSP2 presented the developers with an opportunity to redo the vehicle assembly and parts physics from the ground up. But instead, in an attempt to stick with the familiar \u2018pick and place\u2019 building method, they have given themselves the same obstacles they already overcame years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tutorials, while not a big deal for plyers like myself, are an important part of making an otherwise technical game accessible. But if the developers felt that the accessibility of the first game is lacking, I see no reason why that tutorial system could not have been added in an update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe feature set to come to KSP2 during its early access development are exciting, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that most, if not all of these features are already available though KSP1\u2019s modding scene. And while I\u2019m sure that these feature can be well implemented by the devs, to me, it still doesn\u2019t justify the sequel on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have liked to see an overhaul of the vehicle assembly system, including: Fully procedural parts like fuel tanks, engines and even habitation and command modules. N-body physics instead of sphere of influence orbital mechanics (even if it is just for the currently active craft). And maybe even control of kerbals inside spacecraft and habitation modules. But It\u0027s looking like we\u0027re not going to get the next generation space sim we\u0027ve been hoping for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks if to made to the end of my ramble, I needed to get this off my chest.

As is ships ignoring the gravity of other ships. Otherwise, I\u0027d prefer they\u0027d do the full n-body simulation for how each ship is affected by the planets/moons/asteroids. Or I guess at that point it\u0027d be \u0022the partial n-body simulation\u0022 since the vast majority of the total gravity from those n bodies would be from objects which are on rails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the possibility of running planets/moons on some sort of \u0022partial\u0022 rails, where their motion is calculated using n-body physics, but without including the spaceships (or maybe just without anything below some mass ratio, since an asteroid wouldn\u0027t meaningfully affect the orbit of a planet but it might do so to a small moon) so that their motion can be calculated asynchronously in the background, separate from the gravity part of the \u0022main\u0022 physics engine. I mean, on the scale of a planet vs even a large spaceship, the ship is, at most, a rounding error.\u00A0Such an approach would probably require the devs/modders to run some calculations on solar systems before publishing them to ensure they\u0027ll have the desired stability on the timescale a game is likely to encompass\u00A0(emphasis on the word \u0022desired\u0022, since unstable systems could make for some interesting \u0022maintain the resource networks after everything falls apart\u0022 late-game challenges), but that doesn\u0027t seem like the end of the world to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure where asteroids would fit in... Compared to the mass of spaceships and on the timescales of a fly-by, they\u0027re huge, but it\u0027s clearly not the same thing as the mass of a planet vs the mass of a spaceship. However, on longer timescales the gravitational influence of the spaceship on the asteroid can really add up (to the degree that, AFAIK, a \u0022gravity tug\u0022 is considered to be a plausible way to get asteroids off a collision course with Earth). Plus, given the success of the DART mission, it\u0027s pretty clear that \u0022player-sized objects\u0022 can affect the trajectory of an asteroid even on short timescales when impacts are involved. So you can\u0027t really just ignore the interaction between asteroids and spaceships, either, but maybe you can if there\u0027s not some minimum distance between them? I\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregA","CreatedById":126788,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T23:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224242887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677367643\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232305\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheOtherDave\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, TheOtherDave said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstuff...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I think it comes down to limited developer time.\u00A0 Would you rather the developers be spending their time making a good space ship simulator, or a solar system simulator?\u00A0 For a truly dynamic system like you are describing the developers would spend a bunch of time tuning it and getting it right, and those are resources that would be better spent making a good space ship simulator.\u00A0 For the time being I think most folks reading and posting would rather the developers be working on their spaceship simulator, if forum thread titles are to be believed.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing with Unreal Engine a lot recently, it would be almost trivial to make a gravity orbit tool toy thingie in UE with blueprints.\u00A0 \u00A0 Maybe I do that tonight and post some screen caps of what I come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T00:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224242928\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677369362\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126788\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregA\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, GregA said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing with Unreal Engine a lot recently, it would be almost trivial to make a gravity orbit tool toy thingie in UE with blueprints.\u00A0 \u00A0 Maybe I do that tonight and post some screen caps of what I come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease let this be the KSP themed origin story of what Cities: Skylines was to Sim City 5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Opus_723","CreatedById":170390,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T00:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get why everyone is acting like the number of *vessels* is a big hurdle to the use of N-body physics.
