If you launch a craft it will retain its settings, thats fine. But every time you launch a new craft it reverts. And again, I dont know why the default camera mode has left right as rotate. To me, that is a camera mode that shouldnt exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thewhitemetroid","CreatedById":202561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T01:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having the exact same issue as you among other bugs unfortunately.
