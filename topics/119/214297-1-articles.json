The procedural wings are on par with KSP1\u0027s B9 Procedural Wings, without needing a weird hotkey to access the wing parameters. However, I did have an issue selecting certain wing parts after they had been placed. I speculate that this is related to the collider not being regenerated with the new wing shape. Luckily, I was able to tune a different wing part to suit my needs.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EIt seems that the thickness of a wing part has a notable effect in its lift characteristics.

Where KSP1 has a jagged Perlin noise ridge with terrain polygons a hundred meters across, KSP2 has a pretty well detailed hillside. They seem a bit further away now, or at any rate don\u0027t loom on the horizon like they used to. It\u0027s a bit of a shame losing the landmark, but the quality is much better. Terrain scatter was distributed a bit oddly, with trees in weird clumps and massive open spaces between them, but I don\u0027t really expect too much from a low priority feature like ground scatter right now. Suffice it to say, I look forward to exploring this terrain by rover in the future.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was a persistent issue in my play.

The twitchiness makes it consume a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel (during the M\u00FCn rocket component of the playtest) and I spent most of my time with the plane flying with it off.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EUnfortunately I crashed the plane during the KSP2 test, while trying to land it on the mountains. Rather than flying back east and over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I reverted to launch for the flight across to the island. Still, the trip was long enough to really appreciate what has been done with physics timewarp. Apart from exacerbating the twitchiness of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, there was no apparent loss of sim quality. The wings stayed on with maneuver and the plane stayed on target (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EI flew over to the island runway. They really did it dirty, I think. Gone are the ruins. Now there are two small tent-like buildings and a\u2026 water tower? I think it would have been more suitable to preserve some of the history of KSP with the structures there. Or maybe one level of memorial objects is enough? Still, it seems a step backwards compared to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s massive leap forwards, in terms of story.

First, I wasn\u0027t able to build a fairing to my requirements, because it refused to allow me to add segments except under circumstances I didn\u0027t understand.

I\u0027d much prefer to be able to toggle it. Additionally, I\u0027m not sure how to grab the entire assembly from an arbitrary part. In KSP1, this is done by shift-clicking a part.

My rocket design was conservative, but even so there was no excessive floppiness. Performance was\u2026 well, it was bad, but from what I hear there are Big Issues, and those are always easier to deal with than a myriad of small issues. I found that my personal limit to performance is somewhere around 10\u201312 FPS. If I get that, I can consider it playable. Below that, it is not playable.

However, I am not yet ready to invest my trust in this team and this project. If Intercept proves themselves to me, then I will put forward my trust and fully commit to KSP2. They can do this in one simple way: Release a patch, within my refund period (i.e. on or before March 14), which addresses at least one glaring performance issue and provides a genuine attempt at transparency into the development process. I understand that not every indie or \u0022indie\u0022 developer is on the same level as Wube, but I do not think it is out of line to expect this much from Intercept.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-03T18:21:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2023 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by 0111narwhalz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixing word wrap (how did that even happen)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moons","CreatedById":227067,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T16:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what you did wrong - but your text is unreadable since it has a horizontal scrolling bar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-03T16:48:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2023 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Moons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T17:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea.
