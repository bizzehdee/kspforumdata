And what is the opportunity cost of shelling out the $50 now? That is, is there anything else you\u0027d be missing out on because you spent the money already?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fairly confident that KSP2 will get done, and will be interesting enough for me to buy it at full price. Even if things are going a lot worse than I think, and there will be some shakeups in the studio forced by PD, and the game eventually releases in full in 2025 - just to imagine a particularly bad scenario, whether I spend $50 now or $60 then isn\u0027t really impactful. There\u0027s a chance that the game doesn\u0027t get finished at all, and then I\u0027m effectively out of $50. I think the risk is very low, and it won\u0027t hurt me much if I\u0027m wrong. So for me, the effective cost of participating is very close to nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat math won\u0027t work out the same way for everyone. For some people, spending $50 on KSP2 now would mean not getting to enjoy something else they wanted to buy. In these kinds of situations, pre-orders and early access of any kind are just a bad idea. Hold on to your money until you know what you\u0027re getting. Alternatively, some people might be very pessimistic about the development so far, and evaluate the risk very differently. If the risk of the game not finishing is very high, then the expectation value for the cost of participating in the early access goes up to as high as the full $50 in the worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe concern is valid, and I would absolutely make sure that if I\u0027m making a recommendation, the person I\u0027m telling this to is fully informed about the state of the game, the delays, and anything else that might impact their evaluation of the risk.
