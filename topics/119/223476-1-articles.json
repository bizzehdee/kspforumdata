If i try to route it to the main rocket stack and then put the cargo bay AROUND it, the cargo bay just sits on top leaving a massive gap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the same with decouplers/separators. I wanted to have a small dock at the top of a stage and then put a large separator around the outside. The problem is, the separator attaches itself to the top of the dock centrally (even though they aren\u0027t physically touching). So then I end up with this annoying gap in the rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way around this that I\u0027m just not figuring out, or is this actually how it\u0027s designed? Because it seems a bit crazy to me that I can attach/root to something that I\u0027m not physically connected to. Surely the outside edge of the, lets say fuel tank, should be the bit the decoupler/seperator/cargo bay is physically attaching to.

In the example above, the \u0022real life\u0022 way to attach the decoupler would be circumerentially, directly to its parent part, but the Kerbal way is a floating node in the middle of the circle the decoupler forms.
