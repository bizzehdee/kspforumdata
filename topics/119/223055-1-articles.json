I\u0027m struggling to carry enough fuel to make round-trip Apollo-style Mun landings, and so I\u0027m wondering what to research next. I have 523 research on hand. I see Fuel Lines are available, and the descriptions hints that asparagus staging is still a thing.\u00A0 But I haven\u0027t played KSP for a couple years, it\u0027s been longer than that since I last tried asparagus staging, and I\u0027ve mostly forgotten how it works. Would it help me? Or would I be better off getting , say, Expanded Construction (which might help me build better landers or rockets), or work toward Atmospheric Science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not timing my burns optimally. I know enough to burn at PE to affect the AP, and vice-versa. But when landing on the Mun, is it best to slow down far from the surface, or close to it? Or is a gradual slow burn best? (I know there are excellent autopilot mods that can do this better than I possibly can, but I\u0027ve always enjoyed flying manually.) Likewise, when coming home to land on Kerbin, is it best to establish a low circular orbit, or can one just get away with establishing an elliptical orbit with high apopapsis and low periapsis, and then just burning retrograde from the periapsis?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance. Apologies if I\u0027ve chosen the wrong forum for these sort of newbish questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dmsilev","CreatedById":169176,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-16T23:17:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor landing in a vacuum, the optimal approach is a \u0022suicide burn\u0022, where you do a de-orbit burn, coast until you\u0027re almost at the ground, and then brake all at once, coming to an exact stop at exactly 0 meters above ground level. That\u0027s ...challenging to do by hand, though people have certainly done it, so a safer approach is to plan on coming to more or less a full stop 1 km or so above the terrain (set nav ball to surface retrograde, burn until velocity is nearly zero), then switch to Surface Up orientation, do a controlled fall, and bring the velocity down as you get close to surface. How slow you fall depends on how good a feel you have for your ship\u0027s acceleration when you ramp up the engine. Faster with a single sharp burn at the end is more efficient, but slower can be easier when you\u0027re first trying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor getting home, an elliptical orbit is fine. Just set the PE to be a reasonable depth within the atmosphere and you won\u0027t even need the retrograde burn. Doesn\u0027t hurt to burn off any remaining fuel to bleed off speed just before reentry, but it isn\u0027t necessary.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsparagus staging is definitely still a thing in KSP2. Set up a central core \u00A0(tank and engine) with three radial decouplers. To each decoupler, add a fuel tank, an engine, a nose cone, and a fuel line going from the outer tank to the central one. Finally, under staging, have the first stage be all four engines, the second stage be the radial decouplers, and the third stage the central decoupler for dropping the central stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-17T00:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your reply! That was exactly the kind of information I was hoping for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I assume asparagus staging is more efficient than just slapping on some solid-fuel boosters, which is what I\u2019ve been doing. \u00A0From an aesthetic perspective, I don\u2019t love the look of either solution. I want my Apollo missions to lift off in a Saturn V!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I think I\u2019ll try it. I can get Kerbals to the Mun, but I\u2019m struggling making it a round-trip.

Like for the Mun, first brake to 350 m/s, then 250 m/s, then 150 m/s, and when at around 500-1000 m depending on my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, to 50 m/s. All of these at full throttle.
