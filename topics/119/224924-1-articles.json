This also explains why they hit pretty much the exact same walls. It\u0027s HILARIOUS to me they might\u0027ve pitched a re-engineering of the original game code with none or little knowledge of it and much less asking the people that worked on it about it. Talk about overpromising and underdelivering, something Uber was known for from previous titles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was also really easy to guess that T2 really did see Kerbal as a golden egg goose, good to have confirmation.

At least ShadowZone understands wobblyness in real rockets, even if he uses that to make a dumb case about \u0022teaching engineering\u0022. No, enabling parts to clip into each other or otherwise exploding out of the blue does not teach engineering, it teaches \u003Cem\u003Echeesing. \u003C/em\u003ECouple that with the statement saying he was actively steering stuff away from realism specifically to dumb it down... yeah... no wonder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point (16 minutes) we arrive to the public reveal, yet there\u0027s no mention of any feature being complete even by the original Uber Entertainment, so either they did believe they could finish before the release, or they were already in the cycle of misleading that they had a full game when in reality they, at this point, had a bad frankenstein of KSP1. This is also known to be the point where the revolving door starts at, even after the transition from ST to IG. A revolving door filled with amateurs and juniors, hired under secrecy and now, we know also hired for minimum price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last we also have confirmation that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethey were working with the original codebase ST was using\u003C/strong\u003E, so pretty much another \u0022I told you\u0022 to the clowns stating they magically started a new game from scratch after the merge. To further pile up on this, it seems I also was right on pointing out the \u0022multiplayer build\u0022 we got screenshots from was indeed the original one, and not some magical new build they started after the merge. By minute 28 we get a second confirmation of this... They really didn\u0027t, at \u003Cstrong\u003Eany point\u003C/strong\u003E have a single one of the features developed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also a good warning story that, with multiplayer engineers being fired so early on... the long term product was dead long before these current days.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy key takeaways, in comparison/opposition to SZ:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRead the forums.

Yeah, good point but the problem with that is always interpretation. That changes over time, and then it slowly gets very explicit at some point - whenever it might be. For example some people do interpret the communication between the community and game development as very negative because it lefts room for apologies as you bound emotions to the community so they will accept that product anyways.
