I\u0027m a bit confused about fuel flow though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no visible option to set tank priority that I could see, so I didn\u0027t try using decoupler crossfeed. I had to place each pair of outer tanks separately so I could stage them separately, as there wasn\u0027t an option to place a set of six decouplers into different stages that I could find, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach stage does have fuel lines. The fuel line part is on the bottom of the list of fuel tank parts, and they are attached in what I think is the correct direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how can this be improved?

If you flow the fuel lines through each tank then the \u201Ctop\u201D tank should run out first and the \u201Cbottom\u201D tank last. \u00A0So put a fuel line leading away from the 1st tank you want to drop to the 2nd tank. \u00A0Then a fuel line from 2nd to 3rd and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

I ended up adding three more sets of lines to match up the bottom, middle and top tanks on the 1.25m stacks, and finally connected the third stage\u0027s three lines to the bottom of the 2.5m stack. This produced a fuel drain similar to the KSP 1 Kerbal-X but still not identical, as the 2.5m stack ends up being half-full by the time you stage away the 1.25m stacks. Maybe I need to run the third stage\u0027s tank lines to each of the 2.5m stack\u0027s tanks or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI updated the craft file in my GitHub repository.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lekiffer","CreatedById":190778,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T01:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried some asparagus staging but the fuel lines just didn\u0027t move the fuel I think that\u0027s not working currently\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fullmetal Analyst","CreatedById":212373,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T02:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe fuel lines in ksp2 are BROKEN\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ni tested several setups, and my main tank always ended up half-empty\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nadding more fuel lines didnt fix the issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
