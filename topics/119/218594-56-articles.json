I think it\u0027s pretty obvious that the initial date of 2020 put forth by Star Theory was \u003Cem\u003Ewildly\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eimplausible given the advertised\u00A0\u00A0scope of the game. While none of us knows, nor for legal reasons are we ever likely to know, I think it\u0027s not difficult to put 2 and 2 together that this wild overpromise was directly related to the change in studios and the fact that most of the folks involved in its development moved with the game. That in itself put IG in a pretty difficult position having to own up to Star Theory\u0027s bonkers timeline expectations. By the time they were ramping up and re-solidifying the team they \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E in the midst of COVID. I also work in design and almost everything I do is in CAD or photoshop or illustrator, and the inability to have in-person design sessions, sketch out ideas together, and quickly stop by a colleague\u0027s desk to help work out a problem absolutely slowed our process down and affected delivery dates, and we were a fully-staffed, well oiled team who all knew each other. I think they also probably didn\u0027t realize until they dug in just how difficult this was going to be so they gave the best estimate they could... another 2 years. 2 years turned into 3, which again happens with lots of games. Right now I\u0027m absolutely psyched for Frostpunk 2 and so far we\u0027ve seen exactly \u003Cem\u003Enothing.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003ENo gameplay. No assets. Almost no description of its proposed mechanics. They still haven\u0027t even given a specific release date. We barely knew Elden Ring existed up until 6mo before its release. IG was much more open with us much earlier on than many other studios are. Probably from the reaction they\u0027re seeing now they might even be regretting that. Maybe they never should have shown us anything back in 2021 or 2022 and just kept the whole thing entirely secret right up till it was fully complete and polished and ready to release. It would have been next year anyway, but folks wouldn\u0027t feel like someone had deliberately or maliciously deceived them. Folks feel lied to because they saw assets in editor and heard how excited Nate was and just assumed the game was nearly finished when in reality it was going to take a lot more time. I think it was genuinely unwise to force it to be released this spring instead of giving them more time so that the actual product was more usable. I have little doubt that decision was forced on them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd again, no one at Intercept has access to a time machine.

So when the lockdowns arrived everyone had to potentially upgrade their internet, permissions had to be added, risks ascertained, and new development environments brought online for everybody. Then we had to deal with slowdowns on those environments, constant upgrades to those environments and figuring out how to do that efficiently with everyone, bandwidth issues because everyone goes through the VPN, testing new environments and tools, etc... This persisted for well over a year, and while our velocity even improved slightly at the end of it that took a lot of effort on the part of everyone involved, and was a huge headache when I pulled four fifteen-hour days to meet a deadline (Never again!

Since KSP is my all-time favorite game, I wanted to know if this was due to one or more isolated events or a more structural concern, which would give some insight into future development/viability of KSP2. Discussing the lack of progress has been difficult on the forums due to persistent mocking, gaslighting, white knighting and other forms of toxic positivity. One of the excuses that keeps coming up is that KSP2 has only been in development for a couple of years, because [insert random unsubstantiated reason here]. So until the forum community accepts that KSP2 has been in development for as long as it has, I\u0027m afraid the rehashing is here to stay (or until all critics give up and leave I guess \u003Cspan\u003E\u00AF\\_(\u30C4)_/\u00AF\u003C/span\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224311356\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691848738\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The original studio collapsed and was rebuilt half-way through development.
