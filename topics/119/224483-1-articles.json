Remember the amazing teasers they showed us? Remember the anticipation of a true successor to KSP 1, that would make all other space flight sim games be reduced to obscurity? I remember it so clearly. I love KSP 1 dearly, I remember fond days of playing the game on my 2012 MacBook, having to turn down all the graphic settings in order to play it at a reasonable 50 fps. It truly was one of my favorite games, and still is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u2019t wait for the sequel of this seemingly awesome game to release. But then, I saw a shift, around a couple weeks before its February 24th release. The devs had released some gameplay footage of KSP 2, and it looked different than what was expected. We all knew that this game was going to release as an \u2018early access\u2019 sim, but I had noticed that the frame rate in this video was really low. As time went on, they released the system requirements, which shocked a lot of people. At that time, I had a mid range pc (Rtx 3060 and Ryzen 5) so I felt like I would at least pass the minimum requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, release happened, and that was the day when a huge chunk of my hope was lost. Everyone on the forums were furious of what had released on that day. It was hideous. After that day, they promised that they would make the game better. For months, I regularly checked the forums for updates, but the final breaking point was at some point in June when I realized that this game just wasn\u2019t worth it. All that had came out at the time were a few bug patches. No hint of science releasing anytime soon. So I decided to do something different. Instead of checking the forums like a drug addict, I opened up Steam, clicked over to KSP 1, and hit play. That day, I had the most fun I had in months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen science released in December, I played KSP for the first time since release and liked it, but later put it away. I remember checking the forums and saw that Nate Simpson said that there would be \u2018increased communication\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow 4 months later, what do we have? A still buggy and extremely unfinished game, with no news whatsoever about colonies except for TWO VIDEOS. So this is what I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all to do, go play some KSP 1, I know a lot of you are doing that. Goodbye all, I truly have lost faith in KSP 2. Maybe one day, if the game releases, I\u2019ll check it out. For now, I\u2019ll be playing KSP 1 and Star Citizen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the wall of text, just wanted to show what a longtime follower of KSP 2\u2019s development thinks.

For months, I regularly checked the forums for updates, but the final breaking point was at some point in June when I realized that this game just wasn\u2019t worth it. All that had came out at the time were a few bug patches. No hint of science releasing anytime soon. So I decided to do something different. Instead of checking the forums like a drug addict, I opened up Steam, clicked over to KSP 1, and hit play. That day, I had the most fun I had in months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen science released in December, I played KSP for the first time since release and liked it, but later put it away. I remember checking the forums and saw that Nate Simpson said that there would be \u2018increased communication\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow 4 months later, what do we have? A still buggy and extremely unfinished game, with no news whatsoever about colonies except for TWO VIDEOS. So this is what I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all to do, go play some KSP 1, I know a lot of you are doing that. Goodbye all, I truly have lost faith in KSP 2. Maybe one day, if the game releases, I\u2019ll check it out. For now, I\u2019ll be playing KSP 1 and Star Citizen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the wall of text, just wanted to show what a longtime follower of KSP 2\u2019s development thinks. Thank you to the mod devs, moderators, community managers, and devs for keeping KSP 1 alive.
