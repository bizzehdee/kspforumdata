On one hand, the game doesn\u0027t crash every time I launch a rocket, and most of the rocket generally goes where I want it to, for a while at least. On the other hand, many of the basic mechanics like orbits, docking, etc don\u0027t work and are intended to work, especially for the current gameplay mechanics. I ultimately leaned no, as the buggy behavior bricks most of my missions, preventing me from playing the content. If those bugs were not present, I\u0027d easily say yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn fun, I also said no - Again, due to the bugs, there\u0027s nothing fun about having a mission be bricked.

No one thinks Starfield is perfect, but even with the headwinds BGS is facing from FA76 the general impression Im getting from Starfield is its remarkably stable and solidly playable despite some pacing and structural deficiencies. I know the folks from Intercept have played the happy warrior through this but whoever made the decision to force the 3.2023 launch rather than delaying a year and giving players a solid gameplay experience plus science and heat is a goddamned fool. I deeply hope that all of the people who poured their souls into all of the genuinely brilliant ideas in KSP2 are being given an extra long runway to correct for the obvious disservice management handed to them. There are a number of core bugs that are still substantially preventing even the kind of multi-mission, long-span gameplay KSP1 offers that in no way required the broader community to notice and address. We\u0027ve always loved this game and have always been happy to address edge cases and balance issues and structural questions about the games future. Thats what we\u0027re here for and thats what we\u0027ve always done. Its been cruel to to make even hardcore, devoted players and content creators slog through this though and Take Two for its own shortsightedness really does need to devote real resources to fixing the game and making sure that by the time Science and colonies are introduced the core devs have been given time to make the game truly stable.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy heart goes out to Nate, Shana, Tom, Chris, former Squad members and countless artists and programmers and incredibly passionate people who have put everything they have into this game.
