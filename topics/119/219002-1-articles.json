I was among the crowd expecting a rough launch, but rapid improvement. I was expecting Science and some basic level of stability before 2023 was out - Not perfect feature parity or even specifically science being fully completed, but most of it there and mostly working as intended. I was prepared for regular save eating bugs, quirks, parts that got cut from X update last minute because they more or less just didn\u0027t work, etc. Reaching science parity with the old game should have been \u0027easier\u0027. Not easy explicitly, but it was already a reasonably well mapped design space, both technologically and conceptually. Between KSP1 and the slew of mods, there\u0027s a good amount of info about what does and doesn\u0027t work, what kind of problems are fun to solve, and other such things that are more than enough to build a playable science iteration. The successor roadmap items are a much bigger question mark, and I expected the update cycle to slow for a while afterwards into 2024 just due to the complexity of crafting such systems from more or less scratch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize, I expected a chaotic, fast EA experience up to science feature parity with KSP1, and then a pullback and some stabilizing and quiet while the game moved onto the feature net new roadmap items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I wasn\u0027t expecting was to have the game half a year after release still struggling with fundamental bugs, still lacking heat (Its not explicitly a big deal, but the fact it was stated as \u0027shortly after\u0027 release just highlights how things went wrong) and still being very unreliable mechanically. I don\u0027t have much interest in investing time into a long mission when the games just gonna treat my ships construction as a suggestion, and my orbit as something that it can fidget with and change at a whim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow all this isn\u0027t to say that the game can\u0027t come back, or that my giving up has me never touching it again if it improves in the future. Games have been resurrected before. The problem is that as the people who give up and step outta the EA community grows, the quality of your feedback declines. More of your remaining player base becomes the diehard fans that will eat glass to push through on completing a mission. That willingness to push through the bad times can mask a lot of problems - The existing players get calloused to pain points, you don\u0027t hear about them much as a developer, and then you don\u0027t give them much attention as it doesn\u0027t seem to be as big of an issue. Long term, this turns into a development cycle that masks problems rather than facing them, because the wider audience just left and stopped complaining about those problems.

Remnant 2\u0027s been waiting for me to stop being salty about the labyrinth boss and pick it back up. And even in the Indie space, Terra Invicta\u0027s been running a decent if slow patch cycle, but the game more or less launched finished anyway. But I didn\u0027t give KSP2 Seventy of my Canadian Rubles so I could go buy some other games to play instead. They\u0027re getting measured against their peers large and small, who faced the same tribulations of game development, publishers and the weirdness of the last five years, and provided much better game outcomes at the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224315801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221692978507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178232\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jacksawild\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/25/2023 at 9:48 AM, jacksawild said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe morale of the community is pretty low right now and it doesn\u0027t look set to change any time soon.

If the team suddenly pulls a \u0022We fixed all the various mission killing bugs\u0022 patch outta their rears, or if they suddenly slam down a really well built, interesting and reasonably stable Science update, the energy of the community would probably turn around fast. Folks love underdog comeback stories, lots of abandoners would hear about it and swing back by, and it could arrest the spiral that\u0027s going on right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
