So Im wondering if with both KSP1 and KSP2 if we will see any benefits from the AMD X3D series CPUs. I know little to nothing about software, API, game engines and how they work. So I suppose its asking for Unity to take advantage of the v-cache on the X3D chips? I know its probably too early to say for KSP2 given its current status, but for those who know Unity better can we expect any performance advantage from these chips? Pardon my ignorance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
