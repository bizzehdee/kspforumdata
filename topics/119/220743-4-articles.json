In no particular order:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Life support in some form. I don\u0027t mind how specifically, as long as it\u0027s not trivial and end up as a small increase in craft weight or failing life support has no real consequence. For example have kerbals need snacks, air and comfort. Air filtration takes power, snacks have a weight and comfort is an issue for longer stays in space. Kerbals don\u0027t need to die if anything runs out but at least fall dormant and need rescue. This would give more reasons to build bigger stations and long distance craft can\u0027t just be a mk1 lander can and power systems can\u0027t just work whenever and however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. More interesting electrical systems. Not asking for anything too complicated but batteries should be heavy and power requirements should be a real thing. I\u0027d like there to be limits to how many EC/second different systems can output and for bigger systems you\u0027d need generators which need cooling and so on. The current system (pun totally intended) is just so easy and trivial that it may as well not even exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Kerbal roles. Again there needs to be some consequences. Engineer just does not pilot a ship. Pilot just does not run complicated experiments. Scientist just does not know how to EVA construct. Make me have a reason to bring that experienced kerbal to a mission. Make me care about them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Interactive science. Ok no minigames obviously but make me either fail or succeed based on how I conduct the experiment. The ground impact experiment is a good example. Or have something like JWST where it needs to point away from the sun so it doesn\u0027t heat up and have a target to point at. Make me think which orbit to put it on and figure out where it needs to be to work. How to cool it and how to power it. And so on. Make failure a possibility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Probe cores and IT systems that have a meaning. You can fly a sounding rocket with a stayputnik core but it sure can\u0027t run a science probe or process a huge comms relay station. Some systems need better processing power, some systems need a friggin\u0027 quantum computer that needs to be powered and kept cold while running a complicated experiment which produces a lot of heat and needs a good scientist on board who needs life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Rocket cost. Not wanting contracts to come back but there needs to be a reason to optimize launch vehicles and some cost to it. I\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0should have a reason to use a 5 ton launcher for 5 ton payload instead of just slapping it on the biggest rocket I have available.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. F\u003Cspan\u003Euel systems. There\u0027s already different types of fuels in place but it\u0027s again almost trivial and can be expanded. Make it a part of progression and the above mentioned cost system. Make me have a reason to plan if I should use solid fuels or kerosene or methane or hydrogen or some exotic fuel.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E8.

I don\u0027t usually go for achievements but sometimes they can spark fun gameplay if they\u0027re thought out well and you can even give small in-game rewards for them, say for example a legendary pilot joins up if you survive a crash at 100 m/s.

I really do feel like it\u2019s needed to separate the gameplay and user stories of manned missions and probes.

Much further down the line, the gameplay benefit of visualizing delivery routes to colonies may seem small for the effort it will take, but I for one would love actual craft flying the delivery routes.

The ability to make and tune maneuvers with numbers is so much better than than dealing with the fiddly handle things that are never precise, and hard to grab if you switch to a different angle, or focus view, and are super easy to screw up, but incredibly annoying to fix if you do mess something up or accidentally change something and want to go back to exactly how it was before. I could go on about all the ways that it\u0027s better, but really, I just want them to get permissions from the mod creator (if they need to do that, idk), and copy it pretty much identically (and just change the aesthetics to match ksp2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Some kind of in game Transfer Window Planner (preferably like the ksp1 mod with that name), ideally with the option to use pork chop plots if you want/know how. Planning multiple interplanetary expeditions at once by guesstimating (and then fiddling with the damn maneuver planner), is maddening. I\u0027m sure there would be mods and web tools to do it, like in KSP1, but as important/useful as it is for post mun/minimus level stuff, it would be much, much better to have it built into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

I would not want to deal with the hassle of trying that right now).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Condensed part management, especially fuel tanks and similar structural elements. There only needs to be one item in the part picker for each fuel type/size combo/structural fuselage size, and then a submenu when you click on the one you want that lets you select length. Not everything needs to be like that, but anything where there are multiple nearly identical parts with only one changing variable should really be done that way. I really liked good part mods in KSP1, and am a fan of lots of part options in general, but it gets exhausting searching for each one when you are making something large and/or complicated, and anything that can streamline and speed up the process of finding the part you want is good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Option to sort parts by actual size, rather than arbitrary \u0022size name\u0022.\u00A0 Small, medium and large are all well and good, but once you get past about 5, it\u0027s gonna start to get silly, and probably annoying (is Gigantic bigger than massive, or the other way around? You get the idea). I\u0027m fine with s/m/l being the default, but having the option to switch to actual numbers .625/1.25/2.5/3.75/5/etc would be extremely desirable. A \u0022radial\u0022 category would not be amiss either. YMMV, for sure, but I think the further in progression you go, the more desirable that will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. No idea how many people this appeals to (at least a few I would think), but flavor parts for interplanetary/interstellar travel, even if they don\u0027t have an in game mechanic attached for them. Food production/hydroponics/green house/something, gym, lounge/rec space, etc. A personal flavor thing I always did for long missions or deep space stations, was require the inclusions of sufficient space, and something for long term food.

Another vote for robotics, at least at some point. I never really went into breaking ground, but I messed around with Infernal Robotics enough (which, iirc, had quite a few more parts than BG did). It had some jank, sure, and I didn\u0027t do anything super high level, but I liked rigging up stuff like big unfolding sensor arrays, or even little things like rotating antennas on bases, so something like BG, scaled up to infernal robotics level, would be amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Not sure the best way to phrase it but: the ability to make actual structural loops. Essentially, in KSP1, parts wouldn\u0027t connect all the way around in a looping structure, so if you ran structural parts in a circle, or whatever configuration, the last piece that ties it together would only ever connect to one side, so you had always had to work around it/clip stuff/etc, to keep it from floppy spacepart syndrome, or spontaneous unplanned disassembly, and sometimes the stuff you did to make it work would result in that anyway. A lot of cool design possibilities open up/get much more feasible if there was a way to actually make that last connection\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.\u00A0 Support for the ability to mod in additional star systems.

Non stellar, extrasolar objects. Being able to visit them would be phenomenal, but even just being able to observe them (though I guess this would require some sort of observatory mechanic, which seems unreasonable to ask for, tbh). Black holes, quasars, nebulae, rogue planets, etc, etc. And hey, while we are accelerating rapidly away from reality, how about the capacity to make low level megastructures, lol.
