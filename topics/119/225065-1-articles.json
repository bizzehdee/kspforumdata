Yes, I know there are mods for most of it for KSP1, but having that in stock was great. It needed a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of shader optimization, but I have no doubt that would come eventually.\u00A0That, and the loading times were the biggest wins for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were also a few things that were good ideas poorly implemented, but maybe would get there with some fixes? I would put the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E in that category, as well as the way the data was structured to handle craft and part collections in a very data-driven way. Anyone who dug around the save files will tell you. There were UI problems and the way data was translated to game state and back was a disaster (broken symmetry modes, things not attaching or not detaching randomly...), so it felt worse, but I can tell why Intercept went in that direction and where they were going with it. If it were fixed, it\u0027d be amazing both for the stock game and for modding. In a similar vein, the teleporting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was an indicator that the colony tech was in progress, and while it\u0027s completely useless without a colony builder, it\u0027s sort of technically there, so from a narrow \u0022technically a feature\u0022 perspective it\u0027s in the game. Custom space centers have been hacked into KSP1, but KSP2 was treating these as a place-anywhere sort of object from the start, which would make building new space centers or colonies on other worlds or even in orbit a lot more straight forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there weren\u0027t so many problems with game state, physics, and CPU performance - basically if what was there was fully playable, I think modders could have run with the skeleton of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E tech as a foundation for colony builder, and get that playable. Likewise, shaders could have been written to fix a lot of problems with GPU performance, cloud quality, and visuals that people didn\u0027t like. Same goes for UI that some people didn\u0027t like. It might be hard to believe how close we were to a foundation that, with mods, could have significantly outperformed modded KSP1. That was the correct direction for the KSP2 and I think Intercept were on the path to it, and it\u0027s a shame we didn\u0027t get to the payoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-10T22:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the procedure wings without full procedural load out like Juno.
