You will initially need to set up harvesting of exotic fuel and supply routes to bring it to an orbital shipyard in small amounts. Those supply ships will be using your plentiful fuel. As you scale up your resource harvesting, you can start thinking about using exotic fuel for more common applications in the Kerbin system, like replacing your supply ships with larger ones running the exotic fuel themselves. Now you\u0027re reliant on the exotic fuel just to keep your supply lines going, which means you need to harvest even more of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key point is that it takes time and effort in the form of infrastructure building to get to this point of plentiful exotic fuel, not something you will have available in the early and mid game. The scarcity is the knob you can tweak to tune how early it will be feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, size and materials cost of the engines may not prevent the player from using exotic fuel for trivial applications in the endgame, but if tuned properly it will make more sense to use engines running common fuels for smaller vehicles like launchers and landers.

It turns out, the most effectively way is to store it as a frozen snowball suspend by diamagnetic forces. However, creating this condition in Earth orbit is quit difficult, meaing it requires a heavy storage tank to achieve it . To lower the mass requirment, the best locaton would be to try to do the same thing far away from the sun, like at pluto distance.

Even the far end of the tech tree (as I recall) only includes technologies that have been pretty thoroughly ground tested but not actually flown (NERVA), remain a little bit speculative but one of\u00A0 their key enabling systems has been built, tested, and shown to work (SABRE, which I presume RAPIER is a riff on), or are grounded in known chemistry and engineering and bits of them have been demonstrated (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of science, very little fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP was also nicely scaled. Yes it\u0027s built around a 1/10 scale toy star system but I can mostly ignore that when I\u0027m playing because the journey times are still approximately scaled to travel times around our own solar system. Journeys to the Mun and Minmus take days to weeks, journeys to the nearest planets take months, journeys to the more distant planets take months to years. Allowing interstellar travel - and probably repeated interstellar journeys - within the timeframe of the game, breaks that immersion and rubs my nose in the fact that I\u0027m playing in a scaled down toy sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also wonder about progression time within the game. KSP already suffers from that:\u00A0 a brand new space program can make orbit on day 1, get to the Mun on the same day with a bit of player experience, and be heading out to the planets on the first available transfer window, or earlier if the player isn\u0027t fussed about using minimum energy trajectories. Even allowing for the fact that interstellar travel will require a bunch of infrastructure and resource mining first, I can imagine a brand new KSP2 start going interstellar within a handful of game years, which again, rather breaks the immersion for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I remain skeptical (to put it politely) about the feasibility of rocket-powered, crewed, interstellar travel anyway, and like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223189\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RocketRockington\u003C/a\u003E, I suspect that most of the challenges involved in building an interstellar craft will be abstracted away or ignored, given that a basic stock life support still seems to be a contentious issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, interstellar travel breaks a lot of what I found appealing about KSP and turns KSP2 into just another science-fiction game. That doesn\u0027t mean that roadmap complete KSP2 is going to be a bad game, but I don\u0027t believe it will have the charm of the original.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-03T07:33:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2023 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
