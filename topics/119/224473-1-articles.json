However, I have noticed that I (and many others) are not \u0022committed\u0022 to the game like I was with KSP1. I\u0027ll play around for a few hours during each update release, but even after \u0022For Science!\u0022 I found that I did not want to seriously progress with an Exploration save given the incomplete nature of the game. I did a few missions and haven\u0027t touched the game since early January. This contrasts my KSP1 experience as I loved to spend countless hours in a single career save building an agency with multiple programs, long term goals, etc. I had saves that lasted years and never got bored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been seriously thinking and realize that I do not consider KSP2 a worthwhile time investment until a certain variable or two change. I think this is the same for most people, too. A few of the \u0022variables\u0022 that I commonly see are from people waiting for bug fixes, performance improvements, major milestones, mods, or even full 1.0 release.\u00A0I am curious to hear what people dream of one day doing in KSP2 that will get them \u0022committed\u0022 to the game like they were with KSP1. Keep in mind \u003Cu\u003EI am not asking for complaints about features or early access\u003C/u\u003E, but instead \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI want to hear what you can\u0027t wait to (hopefully) do in this game in the future and why.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, I really share Nate Simpson\u0027s dream of going to a planet, establishing a small colony, and sending a rover to collect/return resources for the very first time. I want more of a substantial reason to visit celestial bodies other than collecting science points and the nice view. I want to have a true reason to build space stations and explore uncharted territory. So, I don\u0027t really see any reason to take the deep dive into KSP2 until 0.5\u0027s resource update drops. I can live with the bugs, performance, and other missing features - I don\u0027t even care about other things such as multiplayer or interstellar travel. But I really really want resource collection for creating new colonies. I\u0027m also seriously holding out for IVA and other Kerbal-centric features. Something about not getting a 1st person view of a Kerbal\u0027s perspective while on missions has really broken the immersion and any investment I had in my Kerbals. I just don\u0027t care for them in KSP2 right now like I did in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I\u0027d love to hear what other gameplay/story dreams people are waiting on before investing more heavily into KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-15T22:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am waiting for a time when the game is more or less feature complete from a single player perspective and is of an equal or higher level of polish than KSP1.
