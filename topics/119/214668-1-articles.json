The question I wish to ask here is: aside from right clicking the engine part and looking at it\u0027s thrust value decreasing how can I determine if my engines are receiving their required intake air? The staging GUI seems to display the same value for air regardless so this does not seem useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T18:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be pretty obvious if they aren\u0027t, they flame out.

Turbofans don\u0027t like to fly very fast and the ramjet effect doesn\u0027t do much for them, the afterburning ones do.

Your engines will \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically\u003C/em\u003E flame out at ~22,000m because the intakes will produce 0 air.

I know the engines will flame out, but this also means they\u0027ve reached some sort of below minimum point but what I seek to know through the GUI is how close I am to that point. At some point the engine is only 50% effective because of lack of air, but how does one know that from the UI?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegex, thank you for the F12 hotkey hint. I loaded things up and took a look, it displays information about the air density but no per-part information like an intake\u0027s satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall followup on the F12 stuff, air density is certainly useful but air speed would also affect intake air and the different intakes have different levels of effectiveness at different speeds... so there are lots of complicated factors and I\u0027m just trying to figure out if my engines are underfed through a gauge on screen of some sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
