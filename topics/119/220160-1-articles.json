Obvious disclaimer, I am just a guy, I could be wrong about some, none, or all of this. This is also a wip build we are seeing, stuff may and likely will easily change.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrough the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, we see 9 science parts, I am pretty sure that these are all the science parts as of semi current build. The reason why I believe this is we see 7 nodes on the tech tree with the science icon, which presumably unlock a science part. One of the nodes has a rover icon, but appears to be named autonomous imaging, which would fit for the camera rover part we see in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. This gives us 8 nodes that seem to unlock a science part, and when we add the one science part we start off with, we get 9! This means that in theory, we can use the name of the science nodes and try to line them up with the image of science parts we see in order to guess at what they will do. I am now going to try to go through each one numerically and try and link it up with a science node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so the 8 nodes we see that probably unlock a science part are (going in order off of the tech tree here): Environmental science, Research miniaturization, Atmospheric science, Autonomous imaging, Radiation science, Orbital science, Aquatic science, and finally Orbital report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience Jr probably doesnt line up with a node, because its probably the part we start unlocked. This part seems to work anywhere, the behavior of this part is probably the same as mystery goo from ksp1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnvironmental science and Research miniaturization probably unlock the two golden XS squares we see,\u00A0 I doubt there\u0027s much too special with these parts as theyre unlocked pretty early on in the tech tree. If I were to guess these parts gimmicks, one of them probably introduces return limits (ie needs to be returned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E), and one of them probably is the first part to have science over time. This guess is purely off the fact I feel like part complexity will be introduced gradually so it makes sense for the first few parts to be pretty simple.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtmospheric science is probably the fly by wire looking thing. This is because its a XS part (thus making sense to unlock early on in the tech tree), and its a nose cone, hard to get more atmosphericy then that. If I were to guess this parts gimmick, it probably generates science over time and needs to be in atmosphere (duh), so if you need a plane to analyze it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutonomous imaging is probably the camera on a stick. This is probably just the scanning arm from breaking ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiation science is almost certainly the cylindrical thing titled radiation survey we see selection. idk if there will be anything too special for this, hopefully it needs EC or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital science is probably the other small sized part with all the stuff sticking out with it. Probably will only work while in orbit and over time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAquatic science is probably the spherical one. It looks like a diving bell, so it will probably only work while in liquid. We know from code some parts will have a crew requirement and this part seems to have a door. You will probably need this one to be manned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital report is probably the one with the purple thing attached to it, I dont feel like this one will be too special. Has a door so probably has a crew requirement, also probably will only work in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-22T20:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat XS sized nosecone \u0022Science Thing\u2122\u0022 looks a lot like its for a sounding rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts probably for a plane though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-22T20:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2023 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 22\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Royalswissarmyknife\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-22T21:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I right in understanding we have eight different types of science to collect now, in order to unlock the parts in the corresponding tech tree?

KSP is not a game about running science experiments, KSP is a game about building rockets and going places with them. Science was always a system aiming to add reason to go to specific and different places, via mechanical rewards that gave you new parts to build new rockets. Which is why colonies was the natural progression of things, as it provided more things to build, more places to build rockets, and more places to fly those rockets to and from as a result. Science was just a decent gameplay loop to drive that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advancement of that system would have best been served by increasing the involvement in rocket design required to accommodate science. Which is a difficult ask with the foundations being on \u0027complete\u0027 piece lego building and all in one style designs. The only design and engineering challenge for most parts is \u0022Do you have the Delta-V to move them into orbit\u0022, as there\u0027s no situation where you have to consider at all how its actually built onto the ship. You can slap a materials bay experiment under a nuclear reactor, have two NERVA\u0027s blasting out on either side of it, and get a perfect environmental sample result regardless of the surrounding ship. Design simply doesn\u0027t matter. But on the flip side, adding those constraints would lead to \u0027optimal\u0027 builds and discourage or prevent a lot of experimentation, which goes against the teams wider design goals. Long term experiments are fun on paper, but in practice most players just slap time accel and wait for it to finish, then carry on with the mission anyway, so the mechanic becomes a minor inconvenience at best. Transmission time at least is an engineering challenge, a check if you\u0027ve got sufficient power generation and storage for the data volume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I understand how they failed to find a solution that worked, and fell back onto what they already had. What I don\u0027t understand is why it took them so long to figure that out, when the KSP1 modding scene had mostly figured that out by 2017 or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T15:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698066342\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid they remove celestial bodies from the Kerbolar system?\u00A0 Because it should be absolutely required to telescope them before you go there. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nId support telescopes for in solar system operation too yeah.
