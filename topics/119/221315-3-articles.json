I had fun launching a few missions in Exploration mode and getting the first part of a two-launch Mun landing mission underway. The layout of the science tree is interesting and I\u0027m curious to see how it\u0027ll play out compared to the original.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are still some things that bug me. To name a few:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClick\u002Bdrag to move up and down the rocket in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is still worse than scrolling. I need the convenience of the scroll wheel for traveling up and down the length of the rocket to check on different parts, not for changing the scale of zoom (which I\u0027ll do less frequently).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe parts manager is too tall and big for what I want to use it for. The old \u0022click on a part\u0022 method from KSP1 was more intuitive as to which parts you\u0027re managing at a time, and more convenient to move windows around.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverall, I think the interface is not very efficient at conveying information - there\u0027s often a lot of style to elements but I find myself having to study the UI to learn where things are, which is problematic when there is a lot of information I need to keep track of moment-to-moment in flight. Maybe I\u0027ll learn how to read\u00A0it better over time. I\u0027m a big fan of Kerbal Engineer where I can choose a subset of information screens depending on what I\u0027m doing and arrange them in my own preferred configuration.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few buggy things, like the camera switching directions occasionally, the skybox flipping over when I surpass 20 km altitude, or my spacecraft mysteriously speeding up slightly in the upper atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a few things that I find weird or convoluted. For instance, the first Mun mission \u0027contract\u0027 requires that the spacecraft orbit higher than 60 km. I like to send my spacecraft to 20 km, so I did that instead. I performed two Mun orbit rendezvous sandwiching a full landing mission, flag and boots and all, and when that was done I raised the periapsis to 60 km to fulfill the silly requirement. Of course, the next milestones were to land and plant a flag in the same geome I\u0027d just been to, but weren\u0027t considered complete. Performing a \u0022first exploration\u0022 of the Mun should be more open to interpretation, it could be a flyby, landing, or totally intentional ballistic impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-21T00:14:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2023 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 21\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rmaine","CreatedById":143945,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-21T00:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2 now seems at least playable for me. The exploration mode gives some sort of goals. The fans on my GPU still make more noise than I\u0027m completely comfortable with, but at least they aren\u0027t going full blast all the time; that had kept me from even trying much of anything earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrashed my first few launches before figuring out that drogue chutes seem more necessary on even the first flights than they were in KSP 1. I kept wondering why my chute wasn\u0027t working. Turned out it had been destroyed, but I never noticed any message saying so. Interestingly, unless I\u0027m confused about something (certainly possible), the smallest stock vehicle isn\u0027t flyable because of that. While looking around at the chutes, I also noticed that the drogue chute description looks to be just copied from the main chute one. In particular, it cites the same 247 m/s max opening speed, which is obviously bogus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike some posters above, I find the science collection UI to be mystifying. It is neither self-obvious nor explained anywhere. And I can\u0027t find a summary of what I\u0027ve collected. Am I getting more science from the same experiment because I\u0027m in a different biome of something? Several places it says that experiments are available, but it isn\u0027t obvious to me how to actually do them. EVA experiments for example; maybe I don\u0027t yet have the tech to do those, but the UI seems to be implying that I could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also got the confusing advice referring to Jool in my briefings for the first mun mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-21T01:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224349279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022221315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703092664\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally deploy parachutes at ~600 m/s during descent, and I\u0027ve never had an issue with them not opening.\u00A0 I think what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/73725-superfluous-j/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273725\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/73725-superfluous-j/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Superfluous J\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0had going on there was a bug.\u00A0 I wonder if there is any chance he can reproduce this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParachutes in general are a mystery to me.
