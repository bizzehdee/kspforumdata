So yeah, we have a game built on flimsy foundations that they just outright refuse to talk about (remember the promises of HDRP and the system that\u0027d replace PQS?

I really don\u0027t think there\u0027s another solution for that. I don\u0027t know how for example Orbiter handles it to say if it\u0027s different, and I know other games like Space Engineer just use a static, heavily scaled down system and displace the active scene resetting coordinates (like KSP1/2 does with rovers on the ground).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the joining of parts, the particular problem with Unity, or rather how the devs used Unity in KSP1 and 2, is that they resorted to Unity\u0027s default joint system. That means when you put 2 parts together, they\u0027re not parent and child, but rather 2 nodes united by a joint. The flexibility this joint allows is what permits things like wobble and all other spaghetti effects... and creates phantom forces as well in some cases. Those joints are their own physical entity and can transfer forces along the connected rigid bodies. A secondary problem this causes is with collision detection, because if you allow elasticity on the joint, the 2 connected parts can collide and that\u0027s when a tank in the middle of your rocket explodes for no apparent reason, and thus the solution is to disable same-vessel collision. Every joint is an extra \u0022part\u0022 that has to be serialized for saving, which is why autostrut is so toxic to performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, all of this carries over to the third aspect: What do you do with non active vessels. \u0022Serializing and saving\u0022 isn\u0027t just for when you stop playing, but also quicksaves, swapping active vessels, docking and so on. In KSP1 (and if I remember correctly), the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and heating systems work for unloaded vessels by saving the current \u003Cem\u003Erates of change\u003C/em\u003E in resources (as in, say, fuel is increasing X units per second, ore decreases by Y amount per second) and when you switch back to a vessel, those rates are calculated against the time since you last played with that ship and are credited or debited to all containers equally and almost instantly. They also had some shortcuts over EC rates not being updated so a solar panel always generates max energy for an offloaded vessel even at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn comes KSP2, and they promise trust on warp, real simulations for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E/Colonies and what not, except the way they do it is to serialize and dump even more data onto the save, and without any shortcut or optimization. Every aspect of a part in KSP2 is serialized and saved individually, and then recomputed pretty much live as you play with another ship someplace else. This means every solar panel, radiator, resource container, resource generator, resource debit, engine, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and so on is continuously working and being recalculated even for vessels you aren\u0027t playing with. You might be launching a 20 part rocket, but that 100 part colony still will hit you like if you were launching it all in one piece right next to your new rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the way this side of the system is built, really has nothing to do with engine choice. Engine choice just adds onto this mess by virtue of how the Unity default joints work and how bad Unity is natively at multithreading. Sure, some engines might have better native multithreading not requiring the mess you have to do in Unity to get that working, but still, it\u0027s a very flimsy system that resolves\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E into an O(n) algorithm\u003C/a\u003E where more parts cause a linear decay in performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T17:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell how in the hell would MP address something like the physics aspects... would each machine be crunching the whole system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game cannot split calcs efficiently between cores how would MP even work without unleashing the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more I see people break down certain things the more I am convinced that a lack of technical reports to the community is a direct result of nothing to show.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T18:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715356542\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715355849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225696\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cocoscacao\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, cocoscacao said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... sadly there\u0027s history of that, SQUAD promised multiplayer for KSP1...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could be wrong, but I don\u0027t recall it ever being \u0027promised\u0027.\u00A0 The most I remember were comments stating that they are \u0027thinking\u0027 about it and \u0027would like\u0027 to do it .\u00A0 The only \u0027promises\u0027 seemed to be in the heads of those that didn\u0027t want to understand what was actually said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit.\u00A0 It would seem I didn\u0027t get my quote from the initial post it was in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-10T18:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2024 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 10\u0022\u003EMay 10\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Icegrx","CreatedById":232176,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T19:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388665\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715363166\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227275\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fizzlebop Smith\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Fizzlebop Smith said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell how in the hell would MP address something like the physics aspects... would each machine be crunching the whole system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game cannot split calcs efficiently between cores how would MP even work without unleashing the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more I see people break down certain things the more I am convinced that a lack of technical reports to the community is a direct result of nothing to show.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey absolutely got caught in the act of spewing attention grabbing features without understanding what they were promising.
