I don\u0027t know what you (or anyone else) were expecting, but I knew there would be bugs. I didn\u0027t expect that the bugs would be random and as non-repeatable as these are.

What proof do we have, what evidence do we have, what anything do we have that suggests that the EA \u0022funds\u0022 will indeed be reinvested into the game? All I can see is a company so seemingly starved for income off of KSP2 that they forced a vastly inferior product into release, all the while claiming how great the game was, how the devs had trouble working because they were spending so much time playing the game instead, and bombarding us with pretty videos showing all the new(!) and improved(!) graphics and gameplay. Honestly, I\u0027m concerned that KSP2 was forced into release so that the game would generate some income before it\u0027s kicked to the trash heap.
