How it WORKS - is different story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight UI - AMAZING.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis dark blue with black reminds me of expanse-style millitary grade UI :). Color scheme there is just perfect.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only minor nitpick about it - this pixelated fonts should be monowidth. \u00221\u0022 is not as wide as \u00229\u0022, so numbers jump around in, for example, fuel UI in staging.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, rounding for that fuel UI should be consistent. If one frame it\u0027s \u00222.21\u0022 tons of fuel, and the next is \u00222.2\u0022, is one digit less, so again - numbers jump around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame SAVE/LOAD UI - also AMAZING.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPause menu styilized for code with syntax highlighting - I really like it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E UI, however, is bad, wich is weird, because you guys show an amazing screenshots for it before release. Like, look at this screen from pre alpha, and compare it to what we get in EA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KkHWq3F.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022135.50\u0022 height=\u0022509\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KkHWq3F.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TcdGEBq.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TcdGEBq.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
