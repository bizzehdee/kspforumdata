The whole point of the exploration mode is to have a guided experience that provides challenges and incentives to experiment within specific limitations to develop your skills towards particular goals. If you want to bypass all of that to play anyway that you want to play, exploration mode no matter how it is balanced will never be what you want it to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you just want to build big interplanetary rockets and go wherever you feel like it or construct a massive airplane for the sake of doing it, hop into sandbox mode and have at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a design point of view, you shouldn\u0027t have late tier 3 parts before going to duna because you don\u0027t need these parts to complete a duna mission. If science was rained on you such that you could access all of the overpowered parts before you left kerbin, the entire challenge of interplanetary travel would be trivialized. Overcoming challenges is what makes the game, or any game, satisfying to many players. Many do not respone well to a directionless sandbox. This can be a substantial contributor to why many players, myself included, never left the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP1. From this point of view, I don\u0027t see any cost scaling problem with science. In fact, the cost scaling of the tech tree was precisely the solution needed to encourage more players away from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I\u0027m aware, colonies and interstellar won\u0027t be restricted to exploration mode. If you prefer sandbox mode, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be missing out on much if you stick to it as they continue to release new content. Don\u0027t feel compelled to play only exploration mode because it\u0027s the cool new thing with this patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
