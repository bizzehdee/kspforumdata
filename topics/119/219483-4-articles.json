Yeah the communication slowdown sucks, I think its a reason for a lot of tensions. I don\u0027t think its because the devs are too scared to speak or whatever (honestly the cms talk about as much in the forums pre comm slowdown). If you want the offical CM answer, check below, if you want my analysis I think its pretty explainable by two things. 1. The CMs have been down a member for around two months now, the most drastic slowdown compared to the time of weekly upnates was right after the CM left the team. Having a third of your team leave will seriously mess up your workflows. 2. The CM team is switching to a new format for large scale communications. I think the call to switch to a video format is a good one, the recent reentry video was pretty well received, however the swap to a different workflow will slow you down a lot. I think in retrospect not doing a fullswap from \u0022upnates\u0022 to videos wouldve been good that way natural delays and the like in videos dont get seen as the devs abandoning all communications. Both of these fortunately are temporary things, but both hiring a new CM and being able to better regularize video production will take a while to happen. (btw we got a minor update on the getting a third CM back today see below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u00228.95\u0022 height=\u0022103\u0022 width=\u00221151\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418965221630017537/1152461986521682040/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002215.06\u0022 height=\u0022105\u0022 width=\u0022697\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418965221630017537/1152452837251485716/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMildly off topic but also not, for my take on the interplatform communication, its fine. I think there\u0027s a fundamental disconnect between \u0022What we (involved community members) would like to know\u0022 and \u0022What\u0027s actually productive to broadcast out\u0022 that I generally try to fill. For example, the unity change wasn\u0027t highlighted a lot, it was only posted in the modding discord and the modding subforum on here. I think a lot of people would want to know that the unity is changing as we are a curious bunch, but if you just put something out like that on the unity change, even if you specify its just a change that effects modders, people will either go \u0022Okay and?\u0022 or \u0022This means that hdrp is happening in 1.5!!\u0022,\u00A0 both of which arent good responses from your community.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think where interplatform communication could improve is 1. Communicating the mild scales news gap that dev tracker fills to reddit and twitter feels lacking (disclaimer, I dont use either of these platform for ksp),\u00A0 I think a link to dev tracker or something like that in the reddit header would be neat. 2. I think that casual communication is inherently hard on the forums because threads are very focused and formal (compared to the more branching and casual discord conversations), however I still think some casual communication would be nice.\u00A0 Like, I dont think there\u0027s any thread to where you could go @ dakota hows the hunt for the new cm going? And it wouldnt be off topic for the thread. But I do think there are times where a cm can casually interject in a thread and add a bit more context. For example I think a tiny two-three sentence comment like the first discord image (would probably have to be worded differently to account for cultural differences) would do a lot for this thread. I think just casual clarifications and microscale news here on the forums would do a long way in the perceived communications gap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-16T04:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224322916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219483\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221694831558\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144772\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlexTheNotSoGreat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AlexTheNotSoGreat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntercept should really look at how the Factorio devs are presenting their content plans.
