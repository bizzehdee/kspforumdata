Meanwhile, all of the old subtopics for KSP 1 are located in a tiny little box at the bottom of the page. KSP 2 hasn\u0027t even been properly bugfixed yet, and it\u0027s practically taking over! Let\u0027s not forget that many players don\u0027t have hardware capable enough of running KSP 2, and that it\u0027s modding scene is still very much glued to KSP 1 at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-07T19:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy wouldn\u0027t a company push their current game, regardless of how well it runs, instead of a product over a decade old?
