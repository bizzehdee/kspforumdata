Looks like the Release Candidate branch updated 8 days ago, and the testing branch updated 7 days ago. I can only speculate as to the exact nature of their build pipeline (Some form of Continuous Integration with all the branches maybe) but that looks to me like the Release Candidate \u0027failed\u0027 QA/Testing and test got updated with new fixes. Of note is also the \u0022Voyager\u0022 depot and the various development depots. Not sure if Voyager is Interstellar or Colonies, the former makes sense the latter could be a release \u0027codename\u0027 for it. But feels to me like each development depot is its own major feature standup, leaning into the simultaneous development that\u0027s been mentioned for the milestone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T23:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nzTBQxMvTuk?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022KSP2 Devs play KSP2 - Nate\u002BPoppe go to Duna Pt.2\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve said in the stream that 0.2.1 will be released on Tuesday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
