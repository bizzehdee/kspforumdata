The thing with KSP (1 and 2) is that they do a lot of stuff that most games just don\u0027t do. If you\u0027re making, say, a driving game, a first-person shooter, or an open-world aRPG, you\u0027re dealing with a known quantity. The engines are made to support just that kind of game. There\u0027s still a ton of stuff to do but it\u0027s all known problems with known solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 needs stuff like precise time-warpable orbital mechanics, multiplayer that takes into account that players may be in different timelines, and even very basic assumptions don\u0027t hold. For example, consider the angst about the clouds. It is true that game engines make it pretty easy to design beautiful clouds. The thing is that they\u0027re predicated on the assumption that the clouds live in a skybox somewhere at optical infinity. That\u0027s not the case for KSP when you can fly right through them and away into the cosmos, until you reach another planet with different clouds. Because you can\u0027t \u0022just add clouds\u0022 like the game engine expects, you have to come up with a custom solution. That takes time and is hard to estimate and may go wrong in unexpected ways. Ditto for precise and stable orbital mechanics. Ditto ditto for timewarp. More so for multiplayer that accounts for players being in different timelines. On top of that, you need to make a driving game (wheels, driving physics), a construction game (duh!), and so on and so forth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Delay after delay\u0022 -- Par for course IMO. The first big delay was an effective reboot of the entire project. You can\u0027t just continue production as if nothing happened when you start a new studio, even if you hire some of the old developers. It\u0027s also likely that the material constraints for the development were changed so drastically that the only thing that carried over was (some of) the design work. Then there was the covid delay. And finally the push into 2023 rather than 2022. All that is \u003Ci\u003Ecompletely normal.\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0Not ideal, mind, but normal -- lots of games do a lot worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rarely any updates\u0022 -- KSP2 has gotten more developer updates earlier on than most games, by far. Although TBF this is most likely because it was announced prematurely; under normal conditions they would\u0027ve gone radio silent until they were ready to announce a release date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An EA that is purely for funding\u0022 -- extremely unlikely. KSP is a \u0022long tail\u0022 franchise. If TT wants ROI, they need to keep the franchise a going concern for years. If they felt that it was more profitable to add another delay than to go with EA now, that\u0027s what they would have done. A company like TT does EA for two reasons: to get a reading on how much interest there is in a franchise (\u0022for X amount of kerbucks in a marketing campaign, how many EA sales do we get?\u0022) and secondly to turn the EA process itself into a marketing effort by getting it into a positive feeback loop, building a community, and eventually creating positive word-of-mouth, especially among influencers. A rocky start to the EA means nothing, it\u0027s a year-long campaign at least.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the plug is pulled\u0022 -- TT treats KSP as a franchise, not even as an individual game. KSP2 is the keystone of that franchise. If they start to seriously worry that the game is going to tank/not get finished/the studio needs help getting it done, then they will put the studio on a tighter leash, appoint a bunch of tough producers known for Getting Stuff Done, and maybe do some ruthless featurectomies. They will only pull the plug if they determine that there isn\u0027t enough interest in the franchise. The current state of the EA barely even factors into that decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom TT\u0027s point of view, the more social media uproar there is over KSP2 at this point, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0-- it signals interest in the franchise. At this stage in the game, there really isn\u0027t any bad publicity: it doesn\u0027t matter what they say as long as they get the name of the game right. Besides which, redemption arcs are super compelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey will only pull the plug on KSP2 if people lose interest. As long as people signal interest, they will keep it going.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Oh, and, the state of the game? I would put it at about six months from production-ready with the current feature set. About a year or two from the full feature set, depending on what the state of readiness of those systems is -- I\u0027ve no doubt they\u0027ve been working on them, they\u0027re just disabled in the EA build.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T13:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Periple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T13:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225622-periple/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225622\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/225622-periple/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Periple\u003C/a\u003Ethis is all been quite a ride and I just ran out of energy to keep\u00A0 trying to explain things from a dev perspective.
