However, the slidebar is very much \u0022analog\u0022, e.g. number showing 0.15 may range from 0.145~0.155. It is impossible to make a wing perfectly straight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be very annoying in some cases, especially when straight wing or precise wing parameters are desired\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if I\u0027m missing some options... Or this is actually not implemented yet, if so, why not make those numbers alongside the slidebar editable so that precise values can be input via keyboard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
