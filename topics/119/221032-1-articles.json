One is that data always transmits at 100% and there\u0027s a clear distinction between samples that need to be returned and transmittable data. That means players aren\u0027t encouraged to go back to the same biome and repeat the same experiment to scrape the barrel. There\u0027s also of course the \u0022collect all science button\u0022 which is really nice for obvious reasons. The third thing we\u0027ve heard mentioned but not\u00A0 seen exactly is that they\u0027re reducing the number of big, visually indistinct biomes and adding in much smaller discoverable zones. This reduces the amount of repetitive biome hopping over and over to places that look and function exactly the same.
