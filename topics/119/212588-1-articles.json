So many features missing that were present in KSP1 and it runs worse than\u00A0v0.22 KSP1 when I started playing in ~2013 on my Sandy Bridge i7 Processor and AMD 6970. The game only runs 20\u002B fps at time-warp zero and 5-10 fps with anything over 50 parts (and I\u0027m playing on all low settings in 1080p with the system above). Why cant I right click on part?! Why is there no quick part prefab saver and spawner? Why do parts break when moving the parent object?! Why does the workflow in the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E feel so unintuitive? Having to edit everything in the parts manager is so cumbersome versus a simple right click and adjust. AND WHY IS THERE NOT AUTO STRUT?! Rockets shouldn\u0027t fly like wet noodles. Its worse than KSP1 was before the weld strut mod from 2014.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have over 4000 hours in KSP1. I have been looking forward to this launch since the announcement teaser. The game should have never been released in this state, early access or otherwise (and asking $50?!). I have been playing for 4 hours and thankfully steam is bugged and not tracking my play time correctly. I think I\u0027m going to refund it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T04:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by vmatt1203\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
