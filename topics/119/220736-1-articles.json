Kinda nostalgic feeling, because I did this a lot back in very old versions of KSP1 but I can certainly say I\u0027m glad we don\u0027t (usually) have to tab out of the game to work this stuff out anymore, and I\u0027m definitely glad I haven\u0027t had to manually work out a vessel\u0027s dry mass in a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I realised there\u0027s probably people around new enough to KSP that they\u0027re not familiar with this so I just figured I\u0027d make this post to bring awareness to make more people aware of its existence/remind people of it while we\u0027re waiting for the delta v calculators to be ironed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
