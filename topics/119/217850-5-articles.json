point.\u00A0 I have been very vocal about how I feel about EA, and what we believe was promised vs. what we got, and the future of KSP2.\u00A0 I want everyone to keep that in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, this video should be must-see TV for the entire community.\u00A0 As someone who came to the party late, I either had no idea or had forgotten the details about how far KSP actually had to go to get to a playable state.\u00A0 All of those updates prior to the 1.0 release are nothing short of amazing, and the fact that most of it was handled by 1 person?\u00A0 Mind-blowing.\u00A0 Like, my mind is blown and may never get put back into its original shape.\u00A0 Just...wow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen compared to KSP2, I can absolutely now see where KSP2 is vs. where KSP1 was at specific points in its development.\u00A0 Although the comparison still isn\u0027t apples to apples (because of who developed which game in the series), you can see where KSP1 was, where KSP2 currently is, and how each got to where they are.\u00A0 And that\u0027s a handy piece of information to have right there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only question that I have left:\u00A0 Why didn\u0027t TT/PD/IG follow the same development path as KSP1?\u00A0 I mean, they could have and we\u0027d never know it (because we will never know what decisions are made internally, right?).\u00A0 But if you look at what was available in EA for KSP1 vs. what was made available in EA for KSP2, it seems to me that the only real issue here is the TT/PD/IG tried to give too much in EA.\u00A0 Or, at least, they tried to give more than what KSP1 had during EA.\u00A0 And that, I think (for whatever my own opinion is worth) is why there are so many bugs and game-breaking mechanics.\u00A0 They simply tried to give too much, and they rushed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that doesn\u0027t alleviate the questions as to how it all happened, or why the endless delays while stating they were just polishing the game up and such.\u00A0 Nor does it entirely excuse the state of the game at this point, especially when you consider that the latest patch introduced a pretty nasty bug (and I agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

But this does help me to see the whole in a new and different light.\u00A0 And it reminds me that perhaps I need to take a step back, calm down, and keep Kerballing on because, in the end, we are all hoping that KSP2 not only becomes as good as KSP1, but that it surpasses it in ways that we never dreamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022
