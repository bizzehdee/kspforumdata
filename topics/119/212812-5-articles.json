We don\u0027t know though whether the repeat vessels will be physically modeled and flying around or more abstract. Though I think the latter could be really cool it poses some problems and I kind of suspect the resource transfers will be more virtual.

It feels like they have a vision of what the game should be - with only a single story mission and single playthrough in mind. It doesn\u0027t feel like they are experienced die-hard fans who really enjoyed all aspects and the rich diversity of the game and what it can be. But now I start to digress. I guess we\u0027ll just have to wait and see. Though for now, I\u0027m still on the verge of refunding my EA.

If I was to hazard a guess, I would probably have a strong argument that Kerbin is the most unexplored planet in the Kerbolar system in KSP1. So if KSP2 bucks that trend and we spend a little more time putting up satellites to map Kerbin and understand that planet before we go to the Mun and beyond, and repeat the approach, I think we\u0027d all be better for it. And, like you, I have also started and restarted quite a number of Career modes - except I do so without mods.\u00A0If you don\u0027t want to follow the full \u0022career mode\u0022 path - that\u0027s literally what the Sandbox mode is for.

How do games like KOTOR and Mass Effect\u00A0 - which all have a common ending - get replayed time and time again? It\u0027s the *players\u0027* mindset and approach that sets each playthrough apart. Plus, when you restart, I guarantee you, you build your \u0022first few\u0022 rockets differently than from your very first playthrough - because you\u0027ve learned new skills, which changes the outcome - by becoming arguably more efficient and/or streamlined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for a single playthrough approach, considering they\u0027re going to be adding more than a few star systems I believe we\u0027ll have hundreds of hours (even with time compression) if we play a career mode from start to finish.

I\u0027m not as concerned about FPS, this isn\u0027t a shooter or twitch-based game after all, but I am concerned about putting heavy payloads (thus requiring heavy, large rockets with complex fuel usage, multiple engines and stages) in space and being able to reliably circularise an orbit and/or dock, and reliably navigate between celestial objects.\u00A0I am, however, also quite interested to see what the first patch brings/fixes. While I\u0027m not expecting it to address all of the issues straight off the bat, I would like to see it address the majority of issues that we have in KSP2 that aren\u0027t in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-11T05:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2023 05:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Cailean_556\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goehler","CreatedById":228671,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-16T11:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too really hope that the Adventure mode will be a new take on Career mode, and not just Science mode.

Everyone has their own way of enjoying games and I don\u0027t begrudge anyone having fun. I personally found most of the generative contracts pretty repetitive and unrewarding, but yeah if you sift through enough of them you can tack on some pretty workable side-quests. I don\u0027t think they need remove all of the generative contracts, but what the do need to do is fix the exploration/ world first contracts for visiting new places and doing new things. I never quite understood why those remained this weird invisible mess in KSP1. I completely agree they shouldn\u0027t be linear--there\u0027s no reason why you should have to visit Duna before Eve or the Mun before Minmus. Players should mostly be able to go where they like and always find ways to discover new things.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as resources and LS goes KSP1 did have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E but it was kind of one dimensional and the way things were mapped and prospected was pretty clunky. Im psyched to see that system developed in a way that makes building colonies and living off the land on other planets feel more active and rewarding. The most important thing is having the supply route system really tightly designed to alleviate the manual maintenance of it. Its not like a city builder or factorio where you need constant maintenance. Everything Nate has said has indicated that colonies are really set-and-forget and non-punitive, so to me a really simple \u0027snacks\u0027 based LS is the most obvious and important mechanic for keeping kerbals happy and productive. I have no interest in worrying that running out of water or oxygen will mean you come back to a colony full of dead kerbals.
