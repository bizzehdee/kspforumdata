There has been too much animosity on the forums since KSP 2\u0027s release. From both sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my perspective, I am very unhappy with the state of things with the game. I tried to get a refund but left it too long as I had trust that the devs would go all out to fix the problems. That trust ran out months ago. I gave up at 0.1.2 and haven\u0027t played since a 30 minute test of 0.1.3. I went back to KSP1 and am having a blast with a career play through. I\u0027ve pretty much stopped posting here, though I am keeping an eye on things. I\u0027ve said my piece and nothing has changed so I don\u0027t feel the need to continue. My feeling toward KSP2 has turned to apathy, and that is not likely to change any time soon. I\u0027ve pretty much checked out and am more interested now in KSP1 and what Cities Skylines 2 will have to offer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe division we see in the community cannot be fixed by the community. All we can do is try to be tollerant of differing opinions, but even I\u0027ve found that hard with some of the insults and personal attacks being thrown around. I\u0027ve had to stop myself several times from responding, and now rarely bother engaging at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s up to the devs to fix, or at least limit the division by fixing the game. The way I see it is there are 3 major problems with the game. Performance, bugs, and lack of content. I think everyone has a concern about at least one of these and we all have our opinions on which should be fixed first. For me it\u0027s bugs as I have a solid rig and wouldn\u0027t enjoy more content until the bugs are fixed. At the same time I can understand why others might have a different opinion and I don\u0027t feel the need to throw insults if their opinion is different to mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI place the blame for the game releasing when it did at the feet of T2 (they had told investors it would release that financial year). At the same time, how much longer were T2 expected to wait for the devs? We\u0027ve seen how painfully slow development has been over the last 6 months, T2\u0027s patience must have been wearing thin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt T2, IG and PD care about my opinion, they already have my money. Is that my fault? Partly, for sure, I shouldn\u0027t have bought the game day 1. But that doesn\u0027t excuse the state the game was in, and continues to be in 6 months later. I won\u0027t be buying from any of them in future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoup","CreatedById":2804,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-16T17:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I see it, I ask myself this question: if even this first early release of KSP2 lived up to what IG wanted people to expect of it, would these people still be wishing all the negative things they do?

For that reason, I am not interest personally in communication like \u0022velocity is good\u0022 or \u0022morale remains high\u0022 or \u0022the publisher is really committed\u0022, but details about how features will work are always welcome.

KSP 1 may have been buggy at the start, but it could easily be forgiven since it offered something new.\u00A0 Had we gotten the same bugs but with colonies then the reception would have been more positive. The issue is of course is that there is room for a lot skepticism about how far along those features actually are, with people either assuming they haven\u0027t started or that they are almost finished implementing them in a separate branch. As always it\u0027ll be somewhere in between but the last post by Nertea (e.g. supply routes) seemed to indicate to me that there\u0027s a lot of design work yet to do, let alone implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisShourai","CreatedById":226083,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-24T22:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293191\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686778080\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225122\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dakota\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/14/2023 at 3:28 PM, Dakota said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EOn Respect...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Some of you have a deep connection with this franchise.

The uproar over it was akin to a revolution. I really think people would have stopped playing if it had ever happened.\u00A0 There were warnings that next we\u0027d be equipping Jeb with \u0022Boots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 or \u0022The Ancient Space Helmet Of Landing\u0022 or something. Squad changed their minds because of this and ended up putting a different Kerbal XP system in the game which is fine I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, years later, they worked in silence on a feature we didn\u0027t even know was coming. And then one day, that feature dropped, with no warning or explanation. That feature was Ground Based Experiments. Cool! New things to do! We have a reason to send Kerbals somewhere and - even better -reasons to send DIFFERENT TYPES of Kerbals somewhere! Because as we all know engineers placing power generators makes them generate more power, and an experienced engineer can make it generate a LOT more power. Similarly, experienced scientists can cause an experiment to generate more science over time! Also, no more worrying about electric charge. One solar panel can power 1 thing. Unless an engineer does it then it\u0027s 2 things. A good engineer can power 3 things with 1 solar panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the best of my knowledge, no one has complained about how ridiculously unrealistic this is. How exactly does Bill get 3 times more power out of a solar panel? And why does that solar panel produce the same power on Eeloo that it does on Moho?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if they had announced that first.

From what I see, the two types of hating/criticizing is the most popular among people in the Forums, Reddit and Discord:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Bug reports, posts to point out problems related to KSP2 and possible ways to improve the game. For me, this is called constructive criticizing, which is to provide feedbacks and to give suggestions. I believe that most people from this group are not the \u0022haters\u0022, they are just people who want the game to be better and/or unsatisfied by its current state. It is the type of \u0022hating\u0022 that may actually help the game\u0027s development, if I say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Player count posts, bots. digging track records, pointless assumptions and personal attacking. Yes, this is now becoming a common sight recently. People who do this type of\u00A0 \u0022hating\u0022 might actually hate KSP2 and have a lot of time to spare. Instead of making constructive criticizing, they are posting toxic comment no matter the status of the game and like to repeat the same thing over and over and over again. From my observations, they are the true type of \u0022haters\u0022 and does no help to the community, if not making it worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy? I\u0027m not white knighting the game and I do acknowledge the many downsides. I just can\u2019t understand the second type of \u0022haters\u0022 because they do no help and are purely wasting their time doing nothing meaningful.
