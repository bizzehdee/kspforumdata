And now a game from one of the largest game publishers at almost full price, which turned out to be much less than expected after years of delays and promises.

I don\u0027t know for sure, I got acquainted with the game in 2015 and paid about $7. KSP2 began to be developed in 2017 by professional game developers under the patronage of T2. It is now in its sixth year of development and the game is 50$.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is missing a boat load of essential, borderline\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erequired\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0features (see: persistent thrust, different fuel types bc the old liquid fuel NERVs are completely broken in regards to balance, ways to access parts that are inaccessible due to camera controls, a basic reactor, part classifications inside categories, etc) and \u00A330 is asked for all that. I don\u0027t think the indie development really holds valid seeing as you had individual modders like Nertea coordinating the development of part assets and parts themselves far better than Squad was. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stretch to say that what\u0027s to be said about KSP 2 applies far more to KSP 1 than 2, especially seeing as \u0026lt;s\u0026gt; KSP 1\u0027s developers were so good at priorities \u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; that they spent a good chunk of developer time remaking the part assets to be just as mediocre and even more bland than the old part assets. Yes, I\u0027m bringing KSP 1 up for the 50th time. But I\u0027m not a big fan of double standards and seeing people take kind stances about KSP 1 when it had many issues much worse than the, as Vl3d would say, mostly \u0022cosmetic\u0022 bugs that I encounter playing KSP 2. On my first few weeks of coming back to KSP 1 towards late 2022, I had even small probes suffering from phantom forces and shaking themselves apart on successive rails warp \u0026gt; physics \u0026gt; rails warp cycles, all because I built a tiny bit of stuff around a tiny small cubic strut. You know, using a part built for part attachment to attach parts to places they otherwise can\u0027t be attached to. Again, this game in its entirety costs \u00A330 and that\u0027s not a kind price point for an insanely cheap and broken game - the game\u0027s look, even with all the eye candy mods you can find, is stuck in 2011 and the bugs and lack of critical features make it feel like an early access game. Even seven years after its early access ended. Sure, KSP 1\u0027s tenuous list of \u003Cem\u003Eplanned\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efeatures being checked makes it \u0022feature complete\u0022, but that\u0027s a frankly useless metric given that many features you should need for e.g. ion engines were seemingly never planned. Yes, KSP 2\u0027s parts list takes a second to load and things are a bit slow, but it\u0027s certainly better than KSP 1 directing all of its resources to getting the parts loaded, which becomes a massive problem when using mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice my tangent is getting longer so I will stop there. I just wanted to address how insanely pricey KSP 1 is for how broken it is, and that people seem to forget, ignore or get apologetic about KSP 1\u0027s Knock-Nevis full of problems when it gets brought up in discussions about KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, KSP 2 costs 15 quid more than KSP 1 (and is just about the same price as the full KSP 1 experience), and it\u0027s already dealt some serious blows in my eyes.
