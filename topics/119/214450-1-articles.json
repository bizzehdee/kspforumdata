There\u0027s a mod for that already - so that\u0027s handy. I also love the mod that let\u0027s my click on AE \u0026amp; PE to have those persistently display as I work on my maneuvers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that would be great is a way to clean out all the bloat from game saves more easily. If you do much traveling around, very quickly your saves will go from a few MB to many hundreds of MBs or even GBs. 90% or more will be the huge block of TravelLogData. I\u0027m not sure what good that stuff does, but stripping it out seems to work fine - I\u0027ve not had a crash yet from doing so and it doens\u0027t seem to have any negative impact - just much faster F5/F9 when needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would not mind having a mod that showed me my surface lat/lon (as we used to get from KerbNet and ScanSat)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d dearly love to have a mod that could make clones of existing parts with edited properties. Why do all engine mounts weigh 700 kg? That\u0027s kinda heavy, especially for a size SM! There are a number of silly part properties in the game like that - so it would be nice to be able to give thigns a bit more balance.
