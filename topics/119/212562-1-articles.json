Runs OK on Core i9 11th gen and RTX 3070 (not Ti).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst couple of times I attempted to launch the thing from the Steam app, but couldn\u0027t. On a lark I opened it from the installation folder and it launched. Also got a Windows Firewall prompt to have it accept inbound connections, which I figured was unnecessary in single player mode so I ignored that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made it to a Mun flyby and came back in one piece, though the seas were pretty rough on splashdown kicking the pod around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to launch it from within Steam only had it exit right away, with \u00271 min\u0027 play time logged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, I do have Software Restriction Policy enabled, and looking in my logs I found this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EAccess to C:\\Users\\gordo\\AppData\\Local\\PD Launcher\\pcr-1.3.0.1366\\LauncherPatcher.exe has been restricted by your Administrator by the default software restriction policy level.\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd shortly afterward:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EFault bucket 1920914238771734676, type 5\nEvent Name: RADAR_PRE_LEAK_64\nResponse: Not available\nCab Id: 0\n\nProblem signature:\nP1: KSP2_x64.exe\nP2: 2020.3.33.23162\nP3: 10.0.19044.2.0.0\nAttached files:\n[snip the rest]\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not too worried though. My setup is unusual compared to most. Though I do wonder why it\u0027s trying to run executable programs in user-writeable space.
