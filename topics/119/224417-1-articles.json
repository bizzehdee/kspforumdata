Paying for a server to host discussions about your game and hearing negativity can\u2019t be easy, and they literally just listened to the community and in particular by making some of those criticisms more visible), since Mike said he\u2019d want to look into this thread I want to share two concise points and some explanation below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. How will the foreseeable problem of \u201Ctime warp to get infinite resources/science\u201D be handled?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

I had made a post about limiting a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s construction abilities to the number of unique supply routes set up by the player. This incentivizes going to new mining sites on multiple planets (which feedbacks into getting more science to get better parts to get more resources and so on.) if it\u2019s timed to the in game clock, just time warp 1 billion seems to take away any incentive to make new bases, one per resource would be enough. Life support is another route, and the last post by Dakota had a surprisingly high amount of people ask for some form of life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the second point, a lot of the negative feedback regarding communication is because we don\u2019t really know how to give feedback without knowing the direction of the game. I find For Science! as a great step forward, but lacking until there are some additional player restrictions beyond science points. There\u2019s feedback I\u2019d like to give, but without knowing what (and if) those additional restrictions will be it\u2019s hard to. One assumes it will be tied to resources, but it doesn\u2019t seem that IG is willing to share any info on how they will play into the game. Which is fine, but I would expect many to stay grumpy when that much is in the dark and the game is in early access.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome clarification on if this more broad idea type feedback is still wanted and helpful would smooth things over I think. If these things are set in stone and are being kept quiet for a surprise an indication that they\u2019re not helpful will keep us from speaking into the wind.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are helpful, you guys know where the undecided bits are- we don\u2019t. If the devs wonder if more/enough players would prefer x feature/solution over y (say enough to make the time and effort to implement it worth it) open up and include us in the discussion. I would love to give feedback that can be specific enough to be actually helpful, even if I\u2019m outvoted by other community members. That type of engagement, where the community is able to offer helpful insight that is applied to the game to make the game better for the majority seems to be what many are missing. Right now the feeling is really that just bug reporting and that level of feedback is desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA CM launching a poll or discussion where they say \u201Cthe team is working on x problem, would you rather us do y, z, or something else?\u201D would be the absolute best thing to happen for community sentiment in a long time. You guys pick where large crowd feedback is helpful (I get that it\u2019s often not, too many voices and too many contradictions) and then each of us gets to communicate a small part to the crowd response that can then hopefully be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso get the whole team more snacks and Dakota another monitor.

As it stands, the direction it is going seems to be a mostly curated mission structure with a sandbox to pick up science points if needed. Almost like a space GTA. KSP1 had open ended contracts and a sandbox to grab your science points from wherever you wanted. That made it so that the only thing fixed was that your start point was Kerbin. From there, you can go anywhere. In KSP2, you are going from Kerbin to Mun, to Minmus, to Duna, etc. I know I can still hit Eve at the start if I want, but most people new to the game won\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really believe that the whole reason KSP caught on was a bunch of enineering people sunk their teeth into the game.

I think that mob vote hurts the Minecraft community because whatever is not voted for will never be in the game (or at least not for a long long time). I think if we had a poll for this big decision of the road map, where we know whatever we didn\u2019t vote for will still end up in the end game, it would make the community feel valued in their opinion on how development should go and could be a boost to moral also. I personally am more curious than anything at this point, I feel like a lot of people agree that they want resources to bring functionality to colonies sooner but that\u2019s just what I have seen, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how most feel. Since this is such a big decision there would be a large amount of players who actually vote for their choosing (especially if you announced it on the YouTube channel for those not in the loop on all the socials/forums). Anyways I see why mob vote sucks but I don\u2019t think \u201Cwhich should come first\u201D would suck. Anyways I know both will come eventually and I appreciate the work that the team puts in but I would love if this were a possibility (obviously behind the curtains development schedule/progress matters a lot about if that sort of poll would even be reasonable/possible) Anyways, Happy Weekend Y\u2019all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-13T13:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem of the community is that they don\u0027t seem to accept that the devs have their own vision for the game.

KSP1 had open ended contracts and a sandbox to grab your science points from wherever you wanted. That made it so that the only thing fixed was that your start point was Kerbin.
