Both satellites where behind the position they actually should be, by such an amount that they are actually pretty close to the satellite following up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRechecking orbits with micro engineer ( I also brought them to orbit with that tool), they have no deviation that would explain that behaviour, AP and EP differ by maximum 2km(0,3%, AP and EP~600km) and the period time is the same for all satellites\u00A0 to the second.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything I am missing that would explain such a deviation, or has anybody observed something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest regards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
