I am of the vision that KSP1 was a golden egg goose, and 2 has (had?) the potential to be one as well, which is why I took Nate at face value when he said they were funded till 1.0. I\u0027ve never thought, at any point, that KSP2 could be cancelled or dropped. I also don\u0027t think the negativity \u003Cem\u003Emade them go faster\u003C/em\u003E. In fact they\u0027re not fast, they\u0027re painfully, measurably, and undoubtedly slow by any and all metrics other than comparing them to themselves and negativity didn\u0027t change their speed at all because it really seems that\u0027s as fast as they can go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u003Cem\u003Edo think\u003C/em\u003E however, that we\u0027re getting the minimum viable product on literally anything promised, and so far that\u0027s my take on FS! with it seemingly being a carbon copy of KSP1 science with minimal changes (and no, a carbon copy with minimal changes is the opposite of what I expect from a sequel). I also think that negativity did get them \u003Cem\u003Eto change their tone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 on communication, to the point of going on an interview like Matt\u0027s, where anyone else would\u0027ve easily laughed at even being offered the unique chance to commit honesty-cide on camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe didn\u0027t make them any faster, or make them create a better product.
