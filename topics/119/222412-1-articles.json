Well done! The game is now both playable and enjoyable. It feels like true KSP now and I think that its a great starting point. Sure there is a lot of room to grow but at least now there is a stable game that players can both enjoy and help to improve along the way. Cant wait to see what this game becomes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheehaw Kerman","CreatedById":223516,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-01T00:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou sound surprised?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
