I don\u0027t know what you do for a living, but you clearly never had to solve a problem that\u0027s actually new and takes more than five minutes to think of a solution to. So we can basically exclude any software work from the list of things you\u0027ve ever attempted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, if I\u0027m working at Google, as I have, and I screwed something up, and it caused our service to fall for a few minutes while the revert is being processed, do you realize how little I care about it? It might cost Google a few million, if it\u0027s an important enough service, but I don\u0027t give a damn. There is no consequence for anything you do, and it gets boring after a while. I left precisely because there is zero impact. Most software jobs are like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, there are a handful of people working on things like self-driving cars and crewed Falcon missions. If you screw up on one of these, it\u0027ll get people killed. Though, it\u0027s super unlikely that you\u0027d ever be able to trace it down to a mistake any one person made. Some people can manage that better than others, and it\u0027s not a job for just anyone. Other than that, though? Medical and military software goes through so many validation checks... The only place where you have to follow more strict guidelines is software for slot machines. It takes enormous level of carelessness from the corporate for any one engineer\u0027s mistakes to propagate to an issue that causes people to die, at which point, it\u0027s not on the engineer. It\u0027s an extremely different environment. Security is somewhere in between. Realistically, though, nobody works in security feels that sort of personal responsibility for people losing money due to leaks. Again, it\u0027s closer to the impact of just a general corporate work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat sets gaming industry aside is that we\u0027re all working on things we actually personally care about. Nobody goes into games for the money or prestige. You go into games because you want to make games. And it\u0027s not about making some little brat happy about playing a game. It\u0027s about making an art piece that you\u0027re proud of. And when you screw up as an engineer on a game, you\u0027re not letting down the corporate or the gamers. You\u0027re letting down your colleagues in art and design, who have worked for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emonths\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on a feature, that now either can\u0027t be shipped or works like total crap, because you didn\u0027t fix something in code. Or you weren\u0027t able to solve an optimization problem. You\u0027re not letting down some arbitrary person out there. Someone you\u0027ll never know or hear from. You\u0027re letting down people you work with day after day for many years, many of whom become your close friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have experience across variety of sectors. Academia, where I started, corporate giants, like Google and a certain media company I do not even wish to name. Several games-adjacent startups that were sort of related, but where it still felt more like just a job in fintech than anything creative, and a number of large and small gaming studios. I\u0027ve never worked on a project involving autonomous guidance, where I\u0027m literally holding someone\u0027s life in my hands. I suspect I\u0027d hate that, and they are probably under more stress than anyone in the tech industry. But outside of that, games are the easy second.

We were running behind, because the entire project was on fire, and my engineering and art resources were constantly getting pulled from me. I had that vacation time scheduled from way before, back when we were still supposed to have the feature already delivered by that point in time, and I refused to shift it. Two reasons. First, I was tired and I needed this time. I already scheduled it for way further out than I was supposed to, and I was already losing PTO hours due to them being unused. But more importantly, I knew that if I don\u0027t take this time, nobody on my team would, and these final two months would be absolutely devastating, because the entire game was far behind schedule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made my vacation public within the relevant teams. I publicly asked not to be disturbed while on that vacation. I\u0027ve also privately made sure that people who might need to reach me for some emergency could. Two or three people from my team have requested PTO after that, people I knew needed it, and nobody from upper management tried to fight me on approving it because that would be bad optics if I had my PTO already approved. We shipped the feature on time. We got the payout for delivering it, we got praised for it in game reviews, and five names from my team ended up on a patent for a certain part of that feature. It\u0027s purely a defensive patent, but my team still got bonuses for it, and it looks good on the resume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are leading an exhausted team during difficult part of development, it\u0027s critical to make a big show out of taking PTO, because some people will absolutely not take the PTO they desperately need because they feel like they\u0027re letting the team down. If you, as a manager, don\u0027t set a good example on good work practices, who will?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what the exact situation is at the Intercept. I don\u0027t know exact causes for the delays. I\u0027ve said before and I\u0027m saying this still - they shipped a decent alpha. Some problems, sure, but nothing that wouldn\u0027t get green-lit to go into the next milestone, and absolutely nothing like a disaster some people here try to claim it to be. Yes, people are used to seeing betas in early access, but the business case for an indy studio releasing beta as early access is very different than publisher-backed studio releasing an alpha build. So I don\u0027t know to what degree the Intercept has been mismanaged if at all. All we know is that the game is taking longer to develop than it was estimated from a few years back, and we don\u0027t know the exact causes of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with all of that in mind, do I think Nate has done the right thing about publicly taking vacation right now? I don\u0027t know. What I know is that there are good, legitimate reasons to do so, and I don\u0027t have enough information to call it a misstep. Even in terms of how it was communicated, because that wasn\u0027t for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0benefit. That was for the benefit of the team that worked hard, and might not take the vacation if all they\u0027re seeing is harsh criticism from the forum and are thinking they\u0027re letting their colleagues down.

I have rich experience of working with people who do not fulfill agreements, miss deadlines, do the job very badly, and at the same time tell in bright colors how great they are and that they will soon reveal their creation to the world.

Nobody goes into games for the money or prestige. You go into games because you want to make games. And it\u0027s not about making some little brat happy about playing a game. It\u0027s about making an art piece that you\u0027re proud of. And when you screw up as an engineer on a game, you\u0027re not letting down the corporate or the gamers.

The thing is just so much nicer to use than high-profile, public-facing services from billion-dollar corporations serving tens of millions of users.
