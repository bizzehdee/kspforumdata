A game isn\u0027t just announced without knowing what it will be, and then scheduled to be released 6 months later. Therefore, the entire team couldn\u0027tve just been planning for the last 3.5 years.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe first \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Epublic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E build of KSP2 is very primitive and appears to contain many things that were pulled and quickly touched up/altered from the original game (should the files be looked into). There is no way that this build was started in 2019, 2020, or 2021. I speculate that this first public build was cobbled together within the last six months, based on the obvious bugs released on day one that could be found and fixed had the devs and playtesters had more time. If the code for KSP2 was in active development since the very initial announcement, I have a feeling things like inferior PQS terrain (no cave support, among other downsides) would be a thing of the past. Also, this is not definitive evidence of anything, but the first build upload for the game shown in SteamDB happened about 6 months ago \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWas there an initial build that was trashed in late 2019? Was it built directly from KSP1 or did it start from the ground up?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe reason KSP2 released like it did is almost certainly not the sole fault of the developers. Look what a tiny team with a limited budget did back in 2011 for KSP1, and in only a matter of a few months. This whole nested conglomerate is much more massive than Squad ever was, and a bigger company with more departments will cause everything to slow down drastically after a critical size. There are obviously parts of the companies and business deals that made it take this long. I mean... it\u0027s T2.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPressure was almost certainly exerted on the dev team to get this out by a certain deadline. They must have known how it was going to go and hunkered down by release day. If they got to choose when to release the first build, it would\u0027ve certainly been at a later date with most of the current gamebreaking bugs fixed. No developer of any kind WANTS to release a bad product and then face harsh criticism for it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are some of my late night ramblings I\u0027ve had on my mind since the day it released and I played it for the first time (I made sure not to watch any videos or read anything about it beforehand as I wanted to go in and form my own opinions). I am neither a game development expert nor an expert in business, so I am definitely interested in insights others may have about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T05:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677906667\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191453\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pickelhaube808\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Pickelhaube808 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we may never get an answer from someone on the inside due to PR, the curious among us may have to try to establish some sort of timeline using the data and hints we can find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will either \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E get an answer, or get multiple answers (because every person involved has their own view on what happened).\u00A0 Knowing what might have (or even what actually) happened doesn\u0027t change the past, present, or future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does wild-ass-guessing about what \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E have happened resolve anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T05:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt we\u0027ll get an answer for this.\u00A0 Noone working for the company will ever share an honest story because, as we\u0027ve seen from the communications over the years, they constantly say everything was going well, and the only time they said things went badly, they blamed externalities - COVID,\u00A0 huge technical challenges, the need to reach quality, etc.\u00A0 Even with Nate\u0027s post today, claiming it was a\u00A0 \u0027bumpy\u0027 launch - it\u0027s all spin to make things sound like they\u0027re the most diligent publisher and developer ever.\u00A0 T2 is very very on message.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone who wants to publically share that information risks both lawsuits over NDAs they\u0027ve signed and being blackballed by the industry for being willing to leak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd anyone who anonymously tries to speak about such things will be laughed at as a poseur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only possibility is some sort of journalist willing to privately vet developers and then let them speak off the record, like the limited information we got about the star theory breakup.\u00A0 But that was a juicy story, vs this just being another dime a dozen botched launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamasutra used to do a thing ages ago where developers talked about what went right and wrong with a project which was slightly more honest - but even that was spin doctored, though not as heavily as T2s public coms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-04T05:32:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2023 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by RocketRockington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pickelhaube808","CreatedById":191453,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T05:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677907898\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... like the limited information we got about the star theory breakup.\u00A0 But that was a juicy story, vs this just being another dime a dozen botched launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be honest - I am so diehard Squad that I have been out of touch with stuff that happened after about 1.3.1.

So from the \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E of it, it might seem that the game was in this state in 2019. In reality that\u0027s just the shape of the parts and how they\u0027re rendered - about 5% of total development?

Cranking out mockups that look like the real thing is suprisingly simple. But it is also less than 1% than the desired final state. Often more like 0%, because you often toss away your prototype and start from scratch once you understand the lessons learned from your prototype.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerdsie","CreatedById":227320,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T19:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677906667\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191453\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pickelhaube808\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Pickelhaube808 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nappears to contain many things that were pulled and quickly touched up/altered from the original game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes you say that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
