I got all four crew out and lined them up next to the flagpole (which rendered as the default KSP flag not my specific selection when starting the campaign, but I digress \u2026)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I watched, they cycled between excitedly dancing in place, yawning, adjusting their helmets, but also scratching their rear ends and quite obviously either farting or peeing, presumably into their suit catheters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the idea of idle animations as such is fine, I don\u2019t really care awful much for some of the more infantilizing/middle school humor animations like butt scratching and farting. I miss the occasional \u201Cterrified Kerbal\u201D trait - we should have animations of them looking around nervously or tentatively, staring up at nebula filled sky with dismay or even fright. We should have some more curiosity-themed animations too - looking down at the soil, pulling out a little widget and \u201Cscanning\u201D the ground or the atmosphere with it, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, I don\u2019t want my Kerbal to be green Minions. I want them to be Kerbals, like they\u2019ve always been.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do YOU think?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T16:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678723715\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, LameLefty said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlooking around nervously or tentatively, staring up at nebula filled sky with dismay or even fright\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recall any of them being nervous when on the ground.
