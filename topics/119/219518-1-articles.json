Still, I do want to get into a \u201Cseeing the game imrpove before my eyes\u201D vibe and the only way to do that is by putting in the hours between updates. But my god, Nate, you\u2019re asking a lot from us...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe objective\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding a medium rocket to launch a series of communication stations around Kerbin an Mun. Over-engineered communication stations, with a Mk I lander can (so when the electronics need fixing or upgrading an engineer can work on it in short sleeves) and a large dish, so a substantial rocket is required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYe olde engine mount plate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn expected problem is that when returning to a ship in flight, engine plates will have their fairings back. If you\u0027re lucky it just looks ugly. But most of the time a sign \u201CHEY KRAKEN OVER HERE IF YOU DARE\u201D seems to be slapped on, stretching and disfiguring the ship at best and ripping it apart at worst. Yes, it\u0027s still there. But surely using it on the first stage will not be an issue? Well, the good news is that the game will not lull you into a false sense of security by pretending things are right at first. My first rocket exploded on the pad before launch, the second one decided spontanous mid-flight to eject all engines, which, now detached and without a lot of mass, accelerated a lot faster as somehow they were still getting fuel. Colliders seem to work as designed though, with expectable results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecouplers aren\u0027t reliable either. \u003Cem\u003ELet\u0027s just shift your engine off-center for no good reason\u003C/em\u003E is something else I just learned can happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdjusting Orbits\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting up synchronous orbits requires precise maneuvering.

You can only do it from the tracking station. Then you have to click on the vessel in the left panel. Then click on rename, only to be reminded if there\u0027s an \u0022M\u0022 in the name that it\u0027s not really renaming it because you didn\u0027t click \u0022focus\u0022.

The game can be very helpful here, because if you had deactivated your engine before hand and you go full throttle, \u003Cem\u003Eobviously\u003C/em\u003E it should automatically be reactivated. There are about 25,000 things the game \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E do without asking, but this one it will, when you really don\u0027t want it. Ok.

Setting up maneuver node and executing it was easy. Click on the Mun periapsis and naively click \u201Ctime warp to point\u201D and Nate starts laughing. Once again I fell for it! The ship time accelerates right past it, exits Mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E stops.

I really do. I like the graphics. The UI is different but I do like it, I think it\u0027s a more a matter of getting used to it than anything else. Sound is great. But game play is such a non-stop exercise in frustration, and making sure you don\u0027t fall for making \u201Cmistakes\u201D that aren\u2019t really mistakes but simply triggers for known bugs. The lack of content doesn\u0027t even bother me at this point; it\u0027s impossible to play the game long enough to \u003Cem\u003Enotice\u003C/em\u003E the lack of content. I doubt the next patch will make it playable, so it will be at least another half year (at the current patch rate) before we get to a point where I can play it without having to hear Nate hysterically laughing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"modus","CreatedById":207631,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-17T09:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for going through this and writing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou the real mvp!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha_star","CreatedById":230385,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-17T10:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.

That would make the game more interesting because probably you could throw updates more frequently, every update would have new parts, and you would have a well-tested base.

I don\u0027t want to defend the corpo suits in any way but there is a very prevalent narrative of the poor game dev being ground up by the gears of corporate greed, which probably has some merit to it, but there is also the fact that sometimes the developers just are not very good.

And it\u0027s painfully obvious that they did not get what they paid for, just like we didn\u0027t. At some point they must have seen the product, after delays and extensions and more delays and just realised that this studio will never make it. They didn\u0027t want to spend any more millions on a failing project, plain and simple.

No. This is on the studio over promising, under delivering and generally just not being up to the task. Of course there was the Star Theory shenanigans which must have made things difficult, and I\u0027m sure T2 made a mess there, no doubt, but still.

I work for a Big Evil Coro that\u2019s not nearly as evil as customers and outsiders like to think. Customers who also want us to deliver our services for free or even less than that, while complaining when we\u2019re not the best in the industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Suits might not be developers, they will know their products and their markets. Which is why you see micropayments and treasure chests in some games but not in others, and why it is unlikely to see them in KSP despite what some haters will say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end developers need to get paid and need an office to work together in, and running the business that provides that \u2014 not to mention upfronting the substantial funds required for that \u2014 is why it\u2019s hard to do it without them, and usually the job done, disliked as the decisions that they made are, are usually a necessity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
