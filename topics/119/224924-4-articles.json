My primary job was to build up an engineering team that could ship the game, and every candidate I spoke with I was able to tell them we were working on a KSP title.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, as someone who has been in a position of managing (and growing) engineering teams across multiple projects at companies both smaller and much larger than Intercept, as well as someone with a background in physics (including patents from work in games), this unfortunately raises more questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to avoid jumping to any conclusions, but the fog of war on hiring did seem like a reasonable explanation for why the team did not know how to make a KSP game. If you are saying otherwise, I do not understand the objectively bad decisions that have been made from the technical perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-24T22:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716569564\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187168\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lisias\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Lisias said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHanlon\u0027s Razor\u003C/a\u003E proposes to \u0022\u003Cem\u003ENever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 - but sometimes we just run out of options.
