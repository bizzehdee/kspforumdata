Even if multiple means \u0022Two\u0022, we\u0027ve seen a trend of months between material updates, which could still put that release out way late into the year. Teams still struggling to keep things like KERB at the promised cadence after all, much less substantial updates, much less milestone updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do hope that\u0027s not the case. The Science update only brought KSP2 to \u0027significant\u0027 gameplay parity with KSP1, and colonies will be the update that objectively makes it mechanically superior. Technically or gameplay wise is still debatable, but KSP1 even with mods didn\u0027t handle colonies well - Closest we got was WOLF that just pushed everything offscreen. However, if that milestone is only reached when we\u0027re closer to two years of early access than not, I\u0027m going to be very disappointed. We were told that content updates should speed up after For Science, as all the parallel work the teams put together starts paying off, but setting a precedent of a yearly major milestone update would break that expectation, and would put the realistic multiplayer gameplay window with my friends into 2028 (December 2027, plus the requisite bugfix patches for it to actually work \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E). And while that\u0027s purely extrapolation from a limited set of data points, we really haven\u0027t been given anything promising to the contrary. After all, we were being shown reentry effects in February at launch, and Science Parts shortly after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-05T04:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224370273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709607634\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTeams still struggling to keep things like KERB at the promised cadence after all, much less substantial updates, much less milestone updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the thing that concerns me.\u00A0 We are told that we will get KERB every 2 weeks...and then every time we should get a KERB we instead get an excuse as to why we aren\u0027t getting one.\u00A0 The biggest thing the community has complained about is the lack of communication, and in the face of them promising us more, we actually get less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last KERB was 2/23, which means the next one should be this Friday the 8th.\u00A0 My guess is it will get delayed at least a week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-05T04:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2024 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 5\u0022\u003EMarch 5\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow71\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-05T08:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe very steady and constant communication issues has been concerning, I admit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-05T09:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtra updates in between isn\u0027t automatically a bad thing.
