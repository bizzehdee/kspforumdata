Well, they aren\u0027t going to be rebuilding the game engine from the ground up now, and whatever gains they may have made are not evident - but it seems that they recognize that they need to optimize more. We shall see\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that they have some massively unoptimized rendering calls to the GPU, and the graphics rendering is a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessels with high part count shouldn\u0027t be that hard on the GPU to render (considering everything else that is being rendered). In KSP1 the limitation on part counts was due to the physics calculations being very demanding on the CPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the GPU load of KSP2 doesn\u0027t really explain the slowness with higher part count vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an interview, IIRC, their performance goals were basically set considering that vessels of 100-150 part would be common. I routinely exceed that in KSP1 by large margins (granted procedural wings could have a large benefit to part count for many designs) - and in KSP2 I expected to make even more complex ships for interstellar travel - so this is also concerning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey say they will optimize-fine let\u0027s see what they can do next. They say their goal is to have ~150 part vessels run smoothly enough. IMO that\u0027s a low number and even their goal is concerning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s s early access, KSP1 came a long way, we\u0027ll see how far KSP2 comes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- that said, we waited a long time, we could wait more, why release it in this state? It suggests to me that someone in the company demanded that they start getting some revenue for the project.

How would \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E describe adding nuclear engines without implementing persistent thrust - which is well within Squad\u0027s capabilities - nor adding a suitable fuel type to curb the misbalance you get when a 700isp engine can consume a dense liquid fuel as if it were hydrogen? What about the many bugs that Squad left unfixed until Shadowzone addressed their negligence and technical debt issues? The many bugs people selectively forget because they don\u0027t want to tarnish their precious indie home-made game? Squad just kept adding nothing more than novelty features even when modders demonstrate it\u0027s possible to make the core of KSP 1 better than it is now, that\u0027s nothing but negligence. KSP 1\u0027s positive ratings are little more than the result of rose-tinted glasses, and just about everything I hear people say about KSP 2, KSP 1 is guilty of as well. Even more inexcusable on Squad\u0027s side because they\u0027re over a decade in and have put ZERO EFFORT into revamping critical parts of the game, instead leaving KSP 2 to mop up the mess Squad made. KSP 2 has dropped with many adjustments to the very foundation of the engine that I\u0027ve been waiting on Squad to do for years. Not to mention the fact Squad asks money for what is, for many intents and purposes, an incomplete product, given the lack of (just to make it an example again because it\u0027s so critical to low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E missions) persistent thrust, among other things. Take the ratings and throw them out, they\u0027re irrelevant and subject to lots of bias. The fact you rely on the ratings to make a point for KSP 1 rather than the game is a point in of itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214715\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678319754\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you\u0027re making excuses for the developers of KSP2 in other threads,\u00A0 a game that was built by professional developers and currently has a 49% positive rating, which is tearing that community apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHistory repeats itself and KSP 2 is not an exception.
