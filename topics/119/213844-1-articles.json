When automatically time warping to a maneuver node, it takes me to within 30 seconds of the node. Personally I would like it to take me closer to 10s because I have no patience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nActually.

The issue with making the time shorter without a 2nd button click would be that people may not have their vessel aligned to the maneuver node yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T11:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt usually stops once at 02:30, then if you press it again it goes to 00:30 (here you can start aligning) and if you\u0027re done.. we should be able to press it again to go to 00:05.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I really miss persistent rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAbaddon","CreatedById":192494,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T11:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of persistent rotation, I miss that too, and I think the lack of rotation in time warp will hold back the non-impulsive nodes. The lack of being able to keep your direction pro-grade makes burning in time-warp problematic. Right now you can enter a pro-grade burn with a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E engine that will lead you into crashing into the planet from a stable orbit (since pro-grade becomes retrograde at some point into the burn). It\u0027s still one of the biggest draws of KSP 2, but the usability in low orbits will be limited if it stays like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s a different topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-28T11:23:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2023 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MarcAbaddon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
