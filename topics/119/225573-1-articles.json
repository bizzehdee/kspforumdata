Maybe they can start from scratch, but as long as those bugs and the insane performance requirements are fixed, there is still hope for following that roadmap. And starting from scratch wouldn\u2019t be as hard, given that they still have the assets. If the original KSP developers can do it, then I think KSP 2 is set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-27T15:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP1 devs all either moved over to KSP2 or on to other jobs.
