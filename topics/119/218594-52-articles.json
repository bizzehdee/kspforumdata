Then the voices of the dissatisfied will drown in the choir of the chanters of the game, which was able to rise from the ashes. In two weeks it will be six months since the release of early access. What did we get in six months? A few common parts and that\u0027s it. Performance went from very poor to mediocre, hundreds of bugs were fixed, but many hundreds more remain. There are no announcements, science is a few animations in the editor. Colonies, multiplayer and interstellar flights are just words. No specific dates. We are now being told about heating, but sorry - this is one of the features of KSP1, which was introduced into the game in 2015 without a standing ovation. Then, in 1.0, many engines were nerfed and it was forbidden to fly into the atmosphere at any speed without consequences. Some were a little upset, but we gathered our will into a fist and dealt with it! And there are quite a lot of such features that were in KSP1 for a very long time, but which are not in KSP2. Asteroids, destructible buildings, in-game wiki, mod support, buoyancy, kerbal professions, grabbing unit, IVA, kerbals hanging out in the hangar ets - all this will also take so long and tedious to add, as if this is some kind of incredible accomplishment and a real challenge for any developer? What exactly can developers expect here? A medal from fans of the franchise? And how fair is this to other developers who really try and make a quality product? If we always praise both good quality and bad quality equally, then this will demotivate good developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-10T21:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

From the game in general, there is still the problem of realistic (or attempts at realistic) terrain, in contrast to the plastic-looking rockets, and the very cartoonish kerbals. Everything is too saturated and bright in general. Typically, things look better when they are desaturated as opposed to heavily saturated. The only area where KSP2 really shines out - planets from space, also attempt hyperrealism, which again, does not mix with the cartoonish kerbals. Kerbals are cartoonish, and I believe it was a design choice - one I disagree with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-10T23:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Any Reddit community with more than 100 members is a cesspool and if you want to post information there and it gets downvoted that\u0027s on you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Instead of linking Reddit posts on the forum, why not post on the forum and link to them on Reddit?

I was just released from having to worry about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would much rather the announcement that KSP2 was coming out as an EA game was along those lines than what we got. I\u2019m not saying I want it to have been canceled, but Take Two should\u2019ve said \u201Cwe have hit unexpected setbacks in development. We have no update on the release of KSP2 and there will be no new updates on development until the game is ready for release, whenever that may be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere absolutely would\u2019ve been gripes for a week or so but the forums, subreddit and community at large could\u2019ve just moved on and known we weren\u2019t going to see it for a while. Way more honest and way less upsetting then the PR over promises we got. Reentry isn\u2019t even on the timeline they thought it would be out so soon. But, as of now, it\u2019s obvious they released too early to even accurately guess the timeline of development. And that is a common part of programming with underestimating the last 20%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one can change the past, and I\u2019m happy they went to \u201Cunder promise overdeliver\u201D but that strategy doesn\u2019t have community goodwill improvement until the \u201Coverdeliver\u201D part.

From the game in general, there is still the problem of realistic (or attempts at realistic) terrain, in contrast to the plastic-looking rockets, and the very cartoonish kerbals. Everything is too saturated and bright in general. Typically, things look better when they are desaturated as opposed to heavily saturated. The only area where KSP2 really shines out - planets from space, also attempt hyperrealism, which again, does not mix with the cartoonish kerbals. Kerbals are cartoonish, and I believe it was a design choice - one I disagree with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% agree everything is just glass and plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun playing ksp-2 at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-11T03:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224310849\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691713358\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does this make sense?
