But for a moment, I\u0027d like us to be a bit objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the Early Access launch plagued by performance issues and unusably wobbly rockets? Yes, it was. But that \u003Cstrong\u003Ewas \u003C/strong\u003Efixed. Sure, maybe not on a timeline that many were happy with, but as a software engineer, I can tell you that development is HARD.\u00A0 That\u0027s not \u0022apologetics\u0022, it\u0027s a fact. Unforeseen issues and technical challenges come up ALL THE TIME in development. You don\u0027t know what it is that you don\u0027t know until you hit those issues. Besides just development hitches, which are normal and expected, it does also seem quite likely that the timelines were being dictated by Take-Two, who as the publisher, has their own agenda (and very little understanding of actual software development).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften times, these large publishers push development teams to hit release dates and patch windows which are just not feasible, and to make announcements that such things will be released in a certain period of time. But in reality, that\u0027s not how that works. Sure, Nate (and others) may have been pushed by T2 to say things like \u0022x feature is coming in y months or so\u0022, when in reality that feature could realistically require a year (or more) to flesh out properly. So again and again, he (at their direction) makes statements, and those statements turn out to be impossible to deliver on time. And the team ends up crunching to hit those deadlines, which causes bugs to be introduced, and things to work all \u0022janky\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been on the Project/Program Manager side of development, so I am confident in saying these things. The developers \u003Cstrong\u003Etruly\u00A0care\u003C/strong\u003E about getting working features out. For the dev team (Intercept), the product is something they (we) take pride in. We WANT it to work, and we WANT you to enjoy it. The PMs and Publishers, on the other hand, only care about quotas, deadlines, and margins. So it\u0027s pretty easy to see where the blame lays, regarding those bugs and \u0022missed\u0022 (unrealistic) expectations that were set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, with that out of the way, let\u0027s look at KSP2 as a whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForget the \u0022missing\u0022 features, because they are not \u0022missing\u0022, they are \u0022planned\u0022. Just because they are not there yet, does not change the quality of what we have. And what we have is a really nice, now well-performing, beautiful, user-friendly KSP2, with tech trees and progressions, a large number of parts to play with, and a lovely Kerbolar system to fly around in. Those things that are there, for the vast part, work as intended, and are a joy to use. I myself now have nearly 550 hours in game, and an enjoying the hell out of it. I play it almost daily, for a few hours at a time. I\u0027ve not had any game-breaking bugs, or anything else that prevents me from honestly enjoying it, exactly as it is. Also, the game IS modable. Personally, I am using the \u003Cem\u003EK2D2\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EFlight Plan\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EScience Arkive\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EMicro Engineer\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003ECommNext\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003EOrbital Survey\u003C/em\u003E mods, all under \u003Cem\u003EBepInEx\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003ESpaceWarp\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And they too work nicely, providing an expanded experience to my game. With these mods, and the \u0022For Science!\u0022 addition, we have PLENTY to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, I am not exactly sure why this game has such negative reviews...\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I want the Colonies, the Interstaller Update, and additional star systems to go explore in? Obviously! That stuff would all be really cool! But we didn\u0027t have those in KSP1 either; only mods allowed that to happen. Really, the only core feature that we do not have in KSP2 that was in the original is a career more, and that (if I recall correctly) was never going to be added into KSP2 anyhow, and thus is a moot point. So it seems, to me at least, that all these negative reviews (which are supposed to be of THE GAME) are not warranted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom reading the reviews, it\u0027s not the state of the game itself which is/was being reviewed negatively, but rather, either the way that communication regarding progress was handled, or, peoples misunderstanding of what Early Access IS and means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the first point - communication - that\u0027s \u003Cu\u003Eunderstandably\u003C/u\u003E frustrating, but unfortunately, these communications were in large part dictated by what the publisher (T2) wanted said, and when and how they wanted it to be said. If false promises were made regarding release dates and timelines - that\u0027s the publisher. If communications were not as frequent as they otherwise should have been - that\u0027s also the publisher\u0027s decision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, is Early Access. Now, we can make all the arguments that we want, but what we paid for is exactly what we got. It\u0027s right there in the name! \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EEarly.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EAccess\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022. We bought \u0022Access\u0022 to play a game \u0022Early\u0022. Which means \u0022before it\u0027s ready\u0022. Obviously, it may (will) have bugs. YES, we ARE participating in their beta testing. YES, our feedback IS needed to incrementally improve the game. YES, there likely WILL be plenty of broken things, missing features, performance issues, and other challenges which can make the game less enjoyable to play. But that was \u003Cu\u003Eour\u003C/u\u003E choice. WE chose to buy \u0022Early. Access\u0022 to this game, because we didn\u0027t want to wait for it to be ready. We didn\u0027t \u003Cstrong\u003Ewant \u003C/strong\u003Eto wait for release, when all of the planned features were done, and polished, and the game ran like butter, and all that jazz. \u003Cstrong\u003EWE\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ewanted to play it, and we wanted to play it \u003Cstrong\u003ENOW\u003C/strong\u003E. Early. In \u0022Early. Access.\u0022. We did NOT pay for a completed working product with all of it\u0027s planned features. We did pay to play the \u003Cu\u003Edevelopment builds\u003C/u\u003E of this game, early. And we got what we paid for. I am sorry if some of us had a different expectation of what \u0022Early\u0022 \u0022Access\u0022 means. But it\u0027s generally been a pretty clear term to most people involved with video games for a number of years now. Steam even attempts to make sure we know by requiring every game to require a disclaimer regarding \u0022Early Access\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly Access Game\u003Cbr\u003E\nGet instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: This Early Access game \u003Cstrong\u003Eis \u003Cu\u003Enot complete\u003C/u\u003E \u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E may or \u003Cu\u003Emay not change further\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.

We knew what we were buying. And if you didn\u0027t... somehow... after all of that...\u00A0 well, I don\u0027t know what to tell you. It\u0027s pretty clear to most of us.\u00A0But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, NEITHER of those two reasons (for the negative reviews) change the fact that we have (currently) a very enjoyable to play successor to KSP1. Plenty of YouTubers have been playing it for literally thousands of hours now, and have built their entire channels off of it. If the game \u0022sucked\u0022 that much, they wouldn\u0027t waste their time. - let\u0027s just be real about that, okay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if the game itself isn\u0027t the problem, why did it fail? In my opinion, the community. Us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReview bombing the game, writing angry posts, lashing out at other community members, trash talking the development team and community managers, personal attacks against Nate Simpson, etc.... NONE of this lent itself towards a positive outcome for KSP2. What did we EXPECT would happen? We left a crap-ton of negative reviews on the \u0022EARLY ACCESS\u0022 game on Steam, and absolutely demolished it in the discussions threads, both of which are the first place that perspective new buyers look, causing otherwise interested buyers to stay away, hurting sales numbers, and ultimately making the game fail. So yes, I will forever blame the community for causing this outcome. And it\u0027s not to point a finger and take out my frustration; it\u0027s so that hopefully, we look at ourselves a little closer, and realize that maybe our interactions have a larger impact than we thought. And maybe WE should take more care to support the games we care about, and those involved in making them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, please let\u0027s be kind and respectful in any comments below. Let\u0027s act like adults, and show everyone (and each other) that we know how to be civil. If you disagree with what I\u0027ve said, that\u0027s fine, I am happy to discuss our differences in opinions. But let\u0027s HAVE a discussion. A real one. Let\u0027s use as much objectivity as possible, and try to not let emotions get in the way?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, please do me a favor? If you DO agree, and you haven\u0027t already given Kerbal Space Program 2 a positive review (on Steam), go do that now. Show Kerbin some love. Show the developers your support.

Though, Early Access wasn\u0027t technically around back then, but if it had been we might expect that it would have been around the time that KSP1 was no longer free, which was version 0.13.3 demo back in March of 2012. The latest version was 1.12.5 in January of 2023. It took 11 YEARS of active development to get KSP1 to where it is today. KSP2 only released in Early Access on Feb 23\u0027, just over a year ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3.\u00A0EA launch at full price:\u003C/strong\u003E A fair criticism, I agree. Most games do Early Access at some kind of reduced price - but not all. Look at Star Citizen, for example. Their \u0022Early Access\u0022 costs $60 at the bare minimum, and in some cases is thousands of dollars, depending on the package you get, all for an incomplete, buggy game that may never release. Same as KSP2 was not that long ago. There are some MMOs that have done this too, for example, Ashes of Creation recently sold Alpha-2 access for about $350. So while it\u0027s somewhat rare for singleplayer titles, the pricing is not unheard of either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4.\u00A0IG\u0027s initial apparent attitude of \u0022we don\u0027t care what you think and we\u0027re not in a rush to fix it. Besides, there\u0027s nothing to fix, the game is great!!\u0022:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0I never got this impression, especially the \u0022we don\u0027t care what you think\u0022 part, but they may have a point about not being in a rush to fix it. It\u0027s far better to take your time and make sure you do something correctly than to try to rush it in, especially in a game with tens of thousands of lines of code, where a single change can introduce dozens of bugs in seemingly unrelated features. I\u0027d always urge caution over speed myself as well. And I do agree, the game IS great. It is. It\u0027s not done, but what IS done, is enjoyable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. First update took forever and fixed very little. And then the pace went down even further.:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ETrue. I think T2 may have pushed the game to have been released in Early Access long before it was actually ready to do so. Publishers do this too often, sadly. So the team crunches to get out a minimum viable product, knowing that they really needed many more months to even come close to what they wanted to release to begin with. Communication could have been better, I agree. They \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E have the same \u0022issue\u0022 that most of us developers do - assuming that your customer understands the process even a fraction as well as we do. Mostly, they don\u0027t, and we (as developers) need to be better at understanding that and communicating in a way that is clear to everyone, not just those with technical or industry knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-08T03:34:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2024 03:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 8\u0022\u003EMay 8\u003C/time\u003E by EndeavourCmdr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mc04","CreatedById":223955,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-08T03:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlmao.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moeggz","CreatedById":107035,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-08T04:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224387625\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224780\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715136286\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EndeavourCmdr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, EndeavourCmdr said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften times, these large publishers push development teams to hit release dates and patch windows which are just not feasible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, I\u2019m glad you like the game.

In that case, it\u0027s not a question of how many people you employ on the project, but rather who (if anyone) you can find to take on the problem of fixing it.\u00A0 The people in that role at IG were apparently both unequal to that task and in denial (or worse, engaging in deception) about how serious of a problem they had on their hands wrt bugs and performance.\u00A0 It might be that if they scour their no doubt deep bench of recently acquired technical geeks, TT can find that special individual who can handle this unglamorous but essential foundation work, and let them and a small team of subordinates toil away in their cave for a number of months without fanfare to see if they can clean up the mess left behind by the apparently empty Aloha shirts who were in charge of this at IG. That would not cost them so much to do, and I do believe that if they could get to some more or less properly functioning version of the colonies/interstellar part, they might find a whole bunch of previously reluctant takers coming out of the woodwork to pony up their portraits of Ulysses S.\u00A0 Grant. Of course that\u0027s a big if, and there\u0027s also the peril that colonies/interstellar will fall flat because it will turn off a lot of the fanbase by abandoning the core hook of KSP (building and flying spacecraft) in favor of a more Factorio-like model of resource extraction and automation. Anyway, who knows? But I stand by my assertion that they are not constrained only to the options of continuing with this big, expensive team or scrapping the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-09T16:43:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2024 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 9\u0022\u003EMay 9\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
