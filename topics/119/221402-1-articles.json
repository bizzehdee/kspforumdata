Between the performance, stability, and gameplay (by which I mean a near total lack of any), there just wasn\u0027t much to bring me to play it. I clocked just six hours in 0.1.0 through 0.1.4, and didn\u0027t bother playing 0.1.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that has changed. The performance is still bad, but tolerable. I don\u0027t trust the game to be stable, but it does not fall to pieces the instant I touch it. And, for now, I am willing to brave these because 0.2 brought \u003Cem\u003Egameplay\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s a bit thin for now\u2014I really want colonies, please don\u0027t make me wait another year\u2014but it exists, and it produces goals and challenges. I never really engaged with KSP1\u0027s science or career modes, probably because I modded like mad and my saves had a lifespan of about a week, so KSP2\u0027s exploration mode offers an opportunity to have progression and a force to get me out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere for once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be frank, I still wouldn\u0027t recommend KSP2. It does not justify its price tag today. However, I have more confidence than before that it will reach its goals eventually. Maybe, if the milestone update cadence is something like four to six months instead of ten, it won\u0027t even take five years to get there. One can hope\u2014and I \u003Cem\u003Eam\u003C/em\u003E hoping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
