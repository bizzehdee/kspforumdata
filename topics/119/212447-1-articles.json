I\u0027ve purchased KSP(console) either got KSP: Enhanced Edition(other console) free or at a reduced price, and KSP for PC, along with all the DLC on console and for the PC. I think I paid 30ish dollars for all 3 copies of the base game. But now, the price is 50 dollars for just the base game, and we know there is going to be DLC down the road. A lot of changes have been made from KSP to KSP 2 we get it, they are different games, but you\u0027ve claimed accessibility as one of the reasons for a lot of the changes. Where is the accessibility in pricing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe price point will make the game less accessible, sure those wanting to ride a nostalgia wave will pay it. But, you won\u0027t be getting content creators buying and distributing 50 copies of the game in a single stream at that price. But, you want KSP 2 to be accessible to more people, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was there, 3,000 crashes ago before auto struts were a thing. I was there when missions failed because 1 manual strut didn\u0027t attach on both sides. I was there when manual struts applied drag making launch vehicles unstable in flight. I was there when manual struts were a\u00A0\u2206v tax on all launches in an atmosphere. Here I am again, like a rat on a sinking ship being dragged backward into the water instead of being to move forward. I am shocked and miffed that such a small quality of life change was ignored on release. Do you think weak attachment points makes KSP 2 more accessible to new players? (Let me tell you, manual strutting was a HUGE time tax, and one of the least fun aspects when I started in KSP)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t tell you how excited I was to hear about KSP 2. Even with the events surrounding the turbulent development, I was excited. Bouncing in my seat excited. Kid going on a field trip excited. Then to see the price point, and lack of auto struts on EA release bringing back the limp, flaccid, floppy rockets of yesterdecade, I feel like you crushed a little of my inner child. You are dragging the KSP backward with these decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll see you at a sale on this, maybe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T00:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly I have to agree. This feels like an old version of KSP 1 with weird UI and control decisions added onto it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
