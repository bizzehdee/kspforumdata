And the company that owns that computer has to enact certain policies that lock down the computer so that all you can do is play that game.\u00A0 Because otherwise hackers and criminals would hack them and use their compute resources for nefarious purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means you don\u0027t get access to the file system. This means no mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can live without most mods, but I can\u0027t imagine playing KSP2 without at least Micro Engineer installed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on the one had, yeah I was originally sad not to see KSP on GeForce Now, as I\u0027m an Ultimate subscriber. But then I also realized I would be playing a more frustrating version of the game, so I\u0027m okay with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, my day-to-day computer is as beefy as GeForce Now\u0027s Ultimate servers. It would still run laggy. The bottleneck is not the video card, it\u0027s how the game utilizes the CPU. Until those Unity/CPU optimizations occur, we won\u0027t be rid of either the time dilation effects or sluggish response times.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-24T15:47:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2024 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 24\u0022\u003EJanuary 24\u003C/time\u003E by rogerawong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ewrong name of mod\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
