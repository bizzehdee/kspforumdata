Not some 10\u2070 until 10k, rapid 45\u2070 until 18k and horizontal\u00A0 from there. Yes, sometimes the launch vehicle can\u0027t make it just right, but the general idea is to make slight corrections. Any craft with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E around 1.4 should be able to do that. Speed didn\u0027t matter much. Unless of course one went with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0026gt;2, then the aero losses started to matter (too much drag, harder to steer). But keeping it slow meant only losing fuel - gravity losses. The trick was to find the balance between the two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that was KSP1. Aero overlay showed the drag arrow and I knew not to make it poke too much to the side, but keep it pointing down from the engine. Throttle down a bit when it appeared too long (Kerbal version of maxQ, this time maxDrag). Easy to fly anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 on the other hand right now has wonky, unpredictable aerodynamics. Nothing should flip when going straight up if the craft is perfectly symmetrical. The same way nothing should flip if it follows the prograde marker, right? And yet it happens. I see some antennas and solar panels sticking out, for what I know they could be super draggy all of a sudden - for no reason other than the aero system is buggy. I could try recreate the craft there to see what\u0027s what later, but my two guesses are: sticking out parts causing drag, and wonky aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
