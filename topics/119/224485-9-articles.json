It sucks for the devs like Blackrack who are clearly very good, but them losing their jobs is ultimately due to IG\u0027s inability to create a decent product, not due to some evil corporation\u0027s greedy supervillain bosses.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything the amount of leeway IG has gotten over the years would speak more towards the fact that whoever at T2 was in charge of their account was dedicated to making the game happen. There\u0027s just only so much good money they can throw after bad money and as you said they were not fooled by Nate\u0027s promises and saw how bad the launch was and how little they\u0027ve managed to accomplish since. There\u0027s no way this project was ever going to work and if it was my money, I would not be throwing another 10 million into development costs for the next two years to get sub-par implementations of colonies and resources while failing to fix critical issues, only to be in the exact same situation as we\u0027re now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
