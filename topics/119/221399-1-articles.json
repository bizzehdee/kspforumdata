But do i think that this update really should have been released, HELL NO!!!! Yes this update added science and parts for science,\u00A0 reentry, and fixes. But the quality of the implementation is terrible. I know the holidays are coming up and they wanted to get something out before Christmas but quality should be top priority, should have given us the bug fixes update now, and pushed science off another quarter at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPopup screens in flight to big and dont lock into positions, have to reset every flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRenetry looks god awful(circles and triangles around every part), It is 2023 almost 2024 do better.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo moisture barrier effects before heating effects(COME ON WAS IN KSP 1)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClouds look awful still, even though screenshots from dev post-show much better quality(Have settings at max, updated drivers)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUI still has pixelation\u00A0on stuff(Like give us the option to remove that or someone make a mod for 4k non-dithering UI...
