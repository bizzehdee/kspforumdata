Examples of this are when I tried to build a cargo bay that was exactly the right length for a satellite probe, but when it was deployed all of the small cargo bay sections were stuck to the craft, the latest one is in the following pictures. I built a truss section to hold the inflatable heat shield over the fairing that enveloped the whole structure for launch. When I deployed the decouplers to release the rover and heatshield from the last stage of the launch vehicle, the heat shield was magically held in place. Is this intentional and if so why. If not, I will submit a bug report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy other issue is parts staying highlighted. How do I \u0027unselect\u0027 a part?
