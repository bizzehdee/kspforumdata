Ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, they need to go one direction, and behind they need to go the other. So for control surfaces on\u00A0swept wings that run both before and behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, the game tries to figure it out for you, but it can get really confused (especially if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves during flight). Note, of course, that control surfaces that are very near your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E tend not to have any effect on your flight anyway. But I\u0027m surprised that inverting the deploy direction didn\u0027t work for you -- that often fixes the problem for pitch and yaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the basic answer is mostly \u0022don\u0027t do that\u0022\u00A0if at all possible. Put your control surfaces on straight wing segments that are clearly ahead of or behind your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-13T00:30:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2018 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
