The engines are relatively fine but the tanks are all over the place. For some time I\u0027ve been taking various methods to measure the stock parts and compute volume data vs the resources they contain, and use that to generate a Volume Density value to balance my own parts against. These methods have been largely flawed and all my baseline numbers come from using Jeb\u0027s Big Stick to measure them in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome weeks ago I started using Taniwha\u0027s .MU Import/Export Addon for Blender to measure the stock meshes directly, this means the data is much more precise accurate but there is still a major flaw in that all I have to measure is the exterior. Also I\u0027m limited in how much effort I can feel like putting into this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this project has a few phases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeasuring the Direct Geometry (DG)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeasuring the Inferred Geometry (IG)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating Representative Vessel Geometries (RVG) (also measuring them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDG is going into blender, importing the stock mesh, getting rid of the colliders and removing greebles like ladders or mountings in the case of exposed vessel parts, and getting the volume of that directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with DG is that everything is made of faces, making the measurement slightly smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIG is taking the mesh, figuring out what the geometry is supposed to be, and computing that raw geometry. So part A is intended to be a cylinder, measure the r and height, and compute that cylinder. So far the difference has been roughly 2% but that\u0027s important if not significant. Still, IG is a measure of the exterior and as we all know most resource containers are shrouded for various reasons; what\u0027s not so straight forward is the geometries hidden within. Capsuloid vessels are very common for fluid resources, but a good number of the stock parts are too small to contain capsuloids, so instead they would have to contain an arrangement of spheres. Batteries on the other hand typically contain cylindrical or prismatic cells, with prisms generally being far less efficient \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Secondary_cell_energy_density.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(link)\u003C/a\u003E, but for batteries it gets even more complicated because of the diverse chemistries and their huge variation (see link). Some fuel tanks however could just be containers, such as the Mk1 Jet Fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s where RVG comes in, taking the original geometry of the of the part into account and laying out geometry to represent what the actual container inside would look like. The trouble with this is that it\u0027s not factual, it\u0027s not canonical, it\u0027s invented and our best guess. Still, it\u0027s nice to have and it should allow for much more reliable numbers once we populate in the values we want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these steps net us a volume measurement in cubic meters, dividing the amount of resource contained in that part by this volume gives us the Volume Density, which is one step off the end goal of this whole project. Volume Density is Units per Cubic Meter, or u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Now this is a little late in the post, but please stop for a moment, take any preconceptions you have about what a unit actually is; set that on fire and throw it out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP has absolutely no definition for what a Unit is, Units, are just Units. They are not liters, they are not cubic meters, not pints, gallons, barrels or even fifths, they just are Units. They\u0027re an abstracted value with a set mass, saying anything else is simply false. Fixing that is the end goal of this project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy getting all of these reliable measurements of what Squad decided for each part to hold we can start doing statistical things. For instance, I\u0027ve nearly completed as of this posting the measurements for the stock batteries and the results are as follows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[min\u0026lt;\u0026gt;max]~avg\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1std dev u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDG [3,278.6885\u0026lt;\u0026gt;25,000.0000]~9,158.6370\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B18,208.3601u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIG [3,236.3790\u0026lt;\u0026gt;25,333.7725]~9,209.7036\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B18,347.2524u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t done any RVGs yet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the standard deviation is very high, and the range is Extremely large. As mentioned batteries are especially complex due to variable chemistry and complex cell structures, once the RVGs get done it should be possible to sort different batteries into different categories and each category would be much more uniform and already, the Z-200, Z-1K, and Z-4K are all very uniforn at between 3,000 and 4,500u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, with the Z-400 being 9,302u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E and the Z-100 being 25,333u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, clearly suggesting three chemistries. Also note that the 200, 1K, and 4K are all disk shaped stack batteries where the 100 and 400 are radial exposed cell batteries. This means that the ones with lower u/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003Es probably contain significant empty space which will be accounted for by the RVG, bringing their volume densities up a good bit, though I can\u0027t guess how far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end goal of this is the statistics, and to have several sets to choose from. From there it will be possible to take those statistics and generate ModuleManager patch sets to rebalance the stock parts against one specific interpretation. Beyond that part makers can use the information to decide how they want to balance their parts, and there could even be patch sets to bring other add-ons inline with the selected stock-rebalance by using these same methods to derive the volumetric data of their parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m petering through this slowly, the most time consuming part is cleaning up the mesh for the DG, replicating the stock parts in non-face based geometry for IG, and then doing the creative part with the RVGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have anything to release at this point and my spreadsheet is in dire need of a restructuring but I\u0027ve described the process and here\u0027s links to my tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Mesh/VolumeTools\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Mesh/VolumeTools\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-cylinder\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-cylinder\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/capsule.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/capsule.php\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok so I do have one thing to release now, I just finished the DGs and IGs for the EC containing parts (excluding capsules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JC7swyM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JC7swyM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T21:13:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T05:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo like.

I\u0027m focusing on the new parts even though the old statistics still need to be updated to the current methodology. I\u0027ve completed two parts so far, the big orange Jumbo-64 which I\u0027ve done as a benchmark, I know it\u0027s high for the old statistics but in the methods described above it\u0027s still useful. Then I\u0027ve done the Size3SmallTank; I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s called in game but it\u0027s the smallest 3.75m tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some pictures and let me say, if anybody has a better geometry derived from the stock mesh, please be my guest, mock it up, all my tools are linked in the first post and I\u0027m not entirely happy with this configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJumbo-64; I did this second and it turned out a lot easier because the visible tank skin on top and bottom had way more detail, and that detail was much more reasonable so I was able to make a capsule shape that I think makes a lot more sense. Now there is one dominate flaw in both of these tanks and I\u0027m really unsure of how big of an issue it is. These are both depicting single primary vessels, while the part contains two resources. I\u0027ve asked some of the smart people and they\u0027re mixed, given that it\u0027s LF, which is assumed to be RP1, which is just really clean kerosene, having a divide in the tank would be reasonable. But for the oxidizer I really just don\u0027t know and there are lots of options. Having a split vessel shouldn\u0027t be that hard and wouldn\u0027t reduce the volume I\u0027m about to state by a massive amount so we\u0027ll deal with those considerations later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Po4DuL.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Po4DuL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Jumbo-64 ranks in at 31.353 cubic meters on the OUTSIDE of the primary vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the cfg it contains 2,880u of LF and 3520u of Oxy, we\u0027ve been given no evidence that the volumetric properties of these two resources differ, and they have the same mass per unit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s 6,400u of either LF or O or any percentage combination, contained in 31.353 cubic meters, which gives one unit for this part a volume of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E204.127 units per cubic meter\u003C/strong\u003E, or a little over one unit per two litres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3-3600, I looked it up.

The word litre is derived from an older French unit, the litron, whose name came from Greek via Latin, and which equalled approximately 0.831 litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI,[2] although not an official SI unit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe SI unit of volume is the cubic metre (m3)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe litre was removed from the International System of Units after it\u0027s definition being changed twice, though I cannot determine strictly when this occured. Litre is a metric unit, but it\u0027s not an SI unit; you are allowed to use it of course but the SI unit for volume is cubic meters and I think that\u0027s a fine square number to work with. All modelling is done in meters, all speeds are done in meters per second, all forces are represented in kN, or Mg*m/s^2, and everything is massed in metric tonnes, which while also a non-SI-but-compatible unit, is the mass of 1 cubic meter of water at STP; so when you work in meters, literally everything is the same base magnitude, where with litres you\u0027re always a few decimal positions off somewhere, and in the end you have to convert it back to Units when filling up your tanks, KSP doesn\u0027t use litres, or cubic meters, it uses abstracted volumeless Units. Stepping to litres adds no benefit except in making the numbers more tangible to people; sort of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou still will never deal with 1.28 kilolitres in your actual life; I couldn\u0027t tell you if that\u0027s more or less than one gasoline tanker truck\u0027s worth, or how it compares to a home. If you talk in cubic metres though, it can become easier to understand. 31 cubic meters is about 3m x 10m x 1m, the rounding error on this example will be quite high. that\u0027s about 10ft by 30ft by almost 3 and a half feet, or 3 cars long, two cars wide, up to my belly button. Note, these are American cars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther non-SI-but-compatible units \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table6.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table6.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad did. Also Squad did. Squad has stated in numerous places, in a constant disregard of facts, that units are litres. This is as you will agree, utterly false. At best in some stock parts a unit 5 litres (I say at best because 5 is really a good number, 3.5 would be much messier), to touch on that point, 5 is completely acceptable to me, better light than heavy I\u0027d say, you can always explain more empty space into a design and it makes things a bit more challenging. Squad defines resources by how much One Unit Weighs, it\u0027s the only concrete property that resources have outside of whether or not they can be pumped around, which is as close to defining the matter state that KSP gets. For all we know, oxidizer could be a plasma, or a gel, all we know is that it can be pumped around. One unit of LiquidFuel has a mass of 0.005 kilograms, or 5 grams. This is the only fact that LiquidFuel has, because LiquidFuel exists only as a concept within the Kerbal universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering late in writing this that perhaps you meant for KSP to define how many units make up a kilogram, that does seem like it\u0027d be a pain but probably a lot easier than it sounds, and to a certain extent it could be done by rebalancing cfg files. Say right now 1LF weighs 5g, you could then reduce that t0 1LF=1g, and rebalance all the tanks to contain five times more LF, keeping them at the same mass; and rebalance all the engines to burn 5 times more LF for the same amount of kN, keeping all their efficiencies the same; and likewise because you\u0027d quintupled the amount of units in each part, you\u0027d... lost my math train... either you\u0027d make it so there\u0027s 1 unit per litre, or 25 units per litre, I\u0027m too tired to figure that one out. Alternatively you could do the opposite and balance it precisely to 1 unit per liter; I\u0027d advocate for 1 unit per cubic meter, but KSP doesn\u0027t like dealing with very small amounts, and making a Unit larger would make everything use less per frame, increasing rounding errors, especially if it was increased by 200 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, Blender isn\u0027t actually hard, it\u0027s just obtuse as all get-out, once you understand how to move the camera around and navigate it\u0027s menus, and how to accurately guess at where Blender thought it was a good idea to put some function; it\u0027s pretty straight forward to then use all of it\u0027s various functions. It\u0027s like moving to a building that\u0027s laid out in a counter intunitive way, once you know where stuff is it\u0027s not a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-13T04:14:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2014 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
