I\u0027ve never done the math on Duna/Ike, but I\u0027ve made that trip, and done the math for Minmus/Kerbin to Duna (and other) transfers, and boosting out of Minmus orbit into an orbit with a low Kerbin periapsis and high apoapsis and then doing a transfer burn at periapsis was much more efficient than going for an interplanetary transfer directly from Minmus/Ike. The timing can be tricky on those kinds of transfers, but just Duna to Kerbin shouldn\u0027t be hard at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T17:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have to burn to lower your PE, then it may not be worth it. You may get back to Kerbin, or maybe not. I\u0027d say just burn at your PE without lowering it, if you\u0027re low on fuel. If you have plenty to spare, go for it.
