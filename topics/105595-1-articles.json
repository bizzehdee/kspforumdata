Its too much to be able to do ISRU with no conversion equipment at all, or a tiny mass penatly.\n\nIMO, they need to at least double the mass of the ISRU converter.

This is good because it means a different niche is filled and so gives the players a different option. The one-click to scan the entire planet is no bad thing (not that the OP every said it was a bad thing) as it allows players with little time and/or little interest with ScanSats approach to mitigate this waiting period. However, it still \u0027forces\u0027 the player to use a scanning satellite (or ship) first to locate the richer deposits. With Karbonite, there is also a sensor (albeit VERY compact in comparison to the new stock) that will also scan instantly, but it isn\u0027t focused on rich/sparse deposits since hotspots were removed (unless I\u0027ve missed something...) so the player can just land anywhere.\n\nI suppose the stock resource system (with its large bulky parts) is more suited to a surface-base processing plant with a tanker shuttling fuel to the orbital station, rather than the orbital station itself being the one to convert the resources into fuels.\n\nPersonally, I like it and will be converting to stock. I like the quick scanning and will enjoy the challenge of the bulky parts.\n\nMy summary:\n\n**Kethane** - *Hard*\n\nDepletable deposits, slow scanning with polar orbit required\\*, deposit variation.\n\n\\**for full planetary coverage*\n\n**Stock** - *Medium*\n\nLarge parts, heat management, bulky but instant scanning in polar orbit only, deposit variation, non-depletable (unless potatoroid).\n\n**Karbonite** - *Easy*\n\nSmall parts, infinite deposits, compact equipment, instant scanning from any orbital inclination, even deposit distribution, can harvest the resources from almost anywhere (surface, oceans, atmospheres, sun particles, empty space!), karbonite-powered engines (no conversion equipment needed if fitted).\n\nThis is off the top of my head, so apologies if I have bad information.\n\n*Edit in response to above post:*\n\n*Roverdude said that solar panels also act as thermal radiators, so adding more of these (and bigger ones) should help keep the equipment cool.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T12:17:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 12:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Akinesis**"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:58:01Z","Content":"The drills were actually overheating.

When you look at how people have been doing resource scanning for years - the number one complaint was that it took too long, and was not fun. That\u0027s why folks like SCANSat since you can just scan at warp. And I agree, but just cut out the middle man of the warp bit since once you\u0027re at a ten second warp anyway, the progressive scan adds nothing. Also as noted, it\u0027s just one in a series of prospecting mechanics.\n\nBackground ore processing is a whole different kettle of fish. It\u0027s generating a tangible resource, and where you will be spending the lion\u0027s share of your time. And logical that once your infrastructure is set up, it could operate in the background.\n\nThe analogue to scanning would be to have background progressive scanning. And people would just warp through it anyway (no value) as it is a one-time and relatively short event.

Get a feel for whether the stuff you want is even on this planet. Find an area that appears to have a lot, understanding that the orbital scan is really vague.\n\nLand a Rover or a Probe. Use the surface scanner to do a detailed analysis. This unlocks more map detail. \n\nDo flybys with a ship equipped with a narrow band scanner. This gives you high-res detail and terrain information. And you can hover over it to get precise concentrations in that biome (note that biome info is shown, also note that I had you previously ground truth to unlock detail for a biome).\n\nOnce you find a choice spot, land your drilling rig. Use the surface scanner\u0027s included GPS function, or use a narrow band scanner to find your way and get to that ideal deposit. Side note - flags will show up on the NBS display.\n\nDrill, the ore goes into your ore tanks. Make sure you have an engineer on board (more stars is better) for maximum efficiency and to delay overheating. Use solar panels as passive radiators or anything with a lot of thermal mass to soak the heat.\n\nOnce done, use the ISRU to convert to fuel products.\n\n???\n\nProfit."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:11:35Z","Content":"Ok cool!

You will get extreme detail on the NBS (but it only covers an 8 degree square). Solar panels are semi-ok (they help but are not perfect). You will get more mileage by attaching your drill or plunking your ISRU on something massive like your fuel storage or ore storage tanks in my experience."},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:19:19Z","Content":"@Roverdude\n\nI read what you said and I\u0027m not disagreeing with your decisions *per se* .
