This is good because it means a different niche is filled and so gives the players a different option. The one-click to scan the entire planet is no bad thing (not that the OP every said it was a bad thing) as it allows players with little time and/or little interest with ScanSats approach to mitigate this waiting period. However, it still \u0027forces\u0027 the player to use a scanning satellite (or ship) first to locate the richer deposits. With Karbonite, there is also a sensor (albeit VERY compact in comparison to the new stock) that will also scan instantly, but it isn\u0027t focused on rich/sparse deposits since hotspots were removed (unless I\u0027ve missed something...) so the player can just land anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the stock resource system (with its large bulky parts) is more suited to a surface-base processing plant with a tanker shuttling fuel to the orbital station, rather than the orbital station itself being the one to convert the resources into fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I like it and will be converting to stock.

My experience wit Kethane was, to quote another forum user, to start scanning and go make a sandwich. In my opinion, from a game design standpoint, that was not fun. Having to optimize what warp speed you can use to mitigate the pain of a long scan process was not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we take SCANSat as a comparison (and it\u0027s awesome for scanning - it\u0027s why I recommended it for Karbonite), the mechanic is different. Background processing for one, full time warp for another. Just get into a polar orbit, and hit time warp for ten seconds and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I made the stock system, I looked at both of these. And in both cases, players generally used timewarp as a gameplay mechanic to circumvent \u0027un-fun\u0027 bits and get to the fun things. And I don\u0027t blame them. So I left in the hard part (getting to a polar orbit), added a cost (power and data transmission that varies based on the size of the body you are scanning), but took out the not fun part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - the stock scanner is significantly less accurate than the Kethane or SCANSat/Karbonite - by design. The reason is that we have a secondary scanner (the narrow band scanner) that gives you high detail, but operates realtime (more for landing planning).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, I stand by the design choice to not (in my opinion) punish players and provide a scanning mechanic that everyone tries to circumvent anyway because it is (for most players) not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of the stock resource system tho, is that if someone wanted to slap a Kethane grind in... well, they could \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane had parts of various sizes for different jobs.

Also note that these are my opinions as a designer of a game system, and in no way reflect the official opinion of Squad, etc. etc.\u003Cp\u003EThis was a very conscious design choice. My experience wit Kethane was, to quote another forum user, to start scanning and go make a sandwich. In my opinion, from a game design standpoint, that was not fun. Having to optimize what warp speed you can use to mitigate the pain of a long scan process was not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we take SCANSat as a comparison (and it\u0027s awesome for scanning - it\u0027s why I recommended it for Karbonite), the mechanic is different. Background processing for one, full time warp for another. Just get into a polar orbit, and hit time warp for ten seconds and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I made the stock system, I looked at both of these. And in both cases, players generally used timewarp as a gameplay mechanic to circumvent \u0027un-fun\u0027 bits and get to the fun things. And I don\u0027t blame them. So I left in the hard part (getting to a polar orbit), added a cost (power and data transmission that varies based on the size of the body you are scanning), but took out the not fun part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - the stock scanner is significantly less accurate than the Kethane or SCANSat/Karbonite - by design. The reason is that we have a secondary scanner (the narrow band scanner) that gives you high detail, but operates realtime (more for landing planning).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, I stand by the design choice to not (in my opinion) punish players and provide a scanning mechanic that everyone tries to circumvent anyway because it is (for most players) not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of the stock resource system tho, is that if someone wanted to slap a Kethane grind in... well, they could \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was another design choice, and one where I intentionally did not do what Kethane and Karbonite do. Real ISRU is hard. The stuff is heavy, the stuff is bulky. It imposes design constraints, and I think this is a good thing. What I find interesting as an outside observer is seeing, on the one hand, folks complain that refueling is OP, followed by folks complaining (to paraphrase) that the equipment is imposing engineering challenges. In my book I chalk that up as a win \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is completely by design that you can\u0027t make little fuel hoppers. But it\u0027s also by design that you don\u0027t have to move around much as resources do not deplete (other than asteroids). So it\u0027s a balance consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncorrect. Without the scanner, you can view the overlay either in map view or in the tracking center. To access it in map view simply double click on the planet and you will see the knowledge base option light up that will allow you to cycle through resources (one for now - Ore - but I look forward to seeing what modders add to the system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cutoff is dynamic and it is relative. So if the planet averages 0% - 15%, a cutoff of 70% will just show things that are (roughly) 10% or greater. Each planet is random in each save, so I have no idea if you landed on a good spot. Also it\u0027s going to have a lot of variance, hence why you generally want to do a ground scan to unlock higher detail for that biome before using a narrow band scanner to zero in on your final landing site. Stock has a significantly more involved scanning and resource location process than Kethane in that regard, which may be why the scanner above caused confusion. The orbital scanner is just the very first step in a more involved prospecting process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverheating wise - did you have an engineer on board? Probe based drills are going to be horribly inefficient (by design).

When you look at how people have been doing resource scanning for years - the number one complaint was that it took too long, and was not fun. That\u0027s why folks like SCANSat since you can just scan at warp. And I agree, but just cut out the middle man of the warp bit since once you\u0027re at a ten second warp anyway, the progressive scan adds nothing. Also as noted, it\u0027s just one in a series of prospecting mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground ore processing is a whole different kettle of fish.

You will get extreme detail on the NBS (but it only covers an 8 degree square). Solar panels are semi-ok (they help but are not perfect).
