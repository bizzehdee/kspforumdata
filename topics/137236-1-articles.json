However I would like to ask if squad have any plans to upgrade\u00A0 the graphics on planet surfaces like duna etc and add more unique geographical futures to explore?simmiler to what they have done with mun\u00A0 and kerbin.i understand they were restricted by the old unity engine and 32 bit before.

Everybody is crossing their fingers on clouds, but even on kerbin the texture tiling isn\u0027t always the best. This may have to do with the kind of radical scale changes you experience in this game. I\u0027m not a programmer but I\u0027m guessing an intermediate texture map in between what you see from high up and what you see from the surface might help. I have no idea the memory cost of these things but long story short, yes they\u0027re interested in this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr falcor","CreatedById":162136,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T14:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah will keep my fingers crossed \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003Eanything that will increase ingame immersion is a bonus,I really like the new external IVA view\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003Eand I also believe I saw on a video of a new fishing animation on ksp???... or maybe I was dreaming lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T14:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fishing animation is not in the stock game: you have to download the mod to go fishing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T20:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEeloo in particular could use some love. \u00A0It looks neat and shiny from orbit with interesting brown line features. \u00A0But once you actually get down to the surface it\u0027s not like that at all. \u00A0The white shiny parts turn into greyish dirt that just look like a slightly lighter-colored Mun. \u00A0The cracks in the surface turn out to be not as deep as they look, and have no real detail. \u00A0The brown parts end up with the same texture as the white-ish parts, just brownish instead. \u00A0For a place that takes so long to get to, it\u0027s pretty underwhelming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T23:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaaaa-woops!
