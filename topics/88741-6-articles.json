Then, mods could include the configuration for their own parts, and how they fit into the tech nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit I\u0027m making the assumption that it\u0027s reasonably possible to rearrange the nodes, and parts are assigned to the nodes by name (or id), not by position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the issue seems to be coming up with a reasonable taxonomy of tech nodes. Which is an admittedly Herculean effort (as you well know with CRS/ORS). Then it\u0027s up to the mod makers to provide the appropriate tech nodes for their parts \u003Cem\u003Ewithout respect to \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E they may be located in the tree\u003C/em\u003E. Once parts are properly categorized in their respective nodes, then a tech tree can be chosen. Perhaps manned pods come much later in the tree, or the aerodynamic nodes are all early and cheap, letting a career begin with planes, then move into rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis presents an opportunity for someone to release a game flavor \u0022mod\u0022 that is just a shuffling of the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the taxonomy is determined, there are just a couple of required covenants, the main one being there can/should be a way to infer overall ordering of subgroups of nodes (rocketry-\u0026gt;advanced rocketry-\u0026gt;heavy rocketry-\u0026gt;super heavy rocketry). Not that they have to be directly sequential, but that each node appears no earlier in the tree than the previous (although they could all be at the same level). But even that is a suggestion, not an enforced structure (if you break it in your tree, you should be nice enough to state that fact up front).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027m rambling and babbling.

While these guys are nice and willing to help a lot you are asking them to put a lot of work into creating a tree and assigning parts to it with no knowledge of what mods that will be used in it and that takes quite a bit of time even with that knowledge. That would take time from them working on their own mods, publicly released or not, for something which may or may not be used by anyone other than you. If you are looking for just a tech tree like this one is where MM configs do all the part assignment it\u0027s a little more feasible but from what I can glean from your original post is that you want discreet paths for each \u0022type\u0022 of progression, plane parts, rocket parts, control parts etc having their own separate progression path with little to no interdependency. If this is true then what benefit does such a tree have over what is being developed here other than jack up the science cost needed to progress further and limiting the player on their choices.
