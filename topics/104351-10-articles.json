I would imagine that means multiple shields could be stacked if a player is planning multiple aerobraking maneuvers, or particularly energetic ones. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T14:19:31Z","Content":"Squeeeeee! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T14:20:48Z","Content":"Actually....
