I\u0027m in hard career mode and while I\u0027m fairly far in the tech tree I\u0027m still meeting some self imposed goals and limitations. I have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - three comm sats in KSO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - a Station in LKO with RC-L01 and 6 kerbals (This was asthetics and research requirements more than a remote tech need).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I launched an unmanned Mk2 cockpit (in a rocket configuration, not an in lifting vehicle config) with RC-001S and RealChute\u0027s stack chute to test a \u0022reusable\u0022 light service vehicle. Something that I can boost my self-imposed Time-to-Launch window and get more launches done while not spending big bucks. On board was a KR-7 dish and a KP-10 antenna. Yes, as you can imagine, both those antennas burnt off at around 25,000\u0027 and I lost communication and control of my ship. I was kept on my trajectory though by a well balanced ship and NEAR aerodynamics. I believed that I would crash uncontrollably though without being able to trigger the chutes. With a slim hope that my trajectory would carry me to within 3k of the Space Center and so my internal antenna of the RC-001S would reestablish comm and save the craft, I stayed with it. But, I lost speed and slipped into a vertical fall about 11k short of the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At 5,000 feet my speed dropped to safe deployment and, noting that I was still out of comm and out of control I hit the space bar futilely - and lo, the chute opened! Yay, but ...? Is something broken? Does the RC-001S work even without comms for certain things? Is this a feature of Realchutes that I wasn\u0027t aware of, or just a feature of this part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T14:13:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might be wrong, but can\u0027t you set an atmospheric pressure at witch the chutes should deploy, haven\u0027t used it in some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
