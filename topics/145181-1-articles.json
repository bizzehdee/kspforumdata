In fact they have an advantage designing for platforms precisely because they \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E change. When you design for a PC, you have to design for older hardware because most people don\u0027t have the new stuff, and people can have oddball hardware configs you didn\u0027t plan for.

Why was it released when it wasn\u0027t ready?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Why was it released on a limiting platform that can\u0027t deliver the PC experience?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn answer to 1, ever was it thus. It\u0027s simply better business to float something that\u0027s full of bugs and see if there\u0027s enough interest to make bugfixing economically viable than to spend the money bugfixing first and then find that your product turns out to have no market. There are many other facets to this, but I think this is pretty easy to understand.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn answer to 2, I think there\u0027s a presumption here that KSP is the same game with the same potential to all players. It isn\u0027t. For some it\u0027s a casual smash-and-crash experience, to others it\u0027s a really deep, realistic and intensive space exploration simulator. Neither is \u0027better\u0027, both are legitimate ways to entertain yourself with KSP, which as I have observed elsewhere is not a \u003Cem\u003EGAME\u003C/em\u003E but a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETOY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. The game you create for yourself with your own imagination.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I think that selling an inferior experience on console (admittedly a dubious statement but bear with me), like the demo on PC, is actually quite a clever marketing technique. If gamers playing console KSP think that their console is limiting their enjoyment of the game, they\u0027ll buy another copy on PC just to be able to tap the freedoms it provides. The opposite is already demonstrably true - PC gamers buy the console version because they want things the console can offer that the PC (practically-speaking) can\u0027t, like playing as a casual/collective experience with family or friends. Ultimately this is good for everybody because it sells more licenses, which means more cash in the pot for more development and a better experience overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lich180","CreatedById":166677,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T14:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, buying KSP on console was a no brainer. The only laptop/desktop I have access to can barely run Minecraft, let alone something like KSP. My gaming computer went out years ago, and I don\u0027t have the money to fix it. Got the PS4 for Christmas 2 years ago, so that\u0027s my main gaming rig. 40$ for a buggy but fun game, that has issues but is still very much playable, versus 500-1200$ for a good gaming computer, PLUS the cost of games.
