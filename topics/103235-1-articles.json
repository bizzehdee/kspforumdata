See the picture below for what I am talking about.\n\nAnyone up for the challenge. I would think that some of you have the skills to whip up something pretty fast and I would be willing to do whatever i needed to (cfgs or whatever) to get it rolling. Feel free to post on here or PM me if you are interested.\n\n![4451408_orig.jpg](http://www.spaceflight101.com/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/4451408_orig.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:29:12Z","Content":"raidernick has several of these in Soviet Probes."},{"CreatedByName":"KGas- Inc","CreatedById":68366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T15:18:23Z","Content":"I literally just downloaded those to see if you were right. I\u0027m afraid you aren\u0027t. There are no launch clamps in Radiernick\u0027s mods, either of them.
