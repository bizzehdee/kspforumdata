Of the two designs, the skipper powered launch the second stage into orbit on the single capsule probe design with fuel to spare to reach Mum and place it into orbit. The same design as a three capsule with Mainsails, besides being difficult to control, needed the third stage to orbit. Of the two, Skippers were not powerful enough for the bigger payload but Mainsails were too inefficient. So a redesign was in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a tutorial, I found how to cluster the smaller engines to get the power I needed for the larger capsule, In this case, four of those engines provided more power then the Skipper, but less then the mainsail. They were not only more fuel efficient, the overall rocket with the six cluster first stage attached to the second onion style, was a lot easier to control for the orbital turn. Fuel in the first stage lasted longer, no overheat problem, and the launch speed was just right for atmospheric travel. Result, three Kerbals reached a 180K orbit with the second stage still 1/2 full of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent them into Mum low orbit using the second stage and still had 641 x 784 units of fuel and oxider left.

This sim does have a sweet spot in launch speed through its atmosphere and gravity.

If you\u0027re TWR is ever far below 2 during launch (except for the final bit of circularizing orbit), you\u0027re prob better off with more engines, even if they\u0027re less efficient. Really, you want your TWR to be in the 2-3 range (higher later in the ascent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor putting up large payloads, mainsails are a must. To put up a 400t payload the whole vessel is roughly 3000t at launch. That is 20 mainsails *just for a TWR of 1*. To get that thrust from skippers would require 45 of them (and the engines would weigh 50% more) . Now since you want a TWR around 1.7 on your first stage, you\u0027re looking at more like 34 mainsails. Doing that with skippers (or god forbid anything smaller) would be a partcount nightmare (over double the number of engines, plus the extra stuff to mount them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth engines have their place. Mainsails have lower ISP, but also higher TWR. So they keep partcount down, especially on your first stage (which is typically half the parts of my full vessel), and have similar efficiency to skippers given the lower weight. My general rule is that if I can get a high enough TWR with just a skipper then use it. If it isn\u0027t as high as I want, replace them with mainsails. When it comes to asparagus (actually I use onion) staging with large payloads, mainsails really are the answer. At the end of the day, I use mainsails much more than I use skippers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you said though, the smaller engines have higher yet ISPs, if you really want to get off on the cheap, you just need to cluster a gazillion aerospikes.

The atmosphere is not uniform (it decays exponentially), so actually you need to accelerate to keep terminal velocity. This means your TWR should be in the low 2\u0027s to get up in the smallest delta-v, and should increase to the mid 2\u0027s as you get around 15km. Lower TWRs will still get you to orbit, but nominally require slightly more delta-v.

Performance was good and like the real Atlas almost achieved 100K orbit. 10% of the second stage fuel was only needed for a 100\u002BK orbit. 4.2 tons in orbit. A two step burn was needed on the Atlas first stage with the 10% burn from the second stage. Interestingly, the Gemini fell into a path that used a full burn to low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T02:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T04:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m1xte\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m1xte\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAspargus rocket puts all stress to the central column\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot at all -- there is no central column!
