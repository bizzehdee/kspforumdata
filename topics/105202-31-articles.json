Anyway, I like the idea from the start, and I like it more the more I think about it. Right now, a single large can of food is pretty much enough to send a Kerbal to infinity and beyond. That\u0027s not fun from the gameplay perspective (it kinda verges on making life support irrelevant), and \u0022real life\u0022 perspective (MREs get tossed after five years even if unopened, for example, and even deep frozen food has it\u0027s best-by date). A mission to places beyond Mars would pretty much have either a very energy-intensive trajectory or a way of replenishing the supplies, OKS style, with dedicated people whose job is to hold the wave of entropy.\n\nYou got quite a bit of negative feedback in the beginning, so I\u0027d like to make note that some people love the idea and think you should make it stock. Also add the \u0022longing for Kerbin\u0022 face expression to the Kerbals.

These can be individually configured for your orange/vets and your default astronauts - for both supply shortage and for habitation issues (see below).\n\nHabitation is now a thing. A single default crew capacity gives you one Kerbal-month of space. Hitchhikers significantly increase this. So no more stuffing Kerbals in lander cans for ten years. Note that the default is for these to be OFF, so your existing saves are not borked. And of course you can configure this independently for vets/non-vets, and this setting is independent of what happens when supplies are exhausted.\n\nThere\u0027s a partmodule included that lets you set the habitation space of parts (and an MM for the hitchhiker is included). Use with reckless abandon.\n\nHabitation works based on a \u0027rest\u0027 state. So whenever your Kerbal is in a ship, his rest is bumped based on that hab\u0027s remaining lifespan (based on it\u0027s capacity as well as kerbals in the vessel). This also opens the door to add emergency inflatable habs to your ship so your Kerbals not only have enough noms, but also a place to rest while they await rescue.\n\nLastly, resource scavenging is being added. If a vessel is short on supplies, it will attempt to automatically pull supplies in from any nearby craft (note that this is basically the same code I use in MKS, minus the MKS requirement).\n\n(edit)\n\nOh!

So whenever your Kerbal is in a ship, his rest is bumped based on that hab\u0027s remaining lifespan (based on it\u0027s capacity as well as kerbals in the vessel). This also opens the door to add emergency inflatable habs to your ship so your Kerbals not only have enough noms, but also a place to rest while they await rescue.\n\nDoes this new system allow for indefinite duration? If so, how much stuff would you need per Kerbal to do so?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T15:21:19Z","Content":"Wow, RoverDude, incoming changes are impressive!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First - there\u0027s a whole host of new \u0027fail\u0027 options (five in total, including death, despawn, mutiny, grumpiness, and just wandering back to the KSC).\n\nWhat\u0027d be the difference between death and despawn?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Habitation is now a thing.\n\nWill be some possibility to restore this \u0027habitation\u0027?
