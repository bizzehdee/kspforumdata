It took a manned lander large enough to get there and back with a bunch of science modules. I got thinking that I might be able to use that nice first and second stage to lift several small probes that I could send on one way missions to Mun or Minmus. I loaded four small probes radial attached around a manned center craft (Manned vehicle would just orbit Mun and drop probes and then return to Kerbin) on that launch vehicle. When I release the probes they appear dead and I cannot switch to them to control them. I still can only control the main vessel. What am I missing?
