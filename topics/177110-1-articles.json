And by clean I mean: The last time you played it, did you remove everything? If you had some mods installed the last time you played it, they are probably still there. Check the GameData folder in your KSP install directory, there should be just \u0027Squad\u0027 and if you got the DLC \u0027SquadExpansion\u0027. If there is anything else, delete it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
