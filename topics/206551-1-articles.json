I have a craft where that there are proper engines facing forward and back that I\u0027d like to use in an \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022-like fashion in order to dock it with another. I noticed that there is an action group for \u0022Translate F/B\u0022 and you can put there the Thrust Limiter on an engine, and I thought this would work. So I did. I set the action to be set (not gradually increase) the throttle to 100%. However, it seems that it doesn\u0027t actually work that way in the game. Once the craft has been lofted and the engines engaged, they burn continuously because apparently before you hit the forward/back controls they start out at 50%. Hitting the F/B makes them go to 100% as I\u0027d expect, but the idle state is not 0% as would be needed, but 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan what I\u0027m trying to do even be done? If so, how? If not, what would one use that action group for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"splashboom","CreatedById":213457,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T14:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you checked the Vernor control thruster?
