You have 3 objects \u0027base\u0027, \u0027cap\u0027 and \u0027canopy\u0027. The base is just the body that \u0027holds\u0027 the parachute, the cap shoots off when the threshold is reached which you define in the cfg. Now for the animation, it seems that the game itself recognizes the \u0027canopy\u0027 object and deploys it in a squeezed state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as long as we have no access to the animation variables, which aren\u0027t baked in the DAE file. We can only create single chutes that unsqueeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried it with three chutes, and the best thing to do is just set the deployAltitude really high, so the chutes immediately take there fully deployed position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
