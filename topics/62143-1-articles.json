Bonding this metastable atom with another ordinary helium atom (don\u0027t ask me how) would in theory form a stable, combustible solid.

Long story short, any covalent bond would require an electron from another atom having opposite spin to get close enough to this excited He for it to be pulled right into the s1. Pretty much the same consideration would forbid any ionic bonds. Not that we would seriously consider these anyways. So Van der Waals with something really, really inert is your best bet. And something like an fcc lattice with regular He does appear like the only option.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s strange, because from what I read He*-He would be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esolid\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E at room temperatures.

Look, the only way this He* atom is possible is because you have one electron removed from its ground state and placed into excited state that it can\u0027t easily drop down from. This is no longer the case in a metallic state. A valence electron in a metal does not belong to an atom. It belongs to the lattice. It no longer counts for the orbital shell. It is one of the electrons that fills the conduction band instead. And there, you also have energy levels. And you also have two electrons per energy level. And with all electrons having the same spin, every other level ends up vacant. So now imagine all the electrons in the lattice, half as many lower energy level to drop down to, and all the possible interactions. Not only is this going to take way more energy than just exciting all of the He atoms, but it\u0027s something that\u0027s going to collapse instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever else may be going on, He* metal is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Palioxis1248\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Palioxis1248\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s strange, because from what I read He*-He would be solid at room temperatures.
