It\u0027s really not that hard, just don\u0027t re enter straight down at 3000m/s and your craft wont die, even without heat shields. I want my ship to blow up if it re enters at an angle that it should blow up. Whats the point of reentry heat if you can\u0027t die?

On my first flight, I put a simple pod\u002Bheat shield\u002Bparachutes combination to LKO, and deorbited with the periapsis at 30-35 km. I immediately noticed that the drag was much lower than in 0.90 with FAR. The pod was still flying 300 m/s at 2 km above sea level, and I wasn\u0027t sure whether it would be safe to deploy parachutes so close to Mach 1. Something was obviously broken (though the heat shield center of mass issue was a more serious problem at the time), and I was glad that it was fixed in 1.0.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1.0.1 patch fixed the aerodynamics for rockets. It still feels a bit different from FAR in 0.90, but rockets seem to behave as they should.

If so, then the issue is probably with the spaceplane parts, which were balanced for the too low drag in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI wasn\u0027t sure whether it would be safe to deploy parachutes so close to Mach 1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0 they where indestructible.

Spaceplanes have to be long and thin with stubby wings to overcome drag issues. They need to have a lot of Rapiers on them if you need to get decent orbital DeltaV\u0027s and carry significant payloads. Good luck mounting all those engines. Many pieces cannot be used for aesthetic purposes due to drag issues. Spaceplanes have to carry an inordinate amount of DeltaV to get into orbit as Jet engines cannot get planes up to half orbital speeds. Most Spaceplanes have to use Rapiers alone as Turbojets are even less up to the task. VTOL\u0027s? Yeah, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find many VTOL Spaceplanes anymore. All these issues harm the creativity in the game and reduce the variety of Spaceplanes that can be built. Look on YouTube. There are tons of planes people made on there but there wont be nearly as many in the future. Same with the Spacecraft exchange. I\u0027m willing to bet you\u0027ll find a tenth as many unique designs in these places now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you are arguing about realism then I get your point. But if people say there are no issues and when they are pointed out say SSTO\u0027s are not realistic then perhaps you should have been more honest in the first place and said I don\u0027t think these craft designs should have been in the stock game because they are not realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it realistic to want to attach many different parts to a Spaceplane to give it a unique look? Given that we are bound by only a limited number of parts and can\u0027t custom make hulls you can\u0027t compare that to reality. The other argument is that people are only complaining because the game become harder and they can\u0027t get into orbit with SSTO\u0027s. Well no, I rose to the challenge and made an SSTO that can get an orange tank into orbit with enough DeltaV to rendezvous with a Space Station if necessary and land again. So it\u0027s not about pilot skill. And yes, it does look like a flying hotdog with a ton of clustered Rapiers. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Whvul85.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Whvul85.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think there is anything wrong with highlighting these facts particularly when those that disagree continually state that there is no problem and state things like \u0022Learn to fly n00b\u0022 and are not being honest about the changes.

Should KSP build or tweak parts in anticipation of near future developments? I don\u0027t see why not. They already did it with the Ion engines. They decided to up their thrust from 0.5 to 2 so people would enjoy them more and so it would be less niche. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m asking for Fusion engines here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Don\u0027t like it?
