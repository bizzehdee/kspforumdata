It\u0027s really not that hard, just don\u0027t re enter straight down at 3000m/s and your craft wont die, even without heat shields. I want my ship to blow up if it re enters at an angle that it should blow up. Whats the point of reentry heat if you can\u0027t die? I want to touchdown at 100\u002B m/s in my shuttle and use drag chutes to slow down. Nothing was wrong with 1.0 Aero. Why was something fixed that wasn\u0027t broken?\n\nThe drag was much too low for pods and other non-aircraft parts in 1.0. On my first flight, I put a simple pod\u002Bheat shield\u002Bparachutes combination to LKO, and deorbited with the periapsis at 30-35 km. I immediately noticed that the drag was much lower than in 0.90 with FAR. The pod was still flying 300 m/s at 2 km above sea level, and I wasn\u0027t sure whether it would be safe to deploy parachutes so close to Mach 1. Something was obviously broken (though the heat shield center of mass issue was a more serious problem at the time), and I was glad that it was fixed in 1.0.1.\n\nThe 1.0.1 patch fixed the aerodynamics for rockets. It still feels a bit different from FAR in 0.90, but rockets seem to behave as they should. On the other hand, some spaceplane people have been complaining that planes no longer behave right after the patch. If so, then the issue is probably with the spaceplane parts, which were balanced for the too low drag in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:28:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wasn\u0027t sure whether it would be safe to deploy parachutes so close to Mach 1\n\nIn 1.0 they where indestructible.

There is no logical reason except that people don\u0027t want to learn the new system. This is a symptom of Squad taking so long to fix aerodynamics. Not that I\u0027m blaming Squad for anything mind you, just that if they done this when there were less players it would have blown over rather quickly.\n\nThere are logical reasons, (and this is addresed to multiple posters not just yourself. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)). Spaceplanes have to be long and thin with stubby wings to overcome drag issues. They need to have a lot of Rapiers on them if you need to get decent orbital DeltaV\u0027s and carry significant payloads. Good luck mounting all those engines. Many pieces cannot be used for aesthetic purposes due to drag issues. Spaceplanes have to carry an inordinate amount of DeltaV to get into orbit as Jet engines cannot get planes up to half orbital speeds. Most Spaceplanes have to use Rapiers alone as Turbojets are even less up to the task. VTOL\u0027s? Yeah, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find many VTOL Spaceplanes anymore. All these issues harm the creativity in the game and reduce the variety of Spaceplanes that can be built. Look on YouTube. There are tons of planes people made on there but there wont be nearly as many in the future. Same with the Spacecraft exchange. I\u0027m willing to bet you\u0027ll find a tenth as many unique designs in these places now.\n\nNow if you are arguing about realism then I get your point. But if people say there are no issues and when they are pointed out say SSTO\u0027s are not realistic then perhaps you should have been more honest in the first place and said I don\u0027t think these craft designs should have been in the stock game because they are not realistic.\n\nSo is it realistic to want to attach many different parts to a Spaceplane to give it a unique look? Given that we are bound by only a limited number of parts and can\u0027t custom make hulls you can\u0027t compare that to reality. The other argument is that people are only complaining because the game become harder and they can\u0027t get into orbit with SSTO\u0027s. Well no, I rose to the challenge and made an SSTO that can get an orange tank into orbit with enough DeltaV to rendezvous with a Space Station if necessary and land again. So it\u0027s not about pilot skill. And yes, it does look like a flying hotdog with a ton of clustered Rapiers. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![Whvul85.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Whvul85.jpg)\n\nI don\u0027t think there is anything wrong with highlighting these facts particularly when those that disagree continually state that there is no problem and state things like \u0022Learn to fly n00b\u0022 and are not being honest about the changes. I\u0027m willing to bet most of the people that disagree with the notion that Spaceplanes have become niche designs were never involved in building any before 1.0 came along.\n\nThe only real issue with real life SSTO\u0027s is the ability of jet engines to produce meaningful thrust in the upper atmosphere. The only projected engine that could theoretically do that and produce thrust near the ground and act as a rocket engine is the Sabre engine. If it works it will be the first and there will be better versions of it in the future. Scram jets can already reach near orbital speeds by gathering atmospheric air alone. Should KSP build or tweak parts in anticipation of near future developments? I don\u0027t see why not. They already did it with the Ion engines.
