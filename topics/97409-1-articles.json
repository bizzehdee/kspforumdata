There was some confusion, however, when Microsoft\u0027s Terry Myerson started talking about Windows 10 \u0022as a service.\u0022 Did that mean that after that first year of free availability, Windows 10 would cost an annual fee? I asked Myerson for clarification after the presentation, and he confirmed that there will be no additional fees attached to Windows 10, whenever you buy it.\u003Cp\u003EMyerson clarified that Windows 10 users will still get free updates and support for the lifetime of the OS, exactly like past versions of Windows (like XP and Windows 7\u0027s Service Packs, for example). There\u0027s no subscription model for updates or support or continuing to use the OS. Myerson\u0027s reference to Windows \u0022as a service\u0022 simply meant that Microsoft plans to update the OS with smaller, more regular updates rather than the big, chunky updates of past Service Packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T08:30:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pxi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T09:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI came here to confirm it is a permanent upgrade:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at no cost\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pxi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pxi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe devil\u0027s in the details, but at the moment it looks like it\u0027ll be free for existing customers.
