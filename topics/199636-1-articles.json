The system will comprise of several orbital tugs in space, modified second stages of my Raptor Heavy launch vehicle, which can deliver a second stage into space with just a first stage and a booster. These several different tugs are launched into space with docking ports, a mixture of solar panels and rtgs, and more monoprop tanks. Then, several Raptor Heavy launch vehicles are launched into different orbital inclinations around kerbin. Then, a Raptor 1 launch vehicle, a Raptor Heavy without four small liquid fuel boosters and a smaller fairing, could launch up payloads with a modified reusable second stage, which would deliver a payload or crew to the orbital tug via docking ports, then, it would re-enter the atmosphere, parachute down to the surface, and be recovered. To expand the effective range of said orbital tugs, more refuel depots could be delivered to the orbits of different planets and moons, to serve as stops to refuel for stages departing from kerbin. To keep prices down, this system would need to be sustained by several IRSU sites spread around the kerbol system would need to be operated, periodically replenishing their supply depots. The orbital tugs themselves have 5.1k deltav, which would allow them to deliver a payload to just about anywhere, refuel along the way if needed, refuel for a return trip, and return back to kerbin. Additionally, tugs\u00A0could be kept on standby outside of kerbin around\u00A0other celestial bodies, allowing economical crew and payload transport to and from any destination around the kerbol system. For instance, a mission profile could follow a tug refueling in orbit, a delivery stage delivering a payload to a tug, the delivery stage being recovered on kerbin, the tug going to, for instance, duna, delivering the payload, refueling, returning back, topping off its fuel, and repeating the cycle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m going to be attempting to refine and replicate this system over time on my savegame, and trying to figure out exactly how much it could save. Thanks for reading over this, please comment with your feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Witch","CreatedById":202604,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-21T03:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds good, but regarding those tugs, make sure that 5.1 km/s is your laden capability for the payload capacity you\u0027re designing for. Something with 5.1 km/s on its own might have less than 2 km/s left over when docked to another craft of similar mass to its own, and your description of them having monopropellant engines implies you\u0027ve made them quite small.

I\u0027d highly suggest a few degrees before going over your target on the surface, slowly zeroing your velocity, descending down with zero lateral velocity, turning as needed to steer your lander closer to your surface base, then, you should be able to figure out out from then and just land normally. If your a bit off, I\u0027d suggest small suborbital hopps.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the ground mining operation, you should probably have unmanned mining landers which will dig up resources and refine them into fuel, then transport the fuel with rovers with docking ports on them over to ascent landers. At that point, you would want to top off your ascent landers fuel, haul up all the fuel to an orbital depot, which then you could use for refueling spacecraft departing from the kerbin system, exporting fuel via tanks with a heat shield and parachute back to kerbin, and distributing fuel around your tug network.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for Rocket Witches post.
