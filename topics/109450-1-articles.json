The problem was even worse for interplanetary transfer burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuggested Solution:\u003C/strong\u003E I think we should radically buff the thermal conductivity of the BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point. I\u0027ve already experimented with doing this myself via Module Manager by using the following config code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[stackPoint1]:AFTER[Squad] {\u003Cbr\u003E\theatConductivity = 0.95  // default is probably 0.12\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that instead of the Radial Attachment Point acting like a relative insulator, trapping heat in the LV-N engines, it allows the fuel tanks it\u0027s attached onto to more effectively sink heat, and on top of that, it also better enables solar panels attached to the fuel tank to do their job of radiating heat (like they\u0027re supposed to). The solar panels are supposed to be our heat-radiators after all, but they can\u0027t radiate heat if the heat doesn\u0027t get to them in the first place, and these radial attachment points seem to be the bottleneck. And it\u0027s not like we can stick our solar panels on these radial attachment points either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think this extremely high heat conducivity value of 0.95 is totally justifiable. The part would seem to be little more than a shaped chunk of metal, effectively making it little more than an extension of the LV-N engine itself. So it having extremely high conductivity there shouldn\u0027t be entirely unreasonable. Does anybody see a reason why this \u003Cem\u003Ewouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be a good idea?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: To be totally clear as to what part that I\u0027m talking about, it\u0027s this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/6/6c/Radial_attachment_point.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Radial_attachment_point.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight on the money with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
