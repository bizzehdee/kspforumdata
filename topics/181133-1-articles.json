The best you could probably do is to compose your post in an editor that you\u0027re more comfortable with, such as Libreoffice Writer, or Microsoft Word (or, perhaps, LaTeX converted to OOXML via Pandoc). Once displayed in rich-text, most formatting should survive a copy\u002Bpaste into the forum\u0027s own text editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Error_Sophius","CreatedById":156232,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-05T18:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the \u0022rich text\u0022 part I have a problem with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, no, I guess that\u0027s not strictly true. It\u0027s trying to edit rich text that I have a problem with. Latex is painful too, but asciidoc-\u0026gt;pandoc-\u0026gt;OOXML should work, if I\u0027m only opening LOW to copy/paste from it.
