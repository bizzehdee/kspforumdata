However, I think you\u0027ll find that there\u0027s no way around that issue, for a couple of reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- First, regardless of what SoI you\u0027re in, you still have access to all the maps via the GUI. I think if it were possible to unload the maps, you\u0027d run into crash issues when the user flicked over from, say, the Mun map (when you\u0027re in the Munar SoI) to the Kerbin map. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to unload the maps, because....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- ... of the way KSP handles memory management. It strongly appears that KSP (and maybe Unity itself -- I\u0027m not a programmer, so I have no clue) uses static memory allocation and a fixed memory space. In other words, the engine, on startup, scans all the parts/addons/.dlls that are in its folders, determines \u0022I need ZZZkb of memory to hold all of these plus whatever memory space I need myself\u0022, then requests that much memory from the system and loads everything into that memory space. So when the program is running, all the mods/textures/.dlls are in memory with an unchanging pointers to them, so the engine does not have to engage in any significant memory management during operation. So I think, \u003Cem\u003Eas KSP is currently configured\u003C/em\u003E, that \u0022unloading\u0022 the maps based on what SoI you\u0027re in won\u0027t actually unload the maps \u003Cem\u003Efrom memory\u003C/em\u003E, because that operation was done (and becomes immutable) on startup.

Wouldn\u0027t it be possible to add a central (non-part-bound) module to ISAMapsat that keeps track of all mapping satellites and (optionally/selectively per sat) remote-triggers their scanning function? If timewarping is a problem, that mechanism could be limited to certain warp ranges. I know the RemoteTech mod does something like that to find other communication nodes in range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T15:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daver4470\u0022 data-cite=\u0022daver4470\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s very interesting, and I hope you keep us posted on your experimentation! However, I think you\u0027ll find that there\u0027s no way around that issue, for a couple of reasons.\u003Cp\u003E-- First, regardless of what SoI you\u0027re in, you still have access to all the maps via the GUI. I think if it were possible to unload the maps, you\u0027d run into crash issues when the user flicked over from, say, the Mun map (when you\u0027re in the Munar SoI) to the Kerbin map. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to unload the maps, because....\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, how Kethane does it (and, er, how mine does it, if it stops crashing the game) is only ever show the map of the body you\u0027re around. It\u0027s a design choice but I think at this point it\u0027s evident that having all the maps loaded for immediate viewing, and having very high resolution, may be mutually exclusive for some people\u0027s machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-- ... of the way KSP handles memory management. It strongly appears that KSP (and maybe Unity itself -- I\u0027m not a programmer, so I have no clue) uses static memory allocation and a fixed memory space. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, mods definitely affect the memory, in ways that are not immediate. It really does seem as if, for example, putting a craft with a scanner on the launchpad loads up those images, given the difference in RAM usage with and without the scanner. I can\u0027t say for certain as while I\u0027m familiar with C#, this is my first time messing with Unity.
