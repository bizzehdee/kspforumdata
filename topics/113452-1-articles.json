So I wonder what is the best way to approach this kind of contracts? maybe some plane with just turbojets since it is high up? I tried this approach and came close to finishing it but run out of fuel..also it is bit boring to keep plane in flight that long time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T07:52:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seaces\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh altitude planes are probably your only bet. You could in theory send a craft to orbit and then de-orbit it so that it passes close to the target area, but judging the correct spot to deorbit can be tricky. You can also burn yourself up pretty efficiently too if you haven\u0027t got A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. unlocked. It is the fastest way to do it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve just begun career, you might want to hold off on high-altitude surveys (much above 15k) until you get far enough the tech tree to get the Whiplash jet engine unlocked. You can do surveys with the Wheesley, but you won\u0027t be travelling nearly as fast nor as high. That said, if you\u0027ve got such a contract already, you can just hold off on doing it for a while rather than cancelling the contract (unless you can still only take two contracts).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot those turbos for high altitude.
