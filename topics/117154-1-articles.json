I think a mod may have heavily corrupted something, and I\u0027m dearly sorry if you had a huge Eeloo station or something. I know you uninstalled all your mods, but I think an out of date or malicious mod may have affected the other files in GameData. If not it may just be something random. Either way reinstalling the game should fix it, and I sadly don\u0027t think you can get your ships back very easily. Tons of mods can cause problems, I usually stick to 10 or less. I understand that\u0027s impossible when you\u0027re doing an Outer Planets Mod install with Near Future and a few other part packs, or trying to play RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERe-tagged as [support - Windows], we really need the logs and your save folder, you can upload them all to dropbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
