Rather than working as a tree, and being stored as such, each craft would link all parts directly to the root part. Each stage would have its own root part (so that seperating still works). This would greatly reduce craft wobble I believe, as it certainly works in Gmod (renowned for having flexible welds). Unfortunately all craft, both in orbit and in VAB/SPH would have to be rebuilt though, and I don\u0027t even know if this is possible in Unity \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T21:32:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T17:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027re looking for suggestions and development discussion: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T18:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you can just download \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-90-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-0-1-12-29-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T18:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t that break all the fuel flow rules?
