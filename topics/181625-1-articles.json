However, this method is not only inexact but also becomes very difficult when you have multiple craft in orbits that muddle the lines. It\u0027s also hard to see when your launch site is actually under the intersecting lines from any distance that keeps Minmus\u0027 orbit in the picture. Additionally, if you have to warp more than an hour or two of game time then the rotation of the frame will cause you to have to keep readjusting your map view slightly to keep the orbit lines straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would all be unnecessary if map view treated landed craft as if their \u0022orbit\u0022 was simply the circle of their latitude on the planet. Then targets in orbit could show a line of ascending/descending nodes which shows you exactly when to launch for a proper inclination. I understand that some latitudes will never have such nodes as the craft might not pass under the orbit of the target, and that launching into any arbitrary inclination could drastically change the node position immediately upon launch - but the latter is already the case in the game, and the former just wouldn\u0027t show a node if you don\u0027t pass under the target orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that adding such a tool must be harder than it seems, because both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and MechJeb seem have trouble finding the relevant nodes for a proper launch inclination. Even just a projection of the target orbit onto the planet\u0027s surface would be fine if calculating the nodes is unrealistic. Am I crazy and the only one that is tired of fumbling with the eyeballing it method? I\u0027m tired of reverting a flight only to find out that I have to time warp another 1/4 Kerbin day while toggling all my orbiting stations and satellites off in the map view so that I can actually see what I\u0027m doing and when I think I have it right finding out that I\u0027m now too far ahead of the best time to launch and do it all over again or live with the wasted fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(P.S.
