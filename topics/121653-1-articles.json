I would have been a survivor. It would take some time today to refresh but in high school we used a slide rule in chem class. In college I bought my first calculator - it cost $300 and did only the most basic calculations. Bought my first scientific calc later for my job. It cost $150. The old school guys laughed at me. They used a logarithm book when doing trig. Seriously, they could flip pages and add as fast as I could punch numbers into the calculator. Each generation has its own version of old school. It may not seem as glamorous but old school obviously works. The pyramids are still standing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and update - rendezvoused an unmanned rescue ship with Bob floating 12k above the Mun and returned safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
