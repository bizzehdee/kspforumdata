Most of what I have to say may come across patrinizing but that is only because I\u0027m thinking outloud as much as wishing to express how much work goes into make fun for others. I\u0027m paying the creators of KSP so I can put aside my studies, allow my brain to rest, and escape to the KSP environment.

How much fun is it to dig into the physiological, perceptual, cognitive, personalities, and social orders of Cultural Psychology? How much fun would it be to build a society, give each member of that society medical and psychological numberical quantities, logical (and some illogical) internal personality traits as well as external social traits, then mesh it all together in a workable program.

Scientists do not reset experiments themselves, they order their technical underlings to actually DO the work. Scientists are busy digging through the mathematical data attempting to discover something unknown with the purpose of sending that mathematical data to an engineer. The Engineer takes the mathematical data and attempts to build something useful without it costing a fortune. Manager\u0027s are there to ensure it\u0027s profitable while always humbly asking for more money from those who write the checks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is much discussion about making this game \u003Cem\u003Emore fun\u003C/em\u003E, but I have yet to see anyone offer so much as an acceleration gauge. I have to get out my\u00A0 stopwatch to calculate velocity = velocity \u002B acceleration * time (Newton\u0027s acceleration formula) just so I can predict where my rocket will be. I have to convert kilograms to newtons just to see if my rocket will lift off the ground. At some point after I get through calculus I can predict the position of the rocket\u0027s orbit with greater accuracy. I ask an open ended question. Is this program about eye-candy or offering a reality game that doesn\u0027t insult one\u0027s intellegence? \u003Cem\u003EOrbiter\u003C/em\u003E, I like because it doesn\u0027t break (almost) every law of physics. Unfortunatly Orbiter is too unstable and can\u0027t handle the excessive tinkering I like to do with the program. KSP I like because I can tinker which inevitably will cause all kinds of program errors but without damage to the original file (safely inside it\u0027s .zip file).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I don\u0027t like having a bunch of useless knobs and buttons in the cockpit.
