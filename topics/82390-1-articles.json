Feel free to remove this\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been playing this game for just over a year, and it\u0027s the first and only PC game I\u0027ve ever played. I\u0027ve built some pretty cool stuff I think, both in game and mods, but I\u0027ve done all this on my macbook pro, which causes the game to crash all the time, and awful video recording.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou an see some of my examples of my mechs at my rocket builder thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88051-cb_co\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecb_co\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.

I know nothing about hardware, I\u0027m pretty good at most software, but I don\u0027t know anything about graphics card or computer specs. Which is why I\u0027d love some input from any of you guys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking at this tower on craigslist for $175. You have to understand I\u0027m a poor dude in my 20\u0027s, I really want a new pc, but I have a lot of living expenses.
