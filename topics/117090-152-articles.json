They wont deploy during my re-entry, saying it is unsafe (even at around 200m/s?). Doing simple tests (launching a ship straight up and activating parachutes) they work fine, so it must be the speed/unsafety that is causing them to not deploy.

If you don\u0027t want your station to look like a 2.5m paper towel roll, then you need to put an adapter with 1.25m docking port between each 2.5m section. To me the most useful modular stuff might be hubs that can change number and size of connection and can switch textures. Built in docking ports would be useful, but I understand those have some special complications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, that is mostly my conclusion from observations as well.\u00A0 The \u0027core\u0027 parts of the station (habitation, lab, command, storage, shipyard?) are the most minor contributors to its part count; most of the part-count comes from adding solar panels(4-20 parts), adapters between different styles/sizes of parts (2-4 per \u0027module\u0027), and, of course, all the docking ports (20-40 depending on the size of the station).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like I might be downloading some other station-part mod packs this weekend and testing out various station designs to see what works, doesn\u0027t work, could use part-count reduction, etc.\u00A0 I honestly gave up with stations with the part-count limitations of 0.90 / 1.0; they simply weren\u0027t feasable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be extremely simple to add optional docking port models/modules/adapters to the various core modules, so that they could be used stand-alone, or with the welding docking ports.\u00A0 Just integrating the docking ports alone could be a massive part-count reduction process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222677471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468604983\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not done really good tests on framerate, but I can try tonight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding stations, I think that it\u0027s important to consider that station parts are also effectively interplanetary ship parts, particularly for those of us that use life support.
