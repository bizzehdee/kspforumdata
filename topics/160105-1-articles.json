Can be used as a lifter engine in an atmosphere, although it doesn\u0027t excel at that. Its tall profile and heavy weight means it takes a lot of creativity to use it as a lander engine using stock parts (you need landing legs somewhere!). Can\u0027t take off from sea level at Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a good navigational practice for interplanetary ships with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (as in, relative low engine power compared to their mass) is to split the nodes. So, instead of a long 2,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E burn, you start with a 800 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E burn at the place where you need to burn to go interplanetary. That will put your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E by the Mun\u0027s orbit and it will take about a day to complete the orbit (so you don\u0027t risk missing a transfer window by pushing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to Minmus orbit).Then you schedule the actual interplanetary burn at (or near) your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. You save some fuel due the Oberth effect and you gain in accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-05T22:02:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2017 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by juanml82\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
