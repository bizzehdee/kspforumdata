Lasers, plasma swords and shields all look shiny, but IMO more sci fi writers should go for sensible and unique countermeasures: Shooting bullets with bullets (See: Advanced Israel iron dome. I think tanks have a special shotgun that destroys incoming projectiles and don\u0027t even get me started on CIWS). Lasers being defeated by mirrors or radiators.

Electronic warfare, etc etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nReal World militaries could best a lot of sci fi factions right now.

Sometimes the technology in a given story is either present day technology or a plausible, not too far-future extrapolation from it. Sometimes the technology is obviously fictional but remains consistent to an internal logic and set of constraints. Sometimes the technology is just pure rule of cool. In all cases, it may be a significant plot point, it may just be window dressing for the story, or it may be something in between.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Science fiction is not necessarily space fiction, still less space war fiction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe job of the science-fiction writer is to tell a good story. If they end up being an inspiration to real-world researchers in the process, then that\u0027s a bonus. Besides, I would argue that a significant part of that inspiration arises from researchers reading about an obviously (at the time) rule-of-cool fictional technology which then spurs them to try and figure out how to turn fiction into reality.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSometimes the inspiration from science fiction is more abstract. I recently listened to a very good podcast (the Washington Post\u0027s Moonrise) which, amongst other things, explored the role of science fiction on the Apollo Program. In a nutshell, the popularity of science fiction helped to shape public perception of what was or could be possible, turning a Moon landing from an outright impossibility (and therefore waste of time) into something that would be incredibly hard but also possible. Remember that Kennedy\u0027s \u0027before this decade is out\u0027 speech happened in the very earliest days of manned spaceflight. Gagarin had only just flown, Shepard had just made his suborbital hop. To aim at a Moon landing from there required a huge leap of faith and science fiction helped to shape the backdrop against which that leap was made.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience fiction writers don\u0027t necessarily have any military experience, are not necessarily versed in military theory or, indeed, are not necessarily scientists. Of course the obvious counter to that statement is the old advice of \u0027write what you know\u0027. If you\u0027re writing about future warfare then it would probably help if you do know something military tactics and/or strategy. Likewise if a particular aspect of real-world science or technology is crucial to your story, it\u0027s probably a good idea if you know enough about it (or can research enough about it) to sound plausible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Defeating lasers with mirrors is an old trope that doesn\u0027t bear up too well in real life. Even high quality mirrors are not 100% reflective, so they will absorb some of the incoming laser energy. If the laser is powerful enough to damage the target, that small percentage of absorbed energy will be enough to damage the protective mirror to the point where it\u0027s much less reflective and therefore much less effective as a laser countermeasure.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nReturning to the original question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA plasma projectile may or may not be as effective as a laser in terms of raw damage output but there are other considerations that may come into play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWeapon cost. High powered lasers are expensive,\u00A0 require a lot of precision equipment and, depending on the lasing medium being used, are not necessarily very efficient. For a space weapon grade laser that might mean a relatively fragile weapon with significant heat dissipation requirements. Plasma weaponry may or may not suffer from those disadvantages.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s very setting dependent but I could well imagine, or be persuaded in the context of a sci-fi story, that there are tactical advantages to using plasma weaponry over lasers:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDamage mode. A plasma projectile, assuming that the \u0027plasma\u0027 is actually plasma and not just a name for some other concept, is basically a blob of charged particles. How they interact with spacecraft armour may be very different to how a laser beam interacts with that armour. Consider the somewhat analogous case of radiation shielding - the materials that you want in your shield are heavily dependent on the type of radiation you\u0027re trying to block.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA plasma projectile (compared to a laser) might be just the thing for quickly wrecking large areas of relatively fragile spacecraft components such as radiators. It\u0027s the difference between cutting a hole in a window with a glass cutter and just lobbing a brick through the window.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecondary weapon effects, aka the classic Star Wars ion cannon. Realistic threat? Who knows. But the very presence of plasma weaponry might force spacecraft designers to add additional shielding or make other performance limiting design changes to their spacecraft, making those spacecraft less combat-effective than would otherwise be possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, I always imagined plasma weapons as a rather more high tech version of these:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/dry-ice-smoke-ring-launcher/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/dry-ice-smoke-ring-launcher/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-03T08:42:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2020 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-03T12:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223813611\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195252\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593725528\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my head-canon, sci-fi plasma weapons\u00A0actually fire some sort of tightly-bound antimatter particle\u00A0cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine is monomolecular hydrogen.

Taking an example from the top of my head, as you already pointed out, a magnetic shield could effectively protect a sci-fi spacecraft against plasma weaponry. However that assumes that the spacecraft can generate a strong enough magnetic field to sufficiently deflect an incoming plasma bolt. Complete protection would also require the shielding to be active over the entire ship and to be continually active. Neither of those needs to hold true when you consider that magnetic shielding would also require power and that the spacecraft might simply not be capable of generating enough energy to power the shields as well as the engines, weapons, life support and other ship systems simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you could choose to go for a Star Wars type solution where the magnetics shields are angled or set to defend against incoming fire from the most likely directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Set deflectors on double front!

Being able to attack from multiple directions becomes especially\u00A0 important. Predicting the enemy\u0027s attack patterns to set your shields accordingly, becomes a real consideration. Lots of good story telling scope there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it may well be that plasma weapons \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E completely ineffective against fast moving craft because your setting is using movie style, relatively slow moving, plasma projectiles. That\u0027s fine. Use something else for picking off the fighters and make your plasma cannons the big capital ship killers. Or forget about plasma cannons. Take a leaf out of the Homeworld playbook and have plasma bombs or missiles equipped with plasma warheads, both of which can be deployed from fighters if need be. The warhead could be an antimatter containment unit which is set to deliberately fail when some predetermined condition is met. At which point the antimatter annihilates and turns the rest of the warhead into a cloud of plasma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL: DR.

The parties that engage in a battle can\u0027t be farther apart than those that engage in conversation. What good is a battle if the good guy can\u0027t throw a quip at the bad guy during the action? As such, the ideal weapon in cinematic fights are swords or even fists. See the prequel trilogy of\u00A0Star Wars, for instance, where sword fighters engage large armies of blaster-wielding robots and win handily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might suit the storytelling medium a lot better, but it does give an unrealistic view on how battles are actually fought, and - to flip it around a little - it means we won\u0027t see realistic\u00A0battles portrayed\u00A0 on screen very often. Has there even been a non-historical movie showing the effects of artillery in a battle? To believe the movies or even most video games, field battles are fought by running up to the enemy and shooting a rifle at them at a range no greater than the distance you can spit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think my \u0022favourite\u0022 example here is Starship Troopers, where a modern army of riflemen engage with huge, monstrous bugs - by getting within two meters of them and spraying them with hundreds of rounds of ammo while trying to avoid the bugs\u0027 dangerous claws. Meanwhile, a short clip halfway through the movie shows a few low-flying aircraft clearing an entire valley packed with bugs by dropping some cluster munitions - and then it\u0027s back to face-to-face infantry battles again. They clearly have effective weapons and effective tactics, but choose not to use either, because the screenwriters want it to be \u0022personal\u0022. The same movie shows the bugs\u0027 claws easily piercing the armour worn by the human soldiers, which makes me wonder why they even bother to be encumbered with it in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo tie this back to the question posed by the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
