But that\u0027d require me to make, among other things, a -ring- on the outside edge. Is that even possible? If so, HOW?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T20:28:32Z","Content":"Yes, this is possible. But it can be very hard to accomplish.\n\nTo be able to close the ring you need (near) perfect docking skills. A tiny error at one side can result in severe misalignment at the other. And you\u0027ll need to dock multiple ports simultaneously.\n\nThe tutorial link in my sig might be of some help."},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:07:56Z","Content":"Weeeellll crud.

I haven\u0027t used the idea for a ring station but I have used it for large cruisers. The ports will connect together if they\u0027re close enough and if you missed you might be able to \u0022wiggle\u0022 the ship till they stick. \n\nNot sure i\u0027d do that for a station though."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T03:16:33Z","Content":"I use multiple docking port connections on all my stations for both alignment and strength purposes\n\nDock slowly and pretty straight and all the ports (I use three, typically) should all dock at once (you can check whether they all have the \u0027undock\u0027 option after connection)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T16:27:22Z","Content":"As the others said, it is possible, and can be used for a wide range of applications...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz43Ww6CWyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz43Ww6CWyY)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAs the others said, it is possible, and can be used for a wide range of applications.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz43Ww6CWyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz43Ww6CWyY)"},{"CreatedByName":"StormKat","CreatedById":126927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:56:47Z","Content":"Have a look at some of my station frames on KerbalX.
