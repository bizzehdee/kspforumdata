They\u0027re planning for the first stage to detach from the vehicle at Mach 6, and then use thrusters to land back at the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t really get is how will the stage negate is huge horizontal velocity away from the launch site, since the first stage separation will take place a while after the gravity turn has started.

The first stage separates about 40 seconds later in that video, at around Mach 10, but the reusable stage separation would occur at Mach 6, which is about 1.8 km/s. So I\u0027m guessing the reusable spacecraft would also be at around 51 km altitude and 59 km downrange at that point.\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that it would require a huge amount of delta-v for the first stage to come back to the launchpad. First it would have to zero its 1.8 km/s forward speed, then it would have to cover the 59 km back to the launchpad, not to mention braking and hovering as it gets close to landing. That would require a large amount of fuel left over in the stage after separation. Am I missing something here? Anyone have an insight into how this would work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T03:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre we sure it will return to the \u003Cem\u003Esame\u003C/em\u003E launchpad? That would be the easiest solution. Otherwise, other than doing gravity turn after the first stage separation, I\u0027ve got nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part about braking is easy, though. Air will do most of it. You\u0027ll have only about 200m/s to kill before landing. And if the programming is done right, there should be almost no hover time there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T05:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ascente profile will be slightly different, so that the horizontall velocity isn\u0027t that high. And keep this in mind. If you shut down the first stage if its nearly empty, you lose a few deltaV (say 100 m/s, just for the thougt experiment). But after the detachement of the secon stage, the same fuel gives the now much lighter first stage (because the mass of the second stage is gone) a much bigger deltaV (like 800 m/s or something). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means if we cut the sum deltaV of the Rocket by only 100 m/s, we give the first stage an additonal 800 m/s deltaV to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: The majority of canceling the horizontal velocity can be done with the atmosphere. And once the vessel dosen\u0027t have any horizontal velocity anymore, one can steer it back using lift forces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do the complete Math you see, that you can land on the same launchpad and the Payload to orbit is approximatley only cut in half. The second stage can land on the same launchpad without problems because it reaches orbit first. It just needs a heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T06:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont know when they plan to release the first stage on the Falcon 1.1, but i do know it will have more powerful and efficient engines, and it is a larger stage than Falcon 1.0, to carry the extra fuel that is needed to land back at Kennedy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before they land at Kennedy, they are going to try a couple of propulsive landings in water off the coast of florida to test out the mechanics. They have already done tests where the one engine was used to lift a firststage with weights off the ground and then hoverslamed it down, and they have proven that it can hold up in decent winds (latest test to 250m)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T07:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest solution would be to put another pad 150-200 km downrange for the first stage to land on, then it would only need the ~200 m/s delta-v for final braking and touching ground. But they specifically said it would land back on the original launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Grasshopper test vehicle is just being used for testing the final ground approach and landing, I\u0027m more interested in what they do right after stage separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the atmosphere killing the horizontal speed, at 50 km altitude the atmosphere is very thin, and the rocket is still going up so it would run into even less atmosphere. The terminal velocity at 50 km is around 3 km/s, so the stage would basically have to go up to its apoapsis and then come back down into the atmosphere to be slowed appreciably. By that time it would be about 150 km downrange from the launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be that the first stage has a lot more delta-v without the second stage attached to it, but it would still have to accelerate quite a bit to get back to the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked and haven\u0027t found anything about this online, or other specifics on the reusability plan, so I guess it\u0027s like a trade secret and we have to just wait and see how they do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T08:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EElon has stated that his plan is for both the first and second stage to return to the launchpad, although this would effectively require a lot of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do have a launch site in Texas, which would put the ballistic trajectory somewhere in the Gulf.
