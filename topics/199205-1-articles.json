Military organizations are some of the most logically rational organizations on Earth, with often clear goals in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said...war in space, whether soft or hard scifi, presents unique challenges for logistics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard Scifi: Every spacecraft is a potential\u00A0kinetic\u00A0weapon...especially for moon bases without atmosphere and even more so for orbiting stations or weapons platform. Resupply takes a LOOONG time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoft Scifi: Every spacecraft has enough energy inside to become like a massive bomb\u00A0explosion if the energy is suddenly released.

Can one side EVER win a war with poor logistics against an opponent with superior logistics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess answer regarding question two is both no and...maybe? Japan tried to alpha strike piecemeal and was A-bombed for it. Russia is wise enough not to even go there but keeps a rich supply of nukes just in case, since in a conventional war they know it would be a hopeless logistics nightmare against a foe who is known for excelling in logistics. With a very, very, very thorough alpha strike, a logistically challenged foe could win against a logistically superior foe. Realistically though, obtaining sufficient data to\u00A0know where to strike to neuter your opponent completely is next to impossible. One would literally need double agents all over the place in secure areas of the enemy...while still having some contact with the government that wishes to alpha strike. Doing that is next to impossible, as being found out by watchdog agencies is likely with any massive undertaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-30T18:22:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2020 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-30T20:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Military organizations are some of the most logically rational organizations on Earth, with often clear goals in mind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!111!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHA!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn XVIII century Holland built two ships of the line.
