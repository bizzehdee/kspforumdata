Many flies, for instance, have neurons that are fused together for faster obstacle avoidance in flight where other animals would usually have a gap between the cells. The circuitry to control the flight muscles is located in the thoracic ganglia, dense nerve clusters in the same part of the body as the wings. Commands to activate or deactivate them come from the brain (where large lobes are also responsible for image processing), but the action itself is extremely structured.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you are saying that insect flight circuitry is highly canalized right from birth?\u00A0 Very interesting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-22T16:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224121259\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650645088\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you are saying that insect flight circuitry is highly canalized right from birth?\u00A0 Very interesting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you sometimes only have a few days to live your adult life, there\u0027s not a lot of time to fool around with having to learn how to do things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-23T12:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor zooming around inside pressurized spaces in zero g, i think a ducted fan pack would probibly suffice. pretty much a drone you wear on your back. would do the job but without being to high performance to be unsafe. i cant imagine a wing pack being better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-24T18:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224121222\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650639236\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/22/2022 at 10:53 AM, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to guess that even flies, given enough time, would eventually get around in zero G just fine.\u00A0 Natural neural nets are pretty amazing.\u00A0 They would simply keep trying and learning until they succeeded finding food and water most likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I read back a few messages.\u00A0 Maybe they don\u0027t keep trying, but that surprises me.\u00A0 They are good at crawling though and maybe the inability to fly triggers them into a \u0022high wind mode\u0022 where they just crawl around and stop trying to fly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moths and flies that went to space as adults kept trying to fly and kept failing.
