You can have 4 ailerons with their maximum deployment set to 4\u00A0degrees. Then if you fully deploy one of them, that will average out to 1 degree. And you can get\u00A0up to 4 degrees that way, depending on the number of them that you deploy. (Or you can do powers of two, to select the deflection you want using binary math.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sivonen","CreatedById":165197,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T14:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks.
