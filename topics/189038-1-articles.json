If necessary, adjust your orbital plane so that the orbit passes as close as possible to being directly above the target. Lower your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to maybe 7km, at a\u00A0point approximately\u00A0over your target. As you approach the target point closely, burn in map mode until your descending leg of your orbit goes right on top of your target. Then land as normal. Using this method, you will generally end up within a few hundred meters of your target -- easy walking distance or driving distance for a rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way is to act like this is a rendezvous maneuver. You adjust your orbital plane and retroburn\u00A0as above so that your orbital line hits the Mun\u0027s surface near your target. You set the target as an actual target. You go into target mode on the navball. You fly your navball, constantly pushing your retrograde marker on top of your anti-target marker. When you get within a couple hundred meters of the surface,\u00A0 you do a normal landing. This will usually get you within a dozen meters of your target. If you do not remain aware of your altitude, you may land on top of your target and/or destroy it with your rocket plumes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-18T21:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2019 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-19T01:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor these things I typically use \u0022hovercraft\u0022, I just make the lander agile enough (local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026gt; 2, a lot of attitude wheels) and give a huge surplus of delta-V, so that I can \u0022hover\u0022 around for a minute or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"k00b","CreatedById":196331,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-20T13:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou need to get your orbit linear (i.e. if you launched originally at 90 degrees; do the same) then, with your periapsis over it, burn retrograde in advance so the map mode indicates will be landing ontop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223689794\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189038\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571433713\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199341\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Public_Storage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2019 at 10:21 PM, Public_Storage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Quickly, a rescue mission was organized\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...it\u0027s more difficult landing on the same spot then going there in the firstplace (need more fuel etc for the presicion maneuvers / it\u0027s a \u0022whole new more difficult mission\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni would make a massive craft with 4 spaces, and then leave most in linear orbit around the mun, then land a lander and attach the kerbals and then rendevouz lander with the craft to get home - you can ferry the kerbals on ladders etc, (you only need the one seat for your lander.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(once you can manage to do that though then you can pretty much do anything (it\u0027s tricky having them stuck in space...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#savethekerbals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
