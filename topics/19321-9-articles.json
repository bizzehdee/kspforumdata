It should be noted that I flew it in with the docking port and three parachutes attached. The entire contraption massed at 6.49 tonnes, as opposed to the 4.75 tonne re-entry mass of my Mk1-2 Pod \u002B Heat Shield \u002B Docking Port \u002B Parachutes assembly. Perhaps S or CD simply need to increase for this pod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the drop test from 200 straight with the Mk1-2, and you are right, the behavior of little to no slowing followed by a sudden flash of acceleration (and destruction) is the norm. Although Jeb was piloting the test, so that may have had something to do with the explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults from running the Mk1-2 through the same trial as the Dragon (Entry from a 300 x 30 orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll speeds relative to the surface:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 70 km: 2250 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 60 km: 2280 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 50 km: 2314 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 45 km: 2325 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 40 km: 2321 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 35 km: 2275 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 30 km: 2080 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 28 km: 1960 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ 26 km: 1820 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... And so on with smooth sailing. But that data isn\u0027t really relevant for comparison, as this is the point where Dragon exploded. The Mk1-2 Pod made it down to the surface safe, and with a peak temperature of 16,000 degrees (which occurred deeper in the atmosphere), less than 1/3 of the temperature that Dragon got at nearly the same speeds while still 26 km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the accelerations seem to hold the same proportions between the two capsules, which makes me think drag simply needs to be scaled up for Dragon.
