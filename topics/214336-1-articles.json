What are Kerbals? Some people theorize that they\u2019re plants, some people theorize they\u2019re fungi, some people theorize they;\u0027re animals, and some people people have even theorized that colonies of organisms! I have built off these theories, and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETHE PLANT THEORY\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s a tiny bit bizarre to think Kerbals are entirely plants. They do eat other things, and have a brain (albeit not much of one). But I do have theory that could still incorporate photosynthesis. In real life, there\u2019s an animal called\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EElysia Chlorotica\u003C/em\u003E, or Emerald Green Sea Slug, that can photosynthesize. This is because they eat algae. From the algae, they take their genes and chloroplasts via specialized pouches in their intestines. This then allows them to photosynthesize. They can go months without food. Kerbals might do the same thing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals are obviously very food driven. And they probably eat a lot. Perhaps they too have specialized pouches in their intestines, which collect genes and chloroplasts from, let\u2019s say, veggie snacks? Now, obviously, Kerbals are bigger than sea slugs. So perhaps they\u2019re able to photosynthesize for several years at a time, and that\u2019s what makes them able to be in space for so long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE COLONY THEORY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals could possibly be not one organism, but multiple put together to form one massive, moving colony. A real life example could also be drawn from this one too. The Portuguese Man O\u2019 War is often thought of as a jellyfish, but it\u2019s actually a massive floating colony with organisms that work together to feed themselves. If Kerbals are like this, it\u2019d explain why they can live pretty much forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlants photosynthesize to make food for a Kerbal, and fungi and bacteria decompose dead matter and reproduce to replenish the shape of the colony, making the Kerbal, once again, a pretty much immortal being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE FUNGI THEORY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFungi is indeed a very good theory too. Kerbals look a lot like fungus, with their flat and round heads. So the idea that they\u2019re fungus isn\u2019t too far off. Perhaps they evolved from a fungus with some kind of fuzz on top of it, that slowly became able to walk and move, and it eventually became an animal. It still maintained its fungal features, though. Fungi though, however, are heterotrophs, and feed off dead organisms. So unless Kerbals feed off their souls, the fungus theory isn\u2019t too strong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003ETHE ANIMAL THEORY\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals are most likely animals. They are quite clearly some kind of mobile heterotroph. But they are very specialized animals. I think think the fact that their semi-autotrophic makes the most sense.
