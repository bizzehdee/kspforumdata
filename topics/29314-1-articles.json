So, I thought, let\u0027s go! How hard could it be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for the heck of it, I built an enormous lander and spacecraft, as shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eS2crhs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eS2crhs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no clue why I built the landing module so big... I guess in my midnight sleepiness I thought it would be cool. Anyway, here is another image right at liftoff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kyVm2Lj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kyVm2Lj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, I got into orbit, boosted myself away with a Skipper engine, and started up my first stage of nuclear travel engines before I realized I hadn\u0027t taken a screen shot in quite a while. Here is the ship\u0027s first stage of nuclear engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2zUnaYG.png\u0022 alt=\u00222zUnaYG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one wasn\u0027t very high quality, sorry. Anyway, once those fuel tanks ran dry, I dropped that stage and ignited my final rocket, also nuclear. Here is the ship (at its solar periapsis) with only the final stage remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/egMi0A0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022egMi0A0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, I was in Moho\u0027s proximity.
