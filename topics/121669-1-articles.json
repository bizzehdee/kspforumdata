There is a beginner way where you make yourself vertical, and then there is a way that is described as a \u0022reverse gravity turn\u0022 (which is a technical misnomer FYI, it isn\u0027t a gravity turn in reverse, it just arcs like one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe former has the issue of needing to be careful of the rotation of the body. The latter is a much easier way to target your landing zone because you are continuously adjusting it as you land simply by angling your craft as you burn. If your burn upward from the retrograde marker you will push your trajectory out, burning on the retrograde marker will pull it in. That allows you to adjust your landing zone while you slow down. Remember to target your base so you get the pink marker (which should get closer and closer to your retrograde as you approach), but be careful the navbal doesn\u0027t switch into target relative mode instead of surface mode. That will mess you up big time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like to mod, there is also Trajectories which shows you where you will land.
