The question was to describe phi in terms of epsilon, radius, and altitude of Sat2. PakledHostage made me see that the problem is a silly SSA triangle problem where I should apply the law of sines.

Psi forms a chord of the angle between the reciever, the celestials center and the satellite where they intercept the celestials surface. This r * cos psi falls short the surface and the chord can be used to solve for that shortfall (q). The angle between \u0027down\u0027 and reciever for the satellite (I will call gamma) forms a triange = ((kr\u002B q)/sin gamma * cos gamma = r sin psi. Epsilon (E) = 90 - gamma - psi.
