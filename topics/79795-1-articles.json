I\u0027ve just thought of an idea for custom contracts within KSP .24, however, I do not have access to a computer with the appropriate materials for testing with such an idea... so I figured asking if anyone has pondered the same idea on the forums already\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould a unique \u0022Company\u0022 be introduced and only generate specific unique contracts? And another question will arise later in this post\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example could \u0022KASA (generic name) be ruled to only give certain \u0022types\u0022 of contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second question: can a contract spawn a craft, for instance a small Space Station with changeable conditions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea I had come up with that lead me to these questins was this: Say another Kerbin-based space agency (Space-K) gives the user a unique contract (not often) that asks them to refuel or rendevous with one of their own crafts in orbit. Accepting the contract would spawn a pre-included craft into orbit around said body (kind like how they can spawn kerbals in orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to take this further... maybe the user completes the contract of rendevous with the station... later it is told that the station needs resupply and so the user must rendevous with this spawned craft... only this time the spawned craft\u0027s main fuel tank has been depleted/emptied\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much for reading this, and an even bigger thanks if you answer!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T03:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can add new companies and have them offer certain types of contracts.
