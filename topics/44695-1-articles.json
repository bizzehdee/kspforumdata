Assign stuff to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I prefer to set it to separate the lander or command pod and activate it\u0027s engines. Shutting down any main engines is a good idea as well. Then I steer away from the pad (and the rising rocket-propelled debris) before popping chutes. It\u0027s fun to absolutely terrify everyone by flipping the pod upside down and slowing down hard while still going upwards, then dropping like a rock and slowing suddenly again as it rights and goes downwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if I forgot to set one up, I just pound through the stages until I\u0027m in control of the lander, and do the above system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther suggestions are to activate landing gear on the lander as well, so you don\u0027t have to remember, and to make sure your command module doesn\u0027t have really heavy fuel tanks attached to it permanently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T15:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
