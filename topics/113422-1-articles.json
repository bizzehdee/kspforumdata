I\u0027m avoiding hard mode explicitly, as reverting is often legitimate in a game as buggy as this, but went \u0022custom\u0022 difficulty with hard settings otherwise for my new save. The juggling of finances in addition to everything else does make the game more involved, and you have to come up with more creative solutions than you otherwise would have with an unlimited stack of cash. To me, that\u0027s fun - though there is a point where it gets a bit too tedious, and that point will be different for every player.\n\nAlso, adding on things which make the game more involved, like RemoteTech and life support, are kind of mandatory for me now. The combination of it all makes the game challenging and enjoyable enough for me at the moment, and keeps me engaged.\n\nTo each their own, though. I\u0027m not particularly a casual gamer, and I like a good \u0022hassle\u0022. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:50:58Z","Content":"Career mode by far.
