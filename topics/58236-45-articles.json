I do this a lot to get the wet/dry CoMs right where I want \u0027em, and it\u0027s easy if I\u0027m just adjust the size of a tank... but sometimes I need to keep the tank larger than the fuel it can hold, for balance reasons, and I need to be able to adjust both quickly since I iterate on my designs very rapidly. This process goes way faster if I can just move the slider back and forth while watching the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rayder","CreatedById":95226,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T11:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to config an engine to use different fuels, but not use Tech levels?
