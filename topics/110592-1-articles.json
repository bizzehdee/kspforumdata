Rescue contract deadline isn\u0027t approaching but I still would love to finish it as early as possible.\n\nNow, do I have any better option other than waiting until Mun goes out of the way? I still have plenty of dV left (3k\u002B) and willing to spend that.\n\nAnswer: I seem overlooked the fact that I don\u0027t need to wait that long for Mun to get out of its way - so I\u0027ll just wait.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T05:12:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 05:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T04:53:15Z","Content":"It\u0027s not impossible to do something else, like establish on a higher orbit first, but alternatives may well take even longer in game days.

Depending on how far out the rescue orbit is, 8 degree inclination might leave you far enough from Mun to not perturb your orbit too badly. \n\nI would think 3K of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v should be enough to correct course after the flyby. \n\nMun orbits fast enough that waiting for the next window is probably your best bet, though."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:10:11Z","Content":"I already match to the target ship inclination so I\u0027m having a 8.3 deg inclination with Mun.\n\nAnd unfortunately Mun just happened to be around AN/DN node so I get the encounter but inclination would screw me.\n\nAnd I guess you guys are probably right... Mun semi-major axis is 12Mm while my target ship is 18Mm, that means the target ship orbit period is about 1.8 Munar month... Looks like I just need a couple of days."}]}
