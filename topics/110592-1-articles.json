Rescue contract deadline isn\u0027t approaching but I still would love to finish it as early as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, do I have any better option other than waiting until Mun goes out of the way?

Depending on how far out the rescue orbit is, 8 degree inclination might leave you far enough from Mun to not perturb your orbit too badly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think 3K of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v should be enough to correct course after the flyby. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun orbits fast enough that waiting for the next window is probably your best bet, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI already match to the target ship inclination so I\u0027m having a 8.3 deg inclination with Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd unfortunately Mun just happened to be around AN/DN node so I get the encounter but inclination would screw me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I guess you guys are probably right... Mun semi-major axis is 12Mm while my target ship is 18Mm, that means the target ship orbit period is about 1.8 Munar month... Looks like I just need a couple of days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
