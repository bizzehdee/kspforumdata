If kerbals need half that we can round a bit and call it 1kg per kerbal per day. I\u0027m not sure what volume that should require, however. It just becomes a matter of determining what density the food should be. We know the mass (1kg per kerbal-day) so the density allows us to derive the volume needed. From that we can either determine how much the current containers can actually hold and what their mass should be, or we can determine what volume the containers need to be to hold the desired mass of food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the same (inefficient) packaging that we use here on Earth, then approximately 75% of the waste mass will be food packaging (the wiki page showed ~65% to 90% waste was food packaging on various missions).
