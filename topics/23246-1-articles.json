This story is actually based off of actual events that went down (and are still going down) on that forum, in a thread called the Battle of Anthania and Abantor. It takes place in the RP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Empire of Angvarden, situated in that southern archipelago. The interviewees are from my nation (Republic of Aldan), another nation made by one Mobius (Usea) and, of course, from Hellorp\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nation Angvarden.

They had all fought against the Anthanian rebel group United Anthania Independence Organization after an Aldanese cargo ship had been sunk and its companion ships captured. First to arrive was Marcuz, then a Colonel in the Advanced Special Attack Squadron (ASAS), investigating the sinking. Second was King Billsky, as he had been notified of the attacks soon after. Third was De Vico, who had been attacked by rebel ships off the coast. Olyver cleared his throat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSirs, Your Highness, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to interview you about the crisis last year and your actions in it.

I was on my third ship, the \u003Cem\u003ECornucopia\u003C/em\u003E, trying to get medical supplies and other necessities to the kerbs in the south, when I saw those ships.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaptain Ken Indreve had been in the Aldanese Merchant Navy for twenty years now. He was a seasoned mariner, and knew his way around a ship. That day, his mission was to captain the AMN Cornucopia and sail to Angvarden with a hold full of vital medical supplies, to be given to the poor kerbs whose lives had been affected by the nuclear strikes of last year. He sighed, then waddled back to the helm. That\u0027s when he saw the ships, seven of them. They looked to be older classes, around 40 years old by now. The first thing he noticed was their guns. Four of them also had antiquated torpedo tubes. But it was one, the largest, that caught his eye. He knew his Aldanese history, and he knew about the infamous Ararian War, when Aldan had lost its largest ship, the Lyonell. Could it be her? He radioed the other ships in his convoy, and attempted to hail the rogue convoy. \u0022Unknown ships, this is the Aldanese Merchant Navy Cornucopia and her convoy. We mean no harm, we have no weapons, we just want to deliver our supplies to Angvarden to help the civilians in distress. How copy? Over.\u0022 There was a pause, and then the radio crackled again. \u0022This is the former RAV Unconquerable. Drop your anchors and surrender your cargo, and we will not fire upon you.\u0022 Captain Indreve hesitated, thinking about the name. Then he realized-it was the Lyonell! She had been renamed Unconquerable after the war! \u0022Unconquerable, we have no quarrel with yo-\u0022 He didn\u0027t have time to finish his sentence, as he was knocked unconscious by the impact of an 11-inch cannon shell.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
