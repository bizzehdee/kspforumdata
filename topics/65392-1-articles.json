Three out of four worked fine. When I got to adding the fourth segment to the final side, the fuel tanks were going upside down. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the \u0022spheres\u0022 on the end of the girders (that appear when I select the part) were reversed in comparison to the others I was using.

But since 5 is not a symmetry setting in the game, I\u0027m assuming you placed them by hand? In which case, I suspect you somehow placed some of the girders in an inverted orientation without realizing it. Anyway, why not simply rotate the tanks back the way you want them with the WASD keys? Even better, build one stricture the way you want it, then copy/paste it 4 more times. You can copy an assembly by alt-l.click on its root part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
