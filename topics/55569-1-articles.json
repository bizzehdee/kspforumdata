MechJeb is no longer needed. In fact, MechJeb is actually wasteful during docking because it spazzes out your RCS thrusters. So here\u0027s how to do it the \u0022hard\u0022 way. A detailed guide to rendezvous and docking without using MechJeb and with visual aides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday this is the craft we are going to rendezvous with, named Agena in honor of the Gemini missions. I purposely put it in a highly inclined orbit for a wholesome demonstration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AlJJAuL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AlJJAuL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8wO36iw.png\u0022 alt=\u00228wO36iw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 1: Launch Window\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably the most critical thing to the success of rendezvous and docking. It is possible to rendezvous with a ship that is 180 degrees out of phase (on the opposite side of the planet at any given point) but it is significantly harder and requires far more dV. So Launch Window - number 1. Its actually very simple on Kerbin. When your target is in LKO, the launch window is when the target strikes that India-like peninsula on the desert continent West of the KSC. Oh and make sure you launch IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE TARGET. I accidentally launched a craft into the proper plane but going the wrong direction on an Apollo style Duna mission that almost stranded my poor Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nCLSrKC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nCLSrKC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 2: Launch Into an Orbit with a Similar Plane\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogical right? If your target is in polar orbit, you wouldn\u0027t launch into an equatorial orbit. That is what we call stupid. Of course, thanks to the inclination of my target combined with the rotation of Kerbin, rarely can we ever reach exactly the same plane so we\u0027ll just have to make it good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 3: Match Orbital Planes with Target\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the second most critical step to any rendezvous and docking, after the launch window. This will make it so your closest approaches to target are a lot closer. It makes the rest of this process a friggin breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, select the target in the orbital map and click \u0022Set As Target.\u0022 You will see its orbit turn green and a bunch of little bugs and dotted lines will pop up that you probably have no idea what they do. Not to fear. For this step you need only play attention to the green house-shaped bugs labelled \u0022Ascending\u0022 and \u0022Descending\u0022 Nodes. If you drew a line between these two points, it would be where the orbital planes of the target and your active ship cross. It is at these points you want to set a maneuver node to adjust your orbital plane because your orbital plane will rotate around the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/elYf03c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022elYf03c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the node at whichever you will reach first. Drag the purple triangles on the maneuver node adjust the plane. You will notice that your orbital will start to become elliptical. Not to worry; thats normal. Drag the Retrograde bug to compensate. It takes a little finagling because in your new plane, they are not mutually exclusive vectors. Eventually you will achieve a projected orbit that is at the same altitudes but an different inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tZob4z2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tZob4z2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see in the image, our projected orbit is within incalculable difference from the plane of the target because it reads NaN.

The thing is orbital mechanics are a little bit wonky at first glance. Even though I am behind my target, I have to burn Retrograde in order to catch up. If I was ahead of the target I would have to burn Prograde to fall back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3HKtovl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223HKtovl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe explanation is boring and long so just believe me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you see those orange and purple bugs on the Orbit? Those show the location of the target and the active ship at their closest approaches. The best places in the orbit to phase match your target are at these points. Set a maneuver node at the nearest intersection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dooYduq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dooYduq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag the retrograde / prograde vectors until the bugs are almost matched. Fine tune from there. You want your closest approaches to be within 1 kilometer. Typically these maneuvers don\u0027t take more than 50 m/s of dV, so be careful. You have to execute these burns precise to \u002B - 0.05 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qGgYGVP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qGgYGVP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be careful that you don\u0027t sink into the atmosphere.

Remember earlier how I said we can pretty much ignore the orbital map now? All you need now are your eyes, some RCS thrusters, and the purple markings on your Navball.

From here it really is as simple as pointing at your target and thrusting forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use the RCS translation, switch to Docking mode down in the lower left corner.

If you have propellant to spare, you can simply boost into a higher orbit for a one shot rendezvous. The reason this will not always work is because you may be orbiting a moon for instance where the orbit you would need to achieve in order to phase match a target may actually fall outside the SOI of that moon or you simply don\u0027t have the propellant to spare. I\u0027m thinking of missions to Eeloo on that last point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason this may not work is because your vessel may have a low TWR. Keep in mind that the encounter with the target will occur in this case at the periapsis of your orbit, or in other words, where you will be going the fastest. This also means your relative velocity to the target will also be the fastest and I don\u0027t see you killing 100\u002B m/s of dV with a nuclear engine in a reasonable window of the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe patient way to do this is to boost into slightly higher orbit and complete many passes.
