Not sure whether this will become a sidestory in the TNF-verse or the B-plot to the sequel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003EJoenie Kermol took a long swig of her sapwood juice, set the glass down and adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses with a businesslike air. \u0022The word \u0027ambitious\u0027 comes to mind,\u0022 she said in carefully measured tones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003EThe neatly besuited young kerman male smiled faintly. \u0022People said that about the Grove on Duna.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022Duna\u0027s surface was totally sterile; my team couldn\u0027t have had a better controlled growing medium if we\u0027d bought it in bulk from a hydroponics company. Laythe is a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E different problem. Not only are we introducing a Kerm to a foreign ecosystem, which for literally any other form of plantlife on Kerbin would be a massive no-no, we know even less about Laythe\u0027s ecosystem than our ancestors knew about Wakira\u0027s back in the Age of Sail.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022We have a huge array of soil samples.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022Soil samples taken from one fairly small island. Even here on Kerbin you can find ten thousand new species of bacteria or fungus in a soil sample taken from any randomly-chosen square kilometre of land, and then find ten thousand \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E species if you move a single kilometre in any direction, or come back to the exact same spot in a year. The variations will be pretty small, mind you, but any one of them could turn out be another Red Blight or something even worse someday. And again, that\u0027s just on Kerbin. What it might be like on a moon where life evolved totally separately in radically different conditions is difficult to even imagine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022True. But that native life will have no inherited protection against our antibiotics.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022For the time being. And come to think of it, that\u0027s another worry. What happens if Kerm pollen or one of our artificial fertilisers proves to be toxic to native life?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022This is why we came to you,\u0022 the young kerman replied simply. \u0022We\u0027re not a large or well-funded organisation, Dr Joenie. We\u0027ve got plenty of good farmers and a couple of biology graduates, but none of us have any practical experience of establishing Groves even on Kerbin. But without a Grove, we won\u0027t have much of a colony to speak of.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003EJoenie nodded. \u0022Don\u0027t get me wrong, Billick, I support your aims all the way. But it\u0027s difficult to uunderstate what a huge undertaking this is. If any of your organisation were hoping we\u0027d be planting a sapling as soon as we unloaded the orbiter then they\u0027re going to be sadly disappointed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022That\u0027s pretty much what we figured.\u0022 Billick sipped his coffee. \u0022We\u0027re not planning on shipping colonists out for another two years, but we want to send an advance party at the next window in three months. Their job will be to acquire more soil and water samples, expand the existing weather station network and run extensive controlled trials of Kerbin crops in Laythe soil, as well as bolting together some prefabs for the colonists when they get there and other preliminary work.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003EJoenie fished a spiral notepad and pen out of her desk drawer. \u0022That sounds pretty workable, but it\u0027s going to involve a certain amount of equipment. What kind of budget are we talking about?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022Seventeen and a half thousand keros, plus whatever you can coax out of the university. The good news is we already have some of the equipment you\u0027ll need. The KSA had a few spare inflatable agridomes left over from the first wave of Duna colonies, and sold them to us for next to nothing \u0027cause they were just taking up space in storage. They\u0027re not exactly this year\u0027s model but they\u0027re in as-new condition. We also have the use of the old outpost buildings; everything portable was removed when it was mothballed but the lab facilities should still be useable.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022That still leaves most of the lab equipment itself... Hmmm. Give me a day or two to get a list of gear and tally up the price tags, then we\u0027ll have something worth presenting to the grants committee. Am I going to be the only biochemist on the team?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003EBilick smiled. \u0022I take it that\u0027s a yes, then? And I\u0027m not sure yet, but after this meeting I have an appointment with your colleague Dr Wickley from the Duna Grove project. I can guarantee you the services of two good biologists and an experienced hydroponics technician for your staff, though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022Wickley van Grun?\u0022 Joenie raised an eyebrow. \u0022Why the two of us? We were the junior members of the team by quite a margin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022Everyone else either has dependents on Kerbin or jumped straight into a prestigious teaching or research post,\u0022 Billick replied. \u0022Besides, breaking ground on a new settlement is a young kerbal\u0027s game; there\u0027s going to be a good deal of physical labour involved in the early days and the climate isn\u0027t exactly balmy. But for someone young and fit who doesn\u0027t mind getting their hands dirty?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan\u003ETAB\u003C/span\u003E\u0022It\u0027s like Geofley Kerman said. You could have the adventure holiday of a lifetime down there.\u0022 Joenie finally cracked a smile. \u0022Count me in!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T12:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, given the inspiration for this story snippet, I can\u0027t claim to be even remotely neutral here but in the words of Hanfrod at KSC - \u0022You know what?
