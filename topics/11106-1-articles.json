It has a fairly similar, but more complicated(Due to complications) system, is connected to Kerbin but no longer takes place on Kerbin, and is much more open and free to war and discussion, as the members that created it felt more freedom and less admin interference was required. We still need to clamp down sometimes, however.\n\nWe have live, animated battles simulated in Battleships Forever(A free game where you can customize ships and put them in battle), recorded, and posted onto youtube so you can view your battles as if watching from a probe nearby.\n\nCurrently unorganized as the preboot RP was, but you can help to organize it but PMing your suggestions to admins. Please try not to be angry at us however, as we are very stressed over the amount of work we are expected to do in a short time.\n\n[http://ksprp.forumotion.com/](http://ksprp.forumotion.com/)\n\nPlease give feedback and suggestions."},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T06:41:34Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m not sure you have permission to use that big KSP header."},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T13:58:28Z","Content":"Which forum type are you guys using?\n\nI plan to make one myself, and am interested in Invision, but I want to hear your ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"Grove","CreatedById":5188,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T14:47:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Which forum type are you guys using?\n\u003E \n\u003E I plan to make one myself, and am interested in Invision, but I want to hear your ideas.\n\nDon\\\u0027t, forumotion is the best."},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T14:55:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\\\u0027t, forumotion is the best.\n\nI\\\u0027m using forumotion, I just don\\\u0027t know which version to use."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T16:16:03Z","Content":"I\\\u0027d like to echo Ascensiam\\\u0027s statement, you shouldn\\\u0027t be using that logo like that on the masthead.
