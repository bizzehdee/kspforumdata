Not just with KSP but with gaming in general. I\u0027m retired and have no interest in playing World of Warcraft or some racing game. Before I started KSP I mostly played backgammon! Yes, you may giggle. Anyway I\u0027ve got a few\u00A0questions I hope you guys can help me with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I haven\u0027t played in a few weeks and I just got around to installing version 1.1.3 Do I delete the older version? I think I red it somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. In my account (I bought straight from the store) there was/is beside KSP 1.1.3 also KSP installer. What do I use that for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. When I first\u00A0installed it a few months ago, I copied \u00A0a Kerbal figure\u00A0from within the KSP_win file to the desktop and it worked fine. There are however 3 of those. KSP, KSP_x64 and Launcher\u00A0and as far as I can tell when I open them I get the game. They are different sized. Can somebody enlighten me? Or maybe I actually should do it different, I don\u0027t know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have hesitated to ask these questions if it was n\u0027t for the fact that I\u0027ve noticed other new players got treated very nice here. So, thanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T15:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello dutchy45 and welcome to the KSP forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Many players keep old versions around.\u00A0 When I unzip a new version onto my hard drive, I rename the folder to KSP_win_1.1.3 for example.\u00A0 This allows me to keep all the versions on my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 That is simply an alternative method of downloading and installing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 The Launcher isn\u0027t necessary (I never use it).\u00A0 The other two are the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of KSP.\u00A0 If you want to run many (memory heavy) mods when playing KSP, you should choose the 64-bit version.\u00A0 Otherwise you are probably better off using the 32-bit version (the one just called KSP.exe).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T22:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome Dutchy45, from another retired old person!
