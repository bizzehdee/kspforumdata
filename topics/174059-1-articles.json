One issue I\u0027m facing, however, is that I want the player to be able to attach things to the surface, but the surface of the part is irregular. KSP doesn\u0027t seem to like this. I\u0027m attaching a screenshot with a radial solar panel just to show you what I mean. As you can see, the solar panel is just kind of awkwardly floating despite being \u0022attached\u0022. My question is: is there a way to make the radial attachment fit more closely to the surface of the part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/J5vW2eD.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/J5vW2eD.png\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T18:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi the problem is not the attaching part,\u00A0 you can only attach\u00A0 to a collider , and by the looks of it that cylinder part has a unity applied convex mesh collider ,\u00A0 and that is what the solar panel is attaching to.\u00A0 This fills out any concave areas, and leaves parts hovering above the apparent model surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution other than using the offset tool to make it look nicer,\u00A0 is to make a better collider for the cylinder part, as anything you do to change the mounting of the solar panel, which is correct as it is, will make it a poor for for every other part\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zyrac","CreatedById":50037,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T18:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223357844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524076572\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250907\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi the problem is not the attaching part,\u00A0 you can only attach\u00A0 to a collider , and by the looks of it that cylinder part has a unity applied convex mesh collider ,\u00A0 and that is what the solar panel is attaching to.\u00A0 This fills out any concave areas, and leaves parts hovering above the apparent model surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution other than using the offset tool to make it look nicer,\u00A0 is to make a better collider for the cylinder part, as anything you do to change the mounting of the solar panel, which is correct as it is, will make it a poor for for every other part\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, I thought it might be that.
