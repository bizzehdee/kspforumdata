I started with paint (God help us all) and now I have moved on to Artweaver3.0 Free and liking the artistic styles I can apply with that, though as you would expect I still need practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question I wanted to ask is are there any art packages out there that have an array of geometry and measurement tools? The reason I ask it becuase I want to place rivets equally across a part and have seams placed across the craft. Whilst I mentioning this, can KSP take Normal Maps yet, or is the feature still deactivated?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dt890","CreatedById":8704,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T19:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen building your uv map try to unwrap so that its only straight lines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso that every surface is rectangular straight 90\u00C2\u00B0 angles or as close as possible.(this excludes circles) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit is a hard process that needs you to cut the shapes using mark seam. \u0026lt;--- this need you to have blender as 3d modeling program.

You just want to make better textures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, here are a couple suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGIMP: Basically free photoshop, big learning curve. Best for improving images rather than creating them, like Photoshop, but you can still make some pretty cool stuff from scratch. My avatar was made entirely in GIMP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epaint.NET: Sort of a mix between Microsoft paint and GIMP, but you aren\\\u0027t going to make anything spectacular with this. Slight learning curve, but pretty simple. Good for making simple textures and then improving them with an image manipulation tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
