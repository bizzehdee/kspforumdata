As I approach any new situation, I observe all of my science expiraments. Any that yield useful science, I hit over and over, until the yield is low enough to stop(or flying is eventful itself). I usually draw the line at .4 units of science. I can have missions that yield 2000 units of science... it keeps going up as I add devices to my science platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI group the equipment so that it is convenient to keep clicking. Also, for manned missions, your men can contribute crew reports, eva reports, and surface samples. Keep working your crew and your equipment until the science gains are no longer worth the effort. But be aware that the science yield can increase whenever conditions change. So check on your equipment often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that each transmission requires quite a bit of power, so plan for renewable power as soon as you have it, and plan for backups. If you start driving with a solar panel open, it will shatter. That could end your mission if you have no contingency. I put small fixed panels on convenient surfaces, have a couple folding panels tucked in good places, and also pack several different kinds of rechargable batteries in different locations. When you roll your rover, or hit a good size bump, you will loose some components. Your spares will keep the mission alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have found that having multiple goo containers and thermometers doesn\u0027t seem to help, but it may be a sequencing thing. I\u0027ll try not transmitting until I read the high-point data and see if that does anything. I have noticed that they tend to be a fixed percentage yield, so if you were promised 70 points, but you had 10 of them before you transmitted, I don\u0027t know if your yield is discounted more than the standard 40%, but I\u0027m sure KerbMav knows what he\u0027s talking about... I have carried spare science equipment, but my sequencing was different, I transmitted after each read, so I didn\u0027t get a chance to observe what Kerb did. If you have the room for spare science gear, it doesn\u0027t hurt to have it along. If it helps you get your science readings faster, such as during a aerobraking maneuver, where time is limited, then having a bunch of experiments lined up for a sequence of quick reads for later transmission makes a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get 100% science credit for returning your science home, but you can gather 400 times more science if you transmit it each time you gather it, at a much lower rate of return (usually around 40%). So you can observe your goo, come home and get 70 points. Or you can fly around into 10 different situations, and read the goo 15 times in each situation, only get 40% credit for your observations, and come back with 2000 points. You decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good mission is to make a close pass to every moon of Jool, running the heck out of your science as you do, then land on Laythe. The goo gets points rich every time you are near something new or are doing anything new. So don\u0027t forget to check it often. Same is true for the other gadgets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m ready to try and feed the kracken some goo, I bet the goo scores some points then....
