This is the Titan. This guy is 2194.1 tons... It honestly frightens me.

It actually didn\u0027t blow up. Also this is the first test flight of it**\n\n![vDDPv8R.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vDDPv8R.jpg)\n\n**This is dropping off the first stage (It is three internal Boosters)**\n\n![pEBxnx3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pEBxnx3.jpg)\n\n**Dropping off the Main stage, it did the main bulk lifting**\n\n![X4KBXcJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X4KBXcJ.jpg)\n\n**It is at this point that i begin to believe. WILL IT WORK?!**\n\n![paxXh4x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/paxXh4x.jpg)\n\n**BOOM! As i decoupled the previous stage it blew up behind me. Worried that i had damaged the ship i frantically look around it. Luckily the boom was just parts from the previous stage**\n\n![AsPNcn3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AsPNcn3.jpg)\n\n**The ships Interplanetary Section**\n\n![XCfm9z1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XCfm9z1.jpg)\n\n**this stage has about 7700 delta V if i calculated it properly and im pretty sure Jeb likes it.**"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:59:55Z","Content":"Good.
