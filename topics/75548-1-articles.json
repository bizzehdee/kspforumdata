Seriously running out of hair. Starting to drool a little and dream of meshes. Meshes that don\u0027t work and result in crazy crazy stuff from KSP\u0027s physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the secret here? I\u0027m missing something fundamental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I get that a collision mesh has to be convex. How the hell is that even possible? I\u0027m making buildings. I need ramps and bezels/bevels(?). How exactly do I avoid concavity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m currently using multiple meshes applied in Unity to a model. Obviously, when using convex, this will result in some crazy meshes that don\u0027t fit a particular part of the model. Because there\u0027s concavity. How the hell do you have a ramp or a bezel/bevel without it? I\u0027ve tried splitting faces, I\u0027ve tried this, I\u0027ve tried that. And the other. I\u0027m drooling again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I keep seeing \u0022use a single mesh for collision set to convex\u0022 or some such. Wait what really? But I have concavity in my model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help/guidance/links on this crazy collision mesh insanity welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T11:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou forgot one gigantic point: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebuildings ARE NOT parts\u003C/span\u003E !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use convex collider with all of buildings I\u0027ve made*, no issue from now, they behave exactly like stock buildings and terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at my stunt ring, no convex collider, plane or anything can go through it, but crash on the \u0022walls\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want convex collider: split split split and split !
