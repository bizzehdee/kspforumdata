I was told you\u0027re interested in those sorts of things! For your convenience, I\u0027ll mention the mods I made these with and which aerodynamics they work under. If you see weapons they\u0027re from Bahamut\u0027s BDArmory mod. Also, I use [B-9 Procedural Wings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Procedural-Parts-0-33-Updated-07-02-15) as opposed to normal [Procedural Wings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29862-0-90-Procedural-Dynamics-Procedural-Wing-0-9-3-Dec-24) because I couldn\u0027t figure out how the latter works.\n\nLooking back, I used the B-9 engines a lot where it might have been easier to use TweakScale and stock engines. Hindsight is 20/20, after all.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Because some people don\u0027t know this, the Firespitter mod **can** still work. Get rid of the old, conflicting firespitter.dll plugin because the newest one is backwards compatible. Bac9 maintains the Firespitter plugin as part of the B-9 mod.\n\nEDIT: Craft now available at [KerbalX](http://kerbalx.com/MooseCannon/craft)!\n\nA-4\n\nKicking it old school with a Vietnam era US carrier-capable attack plane, the A-4! Notable for being able to lift nearly its own takeoff weight in munitions and lasting nearly 50 years in service. Mods: B-9 (engine, airframe spine made from engine mount) and Firespitter (airframe, wing tips). Designed for stock aerodynamics.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Notable for being able to cut tanks in half with its gatling gun, and eating AA missiles to the face without a care in the world. Mods: Firespitter (airframe) and B-9 (engines, tail). Designed for stock aerodynamics.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

As a result, it\u0027s completely unexportable because they\u0027d all have to agree on something. Mods: lots of B-9. Designed for stock aerodynamics.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/ZMXsT)\n\nF-14 Tomcat\n\nA legendary figure in the fighter community, despite only splashing four bandits while flying American colors, the Tomcat was *the* supreme carrier-launched fighter for years. I actually have two versions of this plane: stock and FAR/IR. \n\nStock Aerodynamics\n\nMy first pass at this amazing plane. Aesthetically pretty nice, but I made a few mistakes on the bottom of the airframe and the wings didn\u0027t actuate. Mods used: B-9 for nose, intakes, and air brakes; Firespitter for the engines.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/I21Zo)\n\nFAR and IR\n\nThis version has actuating swing wings. FAR actually models how that changes the aerodynamics! Mods used: Infernal Robotics for rotating wings; B-9 Procedural Wings; B-9 air intakes and nose; Tweakscale; Firespitter engines; and those grey blisters on the bottom are from Mysterious Falcon mod; see the F-16. Funny aside: if your craft breaks up, and your new root part started tweaked, it will revert to its original size.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/eEbNd)\n\nF-15 Eagle\n\nThe undisputed king of the 4th generation of fighters with a 104-0 record, the Eagle (along with the Tomcat) was derived from the lessons learned in the F-4: while you gotta go fast, you also gotta *turn* fast. This version uses the mods B-9 and Firespitter, in much the same capacities as the other planes. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/LDO76)\n\nF-16 Fighting Falcon\n\nThe most efficient modern fighter in the NATO arsenal, the F-16 is one of the most iconic planes of all time, and does just about everything. I\u0027ve made three different version of it: the first two use B-9 and Firespitter, while the latter is the [Falcon Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29932-Mysterious-Projects-Falcon-IVA-HUD), better showcased by Nazari. But I will too. So there. The homebrew variants are designed for stock aerodynamics, while the Mysterious variant works in both.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/4WYVn)\n\nF/A-18E/F Super Hornet\n\nLike the USAF with the F-16, the USN realized that having the best plane in the world was expensive, so they made the F/A-18. Then they retired the F-14, so they decided that they wanted the best plane again. Uses B-9 and Firespitter like usual, and the wings are B-9 Procedural Wings, allowing for the nice tooth where in the real plane you\u0027d have the folding wings. Design for FAR\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/6parF)\n\nSR-71 Blackbird\n\nThe fastest air-breathing plane to date, the Blackbird *was* American surveillance before we had satellites. [1] It\u0027s famous for basically being a spaceship, and for being too fast for planes to intercept and radars to hold a lock. [2] On the rare occasion that it was successfully shot at, it simply *outran* the missiles. This version uses B-9 and B-9 Procedural Wings, and is designed for FAR.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/gNEkD)\n\n[1] Also the U2 and a few others, but they\u0027re not nearly as .....\n\n[2] Except by Swedish Viggens somehow.\n\nDassault Mirage\n\nThe hugely popular French fighter family, the Mirage is a very iconic Cold War fighter plane. This version is most closely based on the Mirage 5. Mods are B-9 and Firespitter as usual, and the planes are designed for stock aerodynamics.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/C9Idh)\n\nF-35 Lightning II\n\nThe most controversial, high-tech, high-cost fighter of the 21st century. Less the stealthy supersonic VTOL jack-of-all-trades we were promised, it\u0027s more like the seven-of-all-trades: sort stealthy, sorta fast, sorta agile. The F-35 is the plane we all wanted to be good. If only it had two engines then maybe it could climb well. This uses the B-9 and B-9 Procedural Wing mods, as well as Infernal Robotics to make the engine rotate down. The cockpit is the [B-9 Mk2 Lightning Cockpit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96766-Mk2-Lightning-Cockpit-for-B9-Aerospace-v1-3-%28FAR-drag-fixed%29) by BD. This plane is *designed* for FAR, but like the real thing the design expectations and product don\u0027t strictly agree.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/pHCbH)\n\nAV-8B Harrier\n\nThe first VTOL to make it into common use, the Harrier is as iconic of British air power as any plane. One of the very few planes imported to America, the subsonic VTOL joins the F-22 as the conceptual parents of the F-35. This plane uses B-9, B-9 Procedural Wings, Firespitter, Infernal Robotics motors and KAX VTOL engines to be able to switch from vertical to forward flight and back.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/U77tV)\n\n\u0027Teen Series\u0027 Group Shots\n\nF-14, F-15, F-16, and F-18 from my 0.24 stock build. They\u0027re probably bffs or something.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/WDy2z)\n\nThose are all the planes accessible in my current KSP builds. I have a few other planes (offhand I can think of the A-6, Mig 21, Mig 27, Mig 29, and F-111) that I have in older, archived builds. If you all seem interested I\u0027ll go back and document them, too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T17:21:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MooseCannon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T22:45:58Z","Content":"**BEAUTIFUL**\n\n**AMAZING**\n\n**SPECTACULAR**\n\n**GENIUS**\n\n![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\netc...\n\n\u002Brep\n\nWow, just wow.\n\nHave you considered AJE support?
