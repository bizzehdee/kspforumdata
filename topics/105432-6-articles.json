Everything will get fixed, and it probably won\u0027t be long. Honestly, since the manual fix is out for the heatshields, the only thing that is totally broken right now as far as I\u0027m concerned is the parachute. I can just pretend those working by only deploying them after re-entry heat is over with, since by then I know I made it anyway. I do think that 1.1 will be more like the version we\u0027ve all been excited for. I can only imagine how much work went into a game like KSP, and I\u0027d be hard pressed to think of a game I enjoy more than this one. Not everything is always exactly the way we like it.
