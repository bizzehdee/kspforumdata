A Stayputnik, a little batt or two, a stick-on solar panel, a piece or two of structural fuselage, a Wheesley engine and bush-plane landing gear will do (maybe also a radial chute). You put that together and park a pair of them on either end of the runway (just off the sloped bit - it\u0027s important to get them as well-aligned with the center of the strip as you can manage and off the sloped bit if you don\u0027t want the game to try and get rid of them_). When you get them in position, set the brakes and then re-class them as bases. They make handy markers for figuring out where KSC is - and as bases, you can see them from a 100 kilometer orbit pretty easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, when your little end-of-runway-devices are in place and you\u0027re out flying and getting ready to land, note the distance to the closest marker. Multiply that distance times 100 and add 100 to that result - the final number is roughly where you want your altimeter to read, plus or minus 200 meters. More than that and you\u0027re too high, less than that and you\u0027re too low. You can also use the markers to align yourself longitudinally with the runway; a third marker a kilometer from the land-ward end of the runway helps with that aspect of the landing. When you\u0027re within about ten kilometers or so, quicksave (always important in case you botch it), kill your throttle (or get it down to one notch, tops) and lower your gear. Airbrakes will help here if your speed is...say, above 150 m/s or so (in your case, I might recommend 100 m/s, or not much more than the minimum speed at which your plane takes off). You want to be descending at a rate not much more than five meters per second when you make contact with the Runway; much faster than that and you risk collapsing your gear - which I\u0027d wager is what\u0027s happening after you bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T16:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, airplanes in KSP usually handle *weird*.

Before takeoff, note the natural pitch of the aircraft on the runway and remember it, it will be your minimum pitch up during landing, preferably you\u0027ll land pitched up 3-5 degrees more than the minimum pitch since you don\u0027t want to land on the nose wheel. Next, in flight, play with the throttle and airspeed but stay clear of stall speed. Note how the aircraft will lose altitude when you throttle down, unless you compensate by pitching up. Use throttle as your main control for the descent rate during finals, with the nose pitched up a few degrees up from your minimum pitch, ease up carefully on the throttle and the plane should descend nicely. If you drop too quickly, throttle up a tad, if you don\u0027t sink fast enough, ease up carefully on the throttle and let the engine settle on the new rpm. Use throttle, not W or S to control the descent. If you have a good line-up to the runway (I normally line up from 5 to 10 km out), use yaw to fine adjust the heading, only use bank turn if you\u0027re way off and have high enough speed. As you approach the edge of the runway a few meters above ground, close the throttle all the way and do a very careful and smooth flare to bleed off speed but don\u0027t overdo it so you climb. Watch the VSI needle. If you bounce, the speed is too great or you\u0027re too aggressive on the S key. As the speed drops, keep the nose wheel up and land on the main wheels. At this point you should be near stall speed. Let the nose drop on its own while you engage the brakes. Of course, design matters and some designs have a very high stall speed but most designs that are flyable should have an at least semi-sane stall speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T18:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starhawk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starhawk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should probably start with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis excellent tutorial\u003C/a\u003E.

It\u0027s like buying expensive pencils to draw with - if you learn to draw, the difference between a cheap pencil and an expensive one isn\u0027t crippling, and if you learn to plane, not having a joystick on hand shouldn\u0027t ruin it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of landing: 70-80 m/s is kinda fast, especially for a small one-seater. Try for 50-60, or under 50 if you can, and try to keep your vertical speed above -10, because while the wheels can roll really fast, they don\u0027t generally handle slamming into the ground too well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T18:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, yeah, I can fly fine with a keyboard too, I just recommend a joystick because the game got more enjoyable to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, flying is a little hard for some people, landing especially so. If you are really struggling to land, experiment using a braking parachute. Some suggested landing completely on parachutes, but that can be dangerous and require lots of them if your plane is big. If you use one on the tail just as you touch down, the drag is going to be so high that you will DEFINITELY stay on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used that in my recon/survey plane to land on rough terrain, it stopped very quickly and allowed for very safe landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T03:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose wings look like overkill, you could definitely get away with making them a good deal smaller, so that your plane can space\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
