You could also take a role playing game (think Traveller, D\u0026amp;D, etc) route. Make AI pilots a thing (player can always take over). Yes, like mechjeb, basically, only just Jeb, himself, and he;s already in the capsule. Whenever there is a task that requires the pilot, the game, well, rolls some dice. The skill level determines how well (within some random range) the task is completed. The rocket physics is entirely unchanged. So a burn is scheduled at T\u002B37 minutes, 23 seconds. The burn is 100% power for 17 seconds. The ship is to be pointed at 122 degrees, no inclination. The game would take this event, and based on the pilot skill the burn should take place around T\u002B37\u0027 15\u0022 (really 15.5). It might take place a couple seconds late, and the burn might go long. In the latter case, Jeb might chase the marker and correct (goal always to make the burn have a green check).

I don\u0027t think pilots should (or even could) affect the maximum thrust or ISP of an engine mid-flight just by being more experienced.

So...how about a sort-of tech-tree for Kerbals? They start out as recruits, with very basic skills, and as they gain experience you can train them to have specific specializations. 2nd tier trainees might be a Scientist, Celebrity, or Engineer (can positively affect the launch and recovery costs). 3rd tier scientists could specialize in orbital or surface science; 3rd tier engineers split into rocket or spaceplane specialization; 3rd tier celebs get MUCH higher rep but also severe penalties if they die or fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and Pilots. Pilots should also be a \u0027class\u0027. Instead of altering the physics of the game with magic boosts though, Kerbal Pilots could do things like execute maneuver nodes. 2nd tier pilots can only do in-SOI maneuvers. 3rd tier pilots can execute Planet-Moon transfers. Final tier they could execute interplanetary maneuvers. Maybe you could even have specializations for rockets and spaceplanes, or rover pilots even....point being, that there are ways to utilize Kerbals\u0027 experience without resorting to ridiculous RPG magic buffs (and this thread proves it isn\u0027t popular anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I doubt the system will change greatly from the way they are developing it now, so this suggestion could be entirely pointless.

Well... I\u0027d really hate to use this word, but it seems lazy to me. There are so many doable ideas that would utilize kerbals, fit in with the overarching gameplay, and be a faithful representation of crew experience, but those ideas would undoubtedly require some serious development effort be put into them. Meanwhile, the feature as it is proposed now seems clunky, tacked on, not particularly useful either way, and must I remind everyone that rockets do not work that way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know it\u0027s an abstraction, and perhaps there is a little green man inside the command pod pushing some buttons that don\u0027t need to be pushed or vice versa, but let\u0027s be honest. Would the game really be able to communicate that clearly at a glance? Players shouldn\u0027t be forced to construct elaborate headcanon to explain deviations from expected behavior on something so basic as ISP or thrust. And if the feature is indeed as subtle as Maxmaps is making it seem, is it really worth having?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve mentioned, there are a plurality of great ideas for how crew experience could be implemented. I personally like the limited autopilot idea. If it could be made to work on out of focus vessels, it solves a number of problems with a single swing: it means that experienced players don\u0027t need to endlessly repeat dull tasks that they\u0027ve done a thousand times before (such as executing maneuver nodes); it allows players to fly multiple missions at once without panicking about missing a maneuver node (because the crew had got it under control); it finally gives crewed vessels a distinct use besides treating kerbals as mobile science generators (if you give uncrewed vessels the ability to generate science, there will actually be an incentive to send crews!); and it would allow for Maxmaps to implement the crew ability affecting rocket performance that he wants without having to create an elaborate headcanon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think we all know where my vote went.
