The first of these is choosing the right engine, I am currently experimenting with Aerospikes and they seem to work well, but does anyone know if I should be using something else. Secondly the ascent profile, most spaceplane ascent profiles are created expecting you to use jet engines for the early stages, however as I can\u0027t use jets I\u0027m struggling to work out the optimum. A 50 degree climb seems to work well, but should I stay low and then try to climb almost vertically?

Karbonite allows getting fuel out of the atmosphere as you\u0027re flying through it, at least on some planets. If this works in Eve\u0027s air, AND if the Karbonite-burning jet engines have the right combination of stats, AND you design the whole thing carefully to take advantage of this, then a Karbonite SSTO Eve spaceplane might be possible. Being able to refuel during flight would reduce the amount of mass you need to start with, which is the main problem with leaving Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intend to test this out this weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-15T13:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2014 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by smart013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T15:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smart013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smart013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn my new careermod with deadly reentry there may be new issues to be overcome, but with interstellar eve is yours \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I guess I knew that, I just never think about KSPI because I don\u0027t use it myself these days. I appreciate it as a fine example of the higher levels of the modding art but after giving it a fair trial, I decided it just doesn\u0027t suit my personal tastes. With KSPI, ever imaginable spacetravel feat eventually becomes not only possible but largely trivial. That outcome is of course the whole point of developing god-like powers, but I prefer to wrestle with difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m hoping for with Karbonite is that with some clever tinkering and careful flying, I can just barely beat Eve within certain limited parameters.

I\u0027m not going to get into an argument about the aerodynamic model though, I\u0027ll just wish you good luck. Yes, you\u0027re maximising your atmospheric performance but in every other way you\u0027re making things worse for yourself. Slower climb, higher drag, higher gravity, lower Isp; ir would be a strange profile that turned that into a fuel-efficient ascent.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe potential benefit of wings comes from requiring less engine thrust, and thus less mass and drag from those engines. If you can replace a ton of engine with less than a ton of wing that\u0027s where your gains can come from. Whether that\u0027s enough to overcome the impact of staying lower for longer is another matter.\u003Cp\u003EAm I right in recalling that in stock wings also have less regular drag for their mass, but have an additional drag component associated with their lift generation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
