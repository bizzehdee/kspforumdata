All the material on the web says you shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exceed ~200m/s in the lower atmosphere (e.g. until ~10km). I spent a couple days trying to test this, using very basic rockets and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstraight up\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 trajectories to compare. Surprisingly, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m getting consistently better results when I burn more fuel earlier, even if it results in high speeds and strongly visible atmospheric effects. It\u0027s leading me to the conclusion that as long as your rocket is aerodynamic, burning off mass faster trumps any negative drag effects (and the importance of controlling ascent velocities is overrated).\n\ne.g. For this rocket:\n\nMk16 Parachute\n\nMk1 Command Module\n\nSC-9001 Science Jr.\n\nRT-10 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHammer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Solid Fuel Booster\n\n3x Delta-Delux Winglet\n\nTweaked to 100% thrust: Reaches 200m/s at ~600m, runs out of fuel at 10km (going 1000m/s), reaches altitude 70.3km\n\nTweaked to 49% thrust: Reaches 200m/s at ~1.6km, runs out of fuel at 17.1km (going 897m/s), reaches altitude 61.7km\n\nThis seemed to be the case for my liquid fueled rockets as well. I found myself actually sabotaging my rocket\u0027s sleekness to TRY and replicate some drag effects, and they didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really seem to kick in until I had fairly unaerodynamic constructions (e.g. 3 science juniors radially mounted with flat surfaces up).\n\nIs it just me? Am I doing something wrong? Or is this something that will become a bigger issue later in the game when I have more complex rockets with more leading surface area?\n\nI think this guy is seeing similar results:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34ap9m/optimal_ascent_profile_for_v10/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34ap9m/optimal_ascent_profile_for_v10/)\n\nI know Squad reduced drag effects in v1.0.3. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering if they may have nerfed it a little too much...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T23:44:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fwiffo**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T19:08:01Z","Content":"All the material on the web that tells you not to exceed 200 m/s while low in the atmosphere is for 0.90 and older, and no longer applies.\n\nMuch like in real life, rockets now do not generally hit terminal velocity going up, even when they accelerate really hard. The Atlas V that launched New Horizons, for instance, held between 4 and 5 g for the entire first stage burn despite its giant payload fairing encapsulating the whole two upper stages, and I suspect the only reason it even throttled to keep it in that range was because the payload (or the upper stages, or both) wasn\u0027t rated for more. The Saturn V, similarly, only switched off its center engine midway through the first stage burn to make the acceleration less crushing for the astronauts on board, not because of aerodynamics. For something shaped like a needle, atmospheric drag is pretty much irrelevant in most scenarios. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Case in point: there are military anti-missile rockets that accelerate at 100g off the \u0027pad\u0027 (launch tube). They glow white-hot within a few seconds of launch but still keep going, \u0027cause they need to get to that enemy ICBM before that reaches its target, at all costs!\n\nIn KSP, even half the acceleration of an Atlas V class rocket feels insane because you get reentry effects going up, but that\u0027s only because KSP generates reentry effects at artificially low speeds. A real life capsule reentering at 2 km/ wouldn\u0027t even produce a visible glow, much less a giant plasma trail. So now you have a halfway realistic atmosphere in KSP and can accelerate really hard, but you also have utterly unrealistic reentry effect behavior, because the planets are all so tiny and orbital speeds are all so low. It\u0027s not optimal, but it\u0027s better than no reentry effects at all, right? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T19:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T19:10:12Z","Content":"A lot of the info on the web for KSP is out of date as the aerodynamics model changed significantly a couple of patches ago.

Here\u0027s an arbitrary example of a ship I\u0027m designing as a fuel tanker (i.e. get a full orange fuel tank up to orbit). It\u0027s not particularly aerodynamic (although it\u0027s not a total flying brick, either). The best straight-up altitude I can get is ~1.8 million km, by thrusting 100% until I run out of fuel. If anyone can pilot this thing in a more efficient manner, and gain higher altitude by working the throttle more proactively, please let me know!\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1056718/Kerbal/Tanker1.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1056718/Kerbal/Tanker1.craft)\n\nI\u0027d be really keen on hearing others\u0027 opinions on this:\n\n**Since 1.0.4, have you created any rocket designs where a slower ascent yields better fuel efficiency?**\n\nThis has not been the case for any of the rockets I\u0027ve designed so far over the natural course of career-mode gameplay. The *only* reason I\u0027ve ever had to go slower than Mach, was to maintain stability benefits from my control surfaces (i.e. prevent tipping over). And that\u0027s been a dubious one in any case, since careful piloting (i.e. slower gravity turn) usually does the trick, allowing me to maintain full throttle and making better use of my fuel. So far, the only time drag has had any impact on my rocket piloting is with contrived designs that are purposely un-aerodynamic.\n\nI did find some drag sliders in the Debug window.
