The Atlas V that launched New Horizons, for instance, held between 4 and 5 g for the entire first stage burn despite its giant payload fairing encapsulating the whole two upper stages, and I suspect the only reason it even throttled to keep it in that range was because the payload (or the upper stages, or both) wasn\u0027t rated for more. The Saturn V, similarly, only switched off its center engine midway through the first stage burn to make the acceleration less crushing for the astronauts on board, not because of aerodynamics. For something shaped like a needle, atmospheric drag is pretty much irrelevant in most scenarios. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Case in point: there are military anti-missile rockets that accelerate at 100g off the \u0027pad\u0027 (launch tube).

A real life capsule reentering at 2 km/ wouldn\u0027t even produce a visible glow, much less a giant plasma trail. So now you have a halfway realistic atmosphere in KSP and can accelerate really hard, but you also have utterly unrealistic reentry effect behavior, because the planets are all so tiny and orbital speeds are all so low. It\u0027s not optimal, but it\u0027s better than no reentry effects at all, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T19:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T19:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the info on the web for KSP is out of date as the aerodynamics model changed significantly a couple of patches ago.
