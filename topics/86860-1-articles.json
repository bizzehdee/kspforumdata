There is a mod under development right now, called Kopernicus, which is designed to replace Planet Factory, however it is still under heavy development. As for the Real Solar system mod, I am not sure, as I don\u0027t use it myself, but I don\u0027t think it takes up much more memory than Planet Factory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T02:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, Kopernicus works enough you can play with it and make some planets, and with RSS to edit the PQSMods you can then make the planet into what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T03:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh! Well, that\u0027s news to me..... Last I checked it was still in the \u0022Download if you Dare\u0022 phase. Anyways, what I meant was that none of the planet mods support it yet.
