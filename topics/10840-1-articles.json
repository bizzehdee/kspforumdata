They called it the *Ibis*. It was compact, compared to the *Kestrel*, it was lighter than the *Kestrel*, it was more controllable in atmosphere than the *Kestrel* and it was an all-round badass spaceplane. However, all of them have since been decommisioned, destroyed through mission failure, or destroyed by Atlaniego\\\u0027s sodding nukes.\n\nWell, it\\\u0027s time for Round 2.\n\nVA\\\u0027s new *Ibis* has a similar design to the previous incarnation, but utilises the latest technology and engineering techniques. It\\\u0027s landing gear has moving wheels, which are also retractable, it\\\u0027s engines include both space and atmospheric to allow for greater maneuvrability in atmosphere [and so it doesn\\\u0027t have to rely on a single sodding-great-big-twin-bell-engine. It has ASAS, unlike its predecessor, and it also has the latest in Veto Aerospace\\\u0027s badass styling, which gives it a similar look to a jet fighter.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Takeoff.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![soIpN.png](http://i.imgur.com/soIpN.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![FGa08.png](http://i.imgur.com/FGa08.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E It was wheelying like this for a full 40 seconds.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![KCY5O.png](http://i.imgur.com/KCY5O.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally getting the bird down.
