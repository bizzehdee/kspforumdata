This is the golden rule of building a model or a simulation in science. Model the stuff you need, control the stuff you don\u0027t. I work on modeling human-robot interaction. We have models that treat the human as a big sack of potatoes (which is useful when looking at \u0027out of bandwidth\u0027 behaviors) - that\u0027s easy, treat them like a m, spring, and damper. Done. We have models that treat the human as a sort-of intelligent potato; these are good for modeling how the person behaves when you throw different, yet in the same neighborhood challenges to them.

Did you cared to read the list ? I\u0027ll assume you did at this point, so you probably noticed that a lot of his requests were made with the propose of making the game more educational ( as the game is touted to be ... you probably know about KerbalEdu ), not to add necessarily more realism ... besides the fact that teaching lies is not educational, that is. Being myself tutoring some 16 yr old kids in Physics at this moment, I cannot stress enough the fact that the current game is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E suitable to teach anything about physics as soon as you enter a atmosphere to kids at that point of their learning ( orbits are ok, since the gravity is modeled in a good enough way and you can do some interesting things regarding sat orbital planning and circular movements in general ) ... even ground movement is strangely non-physical ( just try to make a inclined path to demonstrate vectorial decomposition of forces, just to see that in some places in Kerbin gravity pushes sideways :/ ). I definitely do not want to teach to those kids that air drag is akin to a force field and is independent of the orientation of the object, just for a example \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your argument of models, well, models should have certain thresholds of reality mimicking to be considered competent and those levels are defined by the model maker. So let\u0027s see a certain area of the game ( the one people bicker around more, TBH ): aerodynamics. If you ever read the text that describes nosecones, you\u0027ll see that they are supposed to help reduce drag effects on rockets, so you have a statement of the model maker that his model is supposed to make nosecones reduce drag related kinetic energy losses. Despite that, when you use them in the context of the modeled aerodynamics of the game, they actually increase drag losses. So this model is not compliant with the stated goals of the model maker ( thus in any sane environment you would either ( or both ) make a better model or lower your expectations ). Note that is is not saying that you need a model that takes in account heat dissipation dynamics and van der Walls corrections, just a model that makes nosecones useful \u003Cem\u003Eas per the model maker stated wish\u003C/em\u003E. Same would apply to other parts of the game, BTW ( like deadly reentry, as stated in the MK1 can text ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the \u0022 people needing to go to the forums or the wiki\u0022 issue: well, like Sky_walker says above, that is a issue of the game UI more than anything else .. and of the somewhat ... err ... confusing ( IMHO ) position devs have about the value of self discovery and learning by error and explosions ( while at the same time putting stuff in the shelf just because they are supposedly grindy ... sigh ). In other words, if the devs don\u0027t want to show numbers or initiate the players in the physics behind the game mechanics ( to fulfill their self-learnt and leant by error philosophy ), you won\u0027t learn that via the game, period ( at best you get a fuzzy understanding due to experience ).
