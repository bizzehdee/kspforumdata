The Ares V is a two stage to orbit, with two SRB\u0027s which are dropped when expended during the first stage powered ascent. The second stage (Earth Departure Stage - EDS) delivered the mission to Duna, established Duna orbit, and provided the first push from Duna back to Kerbin. The engine on the KP-1 command module finalized Kerbin intercept.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm, were we meant to leave that there?! - \u002B10pts per science package left on the surface, 30pts for a two kerb rover.

How much fuel does that ascent stage have, because if you are using a LV-909, then you should be able to manage it, but not having power could be a problem. If you do run out of power, and you have made it to space, you might be able to get out and push the ship onto the correct heading, and stop it through time warp, then execute the node. After that point, it should just be a case of rendezvousing the CM to the lander, instead of the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDAMN!
