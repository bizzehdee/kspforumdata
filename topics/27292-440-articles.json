Set up my contracts to favor additional science at the cost of funds, accepted the first four contracts, shot Jeb into orbit with a quad of goo containers and came back down in the sea east of KSC. Earned enough science on that initial hop to unlock all the Tier 2 and 3 nodes, and chose Electrics for my first Tier 4 node. One flight and I\u0027ve already got solar panels and the ability to construct science packs. Almost had enough to go ahead and pick up fuel ducts too, so I did some parts tests to get that out of the road. Did another hop to unlock RCS; I\u0027ve got my first rescue contract in the chute so I figured that\u0027d be important. I do have to concur with the observation that Jeb doesn\u0027t really like to hang on to the side of the ship in 0.25; I had a couple of times when I was out trying to get an EVA report where he just kinda slipped off - this with the pod getting ready to come back down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight I\u0027ll do my rescue mission, and then I think it\u0027ll be about time to go to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T13:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched my third Jool probe for this career save.

The capsule, should it be occupied, can be separated from the rest of the rocket and maneuvered on RCS for docking to another standard docking port. (RCS thrusters have been moved to do this since the snapshot was taken). This is also designed fro reentry to Kerbin (2 side mounted chutes). Now if there were micro docking ports one might (depending on weight) be able to fly the MP(T-P-S)\u0027s back up to a ship for recovery and full science point values. There is enough fuel in the MP(T-P-S) probes to handle this task for most planets/moons.
