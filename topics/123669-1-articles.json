The reason for autoparking was to make sure that if you flew near an airparked vessel it would resume flight (as you can\u0027t switch a flying vessel to a nonflying vessel with the [] keys to manually toggle airpark off) and pause when leaving it. It wasn\u0027t added to make returning to a vessel automatically unpark it or park when hitting pause. I also had expected that anyone using it for booster recovery would be doing so with the intention of flying it back to a runway or attempting powered landings and therefore have a controlling part on it as well and could manually disengage the airpark that was caused by autopark whenever they wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, you do point out a big flaw when using the part with uncontrollable things. I\u0027m currently looking into having autopark behave differently when the vessel is uncontrollable (unpark when loaded and park when pausing), but still working on getting it to function. In the mean time, you still can recover the parts that are left airparked (as they are considered landed), so if you intended to use it for parachute recovered parts (and don\u0027t care about complete accuracy) you can just strap a parachute on it and assume it would have worked. I\u0027ll also look into adding autopark to the editor and getting action groups set up for it, as that does seem very useful.

I never did lock the rotation any more than setting angular speed to zero (vessels didn\u0027t rotate for no reason unlike the velocity), so you can rotate (both with VM and with the standard controls) it and it will keep where you left it. Unless I can figure out to get rid of that 0.2 m/s drop without adjusting position there isn\u0027t any good way to reconcile positional location with VM while they are both active. You can however airpark a vessel, turn on VM, turn off airpark, and then move it with VM, then renable airpark and turn off VM.

The quicksave issue I never ran into in initial testing, but I went back and tested it some more after reading your post and only managed to get that moving over terrain warning when the vessel had engines on and was at about a 90 degree pitch. I don\u0027t fully understand why that happens. My only guess is that it has something to do with some oscillations or rotational speed in the vessel being above a certain threshold. I\u0027m also guessing that the issue is pretty vessel and rotation specific. My 350\u002B part 500 ton exercise-in-computer-melting / Stock SSTO had no issues in level flight, and the VTOL I was doing testing with I managed to quicksave by altering it just a few degrees from that 90 degree pitch or simply turning off the engines. Freezing the physics position of every part to try and get rid of that rare bug doesn\u0027t seem worth it performance wise, so I suggest making sure engines are off and try to stop it from rotating (if it is) to get past that bug.

I\u0027ve had no issues with post effect changing anything. The ships resume exactly as they were in flying state (trajectories appear again, etc...). If you are trying them in space it shouldn\u0027t do anything since it\u0027s function is disabled in space (the effect that makes it landed in the atmosphere would crash the game in space).

The quicksave issue I never ran into in initial testing, but I went back and tested it some more after reading your post and only managed to get that moving over terrain warning when the vessel had engines on and was at about a 90 degree pitch. I don\u0027t fully understand why that happens. My only guess is that it has something to do with some oscillations or rotational speed in the vessel being above a certain threshold. I\u0027m also guessing that the issue is pretty vessel and rotation specific. My 350\u002B part 500 ton exercise-in-computer-melting / Stock SSTO had no issues in level flight, and the VTOL I was doing testing with I managed to quicksave by altering it just a few degrees from that 90 degree pitch or simply turning off the engines. Freezing the physics position of every part to try and get rid of that rare bug doesn\u0027t seem worth it performance wise, so I suggest making sure engines are off and try to stop it from rotating (if it is) to get past that bug. Not a comprehensive solution I know...\u003Cp\u003EAs for the post effect issues, I\u0027m not exactly sure what you are referring to. I\u0027ve had no issues with post effect changing anything.
