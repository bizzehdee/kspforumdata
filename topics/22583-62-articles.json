Good stuff, but I am curious about what causes the helicopter to flip end over end while flying forward, is it caused by blade length or is there a VNE for the helicopter blades? I am using FAR so VNE comes to mind. Also, when using FAR one has to be very careful with speed and maneuvers because the rotor gets destroyed by structural failure \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E . \u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, is it possible to put the new hover code in the old engine configs, or other engines? (For example turbine engines for VTOL jet craft) Also the old engines are no longer providing thrust.

I should add the new hover mechanics to the old stuff as well, I just need to separate it out from the collective code. I also want the old code\u0027s cyclic to be independent of the thrust, cause that\u0027s just silly.

Good idea. Must think. Figuring out the fall speed and forward motion should be simple enough, except for the fact that the drag is irregular, which messes with both. But that could be adjusted for by the player perhaps... Make it a bit skill based where you have to do some trial runs with your selected ordnance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T10:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got an idea to add more or less easily swept wings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eusing a similar module as FSAirBrake to do almost the same thing as airbrake, but in the opposite way, I mean starting drag would be higher, then decrease with angle (ex: from 5 to 2), \u002B rotation will just be on y axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd two questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- could it be possible to use FSAirBrake module and keep animated models\u0027 constraints, ie: if I made an hydraulic cylinder, it should rotate with airbrake angle but stay attached on both sides by its axles and extend itself, I didn\u0027t try this yet and just wish to know what is your thought on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- do you think Electric propellers may work on Duna atmosphere ? They don\u0027t really need oxygen to work as jet engines and blades should be able to produce lift at least for a few 100s meters but because the way KSP is designed, it doesn\u0027t work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E (no oxygen = vacuum despite atmosphere is there, with atmospherecurve of engine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
