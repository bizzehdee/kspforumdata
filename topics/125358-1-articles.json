I seek your help in resolving an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start up a new game, set it to career mode, and go into the KSC. As soon as I\u0027m there, I try opening any facility, and the problems begin. VAB, Spaceplane Hangar, and Tracking Station will highlight, but when I click on them, they won\u0027t open. Research and Development, Administration Building, and Mission Control will open, but when I try to exit out of them, the time warp bar will appear at the bottom of the screen, but the screen will otherwise stay on the display for the building. The Astronaut Complex will open, and then close, but then I can\u0027t even highlight another building in the KSC. Pausing the game will bring up the pause menu, but \u0022Quit to Main Menu\u0022 button will not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have no idea what might be causing this, but my install is heavily modded, so I don\u0027t know if I should list every single mod I have or not. I should also note that I have tried my hand at shuffling around some part files. I am currently using individual parts from LLL, AIES, and Remote Tech to create my own custom Remote Tech satellite progression. I am also using individual parts from AIES for their intended function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I need to provide additional information, I will, but it might take a day to get it here, because my computer is not connected to the Internet (I am posting this via my phone). So I would need to copy the information to a flash drive and ferry it to a usable Internet connection before posting it in here. If I should list my full list of mods, however, I can probably just type that out on my phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions or advice is appreciated immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T01:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour seems a RAM problem, due to the incompatibility with someone of your mods with 1.0.5.

Just to be sure, I went ahead and dropped by texture usage to half res and my rendering quality down two steps. The issue still arose. So, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s RAM usage.
