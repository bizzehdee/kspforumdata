It does not depend on using any particular parts as connectors or having any passable route. Crew Transfer and Crew Manifest are similar, as I understand it, in that they do not rely on a logical route through the ship in order to move crew. Ship Manifest, on the other hand, can use the additional mod Connected Living Spaces, which tells you which parts can be crossed by Kerbals - a fuel tank would \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E be acceptable, as it has fuel in it, a fuselage part is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

There are several-to-lots of \u0022Easter Eggs\u0022 (fun hidden things) on Kerbin and, to a lesser extent, the other bodies. If you want to make use of KSC West and other bases on Kerbin check-out the mod Kerbinside. For other bodies use Extraplanetary Launchpads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jebadiah Kerban","CreatedById":114356,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T07:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1: a fog? impossible you must have a bug just try and re-install ksp. but no thread\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: its up coming in .25 but sorry you can\u0027t use a fuel tank as a tunnel unless you use panels or wings then you eva the kerbals then yeah\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: some say it shows signs of multiplayer and its used by the demo version as i know plus it used to be the old KSC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T12:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Turk_WLF\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Turk_WLF\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI just have 3 questions, some place on the Forum I have see an answer to an issue that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m now having but I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find the thread, the issue is on the ground looking out of the VAB towards the Launch Complex, there is a dense fog between the VAB \u0026amp; the Launch Complex, I have tried searching the forum a number of times without any luck, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m hoping someone can point me towards that thread.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view out the door of the VAB shows \u0022fog\u0022 and \u0022clouds\u0022.

So I\u0027m thinking the doorway is blocked by a force field. The vehicles can drive through it but this causes ripples in the force field.
