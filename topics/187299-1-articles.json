It shows a 69% signal to Kerbin and it shows green lines down to the surface where I have several landed craft. When I shift focus to anything on the surface, the craft show no connection and cannot transmit data home. Other relays around the Mun and Minmus seems to be functioning normally. I\u0027m guessing my Duna relay, which has a pair of HG-55 dishes, has some kind of hidden power requirement or something. The power source on the relay is a pair of the smallest solar panels. The battery on the OKTO is full and enabled, but only holds 10 charge units.

pendulum.\u00A0 The reason that the pendulum fallacy is a fallacy is because it involves the idea that a rocket essentially dangles from its tip because of gravity.\u00A0 Aside from having no answer for what to do once it reaches free space where gravity is effectively nil and the concept of \u003Cem\u003Edangling\u003C/em\u003E needs to be redefined, there is the problem that\u00A0a rocket is a rigid body, but a pendulum is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 In order to work, a pendulum must\u00A0hang \u003Cem\u003Efreely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from a fulcrum and be subject to forces external to itself--specifically, forces that are transmitted through the fulcrum one way or the other.\u00A0 Normally, that\u0027s gravity on the pendulum and a normal force transmitting through the fulcrum, which is to say that the fulcrum holds the pendulum up against the pull of gravity with an equal-and-opposite force.\u00A0 While it is true that a rocket is subject to gravity, it\u0027s also true that both the gravity and\u00A0its own force of thrust work through the rocket\u0027s centre of mass (meaning that they work on the rocket in its entirety), and that it dangles from nothing.\u00A0 In like fashion,\u00A0a fulcrum under thrust or acceleration of some kind can be the fulcrum for a pendulum provided that the force on the fulcrum is transmitted through it to the pendulum.\u00A0 A force that operates equally on both won\u0027t work, which is why\u00A0a pendulum-driven clock won\u0027t work in free fall--the force is not being transmitted through one to the other\u00A0but instead acts on both fulcrum and pendulum directly.\u00A0 The technical term is \u003Cem\u003Erestoring force\u003C/em\u003E and it refers to the tendency of a pendulum to hang along the gravitational pull so as to minimise its potential energy--i.e., the swinging action restores it to vertical.\u00A0 A hanging object that generates its own force is no longer a pendulum, because the direction of the force changes orientation as\u00A0the object does; it\u0027s no longer restorative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sky crane, on the other hand, is an actual pendulum because the rover hangs by a flexible cable and the force behind the hanging is gravity or an acceleration generated somewhere not on the payload, but still transmitted \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E the payload through the cable.\u00A0 It\u0027s either from the rockets on the sky crane (which would be a pseudo-gravitational acceleration that impels the payload to hang) or it would be gravity itself if the crane is landing the payload on the surface of some other body and there is a hovering element involved in the landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the gripping hand, a pendulum-like rocket would work just \u003Cem\u003Efine\u003C/em\u003E if the payload hung from the force generator by a flexible attachment and the force generator kept its orientation in despite of any motion of the payload.\u00A0 That\u0027s the operating theory behind \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMedusa\u003C/a\u003E
