Several people wanted more pics, so here goes. The idea is to land the largest possible base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt number one - before I really started playing with the 3m sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1294/screenshot32l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/9088/screenshot34w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot34w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/7962/screenshot33y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot33y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was really the direct approach. solids, then 1m sections, then the 3m for final orbital insertions and some of the munar insertion. I\u0027d need to burn off some fuel for landing, so you use the landing stage for munar insertion and landing. It worked, but the number of pieces was getting a bit kludgy, so I figured I\u0027d give the 3m sections a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/7792/screenshot35b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot35b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1904/screenshot36ni.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot36ni.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis worked better, so I started adding mass to the \u0022base\u0022 section. More base, more mass, more thrust to compensate, and we have version 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/9035/screenshot37dk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot37dk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere it is without the superstructure. the spaceplane sections are empty sections (the ones that don\u0027t hold fuel) to act as placeholders for actual base sections in .17\u002B. My machine really has issues launching this one - 1fps until down to the final 3m section. A lot of the reinforcement and extra thrust can probably be removed if you can actually drive it. As it stands I can\u0027t even do a roll to 90 degrees until the final 3m section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5655/screenshot38r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot38r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/4318/screenshot39a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot39a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3002/screenshot40c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot40c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has some minor heat issues with all the 3m sections, but nothing that blows up. I decided to redesign the base section, which needed a redesign of the boosters. This part is still a work in progress to try to lessen the lag issues on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1236/screenshot41x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot41x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/460/screenshot42gjy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot42gjy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/3472/screenshot43od.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot43od.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinal version, which I apparently didn\u0027t save because I\u0027m an idiot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/5177/screenshot23t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/8439/screenshot24g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyone have any suggestions for lowering launch lag, or on the 3m sections? the boost phase is kind of a kludge.

The main source of lag is because the game is constantly trying to do physics calculations, and so the fewer it has to do, the better. Also, Unity (the engine KSP is built on) only runs on one thread/core, so it is very poor at doing many calculations. Just add more struts, and watch how your rocket flies to see where the weaknesses are. Also, you might want to use the large decoupler fix, as the current 3m and flat radial decouplers have very low strength for their size, and thus cause a lot of rocket \u0027wiggle\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-30T16:19:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2012 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by NetBlitzer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded some breathing space :P\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T01:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere is one question left in my mind...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehow do you fit it out the door?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
