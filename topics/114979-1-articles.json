I like drawing things with zany facial expressions and body language, which is very difficult to convey with the Kerbals because of their limited facial expressions (they lack eyelids and eyebrows which makes drawing an angry Kerbal insanely difficult for example), and their stumpy limbs and short torsos makes expressing their moods through body language difficult as there isn\u0027t a lot to work with, and their strange splayed legs just makes this even harder.

The little twisty cap thing their helmets attaches to gets in the way of their shoulders and arms sometimes (for example, if they\u0027re hunching their shoulders up or are pointing their arms straight upwards). This just limits their body language even more so sometimes I just draw it anyways, even though it is incorrect.

Cartoonists work to an entirely different set of ideals and aspirations to those of representative art: what they are after is recognisability, character and emotion. Accuracy is deliberately and with careful consideration chucked out the nearest high-rise window the cartoonist can find - the number of fingers is wrong, mouths appear on the side of the face closest to the viewer, tongues hang in mouths with no support etc etc ad infinitum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had been able to criticise the cartoon because the characters were unrecognisable or the emotions were inappropriate - in other words the \u0022essence\u0022 of the characters was wrong - then that would have met with agreement.

If Bill had been made to look as reckless as Jeb then that would have been a criticism the artist could well have learnt from, or if Valentina had looked too girly that would have been useful. But \u0022the number of teeth is wrong\u0022 is as inappropriate as accusing the Mona Lisa for not having enough falling anvils*, or a picture of kittens in a boot** for not having enough haywains or towering oceans - it\u0027s the wrong criticism for the wrong artform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Anvils in the Mona Lisa would be droll, but not art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Personally, I would object to any picture of kittens in boots for existing, but that\u0027s a matter of taste.
