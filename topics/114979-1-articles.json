I like drawing things with zany facial expressions and body language, which is very difficult to convey with the Kerbals because of their limited facial expressions (they lack eyelids and eyebrows which makes drawing an angry Kerbal insanely difficult for example), and their stumpy limbs and short torsos makes expressing their moods through body language difficult as there isn\u0027t a lot to work with, and their strange splayed legs just makes this even harder. I like to think I\u0027m getting better at it, though. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnother thing that makes no sense is the way I draw Kerbals in spacesuits sometimes. The little twisty cap thing their helmets attaches to gets in the way of their shoulders and arms sometimes (for example, if they\u0027re hunching their shoulders up or are pointing their arms straight upwards). This just limits their body language even more so sometimes I just draw it anyways, even though it is incorrect. You can see this in Valentina\u0027s right arm, and Bill\u0027s left arm.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Female kerbals don\u0027t have tongues.\n\u003E [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CB37lrOUsAAoQ7o.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CB37lrOUsAAoQ7o.jpg:large)\n\u003E \n\u003E But still, great work!\n\nThat just looks strange though.

It helps art to get better or for it to be better understood. Only when criticism is mean is it bad. Only non-artists will make excuses like that, implying that it\u0027s art so it must be perfect anyway.\n\nIn fact, whenever I show someone an art of mine, and they just say \u0022Oh that\u0027s good\u0022 or something, I feel like they\u0027re not paying attention enough to see some of the bad things, be it stuff I noticed but didn\u0027t fix, or stuff I didn\u0027t notice and could fix. Criticism can only help art to grow, as long as its only purpose is not to be mean.

Cartoonists work to an entirely different set of ideals and aspirations to those of representative art: what they are after is recognisability, character and emotion. Accuracy is deliberately and with careful consideration chucked out the nearest high-rise window the cartoonist can find - the number of fingers is wrong, mouths appear on the side of the face closest to the viewer, tongues hang in mouths with no support etc etc ad infinitum.\n\nIf you had been able to criticise the cartoon because the characters were unrecognisable or the emotions were inappropriate - in other words the \u0022essence\u0022 of the characters was wrong - then that would have met with agreement. (I would say that in this case there is no case to answer: the characters are recognisable and the emotions are appropriate.) If Bill had been made to look as reckless as Jeb then that would have been a criticism the artist could well have learnt from, or if Valentina had looked too girly that would have been useful. But \u0022the number of teeth is wrong\u0022 is as inappropriate as accusing the Mona Lisa for not having enough falling anvils\\*, or a picture of kittens in a boot\\*\\* for not having enough haywains or towering oceans - it\u0027s the wrong criticism for the wrong artform.\n\n\\* Anvils in the Mona Lisa would be droll, but not art.\n\n\\*\\* Personally, I would object to any picture of kittens in boots for existing, but that\u0027s a matter of taste. Kittens do daft things, it\u0027s realistic, and some people love that sort of thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:17:23Z","Content":"But nevertheless comenting about these things did lead to an interesting exchange in thoughts and information.
