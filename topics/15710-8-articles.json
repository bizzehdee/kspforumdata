I will use aerobraking (skimming the atmosphere) to help put me into orbit. The two kerbals will launch off the surface rendevouz with the orbiter they will Eva ditch the lander and hop on the ride home However i will have to wait for another launch window. on our cruise home there will be a few Deep space evas and a re-entry to kerbin at record setting speeds other than that they will be greeted as heros\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadlyPear","CreatedById":9606,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T17:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIF some of the new parts are a working empty capsule, then that would make a return trip much easier.
