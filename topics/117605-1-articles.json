Main idea is to keep heatshield strictly in front (pointing at surface prograde marker) and it should be wide enough to cover all other parts (could be easily visually checked in VAB). The only downside was that after this aerobraking I was at altitude of about 10 km and speed of about 500-600 m/s (mostly vertical, i.e. going down fast), which isn\u0027t best cause for chute deployment. But anyway I had enough time to aerobrake below 300 m/s, deploy chutes and even decouple propulsion module of craft for separate landing (I tend to build fuel tank\u002Bheatshield (without engine) as separate module for missions that require landing on other bodies and use landing module\u0027s engine as main propulsion).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETested now, heat shields can definitely explode due to overheating before running out of ablator.

This is generally what happens when you try to aerobrake out of an interplanetary transfer a Jool.

And in a way, that\u0027s true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAblator on the heatshield is a consumable that carries skin heat away. Think of it as \u0022every point of ablator is worth X heat energy\u0022. That means the skin of the heatshield stays cooler than it usually would be as long as it has ablator to spend. It doesn\u0027t die immediately after running out of ablator either; it simply behaves like any other part at that point. However, ablator can only be consumed so fast. It is possible to overheat the skin of the heatshield even when you have ablator left, because it simply cannot spend ablator fast enough to carry the heat away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile on MatoroIgnika\u0027s stream ... a heat shield survived \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo hours\u003C/strong\u003E of aerobraking passes at Jool with zero ablator before finally exploding (when it did the rest of the craft went up almost instantaneously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat shields may need a \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E bit of work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly what I wrote... when running out of ablator, heatshields simply work like any other part in KSP.
