I think its main purpose is to detect ejected parts, determine if there is a parachute, and if so to refund a percent of the amount spent on that part. So I\u0027m guessing that no, it would not work like that, because it probably doesn\u0027t save the debris in memory longer than it takes to catalogue what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is 100% guess on my part; a test or two would straighten it out pretty quick \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, Stage Recovery doesn\u0027t actually land anything.

However after my second post I kind of realized maybe he was talking about the other method, the one where you just put parachutes on and switch vessel focus so the actual ship will land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI unfortunately have no concrete knowledge on that.
