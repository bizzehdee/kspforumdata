I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if that also means less heat, though I haven\u0027t tested that.) You could probably burn an LV-N on the launchpad forever without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll build up heat all right. A one-minute burn will get them warm, going full-throttle for multiple minutes has the potential to overheat. Just how much of a problem it is depends on various factors, such as what you have the engine attached to (e.g. how much heat capacity it has). They can definitely explode, and if you like the red glow, have no fear, you\u0027ll be seeing plenty of it.

Best tip is to attach the nukes directly to their own largish tanks to use their high thermal mass. If you like low TWR with long burns, additionally adding parts that radiate heat could also be useful (wing C works well).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XOIIO","CreatedById":100854,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T04:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah they used to heat up instantly in the atmosphere though, whereas now they don;t, must be the heat model.
