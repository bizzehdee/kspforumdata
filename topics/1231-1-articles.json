I\u0027ve toyed around with it every day or so since the Kotaku article \u0027launched\u0027. I made, what I think is an impressively dangerous rocket with stock parts! Here it is! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe goes pretty quick once she is moving. Max thrust all the way up... some very convoluted stage separations... and from experience, do not let it sit on the launchpad for more then ten seconds... it tends to fall over and kill everyone in a rather impressive fireball. (I don\u0027t make rockets... I MAKE WEAPON!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere also tends to be a bit of an explosion around 5000 meters.. not sure why.. but it doesn\u0027t stop the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is about six (necessary) stages I believe... the first two stages are meaningless (I never sorted it out that far). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe tops out at around 4100 m/s about 8 minutes into flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes that is 18 solid boosters that fire in the primary launch stage. Which is why it needs tons of SAS. I don\u0027t believe a mortal could actually control that thing..... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy! \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"commander","CreatedById":4506,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T13:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the first picture it looks like it\u0027s about to topple over ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ihu919","CreatedById":4562,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T16:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yes....
