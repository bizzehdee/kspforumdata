As you can see, on average it takes around 950\u002B350\u002B800=2100 dV to get out to Dres and circularize around it, and 800 dV to return, giving you 2900 dV on \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E to get to Dres. This can go up quite dramatically if you don\u0027t fire when Dres is in phase and/or perform poor plane correction maneuvers. But 9,500dV is more than enough for a simple Dres orbit-and-return operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T15:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei have reduced my delta-v to 5.5k to give me a margin of error.

Better to send up a separate refueling craft to your destination along with your ship that\u0027s doing a mission, so that neither ship needs to pack that much fuel. Plus, it lets you leave the other one in orbit around your target body for whatever orbital purposes you may have for it. Automated science lab, perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Out of curiosity, I did a bit of a test via Kerbal Engineer Redux. I had two setups: one was a lander with drive stage to take it to Dres (the lander had enough to land, return to orbit, and get back to Kerbin with a 30% margin of error). The from-Kerbin launch weight was 170 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I built a pair of ships: the exact same lander without a drive stage (meaning it can reach Dres but needs to refuel once it gets there), and the drive stage modified a bit to be more multipurpose. The final weight: 195 tons across both ships. If I\u0027d made the refueler as minimalist as the drive stage from the all-in-one ship, that\u0027d drop the cumulative weight between the two to about 180 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So yeah, there\u0027s not a lot of weight difference between the two vessels. Technically the all-in-one is slightly more fuel-efficient, but it\u0027s also considerably less versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-27T22:38:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2013 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T07:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe number for Dres in that diagram is at least a few hundred m/s too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WilliamW2010","CreatedById":212281,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T14:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u0022316868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002224350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221367073763\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257141\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rockhem\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/27/2013 at 4:42 PM, Rockhem said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the required delta-v to dres orbit and back? i have designed a propulsion module that has 9.5k delta-v with payload, is this enough? and what is the exact amount needed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.5k is enough please send me a download link\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T21:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078701\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002224350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642517319\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212281\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WilliamW2010\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, WilliamW2010 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.5k is enough please send me a download link\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was almost 9 years ago mate, you might peruse the spacecraft exchange if you are looking for some inspiration\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-18T21:10:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2022 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
