I know it\u0027s pretty much infeasible if you want a realistic ring, like a little asteroid belt around a planet, but what if they just used ground scatter on invisible flat planes in orbit around planets? Could that work? They would suitably impressive from a distance, and would look like a bunch of rocks and chunks of ice up close, and that\u0027s good enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T02:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello titaniumweasel, and welcome to the forum. I\u0027ve moved your post over to the newbie greeting area because the developers are not looking for suggestions about planet improvements right now. They do update the planets\u0027 features from time to time, but it isn\u0027t very high on the priority list right now. I also would like to see rings, though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronut25","CreatedById":9000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T02:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKrag has added rings to Sentar in his mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/krags-planet-factory/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/krags-planet-factory/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LtHeckard","CreatedById":83627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T02:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKrag\u0027s Planet factory mod has a planet with rings.
