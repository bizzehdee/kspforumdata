Example: I would rather not have the fairings from KW, cool as they are. But deleting the fairings folders doesn\u0027t just get rid of fairings stuff, it also affects a number of other parts that seem totally unrelated, like the 5m decoupler - I am just assuming that\u0027s because it uses textures in the fairings folder? In the same vein, deleting many parts\u0027 folders doesn\u0027t remove the parts\u0027 models. It would be much easier if every file that corresponds to only one part were in the same folder as that part, so that you can very easily delete the maximum amount of stuff the game loads by removing that one folder, and if common textures/resources/whatever were placed in explicitly common folders.
