With a sea level atmospheric pressure of .8 bar and an approximation of 5 mBar water vapor partial pressure, would it then be reasonable to calculate the portion of water vapor in the atmosphere as 5 mbar / 800 mbar = 0.0625%, ie 62,500 cubic centimeters of water vapor in 1 cubic meter of atmosphere? If so, how much further is it from there to determining what volume of liquid water at a reasonable ambient temperature that would equate to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moisture extraction is primarily intended to offset entropy in the water cycle I\u0027m setting up, i.e. losses due to conversion of consumed H2O into other chemicals by both kerbals (who I\u0027m assuming are metabolically identical to small humans) and the food-bearing plants in the hydroponics lab I\u0027m creating (still have to decide what sorts of plant/s to model that on). I still have to work out exactly how much H2O that would be, but if it doesn\u0027t stray too far from what could be reasonably extracted then I think I have the makings of a scientifically-plausible self-sustaining outpost on Laythe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T11:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you need to convert the pressure at given temp into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_volume\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emolar volume\u003C/a\u003E, then this molar amount into mass. I\u0027m not quite sure we can do the first part because of absent density, temperature and composition data for Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. Using ideal gas values I get Vm = RT/P = 0.11355 L/mol at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and 5 mBar, or 8.8 mol / L. 62500 cm^3 is 0.625 L so that would amount to 5.5 mol of water for one cubic meter. Molar mass of water is 18, so that would be just shy of 100g of water per cubic meter of Laythe atmosphere at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C - given all the going assumptions and ideal gas properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like quite a bit of water to me, I expected a lot less.

It\u0027s a LOT harder to do when the temperature is already low (see on the second graph I posted, the steep part of the curve is on the high temp range, that\u0027s where it is easy to pull water from the air, whereas in the range where the curve is almost flat you\u0027re just out of options). You cannot extract more than a fraction of the water vapor in the air in the first place, and that fraction gets \u0022eaten\u0022 quickly as temperature drops.
