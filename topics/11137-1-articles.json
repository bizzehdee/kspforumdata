The Impact with our planet is expected to totally annihilate all life on the planet. As chaos and panic are expected to ensue following this statement, the United Kerbin Military has set up a perimeter defense around the Kerbin Space Centre. There, rumour has it, scientist are working frantically on a last ditch effort to save the species by sending a colony-ship towards the closest habitable planet. All Kerbals are adviced to leave the planet by all possible means, if you are unable to, take cover and hope for a miracle.\\\u0027\n\nCurrent focus is obviously on features not content, but can someone, anyone, somewhere in the future PLEASE MAKE THIS SCENARIO! I cannot imagine anything more EPIC then firing up my colony-ship while I can already see a ball of fire enter the atmosphere, then speed through the outer atmosphere while being chased by an enourmous explosion, barely escaping the planet while witnessing the utter destruction below. Then the feeling of sadness and loneliness as you set out for the nearest habitat (maybe at another star), and the shear relief when you manage to savely land the colony-ship on the new planet. So, anyone who feels he\\\u0027s got the skills and is up to the task, please create this.\n\nGreetings"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T19:18:46Z","Content":"Hehe.\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10258](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10258)"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMarty","CreatedById":12670,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T19:39:17Z","Content":"Alright, I missed that.
