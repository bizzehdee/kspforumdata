F=GMm/(r^2) this is the formula for the force due to gravity and as you can see it depends only on the masses of the two objects and the distance between them (G is the gravitational contant). The confusion here is being caused by the lift. If we take the plane as our reference point and look at the forces acting on it we will see gravity acting downwards and lift acting upwards (and drag acting against the motion, but we can ignore that for this argument). No matter what the horizontal speed of the plane gravity will remain the same, the only force that will change is the lift. Now the acceleration is calculated by F=ma where F is the SUM of the forces acting on the object, so since gravity and lift are acting in opposite directions when they are summed the result is less than what we would have with gravity alone. Therefor the acceleration is less. However I will stress this again the gravity is not changing, nor is the acceleration due to gravity.
