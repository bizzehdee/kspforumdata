You could also watch it start up in the task manager and see what how close KSP is to the 3.5gb death mark under processes.

But it seems my game was stable reguardless. Because well... Runs like a charm with Universe Replacer lol. Idk.. I don\u0027t like fixing things that aren\u0027t broken, but the whole idea of TR is its BETTER then UR when it comes to memory management, no? And I\u0027m only using what textutes you see in that pic.
