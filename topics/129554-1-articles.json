Is this wrong or is there something wrong with my GPU because I get 45fps on the launchpad with just a pod. This happens on an unmodded and a modded install on 1.05. I have lowered the resolution and many other things and am running at as low as possible settings but flying a 20 part spaceplane I still get 40-45fps all the way to orbit. I am running KSP 1.05 32-bit on Windows 10.
