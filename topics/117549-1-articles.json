Even the black pod looks tight. And, i should be somewhere halfway in the tech tree, between the black an the grey pods. The point why I changed my opinion is that it could have the same disadvantage over the black cockpit as the grey cockpit has: higher mass. The grey pod is 5 times as heavy as the black pod, but it only houses 3 times more passengers. Maybe a 2-man-cockpit should have the mass of 2.3? Than you could have a Mercury-style-rocket, a pilot and a scientist.

You are tasked to dock with a foreign space agency\u0027s vessel in space, and upon doing so, you get the option to unlock some of their unique tech int he tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it doesn\u0027t cover the unique contracts, administration, or tech tree elements, you can setup Soviet parts and have other launch sites (to play as another Kerbal nation) using Tantaresand that one mod that adds a TON of additional launch sites. Those two mods could make that happen. I forget the name of the multi launch site mod though.
