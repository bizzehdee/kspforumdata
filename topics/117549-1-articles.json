Even the black pod looks tight. And, i should be somewhere halfway in the tech tree, between the black an the grey pods. The point why I changed my opinion is that it could have the same disadvantage over the black cockpit as the grey cockpit has: higher mass. The grey pod is 5 times as heavy as the black pod, but it only houses 3 times more passengers. Maybe a 2-man-cockpit should have the mass of 2.3? Than you could have a Mercury-style-rocket, a pilot and a scientist. And simply using the good-old Mk.1 \u0022black\u0022 cockpit would be better due to the lower mass, but worse due to the lack of a pilot/scientist.\n\nEdit: Also, if We\u0027re going to have so many cockpits, could we give them nicknames such as \u0022black\u0022?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T20:26:22Z","Content":"IMO, we need a 2-man capsule because of the Pilot-Scientist-Engineer paradigm.

I often use HGR which has both Soviet style pods, and a Gemini analog. I also think that the 1.875m parts are just incredibly useful, particularly in slightly scaled up RSS configs, with otherwise stock rocket parts.\n\nWith a full suite of Soviet-style parts, it would almost be better to have a full set in 2 styles, and you pick on or the other (just from a part/memory standpoint)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T22:39:52Z","Content":"I would rather have a Dragon-like pod with crew of 4, tbh.

Something akin to a Gemini would make sense given the capsules we already have but a Soviet lookalike would be cool too. \n\nLots of reasons why. \n\nThe Gemini programme had some really cool missions if you like doing historical reenactments in KSP. Bonus points if you\u0027re playing sandbox and manage to replicate the (sadly failed) manned maneuvering unit mission. Then, as somebody has already said, the proposed extensions to Gemini provide still more inspiration for fun KSP missions.\n\nFor career games,having early access to multi- kerbal capsules would be a nice alternative to strapping a probe core to a Mk1. It\u0027s maybe a personal quirk but I much prefer to fly tourist or rescue missions with a pilot\u002Bpassenger or pilot\u002Bempty seat configuration rather than sending up an empty Mk1 by remote control.\n\nHaving early access to pilot\u002Bscientist crews would provide another way of earning a bit more science in the early game. It would also let the player train up crews more quickly. I don\u0027t think either of those would provide gamebreakingly large gameplay advantages."},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T20:55:37Z","Content":"It is true that Gemini\u0027s capsule was slightly larger in diameter than the Mercury capsule, but the majority of the larger diameter seems to actually stem from the tapered service module. The other bulk of Gemini\u0027s mass comes from it\u0027s longer, and larger diameter nose.\n\nI would argue that a viable option for a 2 crew Kemini module would be to retain the stock MK1 base diameter, but make the capsule\u0027s main body slightly longer, so it has a shallower taper (so as to accommodate two kerbals side by side, add the double door style exits), and make an integral nose that more or less completes Gemini\u0027s profile. The part would obviously have more mass than the single seater. The nose tip would be a slightly larger diameter than the end of the MK1 capsule, but taper to the same small diameter at the tip, for reasons of aerodynamics and part fit. it also would be distinctively Gemini like.\n\nThis would make a Kemini two seater module both viable in the early game, and not require a whole stack of new parts. While not absolutely true to Gemini, a rocket could be built with smaller diameter FL tank upper stages, and larger diameter Rockomax lower stages.\n\nAs for Soviet capsules... I have a thought that I like... The Inland KSC needs to be an alternate starting point in the game. Furthermore... It\u0027d be cool if you had a couple capsules that were soviet specific, that you\u0027d progress with if you started a game selecting that as your launch site. Just a thought. Maybe a Lunakhod shaped rover body or something! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I\u0027m sure you can do it with mods. As you advance the tech tree, and scale up the Administration building, you could get exchange program contracts, like the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. You are tasked to dock with a foreign space agency\u0027s vessel in space, and upon doing so, you get the option to unlock some of their unique tech int he tech tree.\n\nWhile it doesn\u0027t cover the unique contracts, administration, or tech tree elements, you can setup Soviet parts and have other launch sites (to play as another Kerbal nation) using Tantaresand that one mod that adds a TON of additional launch sites. Those two mods could make that happen. I forget the name of the multi launch site mod though.
