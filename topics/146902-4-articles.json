Each time this year, I watch the younger birds being taught to fly by their parents. Believe me, there have been a number of juvenile birds hit the ground -- but must of them never give up. They keep trying until they learn to glide, then they learn to fly. It is actually a pretty amazing process to watch. On occasion, there are the juveniles that won\u0027t try. They hit the ground and are not injured, but for some reason, lack the drive to keep trying.
