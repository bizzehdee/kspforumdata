I\u0027ve begun to feel, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand I acknowledge that not everyone will agree, that there is \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge potential\u003C/strong\u003E for KSP\u0027s career mode. As we all know, the aim of career mode \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis to build and grow your very own space company. This in itself is a challenge I know! But after extended play, and once a nice company is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eestablished, it can become a tad easy and repetitive at times. But wait! I know what you\u0027re gonna say! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You need to set yourself harder challenges Governor!\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know!
