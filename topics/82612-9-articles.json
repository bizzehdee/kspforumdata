I produce my LH2 from Ore using the ISRU already and adding in this little bit makes it nearly impossible to give a portable implementation of this conversion process. This is just one example of how you could setup a conversion process to make it easier to obtain but still requiring you to setup an infrastructure to support it.

You might also take a look at RoverDude\u0027s alcubierre drive for the event horizon, he made a cool-looking transparent bubbly thing for his drive and it strikes me that some of the same techniques might lend themselves to making a cool-looking event horizon within the gate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nupol","CreatedById":79253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T07:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your answer and explanation. After reading your post i thought about something simpler than how a classic stargate works.

Just fly the ship inside. Maybe the gate recognizes a active vessel in a certain range (doesnt matter how big the ship is) then you can activate the jump to another gate and the vessel will be teleported near the other stargate.

The ship they were in failed to retract its engine nacelles and because of that, got \u0022stuck\u0022 with the engines jammed against the gate front, and half of the ship past the event horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that, they concluded that \u0022the stargate only sends objects in one piece\u0022. Meaning, your transit would begin after the rearmost part of your ship has travelled beyond your \u0022event horizon\u0022. If the ship is too big and it gets stuck, or backs out before it\u0027s completely through the ring, nothing would happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisually, you could make a part which looks like a cylindrical worm hole without a collider, and which you can spawn when the dialing sequence to your remote endpoint is successful. The player\u0027s ship will transition straight into that part, and once completely immersed, you could transport it to where you want (which is the exit side of your remote gate). Because your vortex part envelops the player\u0027s ship on all sides, they would see nothing of the transition except for the vortex itself. With a set of colliders, it would also restrict the player\u0027s motion to within the vortex, or trigger certain death if the player inadvertedly ventures beyond it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn completion of the transit, your part would disappear and de-spawn, possibly with some kind of animation, revealing the new destination to the player. This is how jump drive animations work in most games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Unity supports colliders that only notify when something is inside it, and which allow objects to pass straight through, you can make your \u0022vortex\u0022 part the trigger, as long as you dimension it sensibly enough to accomodate typical player ship sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may not look *exactly* like the movie stargates, which have a transition volume which is completely flat, but something which resembles the Babylon 5 jump gates (which are volumetric) will definitely be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, cooking up an actual stargate may warrant its own topic.
