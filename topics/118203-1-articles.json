I know that there is another easy way to make an airplane by adding a mirror module or something. That is something I am not very interested in since I am so far into this model already. What are your suggestions is there an easy way to attach these because I am having trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBlender is a massive beast for learning, and has one of the steepest learning curves I have ever seen in a consumer application. That said, it is wonderfully full of options and capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelete your unwanted wing ont he other side. Separate the wanted wing into a separate object. Set your snapping to snap-to-vertex. Select the wing, hold control (to enable snap), and snap it into place. It -should- snap directly to the vertexes on the body (doesn\u0027t work in edit mode, hence the separating as an object). Hit Ctrl-A and \u0027apply Location\u0027 to the wing to reset its origin to world origin. Hit Shift-D to duplicate it. Now hit Ctrl\u002BM to mirror, and then hit X to select the X axis to mirror the wing on. It is now mirrored identically on the other side (but has improper normals). Select the newly duplicated wing and hit CTRL\u002BA and \u0027apply Scale\u0027 (to apply the mirrored scale). Enter edit mode (hit tab) on the new wing. Select all vertices and use the menu options for Mesh\u0026gt;Normals\u0026gt;Recalculate Outside - this will fix the normals that got inverted from mirroring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should now have two identical wings (as separate objects). Select both wings and then select your main body last, and hit erm... Ctrl\u002BJ (or maybe just J) - to Join both wings to the main body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt Vax","CreatedById":149558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T19:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest using Sketchup for your 3d models (really easy to use) with the Group/Component option making it easy to have the same object mirrored. Then all you do is export it into blender to remove doubles/tries, UV unwrap and texture. Also you do not want to design the whole craft, just parts to build the craft.
