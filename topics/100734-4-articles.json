I teach at a local university (with a significant international population) and can tell you the biggest troublemakers are America\u0027s youth. During my office hours I have had to spend time with my foreign students who are just beside themselves with the outward rudeness, hostility, vulgarity, and disrepectful attitudes of their American peers. I have noticed on the forum (from the self-reported location line) that many of those on the forums who are displaying the same mentality here are those from 13 to about 20, and unfortunately American (before you blast me, I am an American, too...
