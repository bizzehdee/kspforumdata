I assume one of the resources added to the game by this mod because of the big nuclear thingy which I have forgotten the exact name for on the side of it. But the images on the OP kind of make me think it might just be powered solely by electricity(one of the batteries text implies in my interpretation). In a way, that\u0027s actually a cool and possibly useful new engine.

The ISP I think is perfectly balanced, it\u0027s not ridiculous. Smallest setup I built was 9000 deltaV, largest tanks gave 90.000 deltaV. So that\u0027s good although the largest number might be a bit on the large side. It\u0027d mean a large vessel could visit all the planets in one go without refueling. But since this thing works with kethane I\u0027d suggest aiming for 30 thousand deltaV Which is overpowered but this IS an impulse engine, it is meant to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d tune down the trust on the engines if I were you though. I had 30 twr on the smallest ship which was ridiculously overpowered, I think a twr between 7 and 10 should be sufficiently overpowered.

The largest engine doesn\u0027t need to be stronger than 2000. This way they are immensely economic engines for your craft which can backup your normal space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the coolness in your mod lies in the very small very powerfull craft. I\u0027ve played KSP since .14 I put hundreds of hours into it. I\u0027m getting a little bored with it. I like the charm of an easier craft that can get me places quickly so I don\u0027t have to spend hours doing it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour tanks are all relatively large. Diameter is good, but why not make them a quarter of their length keeping the same weight? I\u0027d also suggest flattening the engines a bit. You know how in the old star trek the nacelles are effectively just glowing half spheres attached to a tube? If you consider the tank the tube and fancy up the half sphere you\u0027d end up with something nice that can be put into many designs. Many engines in KSP are too tall. I love the flat engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed you need to attach fuel lines. I\u0027m not too sure about that. I can see where it has it\u0027s charm.
