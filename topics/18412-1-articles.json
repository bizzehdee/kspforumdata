I have amazing rocket designs that could take 3 men around the sun and back, with plenty of feul left. But the problem I have is, I SUCK at controlling the rockets. Iv looked at tutorials and read articles, iv tried at least 30 times. I cant even do it with MechJeb. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E The way I usually try, is by getting into prbit with Kerbin (Which I usually fail at), then I try to thrust towards the mun when I first see it come over the hurrizon.

I got so frustrated that I almost went crazy (okay, maybe not crazy). Now I use the mun (and minmus) as test beds for my crazy designs. The trick of beginners is to make a stable lander by putting rockets around the lander like my Mun rover which you can check out in my sig. But before the landing part you have to get to the mun. The easiest way to do this is to tilt to the 90 degree mark after your rocket is above ~80 km, then you burn until your apoapsis is slightly pass the Mun\u0027s orbit. Now comes the boring part: time accelerate and orbit a few times until you see the yellow line. After you pass the Mun encounter, you wait \u0027til you reach periapsis. This is when you align the orange dot on the nav-ball with the center of the green circle with a \u0022x\u0022 in it. Burn and follow the green circle and watch your speed and altitude. The surface is usually at about ~1750 m. Make sure you land slower than 6.5 m/s.

(Yeah, I know, I ended a sentence with a preposition...) However, that celestial body that is pulling on you is making it so that you cannot easily go anywhere else by simply pointing and shooting. If you want to have a good experience with this game you will need to understand and use orbital mechanics (at least the essential basics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith your orbiting, basically, you need to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimb high enough - 35-40km is minimum, but I usually aim for an apoapsis of about 70-100km (use the map view and mouse over the Ap marker that shows after you have started climbing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAchieve a proper velocity - A velocity is both a speed and a direction, hence you will want to determine the angle of your orbital plane relative to the equatorial plane (though technically your attitude indicator is relative to an ascending polar orbit), and then burn horizontally (parallel to the surface, or roughly thereabout) until you have attained a horizontal velocity component of about 2200-2400 m/s, or until you have a visible periapsis in the map view and you have moved it above the atmosphere of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis simple component-wise procedure should reliably get your working rocket into orbit on every attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond this, you will almost always use burns that are in directions that are horizontal to the surface of the celestial body that you are orbiting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to raise or lower your periapsis or your apoapsis, you will perform burns at the opposite apsis (for periapsis burn at apoapsis and vice versa) that are in the direction of motion (the heading bug, or icon, with the circle and lines on the outside of the circle) or in the opposite direction to your rocket\u0027s motion (the bug that has an x on the inside). This is, basically, how you get to places such as Mun, Minmus, or Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to change your orbital plane, as Minmus requires you to do, then you will perform burns at the nodes of your orbit and the orbital plane into which you are transitioning (currently you have to eyeball this stuff with the map view). To do this, once you have determined where the next node is located you must wait (and hopefully recheck the location of the node) until you are nearing the node. Before you reach the node (well before) you must orient your spacecraft perpendicularly up or down with relation to the orbital plane that you are in (if you are in the equatorial plane, all you have to do is point your rocket North for up or South for down), depending on whether the orbital plane that you are going to transition into will be above the plane you are currently in or below it. If it is going to be above then you need to burn up (North, if you are in an equatorial orbit) and if it will be going below then you need to burn down. When you burn, which you should do at or shortly before the node, you should do so carefully so as to not overdo the changes. If you over, or under, burn then you will need to fix that at the next node (on the other side of your orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo remember that the directions in the above description are with respect to the orbital plane and not the surface of the celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only time that you should be burning toward an object is if it is a few kilometers away or less (for orbital rendezvous or similar). In such situations you should only use your rcs, and you must be careful to not use too much as doing so may cause you to go speeding by your destination, and thereby wasting lots of fuel and maybe even wrecking your rendezvous altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMunRules#1","CreatedById":17298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T21:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re in a low orbit around kerbin heading 90 degrees wait for the Mun to come up over the horizon. use SAS to lock onto 0 degrees pitch heading 90 degrees on the navball. or if using mechjeb use smartass to lock on to prograde. push \u0027m\u0027. turn on full thrusters until your orbit elongates and the patched conics show you will enter the mun\u0027s sphere of influence.
