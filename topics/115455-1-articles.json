But I noticed something interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFins placed on top of my plane structure offset the thrust, by 0.1 degree in this case. Even with fins small enough that they don\u0027t offset it in the data, you can see in the aerodynamic overlay that it lifts to the left (or right if you place them mirrored). It\u0027s driving me insane though, because 0.1 is easily enough to pull me off course on the way up. So much so that my inclination is way off if I\u0027m not constantly pulling right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s really weird is that it even pulls left in space. Actually noticeably more so. And the offset appears while on runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then without the tail fin, there is still a 0.1 degree offset, in space and in the atmosphere, at random different points. Though never when on the ground or at low speeds. But leftward pull is far less even still. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure the best way to post images, but here are some screenshots:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/QqOn4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/QqOn4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure some of this is just changes in atmospheric drag, it\u0027s still weird that it occurs in space\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
