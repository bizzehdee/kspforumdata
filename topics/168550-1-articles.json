We also know that we are gettin that ability to launch from anywhere with Making History. That being said it is still dull. What if you could construct a new\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0and Repair Baikonuber Kosmodrome with excess science ANYWHERE on the planet on any terrain. You could add as many launch sites at you want with as many VABs and any other building. What if you could construct building of your own design by merging existing buildings from your selection. Kerbin Infrastructure is dull and is completely unable to support a space program. Even though this isn\u0027t exactly the purpose of the game After awhile Launching and repeating the mission over and over again can become annoying which leaves three options quit KSP (Don\u0027t do it) Start a new save or continue... being bored. What if these space missions had effects back on Kerbin. Not just for the Kerbal Space Program (KS Program)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContructing a new building would take the same amount of credits as they do now except they also cost 200 Science for each upgrade. This way once most objectives have been completed in career your not left with a empty program with no meaning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor sandbox you will be charged only Science\u00A0and no credits. This would be a great way to introduce a form of accomplishment/science to sandbox instead of mindless launching. Also these buildings would light up at night making Kerbin more alive from orbit. On a form of sandbox science read my post on\u00A0\u0022Improving Kerbals and Associated Programs\u0022 (Below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I\u0027m sure their is a mod for this but it would be good in the stock game because it provides functionality to science in career that is overflow and something else to do in sandbox and science mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother strcuture possibility is a Landing Zone. The Landing Zone is practically a helicopter pad just bigger. It has a Flag type marker with a target marker. This gives the ability for Falcon 9 Style Landings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vacuum Chamber is like a Planetarium in Shape it puts your craft into a void for testing, it is weightless and without pressure except has no stars nothing just the craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir two\u00A0wind tunnels, 1 Vertically and 1 Horizontially.

Once you hit that button you set a wind speed for the test and then fly your plane/ rocket. This allows for POGO Problems to be seen and also for wing placement to be done well.

So if I place 4 engines but have 3 free inventory of that specific engine then. If I have 2 free inventory they I get 2 for free. This way the factories don\u0027t limit your creative ability they just give you free parts.

Once you land on one you could use it to deboard you plane. If you go forward and t right right their is a refuelling station where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E should normally be. So once you taxi to the refuelling station your plane can get refuelled on the tarmac. It one Kerbal Minute for each one thousand units of fuel. This can be timewarped though. This way you don\u0027t need to Hull\u00A0around a giant \u00A0set of ore transformers and such just to haul a few things. It cuts down of part cost and Their for lag of the jet. This way smaller jets can also make it around Kerbin... just with refuelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRailroads are the least\u00A0form of Transportation It cost 7,500 credits\u00A0and 50 Science for each shipment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nshipments take 5 Kerbin minutes per each mile .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Their should be an additional structure to the old space center (Baikonuber)\u00A0called \u0022Research Lab\u0022 the Research Lab can allow you to make your own rocket engines and tanks with your own statistics. It would use a model so if I wanted to model it after the biggest tank that would be the color scheme if I wanted the orange tank that would also be the color scheme. This way instead of squad being forced\u00A0to make new engines they can focus on other things and we get to run OUR OWN R\u0026amp;D Facility We don\u0027t unlock things we make them from templates of current stock parts. So If I was to make a Space shuttle Maine engine less powerful and\u00A0less\u00A0fuel consuming with less gimble I can do that and change its texture at will. So the \u0022Research Lab\u0022\u00A0Consumes Science and doesn\u0027t make it. Also maby a test stand at Baikonuber this way it just isn\u0027t some new launch site it\u0027s useful, to unlock it both the R\u0026amp;D Facility and Launchpad at\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0need to be fully upgraded. What do you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: Due to Popular Replies on my previous threads The Research Lab is basically 3d Photoshop. Using current stock parts as a template and then editing size of it would be good. A calculator would find its size and calculate thrust weight cost etc. Perhaps\u00A0research lab parts could cost 25% more than normal. That\u0027s the simple version of the lab\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe complex version, which I prefer is would add a node tool which would allow you to drag parts of a rocket part in out up down etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaxes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: Only unlocked after tech tree is 100% completed... I\u0027m skeptical of this idea... anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Idea her is a building called Revenue Center. If you raise or decrease taxes the higher you raise taxes the more Approval Points you lose. If you decrease taxes you gain Approval Points. Here is the idea. You have 100 units of either taxes or rep. If I set taxes at 23% I get 23% credits and 77% Approval Points. If I set it at 100% taxes I get 100% taxes and gain 0 Approval Points.\u00A0\u00A0You can only gain 100 units combined of either each day so in the course of 7 Kerbal days at the tax rate of 25% I gain 175% taxes and 525% Approval Points\u00A0\u00A0which converts to 175 credits and 525 Approval Points in that week in that scenario. Approval Points reduce the cost of science needed for the new buildings listed above such as landing pad, boat slip, research lab etc. A decimal is added after the 3rd number so if I have 525 Approval Points I get 5.25% off. This way you can accumulate Approval Points it\u0027s like a coupon system BUT ITS ONLY FOR SCIENCE NOT CREDITS.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: So after 7 weeks with the rate above (25%Credits and 75% Approval Points) I would have\u00A03675 Approval Points and 1,225 Credits. If I want to build a boat slip for X Science and I choose to use my Approval Points I would get 36.75% off the boat slip from the science cost so if it was for arguments point 100 Science I would pay 63.25 Science because of the discount.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003E\n\u003Cspan title=\u0022(Click and hold to edit title)\u0022\u003EImprovement of Kerbals\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wrote this comment on a previous thread and though I should continue the discussion about Kerbals here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVeteran Training or \u0022Intensive Training\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRequired: Intermeditate Training\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think that this should be improved upon where Kerbals can receive \u0022intensive training\u0022 (which would cost credits and science) this so called \u0022training\u0022 would take place in the astronaut complex it would display a video of a Kerbal doing so Kerbal things with a queue for intensive training only or something like that and then three Kerbals (Gene, Werner and Jeb) Hand the Kerbal a Orange Suit and then the Kerbal is like ahhh ( this is the face of the recipient\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u00A0in the video he come out of the complex with the theme song and walking out to look a a rocket launch (a prerecoreded Launch)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat Would be the plot of the video.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way we can have accurate Shuttle Launches with a full compliment of 7 orange jump suits or more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do however however want to highlight that making a Kerbal go through intensive training wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing like maby a mandatory 10 Successful Recoveries and 100 Science Collected so orange jump suits can\u0027t be be bought with each new Kerbal so they still feel like special and like actual veterans, I don\u0027t want Jen Bob Bill and Valinitina (sorry for spelling) to lose their appeal for special launches or missions because of their veteran status. It should feel like a accomplishment to the player too (that they managed to keep their Kerbal alive for 10 missions and collect 100 science with that specific Kerbal)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote:\u00A0Ten Missions AFTER Intermediate Training is completed and 100 Science AFTER Intermediate training is completed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think training should\u00A0take 14 Kerbal Days and cost 25,000 credits with 25 science to train them. THIS SHOULD APPLY TO SANDBOX TO AND HERE IS WHY! ... The Reason the science and training times would apply to sandbox it it gives a purpose to playing sandbox... To better outfit your space program not just to build space stations but to better Kerbin it feels more accomplishing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I think Veteran Kerbals should be given a bigger EVA Suit similarly to the original and not the backup/emergency\u00A0ones the astronauts use today. They should be able to hold 15 units of EVA Propellant instead of five. I know this may seem ridiculous over a suit but that being said their are some legitimate reasons for wanting to put Kerbals though this \u0022training program\u0022 if this idea is taken into account. Also EVA Propellant is consumed 25% Slower And a Additional 5% science is gained Per EACH\u00A0experiment/observation is taken into the craft or transmitted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntermediate Training\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntermediate Training would take 10,000 Credits to complete and 15 science Astronauts will be given a blue uniform to advance a level Training will take 7 Kerbal Days\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe benefits of this are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10 Units of EVA Propellant compared to 5\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA Propellant is consumed 15% Slower\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn Additional 2% Science is gained per EACH Experiment/observation taken into the craft\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor both Classes of a Kerbals:\u00A0Their can be Kerbal Classes so multiple of Intermediate(Blue Uniform modelled after Boeing I think it is) \u00A0and Veteran(orange) trained at once.

About that video it is only Their for the sake of entertainment if the Dev\u0027s don\u0027t want it whatever it\u0027s not a big deal. The more important aspect is the uniform change and the science gain along with the deep space EVA Ability which is helpful if a emergency happens with a Deep space mission and kerbals get separated from a propulsion module/main craft. If you have a large ship and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Glitch/docking port glitch happens and you lose your crew module\u00A0but your station is fine you can EVA Back to the ship and abort or continue the mission. Instead of just losing your kerbals or needing to preform a rescue mission which is also a benefit for sandbox. I whole reason I think that this should be Timed\u00A0and cost something (Rules) and have requirements is that is creates classes of astronauts. If you where going to launch a mission to Pluto (Eeloo) Would you pick the Astronaut who had minimal training (Average Joe) or Jebediah Kerman. I know now their is no reason \u00A0to use Jebediah for the mission but with these updates most emergencys can be avoided AND if you have let\u0027s say 5 experiments each yealding 100 Science with just one Veteran you gain 525 Science instead of 500 and if you have 3 Kerbals you gain 575 Science instead of 500 with your average Joe Astronaut. For Sandbox it is mostly appearance of crew but the addition of science to sandbox for unlocking TIMED things like this will make them worth while. I don\u0027t want KSP to become Clash of Clans with 14 day wait times Unless you spend XYZ on micro transactions that\u0027s just dumb and not what I\u0027m suggesting.

You could add as many launch sites at you want with as many VABs and any other building. What if you could construct building of your own design by merging existing buildings from your selection. Kerbin Infrastructure is dull and is completely unable to support a space program. Even though this isn\u0027t exactly the purpose of the game After awhile Launching and repeating the mission over and over again can become annoying which leaves three options quit KSP (Don\u0027t do it) Start a new save or continue... being bored.

This gives the ability for Falcon 9 Style Landings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Their should be an additional structure to the old space center (Baikonuber)\u00A0called \u0022Research Lab\u0022 the Research Lab can allow you to make your own rocket engines and tanks with your own statistics. It would use a model so if I wanted to model it after the biggest tank that would be the color scheme if I wanted the orange tank that would also be the color scheme. This way instead of squad being forces to make new engines they can focus on other things and we get to run OUR OWN R\u0026amp;D Facility We don\u0027t unlock things we make them from templates of current stock parts. So If I was to make a Space shuttle Maine engine less powerful and\u00A0less\u00A0fuel consuming with less gimble I can do that and change its texture at will.

It would use a model so if I wanted to model it after the biggest tank that would be the color scheme if I wanted the orange tank that would also be the color scheme. This way instead of squad being forces to make new engines they can focus on other things and we get to run OUR OWN R\u0026amp;D Facility We don\u0027t unlock things we make them from templates of current stock parts. So If I was to make a Space shuttle Maine engine less powerful and\u00A0less\u00A0fuel consuming with less gimble I can do that and change its texture at will. So the \u0022Research Lab\u0022\u00A0Consumes Science and doesn\u0027t make it. Also maby a test stand at Baikonuber this way it just isn\u0027t some new launch site it\u0027s useful, to unlock it both the R\u0026amp;D Facility and Launchpad at\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0need to be fully upgraded.
