My guess stems from the fact that Nate said he would like to incorporate VR at some point and that would be a great place to express VR in.

How do maps in vr actually work and how would the one in KSP work? Especially because you need to manipulate maneuvers carefully and have access to the numbers in order to execute things well. Also, all of the different views will need to be considered to give players access to data even in EVA. maybe an info panel and nav ball built into the the kerbal\u2019s sleeve\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blurb","CreatedById":215450,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T16:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224047783\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635348285\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209735\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JebNotFound\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, JebNotFound said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2 in VR would be so epic, I would definitely want that. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRO2 and RP2 in vr would be epic imagine being in the cockpit of a X-1 going mach 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb24","CreatedById":214340,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T23:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVR would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-27T23:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would expect something similar to KSP1\u0027s IVA, with a tad more polish maybe.
