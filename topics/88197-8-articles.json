They went into foundations of more advanced Mechanics as it developed, with Noether\u0027s Theorem connecting it to symmetries. In Thermodynamics, which was originally developed as \u003Cem\u003Efluid dynamics\u003C/em\u003E, these were founding principles. And later, as it became Statistical Mechanics, it held. Quantum Mechanics was built on these principles as well. But it wasn\u0027t until Gauge Theory that we understood why it is so fundamental. When Gauge Theory came along, we suddenly had one, clear explanation that worked on every scale, from Quantum to Cosmological. We\u0027ve done measurements at both ends of this scale to 12 decimal places. Twelve. One part in a trillion. Absolutely no theory has ever stood up to such a test. The statistical significance is incomparable. The odds of these principles failing, by smallest amounts, are effectively zero. As close to it as anything ever was.

The excitations in these fields are called particles. For example, if you try to push off electromagnetic field, as you would from water, you produce photons which take the recoil. You just built a photon drive. You can do the same with gravitational waves. Which sounds all sorts of awesome, but gives you the same 1N / 300MW of power input. You can even push from fermion fields, producing particle-antiparticle pairs in your wake. That requires even more energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason things are so easy with water is because water already has mass. Vacuum is at zero point, and there is no way to bring it bellow zero point, so anything you do to push from it requires extra mass. And that is tons and tons of wasted energy. Efficiency that EMDrive demonstrates absolutely proves that what it pushes off from is a bunch of real, massive particles. Whether it\u0027s something from the environment, say, ionized upper atmosphere, or if it\u0027s something ejected from the craft, say a leak, there is a reaction mass. Which means that all they\u0027ve really built is an ion drive. It might end up the most efficient ion drive we know with some work. So it\u0027s worth looking into. But it\u0027s going to have all the limitations of a conventional ion drive. If the thrust is due to environment, it will be fundamentally limited to tiny fractions of N, because atmo is so rare so high up. If it\u0027s due to a leak, it will be limited to stored propellant. Either way, this keeps us within current limitations of ion drives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
