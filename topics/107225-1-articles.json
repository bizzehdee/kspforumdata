But I have a concept that just might fix the problem: classifying the Magic Boulder as a vessel.\n\nOf course, that would completely kill the idea of it being an easter egg since all you\u0027d have to do is to go into Map View, observe it, and either target it so you can fly a normal vessel there, or simply switch to it. These issues could be easily solved, however, by making MB be considered a different type of vessel; one that, like Debris, is by default invisible; like Asteroids, can\u0027t be switched to; like Asteroids, Flags and EVAs, can\u0027t be selected as a vessel type when you rename a craft of yours; and unlike all other vessel types, can\u0027t be toggled visible/invisible in map mode/tracking station since its icon would not be present.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this would be enough to save Magic Boulder, since there might be two problems: First, it\u0027s probably not possible for a vessel type to be completely absent in the toolbar that lets you toggle which vessels are shown or not in the tracking station/map mode. Second, even if the first problem is avoided, the game might be unable to *always* spawn one instance of such vessel in a specific orbit(especially in already-existing save files), and if it does, it might end up spawning multiple instances, resulting in a ring of Magic Boulders around Ike.\n\nBut hey, better than nothing. Thoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:30:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole**"},{"CreatedByName":"zarincos","CreatedById":33066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:43:07Z","Content":"I can\u0027t see why this wouldn\u0027t work, it sounds like it should get around any major coding difficulties.
