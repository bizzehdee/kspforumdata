If its truly \u201Ckeep the fridge running for 10 days\u201D Id recommend a hybrid system, 3-6kwh storage , 400-800w of solar, and a small, efficient gas or propane generator. This will do fine to keep some lights on, the water pump running, fridge, fans, and devices going. It\u2019ll take a bit of management though because you\u2019re really trying to get the most out of your solar charge, running the generator for an hour or two a day to top the batteries off if needed. Thats still much better than running it 24h/d especially when running out for more fuel isn\u2019t so easy. Its also a lot easier if you\u2019re already using propane/ng to cook and have a 120g tank on site. Most of these systems will also trickle charge from the grid when needed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above can be done pretty affordably, 5-8k for the bank, panels, and generator. \u00A0This goes up as you add in more convenience and resilience, mainly solar and storage capacity for whole home continuous use, full AC, that kind of thing. At a certain point you tip into a breakeven point where you wean yourself all the way off needing the grid and can just cut the cord. Whether this makes sense or not will depend on what you need and how long you can wait for the up-front investment to pay for itself. There may also be tax breaks depending on where you live.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-14T13:44:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2022 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
