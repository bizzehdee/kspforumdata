If a large concentration of asteroids were between Duna and\u00A0Jool it could make navigating\u00A0space craft to Jool more interesting. Also you could have asteroids of different sizes so you could catch small ones in cargo bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T02:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wouldn\u0027t make navigating more interesting. \u00A0Star wars is not an accurate depiction of a asteroid belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ones you see are NKO\u0027s because you can detect them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adam_Mistry","CreatedById":168034,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T07:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222728830\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472092047\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138223\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rath\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Rath said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wouldn\u0027t make navigating more interesting. \u00A0Star wars is not an accurate depiction of a asteroid belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ones you see are NKO\u0027s because you can detect them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t thinking of star wars, I was thinking of the Galileo space craft flying by Eros\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T08:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, so not in the \u0022Asteroid belt is more rock than not, so I have to plan a course, more in the That huge rock\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E is like a solar orbit Ike for transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T15:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow dare you suggesting something that exists in real life!
