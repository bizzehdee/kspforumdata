Or can I, for instance, take my power module up first with no command module after I detach it then dock the living section which will have the command pod to that? Or will the docking clamps not function at all on the uncontrolled module if it doesn\u0027t have command of some kind?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T16:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as any of the modules you send up have some sort of probes or command module on them, you can control it.

This seems to cause docking port bugs that will prevent you from undocking. Even if you detach the probe cores after docking it can still cause this problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a ton of threads about stuck docking ports. This one in the tutorial section gives an overview of what I\u0027m talking about and how to fix it (it\u0027s complicated to fix so you\u0027re better off avoiding the problem in the first place), but my advice is to have probe cores or command pods on all components of your station, and to leave them there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug-How-To-Fix\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug-How-To-Fix\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T18:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve always done it is to send a \u0027utilities\u0027 module (electricity, solar panels, and O2) up first with a probe core attached. It\u0027s just infinitely easier to dock when both the parts that are docking can at the very least, control their orientation. The probe core doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be part of the module, as it\u0027s usually part of the orbital tug it\u0027s attached to in my case.

Some Kerbal forgot to put solar panels or even a battery on the command section of the launcher I sent up carrying the power generation module. So about 10 seconds after I launched the entire power generation system for the station, my ship went unresponsive from battery death. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E And the first rescue ship I sent tore itself in half with the winch and was left with no engine at all. AND the third ship I sent ran out of Monopropellant cause I neglected to turn off RCS assisted turning and it is a heavy beast. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E So I had to dock two two dead ships, recharge one and tow the otehr out of orbit with no RCS thrusters, nothing for fine control except the Skipper main engine, and both targets were dead in space.
