The way I like to think of it is: You gotta be wrong before you can be right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you need to do is have your orbit either smaller or larger than his but the same shape, and intersecting at one point.

You\u0027ll fall into a tighter orbit, then as you start to approach you can speed up a touch to boost your orbit, catch up the last few kilometres and make your RDV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the target is behind, then it\u0027s more counter-intuitive. You speed up to raise your orbit and therefore slow down angularly-wise (which is, admittedly, just as counter-intuitive as the opposite case, above), but you\u0027ve got to be much more careful about the final approach and leave the change in orbit much later. If your target is coming up behind a few kilometres away, and you try to accelerate towards it, you\u0027ll drop your orbit and after a very short time heading towards the target, you\u0027ll find yourself heading down to a lower orbit and accelerating away again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this reason, if the target is behind you (well, to be honest in all cases, but \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E if the target is behind) it is best to rely completely on the map view. Select target, drop a node and set it to boost radially out / prograde (the exact combination will depend on how impatient you are and how much fuel you want to spend) until you get a very close approach (under 1 km). Then do what the map and burn indicator says and wait until you\u0027re extremely close to switch your attention to the navball and make small burns to push retrograde over anti-target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T00:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if the target is really far away and you don\u0027t mind warping a few orbits, set a first node with a prograde/retrograde burn that seems reasonable. Then set a second one a good distance after the next target approach marker. Then right click it and click on the orbit\u002B button until the target approach is very close. Then go back to your first node and correct it until the target intercept is perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira1000","CreatedById":152681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T22:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you can watch How to Dock advice right \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaJ47Zxt_No\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mjarf","CreatedById":16666,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T11:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScott Manley has a video on rendezvous and docking as well, it\u0027s the one I learned from from. Rendezvousing is something that\u0027s really difficult the first time, but then it \u0022clicks in place\u0022 in your brain and it\u0027s much easier after that first successful attempt. I\u0027ve found that those intersect nodes aren\u0027t very relevant, focus on the visual approach in the orbital map, and use the navball in regular mode once you get closer than 20km or so. The way I do it is I go into a higher or lower orbit (depending on the target being in front of or behind me) until the two ships are flying close to parallel, then I burn to the same orbit height as the target\u0027s orbit, then I use the navball for the close approach. Don\u0027t worry about the orbits at this point, just focus on carefully closing in on the target.
