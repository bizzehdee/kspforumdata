If I\u0027m browsing threads the text appears vertically in a single column. If I follow a link to a specific post, e.g. through an alert or the \u0027last posted\u0027 link for a given thread, everything looks fine. Any ideas what could be causing this or how to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m viewing the forum on whatever browser comes with iOS 6 but haven\u0027t had this problem before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T17:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what would cause this issue.

It works fine on my phone browser but of course, that\u0027s just getting the mobile version of the site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBriefly though, \u00A0the home page looks normal. If I click through into any of the sub-forums, all the thread titles appear in vertical text. Clicking through again, the thread title is again displayed vertically but underneath,\u00A0the thread content is displayed normally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if that helps? Hope it\u0027s a bit clearer than my previous post. By way of troubleshooting, I\u0027ve tried clearing my browser cache and history but that didn\u0027t make any difference. Also, this only started happening last night - the forum was rendering fine up until then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T18:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re not able to make a screenshot you might be able to take a shot of your screen.
