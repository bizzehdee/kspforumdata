Kicked out of the Kerbin Institute for Aeronautical Research (popularly known simply as The Institute) for wasting time and money on ridiculous flights of fancy, Jeb, his research supervisor Wernher and a group of like-minded enthusiasts (the self-styled Kerbin Interplanetary Society)\u00A0set up the Junkyard to support and finance their rocket building ambitions. A smart young kerbal named Geneney Kerman had the bright idea of bidding on a recycling contract for the Institute which turned out to be an excellent way of obtaining a lot of good (if slightly worn) second hand equipment and parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter many, many trials and tribulations, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0finally managed to build a crewed sub-orbital rocket.\u00A0Jeb, Bill and Bob\u0027s pioneering first flight aboard the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E only reached an altitude of 36km - but that was enough.
