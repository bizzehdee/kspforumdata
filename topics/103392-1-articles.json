This is an SSTO that can carry 6 kerbals and 2 moon buggys. It has vertical rockets for landing on the Muns\u0027 surface in a horizontal fashion. How I get it to space, Full throttle off the runway and pitch 45\\* until about 10k meters. Then climb as slow as you can to about 25k meters when it runs out of air (going about 1400 m/s) then engage the rockets and cut the turbojets. Climb at 45\\* again until your peak is at about 80k meters. Glide up and circularize your orbit. You will need to refuel before going to the mun but should be the only refueling needed for a round trip. If you guys have any advice on making it better please let me know. The entire goal of the craft was the be able to get to the moon and back without shedding a single part. Making it very cheap for campaign mode.\n\n[![2015-04-04_00004.jpg](http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz248/half0/2015-04-04_00004.jpg)](http://s832.photobucket.com/user/half0/media/2015-04-04_00004.jpg.html)\n\n[![2015-04-04_00003.jpg](http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz248/half0/2015-04-04_00003.jpg)](http://s832.photobucket.com/user/half0/media/2015-04-04_00003.jpg.html)\n\n[![2015-04-04_00001.jpg](http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz248/half0/2015-04-04_00001.jpg)](http://s832.photobucket.com/user/half0/media/2015-04-04_00001.jpg.html)\n\nYou can download a copy here.
