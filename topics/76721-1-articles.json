Corsair tends to have pretty good power supplies. So you should be good with that. And like I said before, if you aren\u0027t planning to do RAID or SLI, the motherboard is fine. You will be able to get more hard drives into that tower when you run out of storage, and you\u0027ll be able to upgrade memory if it will become a factor. CPU is good enough for gaming, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t listen to the guys badmouthing GTX 760. It\u0027s a good card for the money. ATI might have more powerful cards for the same amount, but nVidia has much better software support for games. Like, seriously. With ATI cards, you\u0027ll have to constantly worry about patches and updates with half of the games. It\u0027s a hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, I don\u0027t know much about Zotac as the board manufacturer for it. Make sure you read the reviews.
