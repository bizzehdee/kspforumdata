The last test results were a shortage of fuel to achieve orbit around Kerbin, we are currently updating the launcher with more nuclear powered engines and additional fuel. More pictures will be posted periodically of this on going project I hope that you enjoy the pictures and ideas that we may be providing to the KSP community. Please note this structure is not very clean looking it will be upgraded in the future for better looks and functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/597037214756222052/0B2C089E07548894373A5DF844C2DE383964423A/\u0022 alt=\u00220B2C089E07548894373A5DF844C2DE383964423A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany complications but we are learning!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/579022993753905553/38A9F2C37673D06E93A546A40EFC57F3FF137509/\u0022 alt=\u002238A9F2C37673D06E93A546A40EFC57F3FF137509\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
