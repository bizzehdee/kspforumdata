Problem is, when I try to put the wings on the top I don\u0027t know how to adjust them so they stay at the point but angle down to be horizontal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you know about F for local versus absolute setting in the offset and rotation modes? Also you want to press C to turn off angle snap for fine control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T04:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you hold down the Shift key, you can rotate your parts in 5-degree increments. Similarly, Shift reduces the snap increments on the Rotation gizmo, allowing you greater precision when rotating the parts after placing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that there are three different axes of rotation: QE, AD, and WS. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anybody who can tell you which axis matches which pair of keys, so try \u0027em all - and remember that Space resets the part\u0027s rotation to default.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T05:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other method not mentioned yet, and which I usually do, is to place them at the location you want, even though they are angled, and then use the rotation tool to rotate them horizontally. So place them where you want first. Then press number 3 on the keyboard or click with the mouse on the rotation tool, then click on the wings and you\u0027ll get a rotation gizmo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
