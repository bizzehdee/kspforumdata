Currently, e.g.\u00A0there is not much need to take a MPL to another planet, because once you are able to do so, you already have unlocked (at least almost) the entire tech tree, and there is not much use for sp beyond that point. Sure, you can \u0022sell\u0022 sp for funds, but usually you have plenty of them, too.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ESo imho squad should\u00A0\u0022make sp a resource that is spent in other ways than just unlocking nodes in tech tree\u0022.
