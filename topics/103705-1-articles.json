This one has custom solar panels, if you want them tilted you\u0027ll have to use the rotation gizmo in the VAB. A quick note- the shuttle in the second-to-last picture isn\u0027t mine, it\u0027s Inigma\u0027s fabulous replica, found [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108219-STS-4-Space-Shuttle-%28Stock-NASA-Replica%29-New-Shuttle-Derived-Crafts%21-SDHLV-Ares%21-4-8-15). Also, say hello to Hubble\u0027s 25th anniversary! A quarter of a century of amazing discoveries.\n\n**Craft Info:** 142 parts, 12.1 tons. It doesn\u0027t quite fit in a Mk3 cargo bay, but you could possibly put the solar panels and antenna on using KAS.\n\n**Craft Download:** (Mediafire) [Link](https://www./?dpu9iat59956cfk)\n\nAnd now for some beauty shots!\n\n![S1u44Fk.png](http://i.imgur.com/S1u44Fk.png)\n\n![8kSDscS.png](http://i.imgur.com/8kSDscS.png)\n\n![4uN1Jnp.png](http://i.imgur.com/4uN1Jnp.png)\n\n![IFjnqSg.png](http://i.imgur.com/IFjnqSg.png)\n\n![Ws1v22Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ws1v22Z.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and leave some rep if you enjoyed!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T15:56:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zucal**\n  \nEdited to reflect anniversary."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T19:37:46Z","Content":"Very nice!
