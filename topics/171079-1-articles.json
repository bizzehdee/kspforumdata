The game (from versions 1.2.2 to 1.3.1), launches fine, plays fine, but I have no sound. This changed when I upgraded my computer in early December. I did the full upgrade, including motherboard, processor, graphics card and memory. Since then I have no sound. All of my other games, like War Thunder, Warcraft, Cities Skylines all produce sound. It\u0027s a damn mystery to me. I\u0027ve checked drivers, volume levels, reverted to earlier builds, inputs...\u00A0\u00A0it\u0027s all the same. I\u0027ve tried the 32bit and 64 bit version, still the same. I\u0027m pulling my hair out. Before anyone asks, this is a stock install.
