Well a 2,5m to a 2,5m coupler would be obviously too big and would find little to no use but this could be solved by diagonal parts.

But then there are struts and fuel ducts, so why not use the same principle with procedural versions of some parts e.g. structural fuselages or girders? They would offer more rigid connection and better looks in exchange for heavier weight and would have enabled collisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strikerklm96","CreatedById":102539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T20:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, along with many others would love to see procedural fuel tanks, girders, ladders, ect. have you seen this thread? : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51390-Procedural-Parts-%28The-best-way-to-improve-the-game-experience-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51390-Procedural-Parts-%28The-best-way-to-improve-the-game-experience-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
