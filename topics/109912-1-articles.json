I hate how I go to space and its always giving me tourist contracts or if I have already been to space it tells me to explore Kerbin, I really don\u0027t even want to see those types of contracts anymore, but I would also like a logical progression step of contracts \u0022Oh you landed on the mun with a probe? Now orbit with a kerbal, then after that have this contract to land with a Kerbal\u0022 instead of \u0022Hey you landed on the mun with a probe?? Okay well just fly by again, oh and plant a second flag on the Mun, as well as go plant one on Minmus and then fly by Duna!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried SETI Contracts and I couldn\u0027t get it to work at all which is a shame because it was exactly kind of what I wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what are the better tech tree balance mods?? Again I would like to try SETI because it has a logical progression but from the way it was described in the post, you need certain mods to work with it??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Hasegawa wrote in the SETI thread, Contract Configurator is required for SETIcontracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut SETIcontracts only replaces the stock progression contracts.
