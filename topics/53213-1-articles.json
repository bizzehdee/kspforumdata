I wanted to discuss how to improve it and create a good system that lets you plan [potentially with economics in the future] and provides a unifying overarching narrative to our space program.

I tick these off as they are completed and add notes for anything that could be improved. Then at the end of the mission, I write a separate narrative account of how the mission went, together with screenshots. This is mostly for my dad, who likes the idea (and has a copy) of the game, but is mostly too nervous to actually play it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T12:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI track my ongoing missions with Kerbal Alarm Clock and the tracking system.

That makes efficient use of Kerbal time where you may have to wait years to get a launch window to planets after the last one. Launching staggered rockets will allow a greater chance of success with some or all as you get one into the most efficient intercept possible from the experience of the others. (Most useful if the Krackin decides to eat parts off of one of your deep space ships in flight.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
