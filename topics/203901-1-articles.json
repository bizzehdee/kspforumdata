Kerbonauts would want nothing less than a genuine fan beating the drum to turn a sequel into a passionate continuation of the original.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m curious if there\u0027s any infusion of the game with elements or design choices informed by his previous experience. This isn\u0027t his first rodeo, he\u0027s been a director before. I\u0027m wondering what sort of things in his career are making him confident that this sort of gameplay decision or that sort of UX element are solid choices.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is answering that kind of thing just implicit from the direction we\u0027re seeing in all the teasers? Maybe I\u0027m just not satisfied with seeing his resume on LinkedIn. I\u0027d like to talk about his previous games a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-18T23:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps members of Intercept (either including or specifically Nate) could do an official\u00A0Reddit, Twitch KSP-TV or KSP Discord AMA session at some point?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a pre-thread where people can submit questions, which are parsed/moderated/collated\u00A0to avoid live-thread internet insanity/trolling.\u00A0 Leave some space/time\u00A0for live-prompted\u00A0questions, or have other team members also answering in the thread as-is/when-is possible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine there\u0027s a lot of pressure on their time for development but hopefully they could get some time for some community outreach, maybe the community manager/s could swing something that works for them in lieu of other in-person events which have been forgone due to the current global situation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-19T15:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say its implicit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be really awkward to get anything except something along the lines of \u0022my team and I believe this is the best choice\u0022. Its not like Nate will put someone else under the bus if it doesn\u0027t work out later. Or say \u0022this UI SUCKS\u0022 for the product he is helping create. Nor could I see him take specific credit for a specific direction or decision, as its a team effort not a 1 man project.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the information/interviews he\u0027s given where he more or less gives his background and experience with the game itself is enough. There could be more info dished out later, but I personally would like to hear their experience building\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethis\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0game, rather than past games. This would only come out closer/after release, hard to talk about a games development when the game is under development, since it isn\u0027t done and things can change later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
