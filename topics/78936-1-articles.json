However, being a Kerman, he naturally took every opportunity to slip into the pilot\u0027s seat. Getting Security to throw Bob out became a standard part of the pre flight checklist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Security screwed up. On the recent launch of the SSTO spaceplane \u003Cem\u003EKerbodyne Overshoot\u003C/em\u003E, Bob slipped past Security while they were distracted by the last-minute addition of a testing part. The stowaway wasn\u0027t noticed until the drone-piloted ship reached its target: the stranded Aldfrey Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis presented a problem, as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbodyne Overshoot \u003C/em\u003Eis a single-seat spacecraft.
