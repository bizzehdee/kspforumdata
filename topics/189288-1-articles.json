An inline battery would also be helpful, but as for adapters- just use the fuel tanks and don\u0027t fill them with fuel if you really want a purely structural part. Why you\u0027d want that when you can fill them with fuel is a mystery to me, more fuel is always better and the lack of a 0.625m to 1.25m fuel tank adapter is mildly annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
