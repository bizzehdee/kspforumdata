I had a few hiccups though. I sent the \u0022manned\u0022 lander up without crew figuring I would pilot the rocket with the rover drone (which worked), but I had to EVA a pilot over from the Duna rocket to pilot the lander in for docking. Then the rover section\u0027s solar panels were mostly blocked by the landing... cacoon... I had built for it so that got a little hairy especially since I was trying to keep the lifter stage rocket that still had fuel on it for a fuel transfer (not originally planned).
