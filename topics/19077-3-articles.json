The other main thing is to, if you\u0027re not going to use a mod, do the math to get you within a reasonable distance. I laid out a spreadsheet and put in orbital equations to make it a lot easier to know what altitude to start at if I want to start my burn at a certain angle; it\u0027s easier to eyeball 90 degrees and rely on the map to get a circular orbit at xyz altitude than it is to start at a certain pre-transfer altitude and have to eyeball some ridiculous, weird angle in order to make intercept on your transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, back to topic, a docking mod will definitely help give a purpose to rendezvous maneuvers.
