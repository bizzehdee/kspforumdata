The universe time will still start as year 0 and day 0 but that day will have the planets at a random position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially during a career play it becomes predictable where you will have to wait a set amount of months/years to get to Duna or Eve. With some seeds you may be able to have a launch window to Eve within the very first week. Better yet, a launch window to both Eve and Duna. Maybe your so lucky and you get a launch window to more planets. Or, you\u0027ll have a launch window to nowhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven in sandbox it will have a benefit. There are a great/astronomical number of finite years in which the planets can align differently. That means that if you use gravity assists there are a humongous amount of variations to travel from and to a destination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the current state of the game starting at year 0, day 0 the alignments are always the same. Each planetary alignment for every playthrough becomes predictable while it would be more fun if there was a new game seed that randomly changes the planets orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course we also like the default starting date with the default planet locations. This is where lore is nostalgic and when Kerbalkind went into space for real so a default setting should remain.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this should involve a option for a procedural new game planetary alignment seed but it should be optional and there should be some kind of symbol next to the mission timer that activates whether your using a custom planetary alignment seed or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestions, comments? \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Enay sayers?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-17T00:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs log as it\u0027s an option to be picked when creating a new save, I\u0027m all for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-17T04:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI approve!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-17T05:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223452413\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178341\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221537144508\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs log as it\u0027s an option to be picked when creating a new save, I\u0027m all for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223452140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178341\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221537112039\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this should involve a option for a procedural new game planetary alignment seed but it should be optional and there should be some kind of symbol next to the mission timer that activates whether your using a custom planetary alignment seed or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-17T05:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2018 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
