It works, but it gives a very large amount of fuel for this mod\u0027s fuel tanks and I do mean large. What it doesn\u0027t do is switch over to other types of fuel tanks that MFT is supposed to support according to the config files that are supported with this mod, like service module and the rest. With SSTU\u0027s patch, it uses MFT for Real Fuels tank switching and configuration and limited fuel tank switching between LOX and Mono and Xenon without real fuels. Take out MFT and the tanks use using Mage\u0027s patch to give tanks the stand alone MFT function for LH2 it needs for the size tank you create, though it\u0027s not named cryogenic, but the tanks are there to support the engines for LH2/Ox. \n\nLike I said, a choice will have to happen on what features you\u0027d want. The only thing I could suggest is a fuel switch on the engines that use LH2 to switch back to LOX for an MFT mod install. And I feel that Mage \\*might\\* not do that, because it\u0027s more work on parts he has already worked on, especially this week. He put a lot of work into what he done and I\u0027m not complaining one bit about it. Even if I have to drop a mod in order to use this mod in the way it\u0027s he wants it run, I\u0027ll do just that and figure out the rest. \n\nIn any case, thank you for your reply, Blowfish."},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T01:56:38Z","Content":"has mft support been added?"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T02:25:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 27 minutes ago, 123nick said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E has mft support been added?\n\u003E \n\nFrom the dev notes: \n\n*\u0022ADD - Support for ModularFuelTanks standalone mod.

I find that it seems much more viable from a size and TWR perspective (e.g. recreating real-world rockets), but I also think that it is perhaps still a bit overpowered in the dV department, at least for the stock Kerbin system.  \n\n-If- I were to attempt to balance this for stock Kerbin, I would have two obvious choices (and perhaps a few more obscure ones) -- either increase the mass of the parts to decrease vessel dV, or decrease the ISP downwards a bit.\n\nThe Interstage Decoupler part is coming along nicely (decoupler/fairing with integrated ullage rockets).  Plugin is mostly done -- mesh generation is done, model positioning is done, need to do a bit more event-linking.  Did the first in-flight tests of it yesterday, where it performed acceptably (for a prototype).  Going to need some thrust/fuel balancing, perhaps even on a per-size basis, and I might need to tweak a few colliders a bit, but the concept has proven to work as intended.  Need to still finish off the model / decide on finalized model geometry as well; but as the model is added through config/plugin, its easy enough to change it up in the future if needed.  \n\nSorry, no pics on this one yet.... just imagine a fairing with some big seperatrons bolted on the side, and you\u0027ll get the idea ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAnd...

Thats intresting, HGR had his capsule at 1.875m, and was fiting confortably inside a 2.5m or flush inside a 2.1m fairing. The docking port at that size were 1.25m.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It might be a good idea to go that way, 1,875 part would be more flexible than a new format. A bit like what you did for the Orion, the CM at 3.75m and SM/fairing slightly larger. But thats just my opinion.\n\u003E \n\nThe whole thing is 64% of real-world scale.  The base of the service module is 2.7m real-world size size, mult by 0.64 = 1.728m for the widest point on the service module at KSP scale.  This gives a OM / DM diameter of ~1.41 (2.2m \\*64%=1.408m...).\n\nI\u0027m calling it a 1.875m command pod as that is the size of rocket that it will fit most closely on top of, and the size that its BPC/adapters will be made at (adapters likely will just be fairings).\n\nEdit - render of the pod with a 1.875m fairing-half:\n\n![VK5c0hI.png](http://i.imgur.com/VK5c0hI.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T16:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T15:35:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mage, I know you\u0027re looking for re-usability, but what about having toggleable docking ports and having a probe and drogue russian like? maybe use it as a proper scaled russian probe and drogue to go with russian style station parts, if you still plan on working on them, and have it in a way that you can simulate soft docking  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The Soyuz could also have the other two docking ports that are in use by Apollo and Orion to have it compatible with stations using the two standards if one so desires  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E considering this happened, 1.25 docking port doesn\u0027t sound so crazy ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\u003E ![Soyuz_TM-16.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Soyuz_TM-16.jpg)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E would this be doable or having swapable docking ports is one of the rituals to invoke the kraken?\n\u003E \n\nSorry nope, cannot do docking-port model swapping due to the stock docking port module; its code relies on its docking transform always being present... if I remove it after it has already initialized (such as in the editor), it will null-ref and start causing problems.\n\nOther docking port styles -- I\u0027ve considered it a bit in the past.... and it comes down to compatibility -- without the capability to do run-time swapping of the models, using any male/female docking port setup would render it (at least visually) incompatible with other docking ports, which is unacceptable.  I actually have an \u0027active\u0027 variant of the current docking-port model created and mostly ready to use (with extensible contact/alignment plate), however stock does not support run-time swapping of the models, so it has never been finished or exported.\n\nSo... when stock can support swapping of the docking port model/etc, sure, I\u0027ll look into it.

I won\u0027t be able to use -the same- system due to bundling/licensing, but I can at least keep the math end of things doing the same calculations.  \n\nI would also implement it as part of the fuel tank logic rather than a stand-alone module; as my tanks only -sometimes- carry LH2, having it as part of the fuel-tank module code would help accommodate these cases.  It would also allow me to setup a simple second fuel variant for \u0027insulated\u0027 LH2 tanks, and do all of the processing for both of those through the fuel-tank module.\n\nIn the end though, it probably will function equivalently, including using the same percentages and EC setups; if for no other reason than to maintain compatibility with NF.  Granted, my tanks **will** use different balance than the NF tanks; but at least the mixture ratios and boiloff mechanics would be interchangeable and look the same to an end-user."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T16:26:50Z","Content":"Also... did one of these things... forgot what they are called...I\u0027m sure someone remembers.
