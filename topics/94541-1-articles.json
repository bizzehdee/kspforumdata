Of course not everyone\u0027s going to be able to build efficient rockets reliably - especially not new players - so if a decent number of people find 18 tonnes as the first limit a little bit too low, sure why not \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T04:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny you should mention that, actually.

However, 18t is a bit abitrary (any other limit would be).

Or up to 1100t if we want to spare some money. And each player would have to choose the limit under which he wants to fine tune his crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
