I have a couple of questions and suggestions\n\n**Question:** How in the ever loving hell does one make any sense out of / convert to these horrible quaternion rotations? I have the basic euler rotations from Unity, but the configs require quaternions, and I\u0027ve tried EVERY online conversion calulator, tutorials, trial and error, and no matter what, not one thing ever works out remotely as intended, other than straight up and down or front/back, or copying the numbers from an existing config (which has been good enough so far, but I want to get into environmental ambiance like weirdly rotated cargo bags, etc., and isn\u0027t good enough for that)\n\n**Suggestions / Ideas:**\n\n1) A button or some such prop for changing the computer orientation of the pod in IVA (as in, the way that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and so on behave differently when a pod is placed sideways/upside down. A button similar to having clicked \u201Ccontrol from here\u201D on a differently facing part)  \n\n2) A Mercury-style periscope prop would be wonderful. Could work almost identically to the CRT monitor under the hood, but without the grainy image, or green tint, and with the zoom and pan and so forth mapped onto props that look like physical mechanical levers, \u002B big metal circular pressure bracket.  \n\n3) Is it possible to make a pull-tab prop that fires a single direction of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (also Mercury-style) when activated? Such as when a tab is pulled, it acts as if you are holding down \u201CW\u201D only, until pushed back in. For really low tech pods or escape vehicles etc.  \n\n4) It would be awesome if there were a way to click and swap out the globes in the IMP(act?) indicator during flight, switching to another image in the folder. Then you could have the actual globe show you where you can land on the moon, or wherever else, and if implemented, this would inherently allow a great synergy with scansat, since you could export maps from scansat, toss them in the IMP folder, and get a globe with your current kerbal space program\u0027s actual level of knowledge of that celestial body for landing, as has been collected by scan probes!  \n\n5) A hatch handle prop to go on the docking node portions of the interiors, that when clicked will transfer the crew member into the connected living space if any.  \n\n6) This may already be a thing, but if so I can\u0027t figure it out: Is it possible to have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E joysticks actually draggable by mouse to control \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E? Similar to how the throttle works when dragged. Whenever I install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E props, they look cool but are static.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-10T14:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2017 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Crimeo**"},{"CreatedByName":"alexustas","CreatedById":78632,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-14T18:20:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10.04.2017 at 8:52 PM, Crimeo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E but I want to get into environmental ambiance like weirdly rotated cargo bags, etc., and isn\u0027t good enough for that)\n\u003E \n\ndescribe your problem in more detail, please\n\nIf to be brief, then:\n\nRequests number 1 and 2  require modifications to the Part  model \n\nRequests number 3, 5 and 6  -  a significant revision of the RPM plug-in \n\n\u21164  was discussed [here](https://github.com/Alexustas/Props-requests/issues/31)"},{"CreatedByName":"alexustas","CreatedById":78632,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-14T18:59:22Z","Content":"**to all IVA builders**\n\nI spent the last few weeks on a complete redesign and refinement of such an important prop as a toggle switch and I started working on a similar concept related to Push-Buttons \n\nModular Toggle Switch [complete guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmnwpnh9pbu4xlh/ModularToggleSwitch_v0.2.pdf?dl=0) \n\npreview:\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFBknDTboHM?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEbe0y3wMGA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nModular Push-Button **\u003Cu\u003Eearly WIP\u003C/u\u003E** [guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/waueekx2liw3eeg/ModularPushButton.pdf?dl=0)\n\npreview:\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/grxepMJXilE?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nDL: [ASET Props Dev build](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1s2hxbab5g98n4j/ASET_Props-Dev%201.4.3-15-04-2017.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimeo","CreatedById":170164,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-14T20:55:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, alexustas said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E describe your problem in more detail, please\n\u003E \n\nThe problem is that Unity displays all the rotations in 3 number Euler notation, but the configs require quaternions. I\u0027ve looked up all the conversion calculators I could find and tried all kinds of intuitive guesses at how to convert as well (such as \u0022use the converter, but maybe the first number in the config is supposed to be w thrn xyz instead of xyzw, etc)\n\nNothing ever works, items that I try to calculate the rotations for (euler to quaternion) always end up basically randomly rotated unpredictably. As in, in game, they look nothing like how they did in unity if I try any rotation on my own. Not even a clear consistent pattern to the errors...\n\nI have had success for instrument panels by simply copying the initial rotations in the starting config before deleting those props. But if I want to add anything not perfectly aligned with a panel (like fire extinguishers, rescue beacons, crew manuals, cargo, etc), thrre is no existing reference, and I need to be able to calculate rotations.\n\nThe POSITION numbers unity gives all work perfectly, so I know my unity space is oriented correctly.

I installed RPM, ASET, and MK1-2 IVA in a clean install of KSP. I turned on the RPM debug, loaded the game and launched only the capsule. I did this twice and both times the game crashed after loading \u0022swPush\\_THRTL\\_CUT\u0022. I went into MK1-2\\_ASETinternal.cfg and removed that section and tried again. This time it crashed right *before* where that switch was. I went back, put it back, and removed the section following it, \u0022swPush\\_THRTL\\_FULL\u0022. This time the game progressed further before it crashed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.337] [JSICallbackAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 90 (PanelDivider), supporting 1 callback animators.\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.342] [JSIActionGroupSwitch]: Configuration complete in prop 91 (swPush_THRTL_CUT).\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.343] [JSICallbackAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 91 (swPush_THRTL_CUT), supporting 1 callback animators.\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.343] [JSICallbackAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 91 (swPush_THRTL_CUT), supporting 1 callback animators.\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.346] [JSIVariableAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 92 (ALCORThrottleCtrl), supporting 1 variable indicators.\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.347] [JSICallbackAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 92 (ALCORThrottleCtrl), supporting 2 callback animators.\n\u003E     [LOG 14:21:40.347] [JSICallbackAnimator]: Configuration complete in prop 93 (DigitalIndicator_Throttle), supporting 1 callback animators.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried the same procedure but, instead of getting further, it went back to crashing right after that final PanelDivider.

Does anyone know of a Unity Bug that relates to this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerezza","CreatedById":111051,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T23:43:56Z","Content":"Hello, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got your hands full already but it\u0027d be nice if your LifeSupportMonitor could be expanded for compatibility with other LS mods, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support in particular since that seems to have become the new standard thanks to MKS.\n\nAside from that, I also want to thank you for your work on this pack. I saw your new Mk 1 Lander Can and instantly fell in love, and now I\u0027m using the Unity Editor (for the first time!) to overhaul my other stock cockpit interiors to use the lovely new not-completely-glass-cockpit assets. Definitely won\u0027t turn out as nice looking as your lander can, but thankfully it\u0027s not too hard to improve on the vanilla Mk 1 capsule ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nEdit: Also, I\u0027d love if \u0022NASA\\_GaugeSngl\\_ABLATIVE\u0022 could display Deadly Reentry Continued\u0027s \u0022AblativeShielding\u0022 resource which replaces stock\u0027s \u0022Ablator\u0022 resource while using said mod. I wouldn\u0027t mind an alternate \u0022NASA\\_GaugeSngl\\_DRCABLATIVE\u0022 to swap out via modulemanager in case of DRC, if it\u0027s not possible to make a single gauge display \u0027either or\u0027.\n\nEdit 2: Strangely, the Ablative gauge worked fine with DRC in an IVA I\u0027m editing right now, but it doesn\u0027t seem to work in the Mk1 Lander Can\u0027s ASET IVA. I can\u0027t investigate tonight since it\u0027s almost 2AM now, but seems to not work consistently for some reason.\n\nEdit 3: I\u0027ve got a little complaint to make about your CRT Display part. I think this picture shows the problem well:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![JIZ9HqB.jpg](http://imgur.com/JIZ9HqB.jpg)\n\nThe image in the spoiler is of the CRT in an IVA I put together for myself (though this complaint applies to your lander can IVA also), and as can be clearly seen the CRT\u0027s camera display is anything but clear to see. That\u0027s during a transition to the dark side of Kerbin, and not actually on the dark side of Kerbin yet. Even in ideal lighting conditions (mid day on the launch pad) it\u0027s next to impossible to see the camera display through the CRT\u0027s snow effect, so it probably needs to be toned down quite a bit. I\u0027d suggest that the snow effect should never hinder the camera view, but still be just slightly visible for that CRT nostalgia.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-21T07:41:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2017 07:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nerezza**"},{"CreatedByName":"King Something","CreatedById":160466,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T02:38:29Z","Content":"It mostly works in 1.3.0 with the latest versions of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E and RPM; except that the text on the operations manuals, the life support screens, and the lights that indicate whether or not certain compatible mods are installed, is vertical instead of horizontal.
