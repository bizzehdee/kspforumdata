I think the same error is also happening on all other landmasses where they touch the sea, but for some reason it\u0027s very visible/noticeable at the poles. This seems like it could be something that has been fixed for other people before, but I just don\u0027t know the exact terminology of the issue and am not searching for the right terms to find previous cases of this issue.\n\n[LINK TO A FEW PICS](http://imgur.com/a/CIXtp). Look at where the ice touches the water.\n\nSo far, I\u0027ve done the following to no effect:\n\n- Reinstalled the game and allowed it to re-create settings.cfg on its own\n- Started a new save file (which is when I took the pic above)\n- Tried some basic graphic settings changes (such as dis/re-enabling AA, disabling PPFX, changing texture resolution, etc.). Haven\u0027t tried everything, though.\n- Tried forcing OpenGL\n- Made sure all of my drivers are up to date\n\nSpecs:\n\n- Steam Install\n- Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit\n- AMD FX 6300\n- Radeon 7870 2GB\n\nHelp is much appreciated - thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T06:39:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ve also seen this, although I don\u0027t know what is causing it. It seems even worse when I\u0027ve gone further from Kerbin (where it seems like it lags even worse in loading the textures). I haven\u0027t really found a \u0022fix\u0022 yet myself, so hopefully someone else has some ideas.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T08:37:38Z","Content":"Sorry to break it to both of you but this is an artefact of the stock polar icecap generation, the only \u0022fix\u0022 might be to use a graphical addon.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
