Is there a mod, a CFG entry, or whatever to change it so the MET timer starts when you actually launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnfortuneLess","CreatedById":182848,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T16:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell probably, but is it that important really? I mean, even if you NEED to know the exact second you left, you can still remember how many seconds did it show when you left and then just use a calculator to put in your current time and then just deprive it by how many seconds did you have before takeoff.
