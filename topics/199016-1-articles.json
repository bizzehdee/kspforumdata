I had it launch using allot of those working booster Moores Rockets and then when they were used up I dropped those and then it hit me,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rockets would not fire only then did I see there was no fuel in those tanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou most likely say, well did you not see there was no fuel in them at launch the 1st time you launched?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo because 1 \u0026gt; the amount of booster rockets used was so much due to the weight of the station, the list on the side was only showing them \u0026amp; 2 \u0026gt; no flames from the\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmain rockets is normal to see when you have so many booster rockets start up the speed of the launch is such that those main rockets turn off as they not needed until the boosters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare used up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did not see the problem until I went to fire up the main rockets and nothing happened, by now the list of boosters went away and I saw no fuel in the main tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to stop the launch and reset to the assembly building to try to fix the lack of fuel problem, no luck I even did small rocket tanks testing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll showed zero fuel in the tanks so no take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have lots of the 10.2 mods still working even though the 11.1 has now come in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have some 10.2 and some 11.1 mods thanks to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E doing updates for all them and I only removed any like the 10.2 that the system not let work in 11.1 now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo has anyone got any idea\u0027s why this just now happened when the fuel was in the tanks before the update of 11.1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-23T23:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you mean 1.10.1 and 1.11?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect something in your install is incompatible and is breaking your fuel tanks- my immediate thought is Cryo Tanks as that adds liquid hydrogen and liquid methane options, but without a mod list or the log files it\u2019s impossible to say.
