The kind that are glowing all the time and flare up really brightly when in actual use. Something like that, with tweakable color, would be amazing.\n\nLike this:\n\n![latest?cb=20081008210548](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/firefly/images/4/41/Alliance_cruiser.png/revision/latest?cb=20081008210548)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T05:18:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mitchz95**"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T05:36:06Z","Content":"To be a total killjoy, those aren\u0027t really on the realism level KSP has. If you want sci-fi engines, I\u0027d recommend [KSP Interstellar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-BETA-1-0-2-KSP-Interstellar-Extended-1-1-13-%28last-updated-25-5-2015%29-IMPROVED-MICROWAVE-POWER), which adds a huge variety of different modular engines and other technologies, all of which are very powerful and (for the most part) plausible. There are a few low-thrust \u0027glowing\u0027 types of engines (plasma thrusters) but they don\u0027t have the idle glow you specified and are a lot more like ion drives than anything else. Most of the engines in the mod are the \u0027roaring\u0027 kinds of rockets, which are what the really powerful engines we\u0027ll develop in the future will be like.\n\nAnyway, preaching over. If you want engines like that, the best place is probably the [B9 Aerospace](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-8-%28updated-30-12-14%29) HX engines, but you may note that a) B9 is not update for 1.0.x yet and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) it\u0027s huuuuuuuge, and adds tons of parts beyond those. If you don\u0027t mind rolling back/delaying your upgrade from 0.90, it may suit you with its options for giant soft-sci-fi-looking ships. Presumably, the 1.0.x update is in the works for that.\n\nIf you\u0027re into the shiny sci-fi look, [OPT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-1-0-2-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-6-9) may appeal to you. It focuses mostly on spaceplanes, but it also has a sci-fi-ish \u0022dark drive\u0022 with a fancy glowy effect. Once again, it\u0027s not quite what you specified, but it\u0027s in the same sort of zone.\n\nLastly, if you are interested in the \u0027roaring rockets\u0027 kind of sci-fi drive but don\u0027t like how crazy complex KSP Interstellar can be, I\u0027ve heard great things about [Karbonite\u002B](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92839-WIP-Karbonite-Plus-%28K-%29-a-Karbonite-Expansion). Unlike the other mods I\u0027ve mentioned here, I\u0027ve never actually tried it, but I do know that it includes a very nice looking \u0027torch drive\u0027 with a lot of power behind it. \n\nI hope at least some of this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T05:54:37Z","Content":"Thank you for the advice! I just meant something that resembles those kind of engines, not something that\u0027s super overpowered or anything. Even just a new idle effect for a stock engine would be great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T06:11:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mitchz95**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:00:15Z","Content":"The new linear aerospike from [QuizTech Aero Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111691-WIP-1-0-2-QuizTech-Aero-Pack-v1-2-7-x-Updated-5-27-15-New-Mk2-Linear-Aerospike-More!) has a pretty nice blue glow. \n\nIt\u0027s based off of this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcW9kUUTfxY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
