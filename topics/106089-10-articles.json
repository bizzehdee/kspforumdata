Basically, radiators and heat pipes will now transfer X watts of heat from their parent part - into themselves for radiators, or into their target part for heat pipes. During early testing, this behavior resulted in the parent part getting cooled to ridiculously low temperatures (~4K) while the radiators would get very hot, with various undesirable gameplay consequences. Therefore, Nertea introduced a cooling floor, in which the heat transfer rate tapers down to zero as the parent part\u0027s temperature declines toward 273K.

If you use a Jumbo-64 w/ LFO and then just switch it to LH2/Ox and a cryo engine, you will always have worse dV. However, if you match the fuel mass between the two (which means more LH2/Ox tanks) you will see the improvement in performance and efficient. You\u0027ll also find that you will still end up conserving weight despite using more tanks because of the mass of LH2/Ox. Match the fuel mass and don\u0027t just switch the fuel in the tanks alone otherwise you aren\u0027t getting a real comparison of the two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T00:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vitasalato\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vitasalato\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003ECrzyrndm @\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766-1-02-Cryogenic-Engines-high-Isp-chemical-rockets%21-%2804-06-15-two-more-fixes%29/members/141320-mikegarrison\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emikegarrison\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally guys I\u0027ve tried to set up a launch of 66t (same fuel tanks), and i can\u0027t find any PRO for the Cryo.
