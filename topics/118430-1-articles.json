It is designed to make the creation of new FMs fast and easy, requiring far less work than writing a traditional plugin. B.R.O.K.E. handles the loading and processing of FMs automatically, all you have to do is define a few functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot interested in developing new FMs but want to play with some instead?

You could then spell out the various costs and incoming funds for the period, as well as having a good place to detail out the reputation loss/gain for activity (if that\u0027s where you choose to go).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Doughy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Doughy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eneeds to be compatible with State Funding tho that mod is awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo promises.

If/when that feature gets added then there will likely be more discussion on what\u0027s ok, but I\u0027ll keep in mind that probability is generally not a great idea. An increased cost seems reasonable (pay $10000 a year to keep a skeleton crew, or cut that out entirely and pay $40000 in 3 years when you need to reactivate the probe. You pay more overall, but less up front.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Kerbanomics as-is reputation controls the interest rate on loans and the amount of funds you receive each cycle (default is quarters). Currently you get a message saying how much you earn, and how much you spend on Crew costs. I\u0027d like to expand that to maybe provide total costs for everything (including KSC upgrades and launches) during that quarter, with an optional window to show totals and/or history. If I keep pay tied to reputation, then reputation decay also equates to pay decay, which is what I ultimately want. Gaining \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E rep could reset the decay \u0022grace period\u0022 so you have to keep doing things to keep earning money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do want to increase the management aspect, since KCT already adds some elements of that and this mod can then handle the funds side of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman\u0027s Race Into \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESpace\u003C/span\u003E Crippling Debt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMagico, I love u \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I didn\u0027t even know something like this existed.

So you might hire a scientist and train him to make the R\u0026amp;D center cost less each period (I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d want to balance it, but I might make it cost effective to leave a scientist or two on Kerbin [aka, the cost reductions in the building\u0027s costs outweighs the cost of the kerbal], but if you have too many than you end up paying more in salaries than it\u0027s worth). That makes it so you can hire crew and not have it totally bankrupt you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of several offers, with different requirements associated with them.

At the very least there will be a minimal \u0022We\u0027ll give you this much money based on your reputation (and maybe current funds)\u0022 which should be sustainable if you don\u0027t hire every Kerbal ever and don\u0027t launch 28 missions a quarter (it should be enough to cover a crew of maybe, a few moderate sized launches, and one or two fully funded active flights). Big missions would require you to save up money over multiple quarters or take out extra contracts to fund them right away.
