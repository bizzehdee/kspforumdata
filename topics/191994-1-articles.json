previous installs for engine reliability, Real Antenna instead of Remote Tech for comms, and Kerbalism for my life support mod (instead of TAC LS in previous installs), including reliability of everything else but engines (turned off the engine failures in Kerbalism since Test Lite handles that) and science collection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest Lite seems easy enough -- it works just about like Test Flight but without having to R\u0026amp;D engines before launch (instead, enable \u0022extra telemetry\u0022 during a launch to collect more flight data faster).\u00A0 Real Antenna is a bit different from Remote Tech, but doesn\u0027t look unfathomable -- antenna design and transmit power, along with distance and atmosphere if any, determine how fast you can send and receive data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s got me is Kerbalism.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t even gotten into crewed flight yet, and won\u0027t for a while (quite possibly never in this first save) -- where I\u0027m having problems is in gathering Science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the buttons to start various instruments running during my first real sounding rocket launch (Copper A -- a solid booster and liquid fueled sustainer, capable of about 130 km without a contract payload), opened the UI and flagged each data file for transmission as they became available -- and when the telemetry unit for the rocket (broken up after the fins burned off during reentry) crashed and I returned to the space center, I found that despite scanning temp and pressure Flying High over Shores and both High and Low over Forest (didn\u0027t start it on the pad, my mistake), analyzing telemetry continuously from launch, and running supersonic analysis all the time the vehicle was in that regime -- I had only 0.2 Science after the mission ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did see something afterward that suggest that, for instance, Supersonic Analysis would take \u003Cem\u003E30 minutes\u003C/em\u003E to complete with the built-in antenna in a WAC Corporal Telemetry Unit, and based on reading the online information, it appears there are similar (if shorter or longer) time requirements for other experiments.\u00A0 For a rocket with an average total flight time around ten minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich raises the question -- how does anyone get past the sounding rocket era with Kerbalism?!\u00A0 And why doesn\u0027t the Github documentation include hints on this subject (or why is that information hard to find)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T00:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, for whatever it\u0027s worth, I found the buttons for activating the science instruments (in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, even, though I presume that would be a mistake if you\u0027re running on batteries and need to take data for a contract after several days in flight -- like, say, a Lunar flyby).\u00A0 If they have buttons in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they can be bound to Action Groups, so I can manage my science collection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even better, partial data nets partial science.\u00A0 After bankrupting my first save in the new install (bought one too many KCT upgrade points), I started a new one, and was able to see in the Kerbalism status window as the data added up in whatever biome my sounding rocket flew over.\u00A0 A minute, two minutes, and I\u0027d get 0.1 of the available science.\u00A0 After a couple flights into the Upper Atmosphere, I was able to unlock the entire first (1 point) tier and start one or two nodes in the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure I agree with the Kerbalism model entirely -- reading out a thermometer or barometer is pretty much instantaneous, and the data you get \u003Cem\u003Eought to be\u003C/em\u003E pretty small -- a couple bytes, plus a short header, should be able to encode temperatures from liquid nitrogen up to boiling water (likely easiest to just send as Kelvins, in binary or BCD, and at this tech level 0.1 degree resolution is plenty).\u00A0 Same is true of the pressure readout -- zero to a couple hundred kPa, in tenths of a Pa (one Pa is close to a hundredth of a millibar, if you\u0027re more used to weather than physics) would be three or four bytes.\u00A0 My telemetry unit is supposed to be able to send 32 bps, or ~3 B/s (including start, stop and even or odd parity), and redundancy can stand in for error correction, just keep sending over and over.\u00A0 If you have four instruments, you queue their data in a preset order and sort it out on the ground (with 1950 tech, this would be effectively WWII radio teletype with frequency shift keying, or equivalent of modern 80m ham RTTY).\u00A0 I don\u0027t see it taking more than about ten seconds to get a good temp, pressure, and a recording of the signal that will let you analyze atmospheric (or exo-atmospheric) effects on the signal -- yet multiple flights that spent a minute or so in a particular biome didn\u0027t get fully completed temperature and pressure scans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nepphhh","CreatedById":198315,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T13:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can start collecting science in the flight scene as

Supersonic Flight Analysis was good for 2.5 Science points), so i can start R\u0026amp;D working, it works well enough.\u00A0 At this point, around January 1952, with half a dozen launches under my belt, I\u0027ve got most of the temperature and pressure scans completed for the biomes around Canaveral, and for Space Low; telemetry similar, about 2/3 done with Superonic Flight Analysis, and after three flights on \u0022Space Biological Science\u0022 contracts, about 2/3 of the bio sample data -- and I haven\u0027t even built an A-4/RD-100 class vehicle yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
