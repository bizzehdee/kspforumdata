My hard work did pay off, however, and it allowed me to take a grand tour of the Joolian system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the spacecraft arriving at Pol, and the little pink diamond is the first probe, sent to explore Pol:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wrzVtUG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wrzVtUG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Pol probe was, unfortunately, unable to land. It, like most of these, was ion-powered and the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esolar\u003C/span\u003E photovoltaic panels were insufficient to power the engine at a high enough thrust to overcome the gravity and make a gentle landing. So I took it back into a safe orbit. Oh well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Pol probe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BETsYcC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BETsYcC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after that, I took the mothership out of Pol orbit and sent it to bring my Tylo lander in for a nice close approach. I was trying to bring the Tylo periapsis down from the original burn point near Pol, but it wouldn\u0027t respond. It wasn\u0027t until after I started time acceleration that I realized it was because I was looking at the maneuver node\u0027s periapsis. I delete the node and see that the periapsis is....gone! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E I thought oh no prob, we\u0027re just on the edge of Tylo orbit, we got plenty of time to get a periapsis!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://memesters.com/images/items/home/challengeAccepted.png\u0022 alt=\u0022challengeAccepted.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah well try as I might, I couldn\u0027t bring the periapsis up. Every time I had to shut the engines off and let the batteries charge again, the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eplanet\u003C/span\u003E moon grew significantly closer. I was in danger of losing the whole mission, save for the Pol and maybe Tylo probe! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the last minute, I finally came up with an idea. If I detach both the Tylo and Vall probes, I\u0027ll drop a lot of weight. Maybe I\u0027d finally be able to get a periapsis! Well, it barely worked! Unfortunately I didn\u0027t take any pics during that crisis. (Every entry seemed to happen at night anyway, so wouldn\u0027t have looked like much.) I docked my Vall and Tylo lander with each other, and used some of the Vall lander\u0027s fuel to bring both into a stable orbit low over Tylo. My original plan was to dock both together and use some of the Vall lander\u0027s fuel to assist the Tylo lander, then have the Vall lander fly to Vall under its own power and land. This was to work because both landers were the same design for balance reasons, while Vall has far less gravity than Tylo. Unfortunately, they didn\u0027t have enough delta-v for both missions, but I was able to use the Vall lander\u0027s remaining fuel to assist the Tylo lander\u0027s descent, so at least I got the hardest part out of the way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo lander, with a tiny bit of fuel left:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SWP81RY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SWP81RY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t use this design!! It needs about 50-75% more delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the mothership shortly after averting that disaster:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e8eOTjj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e8eOTjj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was taken from medium orbit around Tylo (or rather, medium altitude in a highly eccentric orbit), and you can see Laythe next to Jool. Vall had just hidden itself behind Laythe on the right side--it might still be visible in fact. I saw a dot by Laythe and checked the map to make sure it was Vall, but didn\u0027t snap the pic in time before it went away to hide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell after a short break, it was time to take the probe off to bigger and better things. (A big green thing! And a better, blue thing that isn\u0027t actually bigger!) I decided to take advantage of the Oberth effect and increase my fuel efficiency. Or maybe I just wanted to be a badass. For whichever reason, I brought the Tylo periapsis down to 10km, and made an exit burn at periapsis:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OeD8B7j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OeD8B7j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the mothership\u0027s four engines lit in the center, with the three remaining ion probes\u0027 engines around the side. I would have brought the periapsis down further, but I didn\u0027t know how high the mountains were and couldn\u0027t check on the KSP wiki as I had no internet at the time. Oh well, maybe later I\u0027ll get a surface-scraping shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up, I took the mothership to Jool apoapsis and lowered the periapsis really low. I got a Laythe intersect. I launched the Laythe probe, then continued lowering periapsis until I got a Jool intersect, at which point I launched the Jool probe. Here\u0027s the two probes in space, and I\u0027m not sure how I got an image with both of them together *scratches head*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(edit) obviously, because that\u0027s the Jool probe and the Mothership - the Laythe probe isn\u0027t in the image! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EWIdnR4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EWIdnR4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I got the Jool probe into an aerobraking maneuver which looked pretty cool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/31FU0s4.png\u0022 alt=\u002231FU0s4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd coming up the other side, I get a beautiful sunrise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QIlnrPw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QIlnrPw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I am posting this, I am thinking to myself that I may have forgotten the Laythe probe for too long and lost it during time acceleration, so I\u0027m going to have to go back and check. But I think worst-case scenario I can take the Jool probe to Laythe instead--or maybe I should take a plane to Laythe? If the research tree ever gets any bigger, I\u0027m sure the points from a mission like that would pay off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s all I have for now!
