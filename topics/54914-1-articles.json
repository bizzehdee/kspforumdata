First off, POGO vibration (so named because it\u0027s similar to what you feel while riding a pogo stick--do they even still make those?) exists in *all* rockets, be they liquid- or solid-fueled. Solid-fuel rockets are less vulnerable to it purely because of their simplicity--they\u0027re just a big burning can of boom, so unless the vibration hits their natural resonant frequency and breaks up the casing, they\u0027re not going to break. Liquid-fueled rockets are more vulnerable because they have more complex parts, and thus have a lot more resonant frequencies to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe POGO-induced problems on Apollo 6 and Apollo 13 were *not* the same. On 13, the pogo oscillations in the second stage hit the resonant frequency of the stage\u0027s thrust structure, and got to a level that was threatening to damage it, so the automated systems performed an early Center Engine Cut Off to (successfully) try and break up that resonance. (CECO was a normal procedure on the first- and second-stages of the Saturn V, done to limit acceleration to 4.5g during the late stages of the burn without adding the complexity of throttling the engines; on 13, the second-stage CECO was performed early.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Apollo 6, however, the POGO vibrations hit the resonant frequency of two things--the Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter (the fairing over the Lunar Module that connected the Service Module to the third stage), and the fuel lines for the J-2 engines used in the second and third stages. This caused structural damage to the SLA (though not enough to cause a failure), but caused more serious issues for the engines. See, the engineers knew that the fuel lines would face heavy vibration and oscillation during their burns, and designed for this by putting two sections of rubber bellows in the line, which would allow it to flex and stretch/compress to absorb those distortions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn ground testing, this worked just fine, and they had no trouble on Apollo 4, either. However, during Apollo 6, because the POGO was strong and at the right frequency, SOMEthing went wrong, and they lost two engines on the second stage due to fuel starvation, and the third stage engine refused to restart for the simulated Trans-Lunar Injection burn. Frantic analysis and ground testing in a vacuum chamber isolated the cause: the liquid hydrogen fuel was freezing the rubber in the bellows and causing them to crack under vibration. This hadn\u0027t been detected earlier because all ground tests to this point had been conducted in air, allowing ice to form on the bellows, which then damped out the vibration. In the vacuum chamber, with no water vapor to freeze, no ice formed, and the bellows ruptured, puking LH2 out into the stage itself and starving the engine of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick redesign followed, replacing the bellows with bends in the line that could provide similar flex, retrofitted to all the other Saturn Vs (there was plenty of time to do this before the next Saturn V launch), and no more problems were experienced with this failure mode for the remainder of the Apollo program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: The dropped oxygen shelf wasn\u0027t actually directly related to the actual Apollo 13 accident. The sole cause was that the subcontractor that made the thermostat for the service module oxygen tanks had failed to redesign it to operate on higher voltage after NASA decided--and informed all contractors and subcontractors--to change the spacecraft\u0027s ground power from 28VDC to 60VDC. When, following a tanking test, the #2 oxygen tank refused to vent on its own (possibly related to the drop, though it had vented fine in the past and would vent fine again after a later test), NASA used a standard procedure to vent it and safe the spacecraft--turn on the tank heaters to warm it up and boil off the contents. The thermostat, not designed for the higher voltage used on the pad, promptly welded itself shut, and instead of the heaters cycling on and off to warm up the tank, they instead stayed on continuously for EIGHT HOURS. Temperatures inside the tank soared (somewhere between 600 and 1000 degrees F), and the insulation on the wiring inside the tank burned off as a result. Thus, that tank became a bomb due to the now-exposed wiring inside it, and eventually, activating the stirring fan inside the tank caused a spark that ignited either some residual insulation or the tank lining, causing the tank to overpressurize too quickly for the burst disc to handle, resulting in the tank exploding, and the rest is history.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
