Make kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go to orbital operations and click TRANS and then transfer to mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. once its done, wait until you are your desired orbit altitude above the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. then in orbital operations go to CIRC and click circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. now click landing autopilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. now choose the target by clicking select target on map\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. now click land on target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. now (thats alot of \u0027\u0027nows\u0027\u0027) just wait and it will (try) to land at your desired location\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. done!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
