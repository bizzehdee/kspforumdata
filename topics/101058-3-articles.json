I was thinking about how I could create/breed kerbals from my mature offworld bases. I am glad someone else has taken care of that.\n\u003E If you recruit a kerbal, does the civilian population size change? \n\u003E \n\u003E Does the population size stay constant (Provided they are provided all the necessary resources) or do they have a life expectancy? If they do have a life expectancy, are they recycled back into the resource system? I can\u0027t imagine jettisoning them makes sense if a space colony is trying to conserve their resources. I am not an expert on kerbal burial practices, other than the fact they sometimes explode or poof into nothingness.\n\u003E \n\u003E Growing a space colony is great. I am wondering if there is an endgame or advantage to growing the colony other than the challenge and kerbal recruitment. Kerbal recruitment alone makes this worthwhile for me.\n\u003E \n\u003E It occurred to me that if space tourism is involved, could this be used to generate funds?\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks\n\nRecruitment costs 1 population. Future releases will have the recruits cost additional resources of Inspiration and Education or Flight Experience, where you can recruit specific kerbal jobs directly.\n\nPopulation size will stay constant assuming you have resources. I don\u0027t have plans to implement life expectancy. It\u0027s assumed that your civies are reproducing to maintain population size. They\u0027ll reproduce to grow more when your population is big enough. There is no burying a kerbal in space. There\u0027s Koylent green. If I do have life expectancy then the dieing kerbals will produce the waste resources. Right now and in the next release if they die from starvation they\u0027ll be jettisoned.\n\nI originally built this mod to fill the one niche I didn\u0027t see filled. There\u0027s all sorts of in-situ resource mods (and this will start using those ISRU soon as I have a feel for the balance now) but none of them allowed producing new crew members. This mod fills that hole. \n\nSpace tourism right now is not used to generate funds but may eventually be. The space university and flight schools that will be in the next release will generate reputation when you recruit from them.\n\nOn the question of conservation of mass I\u0027ve come up with the solution to that one: Having a new kerbal \u0022born\u0022 among the current population will cost his mass in food. This removes mass from the water/food cycle. You would have to get more water to have more crew. When in kerbin space with the civilian docking pod growth won\u0027t incur his expense as the new civilian is \u0022shipped\u0022 in from kerbin.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T18:12:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07**"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:54:10Z","Content":"Some points of thought.\n\n1.

They are all tied to consumption of a single kerbol, But your mod is looking at many many more kerbals on top of those that are named. I could see some one making a ship that is absolutely preposterous housing thousands of civilians. That could be a rather large load of parts just to house the food, waste, air, and water components...considering the scale and all.\n\nBut hey I will be watching, right now I am not playing, rather not until release. though I guess that raises other questions like...how will your parts get into space with the new aerodynamics system. That could be one crazy lift and I have done some crazy lifts. Interesting times ahead."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T13:59:19Z","Content":"I rebalanced the load last night on resources such that 1 civilian kerbal will consume 1kg of food and 1kg of water every kerbin day. I\u0027ll add tonight the use of oxygen and CO2. I noticed the consumption rates were configurable for TAC so I can\u0027t really balance the civies around it. I thus balanced them around the above metric. It changes some of the key metrics in my mod:\n\nCivilian Growth will consume 105kg worth of food when it happens. This obeys conservation of mass.\n\nCivilian death through decay will produce food equivalent to their mass. It\u0027s like dune I guess.\n\nCivilian population no longer decays when there\u0027s less food than pop. It will start decaying when one of their needs is not met. That is food, water, or oxygen are 0.\n\nEach farm module is scaled to support the size of kerbal population it was intended to.\n\nSmall hydroponic farm supports a population of roughly 10 kerbals and carries food store enough for 10 reproduction output. (1 ton of food/water)\n\nSmall biosphere supports 25 kerbals and has food store for 25 reproductions (2.5 tons of food/water).\n\nLarge Biosphere supports 50 kerbals and has food store for 50 reproductions (5 tons food/water)\n\nFarm biodome supports 60 kerbals and food store for 60 repro.\n\nRecyclers can convert the waste produced by kerbals back into biomass/water at a rate of 1kg /3hours. Should the recyclers not be able to keep up with waste production excess waste will be discarded into space.\n\nall farms will convert 1kg of co2 to 1kg of o2 every kerbin day at the rate to match the size of population they support.\n\nThis ends up with the netherdyne farms being very efficient at supporting a crew and sufficient for the size of population they match. You\u0027ll need extra farms to cover the reproduction cost if you plan on your colonists reproducing."},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T23:47:05Z","Content":"The death of a Kerbal should reclaim both water and \u0022food\u0022 (through may be nutrients for growing food could be better?). Assuming kerbals have a similar chemical to water make up as humans you would be looking at a 65/35 (apx) split in Water/Minerals. This value varies as certain tissues have less water...like fat or bone. But reclaiming that would be necessary with out some way of replenishing your resources.\n\nThough really...on Earth it is done for us as humans decay after death. Think about the water we drink...it has been around for billions of years. Eaten and drunk, then pooped and pissed out of a myriad of organisms for all that time.
