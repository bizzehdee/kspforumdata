I was thinking about how I could create/breed kerbals from my mature offworld bases. I am glad someone else has taken care of that.\u003Cp\u003EIf you recruit a kerbal, does the civilian population size change? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the population size stay constant (Provided they are provided all the necessary resources) or do they have a life expectancy? If they do have a life expectancy, are they recycled back into the resource system? I can\u0027t imagine jettisoning them makes sense if a space colony is trying to conserve their resources. I am not an expert on kerbal burial practices, other than the fact they sometimes explode or poof into nothingness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrowing a space colony is great. I am wondering if there is an endgame or advantage to growing the colony other than the challenge and kerbal recruitment. Kerbal recruitment alone makes this worthwhile for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurred to me that if space tourism is involved, could this be used to generate funds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecruitment costs 1 population. Future releases will have the recruits cost additional resources of Inspiration and Education or Flight Experience, where you can recruit specific kerbal jobs directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopulation size will stay constant assuming you have resources. I don\u0027t have plans to implement life expectancy. It\u0027s assumed that your civies are reproducing to maintain population size. They\u0027ll reproduce to grow more when your population is big enough. There is no burying a kerbal in space. There\u0027s Koylent green. If I do have life expectancy then the dieing kerbals will produce the waste resources. Right now and in the next release if they die from starvation they\u0027ll be jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally built this mod to fill the one niche I didn\u0027t see filled. There\u0027s all sorts of in-situ resource mods (and this will start using those ISRU soon as I have a feel for the balance now) but none of them allowed producing new crew members. This mod fills that hole. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace tourism right now is not used to generate funds but may eventually be. The space university and flight schools that will be in the next release will generate reputation when you recruit from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the question of conservation of mass I\u0027ve come up with the solution to that one: Having a new kerbal \u0022born\u0022 among the current population will cost his mass in food. This removes mass from the water/food cycle. You would have to get more water to have more crew. When in kerbin space with the civilian docking pod growth won\u0027t incur his expense as the new civilian is \u0022shipped\u0022 in from kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T18:12:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome points of thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I don\u0027t know if it was me or TAC LS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022michaelhester07\u0022 data-cite=\u0022michaelhester07\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I designed this independent of other mods which do a similar thing as there is no existing public framework for unfocused ship simulation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegolith \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt includes a generator as well as harvesters - they all work off of the same base classes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI should have said that they won\u0027t work with the civilian population regulator class that I had to make from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit again: OnFixedUpdate() is not being called when I override it.
