So I downloaded the source code and spent a few hours trying to figure out how to actually compile it and what some of codes do. And then I wanted to see if I could make some improvements, but certain individuals have advised me to try and get permission before distributing a modified (other than translation) copy of MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe my improvements to be very helpful and convenient and would like to get a permission to continue on. here is a complete list of improvements I have made:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SI Unit converter code has been re-written to suit the Chinese way of counting, which contains a term for ten thousand. it is awkward without this change because it would be like saying \u0022 two hundred hundreds\u0022 in English. The new code also allows for other units to be added that do not have exponents of multiples of 3 but are commonly used, like the centimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-modified fuel flow simulation algorithm to ignore intake air as a resource so you can see your dV for air breathing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added 4 buttons for HDG in the surface reference tab of the Smart A.S.S menu for north south east and west.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added a slider for pitch in the surface reference tab of the Smart A.S.S menu. (I find this extremely useful)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added a 0 degree button for roll in the surface reference tab of the Smart A.S.S menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added a hold current heading and altitude button for Space plane guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Incorporated improved staging codes for staging control from unreleased version of MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-incorporated auto stage to next one stage button, but in the auto launch menu instead of throttle control, also form unreleased version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Modified stage delta V info chart to be shorter in normal mode, excluding burn time and max TWR, but including mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Various modifications to the size of windows and other GUI elements so they fit rightly without blocking others, and functions better. For example altitude text box for Spaceplane guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wGRiO91.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wGRiO91.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture Plans:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Limit to velocity mode for throttle control.
