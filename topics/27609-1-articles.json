Make sure you\u0027re in a fairly circular low-kerbin-orbit, and then start burning prograde when the moon is just coming up over the horizon (if you look at the map of Kerbin from above, the Mun should be at a ~90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle to you, I think), keeping an eye on your orbit in the map view. You should get a close enough orbit to enter the Mun\u0027s SOI, and then you can burn retrograde to establish an orbit. If you plan this out ahead of time with Maneuver Nodes, you can fine-tune it and have a better chance of hitting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Mind if I see a screenshot of your craft? Once you\u0027re in LKO, you don\u0027t need a massive amount of fuel for a Munar mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: You need to kill your velocity a bit earlier, then. Burn retrograde until your velocity is extremely low, this should kill off your horizontal speed, so you\u0027ll just fall directly down. Then you can keep applying short bursts of thrust to keep your velocity fairly low, making sure it\u0027s below 10m/s when you actually hit the ground. This is going to waste a lot more fuel than just freefalling until you get close, but I found it really helped with my first landing, until you get a feel for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI certainly don\u0027t have the best way of doing it, but those are the methods I used when I was first messing about with Munar missions, and I found they helped a lot.
