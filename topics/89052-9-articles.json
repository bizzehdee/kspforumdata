I never understood the whole complaining abotu bug reports anyways? All mods ive ever released (this game or other games) i release as is, and while i do look at bug reports and take them into consideration for improvements, i feel in no way obligated to fix or change any mods ive made. Why cant the modders just make it super clear they have 0 support for this or that version, or whatnot, and will ignore issues arising from use of those versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow personally i get really ticked off when some modder adds code that disables the mod on a specific version of the game, and all mods i currently run (that have any restrictions put in them in teh 1st place) have been custom recompiled for my own use to work regardless of what game im running. While i strongly disagree with the limiting bs that many modders have done to restrict what users can do, i do still respect them, and their hard work, and i dont release anything without at least asking before hand (most of it is a 1 minute edit, so isnt even worth the time to upload). Anyways, liek someone here said, i do reccomend a basic tutorial be made for the inexperienced modded as to how to at a bare minimum recompile someone\u0027s mod with some changes, such as removal of limiting code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T01:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProtip: we did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t work. \u003Cstrong\u003EWe still got blamed\u003C/strong\u003E, and flooded with support requests we couldn\u0027t do anything for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot just requests we could ignore, but threads saying hey, mod X breaks KSP, don\u0027t use it!

It\u0027s been floating around in various areas of this forum how to do this, in more or less tutorials. Hell, there even is a one-click tool on github that was created just to remove the win64 check of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m amazed the discussion hasn\u0027t moved anywhere over the last twenty pages. The stuff I read here is the same that was posted on page 1 and 2. The problem is that modders have a very limited method of handling support requests. Usually they are restricted to \u0022one thread per mod\u0022, where everything gets piled in: Dev notes, bug reports, support requests, etc. . This was enough for a long time, but with the ever growing popularity even the most active modder simply can\u0027t keep up with it anymore. It also causes the problem of the same questions being asked over and over again, because nobody will read through the 8000 posts in the FAR thread alone. And a surprisingly large number of people don\u0027t bother to search for a solution at all and just slam the mod author at once with some nonsense bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Win64 \u0022shutdown\u0022by modders is just one symptom of the underlying issue of the too large userbase without having access to tools to handle that userbase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 0.24 Win64 was still okay-ish, but it continuously degraded with 0.25 and especially 0.9. And now that Squad has given up on Win64 and will not offer such a version with 1.0, it\u0027s best to bite the bullet now and set up a Linux dualboot if you cannot keep your game in the 32bit memory limit.
