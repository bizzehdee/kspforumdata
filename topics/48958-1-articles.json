Last night, when I was first going through 0.22 I spent about 15 minutes trying to decide where to invest my science points, and I felt it was an actually meaningful decision. If I got everything I wanted up front, I wouldn\u0027t have to think about if I want to put RCS and Fuel Lines off for a while while I get a few more basic parts. More than that, I\u0027m having to think about how to do more with less, something I never needed to do before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll grant you it\u0027s likely not realistic and that the progression might need some tweaks, but as far as gameplay goes I have no complaints. As a matter of fact, 0.22 has kind of been instrumental in showing me what \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t \u003C/em\u003E be done with a particular suite of parts. Like trying to go to the Mun and come back with no battery power or solar cells. Yes I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some madman here who could do it blindfolded, but I lost a lander that way and so I was forced to think how to act within my means. That\u0027s still a good thing as far as I\u0027m concerned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess that\u0027s just my opinion anyway and it\u0027s only based on a few hours of work. Still I\u0027m pleased thus far and I have a reason to go to places like Bop now. Of course returning soil samples collected in person from Bop will be a challenge but then that\u0027s part of the fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"techonce","CreatedById":35508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T17:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JeanHavoc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JeanHavoc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll grant you it\u0027s likely not realistic and that the progression might need some tweaks, but as far as gameplay goes I have no complaints.
