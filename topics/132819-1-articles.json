It would appear in sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never used it so I thought oh well, I am sure this happened to a few other parts I never noticed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night the orbital super-collider from another mod vanished from the available parts in the VAB, rendering the space station core **invalid**. Again parts bought, researched and in this case used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I thought I would drop all\u00A0my mods and reinstall, this went fine CKAN yay and resinstalled the exact same set of mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI stupidly did a Steam Validate and it wiped out me 64-bit mod so I redid that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can load up my save file and my game loads just fine. I can enter any building but I can not exit! I can\u0027t even exit the game. I can do whatever I want in said building, like if I was stuck in the research building I can look around, buy/research stuff or the contracts building I can browse and accept/deny contracts...I just can\u0027t leave. I can not leave the game either, I can get the system menu to appear but none of the buttons work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI started a new game and I poked around for about 2 minutes and it seemed fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI checked my persistent file and my buildings were still set to 1 so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny ideas on how to fix this without starting over again?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile I am going to poke around and see what I can find.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-24T01:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2016 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kurdain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurdain","CreatedById":154984,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T02:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI uninstalled kopernicus, which dumped the Ascelpious and Saru installs and it seems to be working, I had both these running previously so I am not sure why it\u0027s affecting it now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestions?
