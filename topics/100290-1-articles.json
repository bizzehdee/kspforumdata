The part itself would probually look a lot like a docking port and would be able to operate under power and holds positon (consuming an electric charge) or it could be set to a free rotation mode where it can freely move! My current idea to how it would work is as follows:\n\nThings you can adjust with tweakables\n\n-Inverse rotation direction\n\n-Change rotation speed (slide bar like that for fuel or thrust)\n\n-Free Rotation (toggles motorized and non motorized mode)\n\nThings you can adjust with action groups\n\n-Toggle Free Rotation\n\n-Rotate clockwise (effected by inverse of rotation direction)\n\n-Rotate counterclockwise (effected by inverse of rotation direction)\n\nFeel free to suggest better ideas onto how a system like this should be controlled and make sure to give me some feedback on wheter or not you think including this part in 1.0 would be a good idea or not!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T08:59:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DerpenWolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T08:58:03Z","Content":"While I agree, I think[Hinges are more important due to the coming addition of fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108890-With-Fairings-becoming-stock-we-NEED-stock-hinges). we need to be able to tuck things inside easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T09:10:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While I agree, I think[Hinges are more important due to the coming addition of fairings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108890-With-Fairings-becoming-stock-we-NEED-stock-hinges). we need to be able to tuck things inside easier.\n\nI agree that hinges are a bit more needed.
