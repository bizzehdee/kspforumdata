Not very aerodynamic but doable.\\\n\nOption 2: orbital reconfiguration. You have two tubes attached in T shape. Attach them in line on top of the orbital vehicle, then move to the right position in the orbit.\n\nOption 3: this tower is asking for trouble for the landing time. Redesign the landing stage, e.g, attach a wide, flat tank with engine to the rover\u0027s tail, then during the landing make it tip onto its wheels. Or give it a straddling lifter, reverse U shape. Personally, that would be my choice This thing will maneuver poorly and you\u0027ll have trouble landing it.\n\nMy personal recommendation: attach the tank and an engine to the end of the rover. Give it a single pair of landing legs, angled upwards, so that it will flip onto its wheels after a vertical landing. Have an engineer handy for fixing the broken wheels; you\u0027ll need him for normal operation anyway. (these wheels are fragile!). And move that reaction wheel into the rover. It\u0027s a very useful thing once you remap rover controls from WSAD to arrows or something else.\n\n(allow me to name this lander style \u0022Earwig configuration\u0022:\n\n![uvvtnRC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uvvtnRC.jpg)\n\n...one more option: give your rover flying capability. Driving long distances gets extermely tedious, and you can dump some extra fuel tanks shortly before landing, to land full."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T06:42:25Z","Content":"Set the top of the stack as the root part, save it as a sub-assembly, then put it on top of a rocket.\n\nOr flip it upside-down and build the lifter under it.\n\nYou may need a bug ugly fairing to keep it out of the airstream on launch though, time to get creative. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nMy personal favourite is to build a skycrane type landing stage with the tanks parallel to the lander and radial engines... then the lander can be launched facing the \u0022right\u0022 way.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nYou can get some pretty funky things to orbit, I can\u0027t remember where this was going... but it worked nicely ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![screenshot1289.png](http://s14.postimg.org/vlf47476p/screenshot1289.png)\n\nI got bored with slow rovers, that\u0027ll do 150km/h\u002B on the mun ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T06:46:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 06:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T07:48:14Z","Content":"\u003E I got bored with slow rovers, that\u0027ll do 150km/h\u002B on the mun ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nfrom 0 to all wheels busted in 3 seconds ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T08:55:42Z","Content":"Ahh, but vernors for \u0022soft\u0022 landings.
