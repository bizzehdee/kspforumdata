The power output offered by the panels is quite small compared to their weight, leading to the situations we see with the KSP ion engine. If a more powerful electric drive were added to the game, players would need to add \u003Cstrong\u003Every large\u003C/strong\u003E arrays of solar panels to their ships. The mass of these arrays would be considerable, leading to poor thrust to weight ratios and long burn times. Despite being heavy, the saving in fuel would lower the overall mass required, especially on high dV interplanetary transfers. This could make solar electric drives competitive with nuclear thermal rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative would be to use nuclear electric drive. This would be powered by a small nuclear reactor, which would weigh a lot less than the huge array of solar panels.
