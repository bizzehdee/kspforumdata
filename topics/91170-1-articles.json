It seems to me like the game always has one of these up. All you have to do is put a satellite in orbit around each body and you can instafulfill the contract by transmitting 0 science data of gravity scan. Then it just respawns over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on the fence about this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand, it was a nice motivation to actually use satellites, probes and such, which I previously had absolutely no use for whatsoever. It\u0027s actually been quite motivating to launch quite a few satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it totally blows away every other contract. Especially those SUPER annoying \u0022Test X part in Y place\u0022 contracts. As long as you have a satellite in orbit around all of the bodies you\u0027ve \u0022explored\u0022 so far, you have basically infinite resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that contracts really need re-working. They should directly reward different ways of playing the game- like \u0022Land probe on X body\u0022 vs \u0022Land a manned craft and return it safely\u0022, \u0022Put satellite into orbit\u0022, \u0022Put super-heavy object on the ground safely\u0022, \u0022Land on a particular point on a body\u0022, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current contracts divide into three groups- \u0022Stuff I\u0027d do anyway\u0022, like explore another celestial body, \u0022Stuff I\u0027m never gonna spend my time doing no matter how many imaginary points you give me\u0022, like \u0022Test explosive decoupler on escape trajectory from Mun\u0022 or \u0022Plant the fourth flag on Mun\u0022, and \u0022Stuff that gives every reward possible whilst being fun to play\u0022, which is exclusively \u0022..... transmit science from orbit\u0022. Those still need a little nerf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to say that contracts should really be mostly in the 3rd category.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
