It\u0027d be nice to find out exactly *why*, in that example, they decided to go with thirty little engines instead of a smaller number of larger engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, I\u0027d also want to get his opinions on various rocket designs, ranging from real-world ones like the SpaceX Falcon series, to studied-but-never-built ones like the Saturn V derivatives proposed in the late 60s (including the S-ID \u0022stage-and-a-half\u0022 version of the first stage, which would work like the Atlas booster and jettison the outboard engines once they were no longer strictly necessary, though unlike Atlas, the proposal was that this would allow recovery and reuse of the outboard engines), to even possible ways that he could have further developed the N-1 for the future, had it succeeded. (Again, my first thought on the N-1 is making it a stage-and-a-half first stage design, jettisoning either the outer ring of engines, or, if they were intended to act as a toroidal aerospike, jettisoning the *inner* core engines...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T20:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of larger engines was due to...
