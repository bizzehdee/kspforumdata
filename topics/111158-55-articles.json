We had to do that in one of the forums I moderated for for SimCity. The only problem we ran into with the IP addresses is that if the original spammer used Internet access from a university, library, or other public area, and we blocked the IP address, we would often (and unavoidably) block access to those with legitimate accounts that had the same IP as the offending party.
