Science, reputation and funds are all relevant information, but the funds section lack a representation for funds gained for completing contracts during the mission.\n\nOften you get a lot of funds during the mission for completed contracts. And I think these funds should be represented in the funds section when the mission is completed.\n\nI think you should clearly be able to see what funds came from the crafts recovery and what the mission brought in. quite often contacts are only fulfilled when the crew returns to Kerbin. Maybe that should also be presented?\n\nI hope it was a reasonable suggestion. I don\u0027t think it would take much work to implement it."}]}
