The second bullet point to me seems to imply I target a group and it chooses available relays from that, so I could target all my GEO sats from one probe instead of having to settle with just one. This sounds like a very nice addition since my main issue with the current system is that if the targeted relay is obstructed by Kerbin or whatever else, the probe will lose connection with no way of changing it.
