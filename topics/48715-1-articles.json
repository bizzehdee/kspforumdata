How much delta vatever and how big rockets have to be and how long to to do this and where to do that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never did any calculations at all. I also don\u0027t use any mods (except KAS pipes and struts which are nice but nearly never used it to do something besides a refill test)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have gotten probes to the mun, minimus, eve and duna and did a lot of docking on my station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd returned savely from minimus and the mun, but looking at how easylie I landed on duna, I think I can possibly also return from there with a small orbitting tank station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... I didn\u0027t find those things very hard. Most things worked in the first try, some failed because of small design flaws on my vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Question now is: Can I keep going on like that? Or will I hit a point, where just playing around won\u0027t work anymore?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see that getting home from eve can be a huge challenge. and getting to the outer planets too. But with a small gravity swing even the outer planets should be reachable by just eating your way through the different orbits of other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your opinion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T07:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 07:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Leberschnitzel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderB","CreatedById":17544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T00:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust keep doing what you\u0027re doing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough if you get into bigger, multi-planet missions, you\u0027d notice it\u0027d be really annoying to have to send a load of refueling missions, which you wouldn\u0027t have to if you packed enough delta-v in the original design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy fix: get Kerbal Engineering Redux, and the delta-v chart, and have a quick look every now and then to see how you\u0027re getting along with delta-v for your mission.

The best places for using ideas like delta-v and TWR are in making minimalist designs or in attempting very difficult maneuvers (Eeloo, Moho, Tylo, or Eve return missions, for instance.) You can always strap on more rockets and go for it, but you will eventually run into issues with part counts and the like on very large vehicles.
