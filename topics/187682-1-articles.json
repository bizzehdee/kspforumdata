This was pretty easy to achieve on Minmus with very small craft but the Mun seems to demand much, much larger craft. I was wondering whether deorbiting an asteroid would work. I already have one from another contract and I have enough fuel in my re-direction craft that I think I can smash the thing into the Mun and hopefully break that stupid seismic sensor. I was hoping someone could tell me whether this would register on the experiment before I go through the trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-25T23:12:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2019 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T03:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why it wouldn\u0027t, but I\u0027ve never actually tried - or even thought about that.\u00A0 I know what I\u0027m doing tomorrow though....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T09:22:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly one way to be sure: give it a try. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(But I would be rather surprised if it didn\u0027t work.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t know if getting 100% seismic science on the Mun is per se harder than on Minmus. What is harder is to hit close to your deployed seismic sensor, and because distance plays a role in the amount of seismic science you get that will make it harder. Another issue is that the craft (or parts of it) need to be destroyed by the crash. I guess you are not planning to soft land the asteroid, but it can become an issue if the crashing craft (or asteroid) is outside physics distance.
