Has any thought been given to looking into this and/or researching the old code to see what was done, and how to implement the same in KSP2? Simply rotating a vessel in KSP2 has a noticeable impact on orbital parameters and this was something that was experienced throughout much of KSP1\u0027s early access (and IIRC, even past the 1.0 release).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-18T17:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2023 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-18T05:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Mortoc\u0027s Dev Diary 18 was very interesting.\u00A0 Any chance we can get a second installment where he goes into more detail about the CBT system and what it\u0027s like to port the existing work over to that?\u00A0\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso, \u0022...new earth-shaking architectures are possible\u0022 - does this mean we can get the towering mountains near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP back?\u00A0 They were fun to fly around!\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe\u0027d love to see some updates on the HDRP portion as well!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDev Diary 10 and Developer Insights # 2 showcased the promise of unique explosions and interesting destruction graphics for our glorious failures... but the UI choice of the very large and opaque Flight Report immediately pops up and\u00A0blocks the screen.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t let us watch our ships explode and scatter.\u00A0 Any chance we can tame that thing?\u00A0 Tone it down or leave it off until the player presses ESC or something?\u00A0 Unique explosions based on the parts we\u0027ve added and the physics involved is very Kerbal.\u00A0 The Immediate Flight Report Pop-Up is not.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVersion 0.1.0.0 looked very different from the ESA event videos I\u0027ve seen - however version 0.1.1.0 (the patch) has many elements in common with the videos we saw, notably the Maneuver Nodes and\u00A0some bugs like the endlessly scrolling notification (yellow barred text) bug.\u00A0 Was the EA release version a different branch from what we saw in the ESA videos (and is the current version mostly similar to what the ESA attendees got to play)?\u00A0 If so - can you lift the veil on what\u0027s going on behind the scenes and why the EA Release looked so different from the ESA?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWill HOTAS support for spaceplane flight be introduced during any part of the EA?\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-18T12:55:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2023 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JoeSchmuckatelli\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moons","CreatedById":227067,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-18T10:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhow far the \u003Cstrong\u003Esteam-release compared to the internal release\u003C/strong\u003E (is there already a lot more completed (beyond assets) in the internal version?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs there any estimate on when the different \u003Cstrong\u003Eroadmap targets \u003C/strong\u003Ewill be reached realistically and roughly\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhow much time is planned roughly for V1.0 (this is important to people because its hows how much time will be invested in this game and what to expect) - for Example 6 Months/1\u002B Year/2\u002B Years etc.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nto me thats important i saw for example an EA that was pretty rough - so it was clear that dev time planned was short it would be a flop - said game then stated that 1.0 is planned in 3-6 months wh ich to me as a consumer made clear what was planned and realistic and that that game would never become much different etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMechanics:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwill the game mechanics be adjusted to feel more like KSP1 - or will the game stay or try to be more different than KSP1?
