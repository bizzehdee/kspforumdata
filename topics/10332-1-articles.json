I will, in fact buy it in about a week, but until then I will have to resort to the demo version. This brings me to my main point. Is it somehow possible to run Mechjeb on the demo version of the game? I recently found out about this add-on and I\\\u0027d really want to give it a go. Perhaps there is an older version that I could download?\n\nIf there isn\\\u0027t, I suppose i\\\u0027ll just have to wait. \n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T18:59:44Z","Content":"Nope. only .14 right now can use it."},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T19:00:44Z","Content":"Plugin support was added in the most recent version of KSP.
