I\u0027ll get frustrated by incomplete features that have been incomplete for a very long time, with multiple requests over that time period to actually sort them out that haven\u0027t been heeded. - Rocket wobble is a great example, and Unity engine and Development Asymptotes a poor excuse. 2.5m parts have been around for a long time and still are very poor. Extra rigidbody connections, which are placed at a spacing determined by the difference in mass of the two parts could solve this. See? A possible solution!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr how about a lot of talk about how we could stick a Kerbal on SRB, even an endorsed comic showing it so - when in actuality we can\u0027t without having some way of spawning the Kerbal first, as apparently seats aren\u0027t crewable! Look at it this way - Assign Kerbal to seat, seat starts with the Kerbal\u0027s data (this can be done with ANY part at all, I have made seats able to do this part) and then the seat during physics loading spawns a new part, which is the Kerbal. They should have all the code they need available to do that in their hands, very quickly - same with the previous suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth have had quite a few requests floating around to be done and I know Devs have had contact with both.
