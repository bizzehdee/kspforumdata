Sometimes you need more living space than crew capacity. Yes you can store the scientists in the science lab but their bed rooms will be in a different module. Being on your own for 5 years is mean to the Kerbals, as I imagine them being social creatures like humans. But you also don\u0027t want to limit them to just 2 or so other people, that gets tiring over enough time. I imagine a crew of 4-15 to be a reasonable number for a space voyage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know I wish we had to worry about Kerbals more. I want more to do with them. I\u0027ve long been a proponent of the Kerbal/Probe dichotomy as a feature. Right now the only reason to send Kerbals anywhere is so you can see faces and walk on the surface. Probes are cheaper, smaller, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution is for Kerbals to have sanity, health, and life support mechanics, but you get immediate control. Whereas probes are timeless hunks of metal that you have to wait for lightspeed delay to control them, either manually with delay (for something like a Mun or Minmus mission)\u00A0or using a simple flight computer which you upload commands to. There could also be station modules which are science experiments which have to be operated by Kerbals, like the science lab now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Kerbals had sanity, health, and life support, bigger ships like this would be necessary or recommended for gameplay reasons. They can fly the ship in the small little cabin of the Mk1-2 pod, but for months or years long mission their health and sanity will deplete. Without food they\u0027ll die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I role play these aspects because I want them in stock.
