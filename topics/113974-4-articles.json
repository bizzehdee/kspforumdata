Now, once again, frost clung stubbornly to a waiting rocket\u0027s skin. Now, once again, a Kerbal sat in a tiny capsule atop it. Beyond the cosmodrome, and beyond the skeletal, blackened forest surrounding it, the first hints of orange and red fringed the lower leaves of the trees. This, and the unseasonably cool day signaled that fall would soon arrive. In Ussari, the fall never lasted long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, Valentina stared out the expansive windows of the Mission Control building, trying to calm herself. The sky overhead was slightly darkened by a high overcast. The weather center didn\u0027t expect it to delay the launch. Valentina hugged herself against the slight chill in the room, silently wishing it would. Gone were the crowds of spectators, the few who \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E shown up were kept outside by very serious-looking security. The launch would be televised, of course, now on a five minute delay. There was still anticipation in the air, but it was guarded. As guarded as the building now was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella, once again, was coordinating the mission. She quietly went through the final procedures with the engineers at their stations. So far, everything had gone smoothly. Valentina rubbed her arms, and took a long breath that shuddered just slightly. It had gone smoothly before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Terminal countdown commencing,\u0022 Dibella said into her headset mic, \u0022how are you doing,\u003Cem\u003E Sila?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All systems nominal, checklist complete.

Valentina took another slow breath. She wondered how many others were consciously trying not to hyperventilate. The voice was here too, always here, a susurrus of madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Sem...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Shest...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Pyat...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Auto sequence start...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, thunder rolled outside. The sound of the four kerosene main engines and their four vernier counterparts roaring to life was quite unlike the the chaotic noise of the older solid-fueled launchers. The ground still rumbled, the windows still shook, but it was ordered. Tight. Controlled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All engines running.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Tree...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Dva...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Od\u00E9en...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s breath caught. For a moment, mission control was once again filled with that awful, pregnant stillness. And then...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Liftoff, we have liftoff. The clock is running.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were no cheers, no shouts, just the sound of a few dozen people breathing again. It took Valentina a moment to join them. She watched nervously as the long, green rocket lumbered past the launch towers, then rolled to the proper azimuth. She could do nothing, now, but watch. After a few moments, it disappeared into the cloud deck, leaving trail of matching grey smoke, and even watching was denied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have planned shutdown of engines two and four.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E copies, confirm engine shutdown, all lights still green.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina turned her attention to the array of screens as Dibella and the controllers went through their procedures with frustrating calmness. A video feed from the hull of a fuel tank showed a shaky image of the gleaming white top of the cloud deck. She watched, as the image slowly changed, the clouds stretched off into the distance, then finally met the sky. The horizon gradually crept towards the middle of the screen. The shaking began to get worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E, control, you\u0027re coming up on staging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn engineer slowly counted down, then the image on the screen suddenly went to static.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s heart stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stumbled back when the feed sputtered and then returned, the spent first stage just visible as it began to tumble away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Staging is good, ullage burnout, secondary engine at one hundred percent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E copies, confirm staging.

Even the video was now useless, all Valentina could do was watch the telemetry display. The numbered blinked and stuttered from the weak signal. Trying to distract herself, she began going over Kerblish verb conjugations in her head. She\u0027d teased enough from the further pages of the manual to know that this was the most dangerous part of the ascent. An abort from this speed and altitude was possible, in theory, but the gee forces from such a steep descent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pushed the thought out of her mind, tried to breathe, tried to focus on something else. Words. Words. Words! She looked away from the screens. At any moment, the call would come, any moment! Something had gone wrong again and now--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E, control, we have SECO.

Telemetry confirmed, you are go for at least five orbits.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thick, heavy silence stretched out. Some machine or other beeped softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, \u0022\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S L\u0417FT \u042D\u0414\u042F\u003C/em\u003E, I did it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room \u003Cem\u003Eexploded\u003C/em\u003E. Valentina\u0027s hearing was still off, it probably wasn\u0027t as loud as it seemed. But then again, it just might have been. Cheers, whoops, shouts of joy filled the cavernous room. Papers and clipboards flew to the ceiling, one of which took out a light fixture but no one seemed to care. All around, people were hugging or shaking hands. Someone ran up to Dibella and gave her a big kiss on the cheek before running off again, leaving the former staring wide-eyed and gaping. Then someone tried to do the same to Valentina, but encountered her elbow instead, which by an odd coincidence arrived at the same place at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlashes and explosions outside made her jump, convinced something \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E had gone wrong, before she realized they were fireworks. Small monitors in the control room playing news broadcasts showed people flowing out into the streets, waving flags, hanging from light poles. And in the tiny broadcast room in the back of the mission control building, Mikhail Kerman was so busy dancing around and not standing by his station that he was singly responsible for Tercella Kerman swearing on a live international broadcast. No one seemed to care, though. They had done it, they had finally \u003Cem\u003Edone\u003C/em\u003E it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA burst of garbled sound came from the speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right, all right, quiet down!\u0022 Dibella yelled over the din, trying to regain her composure, \u0022we still have a mission to run here!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did not copy that, \u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E, say again,\u0022 she said into her mic as the noise died down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, do you have a problem?\u0022 Tercella said, \u0022I just had the oddest bunch of red lights come on up here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella looked nervously over her control panel, rolled her eyes, then walked to an engineer still sitting on his own panel, and slapped him upside the head. He hopped down sheepishly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... disregard control, they all went green again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s get back on track here, give me a status report, \u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy... oxygen 99%, batteries 98%, flight fuel 94%, re-entry fuel 100%. All systems nominal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella looked to the massive central monitor that plotted Tercella\u0027s predicted course on a map, \u0022we\u0027re in this for the long run now. Power off antennas 1, 3, and 4, and switch to your orbital checklist. You\u0027re coming up on the coast, twenty\u00A0minutes to Objective One...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s anxiety abated for the moment and she finally decided to join Dibella on the platform where the rows of consoles were stretched out. She kept out of the way, watched and listened as Tercella went through a series of attitude checks, visual tests, and activated science experiments. Tercella remarked that Kerbin seemed to be mostly below her. Dibella asked if it was drifting or falling. Tercella confirmed that it was not, but she was floating in a most peculiar way, and the stars looked very different, today. Valentina had the distinct impression she was missing a joke. A bad one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe indicator lights marked \u0027TX1/RX1\u0027 blinked back and forth as the other two spoke over the radio. The little Orbiter craft had now exceeded Dibella and Valentina\u0027s own flight times combined, and continued to perform well. A major mission goal neared as the tiny ship approached the coast of Kerfrica.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You should be in range, now, \u003Cem\u003ESila\u003C/em\u003E.

She watched, as Tercella pulled herself out, and promptly fell face first in the mud. Valentina looked back at Mission Control, and her smile faded, as she watched everyone embracing and kissing cheeks and still not getting that hand-slap thing quite right. She watched, for a moment, alone, then sighed and went from the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe never saw Dibella break away and scan the room for her again.

Here and there, tinier insects flitted about, oblivious to the still mist. Valentina crept silently between the trees, moving with a preternatural grace, fitting through the branches yet not touching a one. Her face was black with foul mud and streaked with sweat. Her quarry lay just ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe deftly slid past another limb. Moving about this part of the taiga was always tricky. Inadvertently brushing up against a Stick would quickly spoil your day, here. But Sticks, at least, mostly kept to themselves. Mostly. A Twig, on the other hand... Valentina shuddered in spite of the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe villagers avoided the deep wood, feared it, called it a place of death. Yes, there was death here, death in spades. But there could only be so much death because there was so much \u003Cem\u003Elife\u003C/em\u003E. Here, everything was alive. The trees, the soil, the water, even the rocks. Life permeated the air with an otherworldly force. And that life would inevitably bring death. Life fed death fed life, in circles upon infinite circles. The patterns were there, for anyone who cared to look. Valentina knew the circles well, their interactions, their interceptions. Another interception waited in the next clearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u0027t know the great furry thing\u0027s name. The taiga-dwellers seldom bothered with names. There was so much here, no one could know all the names. \u0022Lunch\u0022 or \u0022argh\u0022 covered most things, and the names could switch with disturbing speed. Except Sticks. And Twigs. Those were worthy of names.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had been stalking this particular thing for over an hour, and it had finally let its guard down in the small clearing. Hidden in the undergrowth, Valentina silently drew back on her short bow, its waxed string and supple wood not making a sound. The tiny arrow\u0027s tip had been dipped in the juice of berries and crushed beetles. She took a slow breath, let it part way out, aimed...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing sensed the threat. It tensed, spun its head... but too late. The arrow caught it in the flank and it was dead before it hit the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina smiled beneath her mask of mud. Now, there would be meat for smoking, bone for tools, a pelt to trade, and... well, those spiky bits on the tail must be good for \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, this was \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E.

There was something else, something she had to...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina pushed the uncomfortable thought away. She drew her knife, and cautiously approached the carcass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt burst into flames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stood transfixed, too shocked to move. Then the \u003Cem\u003Ecarcass\u003C/em\u003E moved. It shifted, strained, then began to rise. As the flames burned ever higher, it slowly turned. The flaming corpse of Sergei Kermanski stared back at her with empty eye sockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina wanted to scream, wanted to run, but she was frozen in place. The corpse raised its blazing arms, stepping toward her.

She tried to cry out but barely a whimper crossed her lips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the shadows, a figure rose. Valentina\u0027s panicked eyes darted about, but her body still betrayed her. The figure drew closer, closer.

For an instant as she turned the switch, she was sure that the light would not come, that the nightmare would go on and on. The Dead Girl\u0027s words echoed in her mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe price must be paid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSooner, or later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe price must be paid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cold wind blew down from the rolling hills north of the Cosmodrome, chilling its denizens before moving on south. A slate gray sky hung over the complex, its shades muted, its sounds softened. Despite this, or perhaps defying it, those same forested hills were also alive with color. The hesitant yellow fringe of past weeks was now a sea of gold and crimson. Similar colors were slowly spreading across the Cosmodrome, too, as crews braved the wind and cold to hang banners that marked the anniversary of the Glorious Octember Revolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrough all this, Valentina Kerman walked, not seeing the colors or feeling the wind, her heavy coat and tall \u003Cem\u003Eushanka\u003C/em\u003E little more than habit. The Kerbal coming the other way down the path didn\u0027t look at her, or really see her at all, but shifted his course, giving her a wide berth without even realizing he had done so. On the launch pad, surrounded by towers and equipment, stood the rocket that would take Dibella into space again. Valentina didn\u0027t look at it, she didn\u0027t need to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe continued along the path, surrounded by a wide bubble of emptiness despite the bustle. As expected, the towering doors of the VAB stood open. Just inside was the reason Valentina had dragged herself from the shelter of her small room. It was already surrounded by a crowd of gawkers, who nonetheless parted as she approached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E.

Far more advanced than even the Foreigners\u0027 craft, it could carry two Kerbals into space for a week or more. Some day. The craft mated to the top of this towering \u003Cem\u003EKrasniyy Ivan\u003C/em\u003E booster was merely a test article, half its systems still incomplete, scheduled for an uncrewed launch shortly after Dibella\u0027s. The crowd continued to stare and murmur, despite the fact that no one could actually see it from down on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina had made the trek out here, silently hoping for... something. But found nothing. Her face impassive, she turned back towards the Kerbonaut Center.

Spinning around the globe, each new orbit brought a new record. The first person to sleep in space, the first person to eat in space, the first person to get sick in space from eating space food. Flying at a high 43 degree inclination, she passed over nearly every population center in the world, beaming down grainy, live television broadcasts, often in the viewers\u0027 native language, and quickly becoming somewhat of a celebrity. All the while, data flowed back to the Cosmodrome, bringing new insights into Kerbal physiology and space science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for Valentina, those three days passed in a haze. She spent most her time in the Mission Control center, for lack of anything else to do. A deep-seated anger she couldn\u0027t understand festered in her mind, coloring everything, and punctuated by the incessant voice that sounded ever more reasonable. Perhaps there was no more point in resisting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, \u003Cem\u003EOduvanchik\u003C/em\u003E, everything checks out down here, we\u0027re ready to begin the de-orbit sequence,\u0022 said the flight controller as he stood by his console.

At least she felt something out here, she felt dead inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA technician in a lab coat walked by, hurrying about his business. Valentina ignored him. It was over, now.

Our kind has a rather well documented record of such...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe controller\u0027s eyes darted back and forth between the gathered Kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0lost your minds. And you\u0027ve overlooked one critical point. Only the Kommissar himself could authorize this. He has the launch key. And as usual, he\u0027s gone,\u0022 the irritation at this last fact was plain in his voice.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe held the flight surgeon\u0027s gaze, \u0022there \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0worse things than Kerberia.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Greetings, Comrades!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe group yelped and spun around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Papers, please! Yes, yes, good, good, you, your shots are out of date, you need a booster.

Do you dispute this?\u0022 Heads briskly shook in the negative.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe pulled something from under his shirt, snapping the chain with a quiet \u003Cem\u003Eplink\u003C/em\u003E, then tossed it on the table.
