I looked it up on the wiki and the cost is apparently: 150n^2\u002B12350n, for the nth hire. This seems kind of silly and makes it prohibitively expensive to run large space programs with multiple stations and bases on different bodies. Some folks have suggested a mod to breed Kerbals, but wouldn\u0027t fixing the hiring cost of Kerbal\u0027s be a simpler/more logical solution? You don\u0027t have to worry about male/female ratios, time in flight, room, skipping childhood, genetics or anything else. Simply making it so the hiring cost makes sense would be ideal for most applications. Maybe make the price inversely proportional to rep (probably plus some base constant) and make it so you have serious hits to your rep if a Kerbal dies. The current cost formula only makes sense if the Kerbal population is very very small or your killing Kerbals left and right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how difficult or easy is it to mod the cost of hiring Kerbals?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever hired them anyway.
