I LOVE the whole science aspect, as now It forces me to do new and different things each mission, and makes me really want to go to different places I never bothered with before. A simple one is that I\u0027d much rather have an un-manned probe at the start, and need to unlock the manned command pods. And perhaps some kind of KSP version of other non-kerbal life forms in capsules, similar to dogs, monkeys and such. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also would like to see more types of \u0027science\u0027 rather than the catch-all single type.

I\u0027d like to have it more where studying a specific science is needed to further progress down that technology. Run an accelerometer to get propulsion and aerodynamic science, things like that. In some ways the current system causes me to completely ignore some aspects of the tree since there is no need for me to deal with them in order to get the higher up items I actually DO want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T17:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost forgot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least one more category of ships for the map: satellites - to distinguish from actual probes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T18:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdjustments to the Tech Tree sequence so nodes are stocked and unlock in a similar order to that of historic aerospace development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some more elaborate thoughts on this and how some of the guesswork can be eased, but I\u0027ll leave that for later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dean Harper","CreatedById":63324,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T18:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA real reason to have a network of communication satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something like needing line of sight with either the space center or something with functioning communication devices that can relay the info back.
