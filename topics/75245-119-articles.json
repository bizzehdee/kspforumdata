I like the concept and have successfully set up some communication networks. It feels really great the first few times when you do that and watch the network nice and tidy. But the problem is the satellites drift away way too fast even if you have set up a very closely synced network. The game engine itselfs limits how fine tuned the orbit can be and it gets quite tedious and boring to have to manually correct it every few hundred days.\u003Cp\u003EI hope there could be a feature like ground satellite control that the system automatically synchronize and adjust the orbits of satellites, provided you have launched them properly within a reasonable margin of error(eg. 5 seconds). That would relieve a lot of tedium of maintaining the networks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have my 2 cents. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be happy enough if ground control would be able to tell me \u0022check constellation on planet x because it\u0027s about to break\u0022, then I\u0027d load sat 1, and one click flight computer so it\u0027d a) oriented pro/retro \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E fire until it\u0027d drift back into the proper place.

Then put the main rocket into a carefully calculated elliptic orbit so that Ap is the target orbit satellite height, and orbit period is 2/3 or 3/4 of the target satellite orbit period. Then rocket releases one satellite each time it reaches Ap, and satellite circularize itself and fine tune after release (and this fine-tune is just to get your semi-major axis the correct value - no orbit matching). The satellite will naturally be separated 120 degrees or 90 degrees apart by this method. No need to worry about rendezvous or matching up anything at all.
