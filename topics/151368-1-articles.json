To my good fortune, i shall be representing Israel in the United Nations Office for\u00A0Outer Space Affairs. The topics are the Environment and Space Activity, the Militarisation of Space and International Law, and Space Commercialisation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am currently doing research into Israel\u0027s role in this committee. However, i also realised that there\u0027s a whole world of space enthusiasts here. So, if anyone knows anything about Israel\u0027s space program, or any of the policies it has implemented regarding space travel, it would be a big help to me if you could post here. So far, i know that Israel has sent 12 satellites into space, has signed and ratified the Outer Space Treaty but not the Moon Treaty, and that an Israeli-designed communications satellite was destroyed in the recent Falcon 9 Explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs well, although i have been to many Model UN conferences in the past, i have never really excelled in them. So if anyone has been to any past Model UN conferences, and has any good experience with them, any advice on how to make deals quickly and win people over would also be really appreciated. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that this is a bit... political, but i\u0027m hoping you guys can be sensible and honourable enough not to turn this into a\u00A0flame war.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is all.

That\u0027s normal, and that\u0027s OK. This may even involve voting for things you find morally reprehensible. Just keep in mind that it\u0027s a small bad for a lot of good- don\u0027t be an idealist. Keep your cards close to your chest, and don\u0027t confuse friends with allies. And don\u0027t confuse allies with people who have similar interests. Don\u0027t make people hate you quickly. Be nice, and make lots of friends, at least early on. Take people for dinner, or something like that. Get them to like you. When you\u0027re proposing a deal, don\u0027t make your first offer your final offer.
