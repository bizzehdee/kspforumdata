Because as far as I can tell, they don\u0027t seem to actually do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem: I\u0027m trying to use the nuclear lightbulb, and those radiators seem to be neither necessary nor sufficient. I find the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If I just use the Atomic Age radiators, it blows up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Therefore, when I have a nuke lightbulb that\u0027s getting super-hot, they suck heat directly out of it and it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, as far as I can tell, the Atomic Age radiators never get any hotter than the part they\u0027re attached to. And they can\u0027t be attached directly to the lightbulb (since it doesn\u0027t allow radial attachment). Okay, so I do what I assume is the next-best thing: I have a big LF tank with a lot of thermal mass. The lightbulb is attached directly below the tank. I encase the tank in Atomic Age radiators. Activate the lightbulb at full throttle. Result? It gets hotter... and hotter... and then blows up. With the thermal overlay turned on, I can watch the lightbulb go from red to orange to yellow to white-- and in the meantime, the fuel tank (and radiators) never get beyond reddish-orange, and seem to do nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong here? I love this mod, and I can certainly use the stock radiators to get the job done... but those radiators that come with the mod look so cool, I\u0027d love to have a reason to use them, and they just don\u0027t seem to be doing anything.

The engine was white-hot when the radiators were still quite cool (the same temperature as the fuel tank, a slightly orangey red when the thermo overlay is turned on). I could understand if, for example, the radiators got white hot along with the engine, and simply couldn\u0027t keep up with the heat load. But they didn\u0027t seem to be doing anything at all, as far as I could tell. Regardless of their size, and whether I have enough of them or not, shouldn\u0027t they be getting hot if they\u0027re working properly? That\u0027s what makes me concerned that maybe I\u0027m somehow using them wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a test ship I slapped together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eaFcVmu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eaFcVmu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the heat overlay:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9w4vWIF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229w4vWIF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the engine is getting white-hot while the radiators aren\u0027t even trying, as far as I can tell-- they haven\u0027t warmed up at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI timed it by the mission clock. From the time I throttled up until the lightbulb exploded, 70 seconds elapsed. That seems pretty quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if I\u0027m not using enough of the heat sinks... shouldn\u0027t they be doing \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E? Warm up? Make it take longer than 70 seconds to go boom? (For comparison, four of the medium-size folding panels allow it to run for a really long time, i.e. until the tank runs dry, without ever getting close to blowing up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the blow-up was unexpected-- the \u0022overheat\u0022 bar started showing up on the lightbulb, but it exploded when the bar was only around 50% and still quite green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] Some experimentation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Same ship, no radiators at all -\u0026gt; blew up in 41 seconds rather than 70.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Same ship, 8 radiators instead of 4 -\u0026gt; ran just fine for a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...So I guess what throws me here, as a user, is that it\u0027s hard to tell from observing the game what the problem is, which makes debugging harder. For example, the lightbulb explodes from overheat when its \u0022heat bar\u0022 is only around 50%-- that means it\u0027s unexpected, and it\u0027s harder to control the ship (e.g. \u0022thrust until it\u0027s almost ready to blow, then let it cool off for a while\u0022 is hard to judge). Second, it\u0027s hard to tell whether the radiators are doing their job, because they don\u0027t visibly change their temperature. If the ship overheats in spite of the radiators, it\u0027s hard to tell whether it\u0027s because I don\u0027t have enough of them, or because I\u0027ve got them placed wrong (or even whether placement matters-- for example, the folding stock panels can go anywhere, but the passive stock panels need to be mounted directly on the thing to be cooled off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have the idea now, thank you for the guidance! User requests: first, fix the lightbulb\u0027s temperature bar so that it blows up when the bar hits the 100% mark rather than when it\u0027s 50% and green; and second, maybe add some verbiage to the radiator part descriptions, explaining usage (e.g. \u0022place anywhere on the ship\u0022 or \u0022must be placed on the part you want to cool off\u0022 or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a great mod! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T02:03:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T18:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk this is strange indeed, the four radiators should cool it for a at least a few minutes, not just 7 seconds, and they should visibly turn red rather quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tested your setup (with stock fueltank) and replicated the result.
