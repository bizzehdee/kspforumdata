My main metric for efficiency will be est (electricity per second per ton), with mass a second metric. All panel efficiencies are given for Kerbin distance from the sun-- they drop off very quickly as you move outwards. \n\nOX-STAT panels: 70 est, 0.005 t\n\nOX-4L/W panels: 91.4 est, 0.0175 t (non-retractable)\n\nSP-L/W panels: 64 est, 0.025 t\n\nGigantor panels: 81.3 est, 0.3 t\n\nRTG: 9.4 est, 0.08 t\n\nFuel cell: 30 est (\u002B0.125t LF/OX per 10,000 units electricity), 0.05 t\n\nFuel cell array: 75 est (\u002B0.125t LF/OX per 10,000 units electricity), 0.24 t\n\nSo, what to make of this? Obviously, if retractability is not an issue, the OX-4L/W panels are going to be your best inner solar system electricity source for everything except the smallest probes, where the OX-STAT will be better because of its lower total weight. If you need retractability, and have a large-ish ship, go Gigantor.\n\nThe outer solar system (where solar panels suck) is more difficult, and I will need to play and think more before making any definitive comments. I will say that the fuel cells can run an ion engine for ~19 minutes on 0.125 t of fuel, which is pretty darn good. Fuel cell ion propulsion might be feasible for small-medium ships, maybe even OP. **Does anyone have the math skills to calculate ion engine Isp with the fuel cell LF/OX consumption counted as reaction mass?** I reckon it\u0027s excellent. Fuel cells even work for probe missions, with a trick. On long-duration probe missions with a fuel cell, turn off the fuel cell and the fuel cell\u0027s internal battery before warping. The probe will drain the rest of the batteries during warp and the craft will die. When coming out of warp, turn to fuel cell\u0027s battery back on, use that power to activate the fuel cell and voila! You have power with no wasted LF/OX!\n\nThe RTG seems a bit rubbish, especially given the fuel cell trick just outlined. The fuel cell requires so little LF/OX that only the smallest ships would benefit from trading it for the far lower est of the RTG. But the fact that the RTG weighs 60% more than the standard fuel cell makes it worse for small ships, not better. So is the RTG useless? I\u0027m not sure. Perhaps there is a narrow range of conditions where using it is optimal, someone with more math skills than me can do the calculations. In any case, the RTG will always be the best choice when ease and convenience matter more than every last drop of efficiency, and that is an important role.\n\nSo, what do I think of all this? I\u0027m mostly really happy that OX-STAT spam is no longer the objectively correct answer to everything. My life will be harder, but it\u0027s the good sort of challenge. If I could change one thing, it would be to make the Gigantor\u0027s efficiency equal to that of the OX-4L/W panels. It\u0027s too awesome of a part to be relegated to the \u0022retractable panels on a medium-to-large ship\u0022 role-- it should be the go-to for any sufficiently large inner system craft.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027m extremely happy with the changes ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:12:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by a2soup**"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:34:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What do you guys think?\n\nI pretty much concur with everything you wrote there (although I\u0027d write EC/t rather than \u0027est\u0027, that makes me think of the timezone hehe).\n\nAs I mentioned before, my own changes in the Horrible Nerf prior to 1.0 was as follows:\n\n    //  Stock                                 HorribleNerf//  Panel     EC/ton  Cost/EC             EC/ton  Cost/EC      Size//  OX-STAT      150      133                 40     2000      45x32=1440//  SP-*          80      200                 60     1750      (roughly same as OX-4*)//  OX-4*        114.286  190                 60     1750      222x36=7992//  Gigantor      51.429  166                 80     1500      548x200=109600//  RTG            9.375 4400\n\nI think that was a better solution (naturally), but what they\u0027ve done isn\u0027t too far different."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:37:09Z","Content":"I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out which mod broke my OX panels animation. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:24:12Z","Content":"\\*Maths incoming\\* \n\nOk, the ION engine consumes\n\n 0.486 xenon/s = 48.6E-6 t/s\n\n 8.74 ec/s\n\nand produces a thrust of 2kN\n\nWith fuel cells, the ec costs\n\n8.74 ec/s \\* 12.5E-6 t(lfo)/ec = 109.3E-6 t/s\n\nso the total mass flow rate is\n\n48.3E-6 \u002B 109.3E-6 = 157.9E-6 t/s\n\nSpecific impulse is \n\nthrust/(mass flow rate) = 2kN/(157.9 t/s) = 12.63 E3 m/s which is equivalent to ~1300 s\n\nSo it\u0027s a big performance hit, but still better than any other engine, including the LV-N."},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:36:47Z","Content":"Does solar panels energy generation depend on distance to kerbol now or not?"},{"CreatedByName":"a2soup","CreatedById":68260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:50:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does solar panels energy generation depend on distance to kerbol now or not?\n\nIt depends on distance to Kerbol and varies by the square of that distance rather than linearly, as was the case before.

And I don\u0027t know how much they toned down the nuke heating, but that can only help the ion in the comparison. Of course, the use of the ion is usually limited by tech tree position and patience.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T02:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by a2soup**"},{"CreatedByName":"gavman420SSJ","CreatedById":128463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:48:49Z","Content":"an ion engine can run for about 3 hours with the biggest xenon tank. a single 6-pack fuel cell can run two engines for that long with about 215 LF \u002B 263 Ox. a simple satellite built this way with no payload has 5100 dv and .09 twr in the VAB. but that doesn\u0027t account for the LF/OX usage... time to scale it up!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T03:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gavman420SSJ**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowlord","CreatedById":141962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T04:08:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*Maths incoming\\* \n\u003E With fuel cells, the ec costs\n\u003E \n\u003E 8.74 ec/s \\* 12.5E-6 t(lfo)/ec = 109.3E-6 t/s\n\u003E \n\u003E so the total mass flow rate is\n\u003E \n\u003E 48.3E-6 \u002B 109.3E-6 = 157.9E-6 t/s\n\u003E \n\u003E Specific impulse is \n\u003E \n\u003E thrust/(mass flow rate) = 2kN/(157.9 t/s) = 12.63 E3 m/s which is equivalent to ~1300 s\n\u003E \n\u003E So it\u0027s a big performance hit, but still better than any other engine, including the LV-N.\n\nHow do you end up with a mass flow rate for the LFO which is twice as high as the xenon?
