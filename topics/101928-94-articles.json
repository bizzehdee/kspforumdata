I think I can work around that by making the deploy time really slow, but it\u0027s not ideal. It also look weird because the chute does not move with the kerbals bones properly.\n\nequipmode=part works if I am standing on solid ground. I can arm the chute while standing on the VAB or on a landed vessel and jump off. However, when I jump out of an aircraft, I can not get a right click menu from that chute while I\u0027m falling. Im actually fallig in a controlled way. I can even turn on RCS and stabilize, but still no right click menu. The rightclick menu on the kerbal itself works.\n\nequipmode=part would really be the prettier option, but it\u0027s not working the way I expected. Maybe there are some intended restrictions when the equipped parts can be used? I suspect it could be a feature rather then a bug. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-30T23:59:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2016 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"IgorZ","CreatedById":155445,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T00:58:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, baranowb said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Inventory range?

Trick is that WHEN I stand next to bottom part of it( rear end of truck/rover) I cant access it inventory. I have to walk under, closer to center of mass of container, to access it - that is, with standard. This is what I meant by \u0022focus point\u0022.

As I have mentioned before only position is considered, not the part\u0027s boundaries. I.e. if our hypothetical inventory part is a sphere of radius 3m then there is no way for a kerbal to access the inventory with default settings (3m for range limit). It may sound odd but that\u0027s a limitation of a simulated world: checking distances for bounds of the objects is rather expensive task."},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T07:16:54Z","Content":"Is the most recent version of KIS/KAS stable at the moment in 1.1.2?"},{"CreatedByName":"IgorZ","CreatedById":155445,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T07:23:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, fireblade274 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is the most recent version of KIS/KAS stable at the moment in 1.1.2?\n\u003E \n\nTo the best of my knowledge there were no breaking changes in 1.1.2 comparing to 1.1.0.
