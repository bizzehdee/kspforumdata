Maybe see if there are more space things, and keep them from hitting me again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow. I know I can pucker. Let me see how well I can protrude.

That works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh hey, I can use protrusions to dig into the soft stuff, and break up the hard stuff, and--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, that is how I\u0027ve been eating!? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigures.

Nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, let\u0027s fill some of those protrusion full of nutrients for later... and... TA-DA. Took a lot of rotations to do but it works great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m terrible at names. I\u0027m going to call it a... kerb. I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kerbin\u0027 now. Oh yeah. Kerbin. Hey, that works for a name. Why not? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello, warm bright space thing, I\u0027m Kerbin. Nice to never hear from you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thank you for helping to keep things warm and bright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I should call you \u0022Sun\u0022--nice and short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile I can work on improving my puckering skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on getting more sensitive to pressure changes, too. If I pucker then close over the pucker with just a thin bit of me... I can pick up variations in pressure really well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh. Seeing and hearing. Is there anything puckering can\u0027t do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if I open and close a pucker fast enough? Sounds like I\u0027m able to change the pressure around that area, that way. Not sure I like how it sounds yet, but maybe I\u0027ll need to know how to make sounds some day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHee hee, that one was funny. Brrrrrrrrrrrap. Hahahahaha!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to protrusions. Can I wrap one around... I dunno, a rock?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can! And I can move it around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow fast? Let\u0027s find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I let go of it. Crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOW CRAP. That hurt! Not as bad as that space thing... hey, maybe that was just a big rock. Maybe I can find out some day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocks are cool, when they aren\u0027t hitting me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like eating rocks--very slow, but still. Tasty. Full of minerals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery slow. This sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are some rocks that are out of reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. If I had a way of taking some of me, breaking it off, and sending it off to gnaw on rocks for me, I can get a lot more nutrients that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll attach some puckers for vision, a pucker with jaws for gnawing, some protrusions for grabbing and moving, maybe some extra organs to help it keep going...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, that attempt failed. Ran out of power before it could get back to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need... a kerb. Keep it away from the other organs for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll call it a kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo forth, kerbal! Wander in search of rocks, gnaw on them, then come back to me before your kerb shrinks too small!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Hey, that works! Better absorb that kerbal and restore its kerb. Oh, hey, check this out, the kerb managed to record everything the kerbal saw and heard and felt!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHah, this is hilarious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I got to make more of them, this is the best thing ever. I\u0027m never going to be bored again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo forth, kerbals! Explore, let me see myself and this place we call home! Gnaw on many rocks! Do that funny thing where you fall and bounce from great heights! Then come home and let me embrace you and see your sights, and I shall reinvigorate your kerb for another go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, if they bounce high enough, maybe they can get a better view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how high up I can get a kerbal, anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOF. I felt that one. Literally. Poor fellow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me take what\u0027s left... Wow, what a mess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think I can put it all back together and look over its memories of--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait. Its last memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is that thing!?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s got lots of protrusions on one end and a big protrusion with puckers on the other and... it grabbed the kerbal and... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhy would you do that!? And how!?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like the universe... broke or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoor, poor kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gotta find out what that... kraken... was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of things I gotta find out. Lots. I think I need more kerbals still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some of them seem to be starting to learn. I mean a couple of them could have passed for clever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what, this one here was one of the more clever ones, and willing to take risks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I could remake that kerbal over and over, make it an inspiration to the other kerbals. That might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, with the naming things. It made a kind of \u0022jebediah\u0022 sound when I pulled it from the muck.
