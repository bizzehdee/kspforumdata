I had this problem: When the plane can go fast enough to fly, it can\u0027t turn... and if it\u0027s going slow enough to turn it cannot fly. This means your lift-to-weight ratio is too low. Experiment until your plane can take off at around 80m/s. Once you can do that, you\u0027ll immediately notice a big difference in the way it flies. Other than that, just ensure that center of lift stays behind center of mass at all times. I find that raising center of lift a little above the line that runs through center of mass and center of thrust adds a bit of roll stability. As someone else said, adding forward canards can also help improve mobility (but be warned that your plane\u0027s ability to adjust its angle of attack can outstrip its ability to generate lift with highly maneuverable craft). The most stable vessel will have maneuverability that is slightly less than its lift capacity(max pre-stall AOA)... reducing the chances of stalls.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T06:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022quasarrgames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022quasarrgames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emostly it\u0027s that they have no maneuverability.
