Are you on the same plane as it? Are you travelling in the same direction as the asteroid? If you are in the same plane and are travelling the same direction, what you are going to want to do is get an encounter at the asteroid\u0027s periapsis, and as you get to the encounter, burn to match speeds, you might end up behind if you start your burn too late so you will have to either start the burn a few minutes early or catch up to it, unless you have a very high TWR.

Arg!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat follows would be any easy way to rendezvous with the asteroid, but you will meet up with it AFTER it passes periapse. It can still be slowed into a stable orbit, but not with the help of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand there is a new feature of the maneuver nodes, such that you can set them for future orbits. I haven\u0027t seen what this feature looks like, but if you get your orbit to touch the asteroid\u0027s periapse, then place a maneuver node there, you\u0027ll be able to see a few orbits into the future and find where the asteroid reaches or passes the periapse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve found it, go back one orbit and use the same node to adjust your orbit in or out a bit (pulling on prograde/retrograde) until the projected closest approach is as close as you want it (within 5-10 kilometers should be pretty good). What you\u0027re doing is increasing or decreasing your orbital period, so it takes more or less time for you to swing back around the planet to meet up with the asteroid as it arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you start getting close to that closest approach, you switch to target mode and start burning hard at target retrograde (to match velocity with the asteroid). A maneuver node can help you gauge how long a burn will be needed, just try to get the projected orbit to more or less match the asteroid\u0027s path by pulling on prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce relative velocity gets close to zero, you can then burn toward the pink target to start your final approach, then time warp and adjust as necessary until you\u0027re close enough to do your final braking maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to meet up with the asteroid earlier, but the periapse is the easiest place to plan a rendezvous for (you match your periapse with it\u0027s) and match velocities (you\u0027re already moving as fast as your orbit allows in the same direction as the asteroid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo meet it earlier, you\u0027d want to set a maneuver to put your apoapse near the asteroid\u0027s path so that you get a close approach there or somewhere after it. This could take some fiddling to get right, and I have not had the chance to play with it to find the best way, yet. You\u0027ll also need more dV for this kind of rendezvous, but you might make up for it if you are able to then make the asteroid aerobrake for capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!

Only this is heading out of the Kerbin SOI. So when it gets close to Kerbin, you need to burn towards it as it passes you. This will make you head out of the SOI as well, but it\u0027s ok. Click on your velocity on the nav ball gadget until it shows the target velocity. Then you just have to get the velocity to point towards your target. You\u0027ll catch up to it eventually. When you do, latch onto it, aiming at the center of mass as best you can. Then switch you velocity over to orbital. You now need to burn retrograde if you\u0027re still in the SOI, otherwise you\u0027ll have to plot an intercept back with Kerbin.

You\u0027re not really matching two ellipses in space and time, but timing a certain point of one ellipse (your orbit) to coincide with a point on a more or less straight line. IMO this is easier than an orbital rendez-vous, in concept at any rate. What I do is make sure the planes are aligned properly and then adjust my AP to be as close as possible to the trajectory of the infalling asteroid. Then I tweak the height (and thus also the timing) of the AP so that an encounter or close approach happens.
