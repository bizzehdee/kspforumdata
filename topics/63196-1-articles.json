I saw it in a youtube video and thought that I bookmarked it to add it to ksp later. it was a plane/hanger add-on that helped in the aerodynamic design of planes and space planes. had all sorts of good information about stability at different altitudes and speeds. You basically built a plane and then it would allow you to run it through various simulations that would output graphs on speed and stability among other useful statistics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany direction would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeteTimesSix","CreatedById":84082,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T18:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe youre looking for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-12-5-2-Aero-Fixes-For-Planes-Rockets-1-7-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
