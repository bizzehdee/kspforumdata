Personally, I quite like them. Historically, I found they were often superior to the RAPIER (it was never clearly better than them pre-1.0, and I always felt it was a bit mediocre, falling quite short of what it should be). 1.0 has changed the ascent profile needed, and altered the fuel usage a bit, but they are quite usable for a spaceplane. N.B. I\u0027m talking about larger spaceplanes, which can deliver useful payload, there was an edge case for micro spaceplanes (with basically zero payload) pre-1.0 which the RAPIER seemed to win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I was always unimpressed with the RAPIER historically, I\u0027ve yet to really properly evaluate it in 1.0, so not sure just how it measures up now. I just know that with a little adjustment to designs, I can produce reasonably viable low orbit spaceplanes using traditional non-air-hog turbojet \u002B Aerospike. If anything, the turbojet is now superior to the old one (with no air hogging), due to the big burst of power before it falls off due to lack of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pre-1.0 RAPIER always felt to me like I\u0027d been promised a Ferrari, but a Fiat painted Ferrari Flame Red was delivered, and the salesman thought that was ok.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T06:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T11:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Starhawk (I almost always do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The turbojet\u002BOMS rockets was unbeatable pre- 1.0, but now the RAPIER is superior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Each engine will handle 15 tonnes of spaceplane comfortably and I\u0027ve pushed some of mine beyond 18 tonnes.
