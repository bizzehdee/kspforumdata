In the end, codepoet elected to \u0022leave it as it is\u0022 in order to satisfy the greatest number of people. There are many that would argue that radial attached openings to some kinds of parts is not \u0022realistic\u0022 and do not want it. I took a look at the \u0022CLSStock alternative configs.zip\u0022, and do not see it there for the lab either. Possibly I could add it to the Freedom config...\n\nWhat I might also suggest is to create another folder under GameData, say \u0022casper88\u0022, and add your custom Module Manager configs there. I have a folder such as this for that, and for custom parts I\u0027ve created via part.cfg tweaks, etc. This way, you have the freedom to create any config tweak you wish, and when CLS is updated (or other mods you have tweaked) you do not lose your tweaks.\n\nSee if that works for you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T15:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"casper88","CreatedById":144962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:05:08Z","Content":"yeh thats exactly what i did in the end; not to start a discussion off again ha but the way the wiki reads the surfaceAttachmentsPassable requries the radial part to passableWhenSurfaceAttached to be true in order to pass between the two. thanks for the help agin"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:17:39Z","Content":"I have just seen this, so thought I would offer my 2cents worth. In then end we decided to deal with the radial attachment stuff fully in config. The basic premise is that if BOTH the radially attached part and the part it is stuck on the outside of are configured to allow it then the joint can be passable, but only if both parts are configured for this. The thinking was that some parts have lots of surface details that intuitively make them look like not the sort of place where Jeb should get out his angle grinder and cut a big hole. Other parts such as the stock fuselage are more plain and you could imagine it being allowed.\n\nThe focus is on developers who provide new parts providing their own CLS config that reflects what they intended for their parts. This approach has now been adopted by countless part providers and has the advantage that the CLS config is kept up to date when the part author makes changes to their parts.\n\nOf course as a player you always have the option of editing the config to suit your needs.\n\nAs a mod developer I have no desire to get involved with debates about how particular parts should work, but am pleased if a mod I have worked on provides the flexibility for players and part designers to create and play in the way that they want to.\n\nHaving said all that, I am not sure that the description text for the part in the VAB does mention anything about surface attachment passability.

This will allow you to perform a stock transfer. If you are using SM, you can turn off realism in settings and get the same result. Stop gap and not a real fix, I know. \n\nAs for the new feature, it was not my intention to allow changing these settings while in flight, but only in the editor (cant really rebuild parts in flight eh?).

As an alternative, it may be possible to create one config that picks up all remaining parts, but I\u0027ll have to spend a bit of time learning the MM language to get the wildcards right. That might not hurt me in any case, but it would be trivial to simply check loaded parts when they are added to a vessel and add the needed modules during assembly... if no CLS module exists for a given part, automatically add a module and make it impassable. then, you could edit the part as you build the vessel. \n\nAs part of the next release (after the upcoming one), I could have it make mm Configs via an interface.
