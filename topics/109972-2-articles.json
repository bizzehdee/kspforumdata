In then end we decided to deal with the radial attachment stuff fully in config. The basic premise is that if BOTH the radially attached part and the part it is stuck on the outside of are configured to allow it then the joint can be passable, but only if both parts are configured for this. The thinking was that some parts have lots of surface details that intuitively make them look like not the sort of place where Jeb should get out his angle grinder and cut a big hole. Other parts such as the stock fuselage are more plain and you could imagine it being allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe focus is on developers who provide new parts providing their own CLS config that reflects what they intended for their parts. This approach has now been adopted by countless part providers and has the advantage that the CLS config is kept up to date when the part author makes changes to their parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course as a player you always have the option of editing the config to suit your needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a mod developer I have no desire to get involved with debates about how particular parts should work, but am pleased if a mod I have worked on provides the flexibility for players and part designers to create and play in the way that they want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all that, I am not sure that the description text for the part in the VAB does mention anything about surface attachment passability.

That might not hurt me in any case, but it would be trivial to simply check loaded parts when they are added to a vessel and add the needed modules during assembly... if no CLS module exists for a given part, automatically add a module and make it impassable. then, you could edit the part as you build the vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the next release (after the upcoming one), I could have it make mm Configs via an interface.
