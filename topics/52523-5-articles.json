This was inevitable since the largest engines available to me are the 5 meter NovaPunch2 engines... I can foresee two solutions to this- one is to install additional mods allowing bigger engines (there\u0027s a mod out there somewhere that allows procedurally-generated engines I think, and StretchySRB\u0027s does allow procedurally-generated boosters at least- which I think can stretch in width as well as length), and the other is to add MOAR BOOSTERS! Actually, the original design as seen here didn\u0027t have any, as I was having so much trouble controlling the craft and stopping the darn thing from imploding on the launchpad (once a vessel reaches a certain critical mass, KSP starts treating it almost like a little black hole- OK, really, it\u0027s just the Kraken...), but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll figure out how to add a bunch of boosters (solid or liquid) eventually...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and by the way, the fuel tanker utilized beamed power from my Microwave Power Station to help power its three *HUGE* SAS wheels (125 SAS force EACH), possibly saving a bit of weight on the final design...

I suppose most of you have forgotten about it by this point, but I haven\u0027t.

It also managed to fill up its Aluminum Hybrid boosters with Aluminum- which is good for additional impulse to get it into Munar orbit. Thus, I decided with its now relatively-full fuel reserves, it would be an excellent candidate to refuel the Early Spacedock to usable levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Munar Science Module and my two manned LFO tankers in Munar orbit will transfer their fuel and crew to the two spacedocks (and eventually be recycled for much-needed RocketParts).

It also pushed the very limits of what the game could handle without the vessel exploding due to lack of structural integrity and/or the Kraken bugs, and the number of engines I could cram onto a single rocket (in fact, the TWR at liftoff was pathetically low- reducing efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-25T08:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2014 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T09:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Blackhawk has finished its Dunar transfer.

Since he and Donely had landed and begun their primary mission of preparing large quantities of oxygen for the Munar Spacedock, and secondary goal of performing research, the two had become close friends. At first, Doneley grated a little on Jerbo\u0027s nerves, but over time stuck in close quarters with his teammate, he had come to appreciate his camaraderie and even sought to understood Doneley as an equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, their time on the Science Module, and Jerbo suspected their mission as well, was coming to an end.

And once the combined crews had managed to finish constructing the new crew recovery vehicle they had already been ordered to begin work on from the scrap parts of two earlier fuel tankers and the Science Module, it was highly likely Jerbo and Doneley would be the first Kerbals hitching a ride on its re-entry capsule back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, Jerbo was praying for delays in the construction of the recovery vehicle- perhaps even a reassignment to the new Munar outpost they had also begun constructing equipment for.

He also wondered if he and Doneley would be re-assigned to Duna instead: there was gravity there right?

The new Munar outpost would be built with crew quarters underground, in depleted mining tunnels- which would begun to be dug soon after the first equipment landings for the outpost.

Another was attempting to explain many things that can\u0027t be accounted for in-game: such as how my Kerbals can make trip after trip into outer space, with no apparent retirement in sight (I account this to futuristic regenerative medicine treatments designed to repair the damage from extraplanetary radiation, and even destroy/replace diseased or cancerous cells.

That\u0027s not entirely accurate from a real-world perspective, but whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat that means is, the thrust counteracts gravity, and if it\u0027s great enough, the helicopter hovers or climbs. Since Duna\u0027s gravity is only 30% of Kerbin\u0027s, the helicopter should be able to climb much higher- theoretically infinitely high if the helicopter\u0027s thrust didn\u0027t fall off as the atmosphere gets thinner, but since I don\u0027t actually know the equation for helicopter rotor thrust (unlike lift, which simply increases as e^speed in KSP) I couldn\u0027t tell you how much higher it can climb. It MIGHT be able to climb to 5000 meters, it might climb to 500 meters. But either way, it can AT LEAST make it off the ground there, since it can hover at an altitude on Kerbin where the air is slightly thinner than Duna\u0027s at sea-level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I might try taking a helicopter to Duna. This early prototype has shown me it\u0027s at least possible. And, a helicopter is MUCH less unwieldy than getting a plane (one that can\u0027t function as a spaceplane, at least) to Duna.

A design note for those of you looking to make you own helicopters with Firespitter: the simplest designs are two-rotor craft like this one, but the rotors *HAVE TO* face in opposite directions- otherwise the helicopter WILL spin wildly around and CRASH. The helicopter rotors have an innate polarity to them, and that polarity determines the direction of the torque they exert on the craft. You can either balance this with two rotors roughly equidistant from the center of mass, or you can add a tail-rotor to a one-rotor (or imbalanced multi-rotor) design to cancel the torque. I prefer the two-rotor solution because it means that all my lift/thrust is pointed straight UP, increasing altitude-ceiling and lifting capacity, instead of wasting some of it just to cancel my torque...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T10:32:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 10:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T16:00:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got so excited with building my first helicopter I just kept rolling out new designs until I got something I was satisfied with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present, the \u0027Hornet\u0027:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AC2BDh2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AC2BDh2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is yet another craft I\u0027m going to take to Duna.

Additionally, the WasteHeat code seems to have been fixed- its radiators now dissipate at a reasonable rate again, seemingly capable of keeping the Early Spacedock\u0027s reactors in check at a reasonable WasteHeat level (the code seemed to be broken before- heat dissipation was not increasing with increasing WasteHeat levels). as such, I see no reason not to re-tool the thing as an interplanetary \u0022Mothership\u0022 after all- the main qualm I had with the thing before was the poor performance of its engines and radiators, and both seem to be fixed. The part count is higher than ideal for a permanent space station where I\u0027ll have to repeatedly have to put up with the resultant docking lag, but quite reasonable for a mobile spacecraft- as most of the extra parts in some way improve the stability of the craft during burns...

A helicopter here, a fuel tanker there- he had even toyed with the idea of setting up an additional launch facility amid the peaks of the mountains to the west of the Kerbal Space Center to reduce the fuel requirements and raise the payload fractions when getting rockets to orbit, a project which would required a lot of heavy airlifting and careful base design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis latest mission, though, could be called less of a distraction. Perhaps even useful. After weeks of launching interplanetary spaceplanes (when rockets and specialized planes without ascent systems would be faster, have higher cargo capacity, and be easier ways of accomplishing their designated tasks), Mission Control had actually realized something USEFUL they could send for the future colonists at Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithium.

But he knew it wouldn\u0027t be easy. With more than enough to worry about setting up a functional mining infrastructure and fuel production systems, he knew the last thing they needed to be worrying about was digging some hard to find alkali metals out of the ground. Hard science fiction writers has written about some planets called \u0022Earth\u0022 and \u0022Mars\u0022, and he knew there, at least Lithium was a lot easier to come by on Earth then Mars- the more Kerbin-like planet of the two. Something about the higher concentration of lighter elements on the more Kerbin-like planet came to memory...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar also remembered recently overhearing a conversation between two engineers mentioning something about the high utility of Lithium for plasma thrusters if they could ever get a powerful enough Microwave Transmission system in operation around Duna...

Bigger rockets than we ever launched in my day. an entire armada of ships to Duna these past few weeks. And did I hear correctly something about developing a helicopter that could even fly on Duna?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, that\u0022 said Northstar. \u0022I thought such a practical man as yourself wouldn\u0027t approve,\u0022 Northstar paused a moment in thought. \u0022I mean, what\u0027s the point of building something like that when we\u0027ve already sent off two spaceplanes, a standard plane, and enough supplies to send an entire giant colony ship back this way if the colonists wanted or something happened to wipe us out here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know the answer to that\u0022 said Eugene. \u0022Why are you even asking me? Feeling hard on yourself of late?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar was a little taken aback by this response. \u0022Why would we need a craft type that travels at a fraction of the speed of a plane, has a much smaller lifting capacity, and is absolutely incapable of making it into space?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t play dumb with me young man\u0022 said Eugene, serious now. \u0022How many orbital cargo or passenger drops do you know of that land exactly on-target, especially when relying mostly on parachutes to conserve fuel and only aided by a tiny rocket engine whose fuel is mostly for last-minute deceleration?\u0022 Northstar genuinely considered this a moment, but Eugene didn\u0027t leave him long to think. \u0022Well?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But why would we need a helicopter for that? Wouldn\u0027t a plane be faster?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEugene was actually a little bit irritate now. \u0022You remember the days when our space program spent most of its time flying around in the atmosphere back here on Kerbin, don\u0027t you?\u0022 demanded Eugene. \u0022Do you remember how HARD it was to try and land our planes on the sides of mountaintops? Do you remember how many Kerbals we stranded in damaged jet planes up there trying?\u0022 Northstar was starting to see his point, but said nothing... \u0022And do you remember the last topographical map you looked at of Duna? Most of the place is mountains!\u0022 Norsttar silently nodded in agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A plane\u0027s great for when you want to get somewhere really fast- but most unguided orbital drops are bound to land somewhere in the midst of a mountain range there- the sizes of which make Kerbin\u0027s peaks look like foothills!\u0022 Northstar waited patiently for Eugene to finish. \u0022The only way we\u0027re going to ever retrieve 90% of the stuff we drop there is with rovers or something that can take off vertically. And a \u0027copter is much faster and can simply fly above slopes that a rover couldn\u0027t even DREAM of tackling without the aid of a grappling hook.\u0022 Northstar nodded again. \u0022NOW do you see why we need helicopters on Duna? Otherwise, our giant colony supply ships are going to end up seeding nothing but a really dense scattering of pretty monuments across the mountaintops of Duna for our planes to circle around searching vain for a decent place to land, once they finally unpack the drop-pods from the construction ship you sent up there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How did you know about my plans for getting the supplies down to the surface?\u0022 Northstar asked, surprised. \u0022I told nobody about that but my engineers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The ears have walls around here these days young man\u0022 came Eugene\u0027s reply, the twinkling of his eyes a sharp contrast to the magnificent gray of his aging scalp. \u0022It\u0027s a good idea if you ask me- you risk too much trying to land one of the interstellar heavier ships directly on the planetary surface. If the engines fail, the parachutes don\u0027t deploy, or one of those simply hits the ground a bit too hard on impact; you\u0027re not going to have a colony on Duna anymore- you\u0027re going to have the biggest and most expensive rescue mission you\u0027ve ever heard of, the end of your career, and the most magnificent fireball you\u0027ve ever seen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022True. I\u0027ve always said, don\u0027t put all your eggs in one basket.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022-or your Kerbals in one lander\u0022 Eugene interrupted. \u0022Which reminds me of the time one of our landers ran out of fuel on the way back up from the Mun, and both the crew members had to bail out an EVA it. Do you remember the poor Kerbal who ended up burning too far off-course when they finally pulled him out of his suit not long after his oxygen ran out? He was blue in the face- and they say he was never quite as bright of wit again after that, if you know what I mean...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Enough reminiscing Eugene\u0022 said Northstar, very matter-of-fact. \u0022So what are we going to do to get the poor Kerbals back if re-assigning the Minmus Spacedock to Laythe (after refueling the Raven) goes wrong? If you have eyes and ears in the walls, you must have heard of this one, or seen something of my plans?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now hold on a second there young man\u0022 said Eugene. \u0022I said I hear things- I didn\u0027t say I\u0027d seen any of your blueprints. What makes you think I even have the slightest idea what your \u0027Minmus Sapcedock\u0027 even looks like?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on, old man\u0022 insisted Northstar. \u0022I know you\u0027ve heard about this one. You even took part in drawing up the early plans for this particular spacedock personally, before handing off the mission to younger men like myself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re correct indeed, green one\u0022 said Eugene. \u0022Tell me, did they keep my idea for the radial fuel tank attachments near the engines? I imagine that would have been a sight of beauty to look at if it ever made it to space...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We did indeed- Maller Kerman tells me it takes his breath away to see them serenely spinning about the craft every time he gets far enough away from the vessel on spacewalks... But you didn\u0027t answer my question- how could I possibly rescue to Kerbals if things go wrong?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You couldn\u0027t\u0022 answered Eugene. \u0022But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re Kerbals, they can handle a little risk... Besides, they\u0027ve got more than enough metal making up the body of that thing. Unless the craft completely gets torn apart during the aerocapture with Jool, they should have more than enough metal there to fashion a few lifeboats out of any debris if the craft breaks, and make it down to Laythe\u0027s surface. As long as they remember to grab a few days of Kerbal snacks, and save some of the oxygen, they can go into that deep hibernation we\u0027ve trained all our Kerbonauts for- and they\u0027ll be fine until help arrives in a year or two.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar pondered this. \u0022You\u0027re right- I get far too cautious sometimes these days. I\u0027ll make sure to remind the Kerbonauts that they\u0027ll be just like the brave Munar explorers of old- off to explore new frontiers. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll understand\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know as well as I do that whole \u0027new frontier\u0027 stuff is just a load of wishy-washy that does about as much to help Kerbalkind as a Kerbonaut who can\u0027t pilot. The truth is we\u0027re not accomplishing anything if we can\u0027t set up some kind of long-term presence outside of the bounds of our planet. But you go on feeding them that stuff, and I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll eat it right out of your hand...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right\u0022 muttered Northstar to himself. \u0022Should\u0027ve known the head of a space program that sent up a permanent fuel depot before it set its first footsteps on the Mun would be a huge cynic...\u0022 Then, aloud \u0022Alright Eugene, it was great talking to you, but I\u0027ve got orbital maneuvers to direct. I\u0027ll catch you on the flip side old man, here, let my assistant buy you a cup of coffee\u0022, and with that, Northstar opened the office door and ushered over his able assistant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Buy this man a cup of our strongest stuff- he looks like he\u0027s tired. And make sure to listen to all hist stories even if they bore you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, the elderly and glaringly-youthful Kerbal strode out of his office together, leaving Northstar to his thoughts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOOC:\u003C/strong\u003E I know it was SUPER long, but I hope you guys enjoyed this latest update.

The command pod was rapidly spinning about its axis, and the upper stage had suddenly separated into several pieces.

A simple detachment of the main parachute from the rear would free up the engine for orbital circularization (neither Bill nor the other Kerbals trusted it to remain attached at deployment by nothing but a tiny 0.625 meter decoupler. Further, the ladder/descent platform combinations were designed for G-forces the opposite direction from the parachute- even the initial drogue deployment would likely send them hurtling off during re-entry, assuming the heat didn\u0027t kill them...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, minutes later, it become apparent that only Lury Kerman was on course, and would make it to the lander before re-entry. And then, much to his horror, Bill heard him radio that he had run out of jetpack fuel just before managing to get close enough to grip onto the ladder...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill screamed into his commlink to vent anger, but he knew it would be no use. He and the rest of the Kerbals would be plummeting to their deaths...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, Bill woke up in a cold sweat, only to discover it had all just been a dream. Glancing at the clock to his side, he discovered the Light Munar Explorer\u0027s launch was still a few hours away. \u0022Better get to the KSC and get suited up\u0022, Bill thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple hours later, Bill was informed that the launch would be delayed several hours for re-fitting of the vehicle. Apparently simulations had revealed a structural weakness in the attachment of the upper stage to its engine and the stage below that would be likely to cause rapid unplanned disassembly. The engineers would be replacing the connection with a stronger decoupler, and expected the new design would hold up just fine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What a prophetic dream\u0022 Bill thought...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOOC:\u003C/strong\u003E Technically, this mission actually happened as described in Bill\u0027s dream. But attempts to re-load the quicksave I thought I had taken just before disboarding the first Kerbal from the capsule (I actually did this in case I burned the Kerbals\u0027 jetpacks in the wrong direction, being unable to aim in anything but 45-degree increments due to the unrealistic limitations of the keyboard controls after all, or at least my lack of understanding on how to reconfigure the controls to allow me to re-orient the Kerbals in any direction other than parallel to the horizon... I had forgotten about the radial parachutes, however- so on reload I probably would have noticed them, and only had to burn the Kerbal in the 1-man service module to the lander instead of trying for 3 at once from the Odin...) revealed that the last SUCCESSFUL quicksave- in which I held F9 long enough- was on the launchpad at the KSC before launch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole structural failure appears to have resulted from using a wimpy 2.5 meter mechanical decoupler instead of a standard Rockomax version, in order to save weight. The 2.5 meter mechanical decouplers are lighter than their explosive counterparts, but can\u0027t sustain nearly as many G-forces before failures like this tend to occur... The design worked fine until fuel weight dipped low enough that the acceleration at full throttle became too high- causing rapid unplanned disassembly, exaggerated greatly by the centripetal force of the rapid spin it induced. I\u0027ve had similar failures much earlier in my KSP career, in previous saves- but never nearly lost a Kerbal to them before- saved only by a quicksave like this... (technically, the radial parachutes could have easily saved the 3 of them in the Odin command capsule, and with only one to focus on I could have easily gotten the last Kerbal to the lander by EVA- which had more than enough fuel to *quickly* make it to the nearest space station...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I\u0027ve redesigned the vessel with a lighter payload (crew capacity reduced from 4 to 3, mainly) and stronger decoupler, so I don\u0027t expect this to happen again. Oh, and I gave the tiny lander even more fuel and some scientific instruments (the antenna will stay with the Odin command pod, as I won\u0027t be able to transmit-spam anymore in 0.23, which I\u0027ve had installed for some time now but not yet used the science system in... I\u0027ll still be using an antennna, as I\u0027m not sure exactly how many experiments I can store in a command pod for return from different biomes...)- although the last one Mechjeb\u0027s KErbal Engineer functionality was telling me it had a frankly insane Delta-V of 10,000 m/s, so if that was ANYWHERE close to accurate, I\u0027m sure the extra fuel is entirely unnecessary...

Even while you\u0027re clamoring for its improvement, be *SURE* to thank FractalUK for creating his awesome mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T04:14:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T09:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAside about ISRU over, here\u0027s what I\u0027ve been up to lately:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eLbyN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I practically shouted in joy when I finally managed to land that Launchpad on the top of one of the mountains west of the KSC... It is currently placed roughly 4630 meters above Kerbin Sea Level, on a slope of approximately 5 degrees to the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI unloaded all 3 of the Kerbals on board the HELO:B and recovered the copter (rather than fly it back to the KSC), and am loading up another HELO B with a load of RocketParts to connect to the Launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I won\u0027t have to perform any more trips though- rather than carrying out literally dozens or hundreds of supply runs to the mountaintop to carry up all the parts needed for future launches piece by piece, I\u0027m just going to be using TAC Fuel Balancer to repeatedly edit full the RocketParts and LFO storage containers I set up connected to the Launchpad by KAS port. I\u0027ll still be having to run up crew for my launches (there\u0027s no way to spawn them at the mountain launchpad), so it won\u0027t be THAT easy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T09:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
