Well don\u0027t use em\u0027! Instead put a poor little probe on the danger! Okay that is enough of that. It isn\u0027t a fighter so don\u0027t expect dime quality turning but it should be enough for anything the probe will come across. She comes stock with two light missles for self defence or light attack. I am working on a heavier version for dog fighting. Also press two for the asthetics protion. A good thing about this craft is there is almost no part clipping, with the exeption a two cubical struts. I hope you enjoy flying it and here are the pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bXdcb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
