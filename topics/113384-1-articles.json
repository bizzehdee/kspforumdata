I have limited time this morning, so I may need to come back this afternoon to fill in the blanks.\n\nThe idea is to start with a mission requirement and end up with a design derived from it. \n\n-Mission requirement: Payload mass, required DV, minimum acceleration\n\n-Design result: Number of engines, mass of fuel, mass of empty tanks.\n\nWe set up the math for one engine and then copy \u0026 paste for all others so that we can see the result for all engines simultaneously. This allows us to compare designs so we can pick the best design.\n\nStep #1: How much total mass can a single engine of this type accelerate at our minimum rate?\n\n I define the acceleration in Gs and reference it to the local gravity, such as .5 Gs on Kerbin \n\n We take the thrust in KN and divide it by the local gravity and Gs acceleration.\n\nStep #2: What fraction of this total mass must be fuel in order to achieve the desired DV?\n\n This uses the rocket equation in reverse; e^(DV/9.81Isp)-1\n\nStep #3: From step 2, derive the mass of fuel and tanks for our single engine reference.\n\n Multiply the fuel fraction by total stage mass to yield the mass of fuel. Multiply the fuel mass by 1/8 to yield the tank mass.\n\nStep #4: Find the payload mass of our single engine reference.\n\n Total stage mass-engine mass-fuel mass-tank mass=payload mass.\n\nStep #5: Scale it up to fit our need.\n\n Payload mass required/ reference payload mass= number of engines needed for the full scale stage. Use the roundup(x,0) function to yield an integer value.\n\nAt this point, we could simply use the scaled numbers and call it good, but because we have to round up to the nearest whole number of engines, we have a little more mass than the model expects and this will hurt our total DV. We have to reiterate with our total engine mass and payload in order to find our fuel load and tankage.\n\nStep #6: Compute tankage mass for final vehicle.\n\n6a: e^(DV/9.81Isp)= Rwd\n\n6b:\n\n (Rwd-1)(NMe\u002BMp)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ = Mt The mass of your required fuel tank in tonnes when empty.\n\n (9-Rwd)\n\nwhere\n\nN= number of engines\n\nMe= mass of an individual engine\n\nMp= mass of payload\n\n6c: Mt\\*8= Mf; the mass of your fuel and oxidizer.\n\nSo now you have everything you need. Number of engines, amount of fuel, and tankage. From here you can figure out total vehicle mass and cost so that you can directly compare results from different engines.\n\nI design my missions backwards this way with later stages\u002Bcouplers entered as payload for previous stages.\n\nFor a first stage lifter I\u0027ll use the sea level thrust and an Isp mid-way between Vac and Isp. For all others I use the vacuum numbers.\n\n It only takes a few minutes to design a multistage rocket this way, and then I build it IAW the numbers. Takes all the guesswork out of the process and assures that my design is cheap, efficient, and will do exactly what I need it to do.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T21:46:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lynch","CreatedById":136598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T17:26:04Z","Content":"Best regards to Slashy on his answer to my post, I am preparing a new post up on calculations; for whom interested I await you on the links of the 1st post of this thread. =)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T17:45:27Z","Content":"A brave attempt to make our lives easier is always appreciated.
