Anyways, if you download, unzip and put this file in the same place the .exe is and double click it, it should open the client just like it works on windows, you can then do your settings and connect. You can open the file in TextEdit or something and see what it does precisely. All it really does is navigate to the right place and then open the .exe with mono, but it\u0027s quick and effortless so why not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99458555/StartKLF.command.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99458555/StartKLF.command.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T13:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi thank you i think that it works now i only need to find a server and take a look at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T14:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETheres a couple servers on the forum topic for KLF.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
