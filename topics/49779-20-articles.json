The only option is to send fuel lines to each engine or attatch them directly to an rcs tank? I\u0027m finding this very problematic with smaller designs. Right now this particular launch vehicle I\u0027m working on is very small and the second stage needs help with attitude. But I cannot for the life of me tuck tanks, ports and fuel lines under this tiny .72m stage. I have good rcs ports that fit and small tanks, but I can\u0027t feed them. Despite the ports and tanks being right next to eachother they will not feed fuel. And the fuel lines are twice the size of the rcs ports and do not attatch to any of my rcs tanks.
