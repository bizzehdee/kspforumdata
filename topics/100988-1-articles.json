Except aliens aren\u0027t really within the scope of the game, and are also on the list of things that won\u0027t be included/shouldn\u0027t be suggested. Sure, aliens might be a silly idea for KSP, but it would still be fun to have some other active force besides you in the game, wouldn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also people who like playing with weapons, right? BDA, Skillful, or even just detachable \u0027missiles\u0027 which are just fuel tanks and engines? Only problem is, there\u0027s nothing to shoot at but your own stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter randomly-placed, non-player-controllable spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d probably be mostly your own designs, maybe with a few \u0022secret\u0022 stock designs that only show up as NPCs, and their position and state of stage attachment when found would be governed by how much delta-V they have (i.e. you wouldn\u0027t find a space shuttle orbiting Jool, but you could easily find one of your short-range landers on the surface of Minmus). I\u0027d imagine they\u0027d be relatively rare to find - space is a big place, and, particularly early in the game, I wouldn\u0027t expect many agencies to have the power of spaceflight. In fact, that might add something of a race element to the game - You might be the first off the ground, but you\u0027ll have to work some to be the first to any given destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOstensibly, they\u0027d belong to rival space programs. The tracking station would be able to pick them up in the vicinity of Kerbin in much the same way as asteroids, but further out, you might only be able to detect them by flying there yourself. At that point, your ability to detect them might depend on a number of things, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Operational state of the NPC (running ships containing live kerbals will be easier to find than derelicts, just because of radio traffic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Antennae on your own ship (this could be a double function for resource scanners - finding other ships)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Skill level of crew members\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Size of NPC ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, the NPCs would be in different states of repair. You could easily find crash debris or halves of ships that didn\u0027t make it down to the surface of a planet in one piece, orbiting derelicts with important parts missing, and, of course, fully-operational craft with missions of their own. These last ones might have variable behavior - they might, for instance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Try to rendezvous with you once detected- after all, most kerbals are probably very curious by nature, and they\u0027ll want check out that weird blip on the radar just as much as you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Run away from you if you try to approach them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ignore you completely- they have more important business to attend to than your silliness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also give rise to a bunch of new options and gameplay mechanics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You could dock to a derelict ship, assuming it has a docking port, and siphon off whatever resources are still left aboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You could also board a ship which is mostly functional but lacks crew and claim it for yourself, assuming the previous owners were so kind as to leave the door unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Contracts could require you to deliver supplies to a stranded ship, salvage a derelict, tow an NPC satellite or station into a new orbit, or otherwise help out spacecraft in need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, combat will be something many people will be looking for. I don\u0027t think space combat, being as notoriously complex as it is, would find much of a place in stock KSP, but that won\u0027t stop people from mounting weapons on their craft anyway. In the stock game, I would imagine destroying (or colliding with) other people\u0027s ships would lower your reputation significantly, and they might start to run from you more often if your notoriety got particularly high. This would also, of course, open the door to all kinds of complicated combat-based mods - it wouldn\u0027t take much more than what you can already do with Mechjeb to make an NPC ship launch things at you, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I think having NPC ships in the game would greatly improve its immersiveness in a way that wouldn\u0027t complicate the existing mechanics too much. It would also add a constantly-changing element to the gameplay, which would keep players interested for longer, and would further diversify contracts and make the game more exciting - who doesn\u0027t love finding strange ships?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what does everyone think?

Mods such as MechJeb and KER are already quite good at figuring out which stages are which and calculating dV, and the latter is already a planned feature if I remember correctly. So all you need to do is to have your little map-blip keep track of how much dV it\u0027s using as it moves (not a very heavy operation) and then figure out which parts of itself (spent stages) it needs to delete whenever a certain stage runs out of fuel. The ships would never execute burns (apart from ones designed to flee or approach you) when inside physics range, so you could get away with instantaneous accelerations, too. It\u0027s not perfect, no, but it would be very computationally inexpensive (especially considering how infrequently it would occur) and would probably be relatively simple to add. \u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do they have their own space center ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Inland KSC, anyone? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENah.
