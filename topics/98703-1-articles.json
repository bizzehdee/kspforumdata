Now, outside of game we have the Wiki, but I don\u0027t really use it unless I\u0027m talking to someone and I don\u0027t have the game open or unless I\u0027m looking for delta-v requirements etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is that a really good manual on the UI and just understanding the game (eg, how to read the navball, basic orbital mechanics (retroburn to lower, pro burn to raise), and how to translate what the game is giving you into the info needed for flight) would be amazing, and probably worth two or three dev-months worth of time to get very understandable. Same basic outline of say, the DCS A-10 manual: purpose, terms, UI explanation, how to fly, advanced maneuvers, etc. Tips to avoid common errors (backwards docking ports etc) would be nice. I don\u0027t know how long a great comprehensive manual would end up being, but maybe...200 pages? Split into separate docs (how to use the editors, orbital mechanics, quick start guide, career overview, etc). It should definitely be available outside of the game for printing or whatever, and maybe there could be a simple manual pdf reader in-game as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third idea is that videos of maneuvers aren\u0027t needed. We have the tutorial system for a reason, and a good interactive tutorial is an effective way to teach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest hurdle to manuals and really good docs using language rather than pictographs is that they\u0027ll have to be translated into a variety of languages, although I imagine the community would help out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T00:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I have to go to the VAB to look at the parsts, go to the tracking station to see planet stats, and go to the Science Buildibg to look at the tech tree.

It could be worked as maybe having to first track the planet in the tracking station to learn it\u0027s position, size and movement, and then having to deploy a probe in that planets SOI to learn about its atmosphere, gravity etc. and once you have that info it is available to you from then on in the Kerbopedia, and Wehrner Kerban could give you pointers on how he thinks a landing on a body with those characteristics might go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would add another layer of complexity and realism to the game, as well as providing more information incrementally rather than knowing everything about everything at the start, which is unrealistic and a bit boring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T01:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t going to take up any more of KSP 4GB of memory space, is it?

Or you might want to check which contracts are available, before you decide which tech tree nodes to unlock. Or maybe you want to compare the stats of many different engines quickly, instead of having to go through many separate windows, where most of the space is used for unnecessary information, like picture and flavor text.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space center works in a logical way, but the design is bad from UI perspective. Astronaut Complex, R\u0026amp;D, Mission Control, and Administration Facility shouldn\u0027t even exist as separate screens. Their functions are so simple that they could be implemented as windows that are accessible from anywhere. Keeping VAB, SPH, and the Tracking Station separate can be justified, but you should be able to switch between them without having to go outside first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
