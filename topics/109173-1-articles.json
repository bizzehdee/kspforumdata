However, in that area, shadows of terrain scatter boulders miles away pass through some of the cliffs and appear as dark spots on the ground in the area of the poles.\n\n[https://flic.kr/p/pHCXhw](https://flic.kr/p/pHCXhw)"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:08:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi all.\n\u003E Does anyone know if there still are any *really* large, steep(like 80\\* or more) cliffs or craters in the game?
