Using Cities Skylines as an example, the Gold FM channel has had most of the music removed because of DMC strikes and not being licensed for use outside of the game. Most of the music was US radio hits from the \u002740s to the \u002760s, and licensed for in game use only, not broadcast. So when streamers started playing the music on stream, Paragon/Colossal Order were in breach of contract and was forced to remove the songs... for everyone. (They were very apologetic to the players, but one bad apple you know.) So yes, especially in the US, you have to pay royalties and have the correct licensing to use music.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neptunium_69","CreatedById":218699,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-04T03:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WisconsinWintergreen","CreatedById":221250,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-16T12:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey definitely need to keep the KSP theme song, it really could use a revamp though.
