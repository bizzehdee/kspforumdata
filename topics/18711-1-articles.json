I do think that the price is a little high at 100 USD; I would drop it down to 75 USD myself. However, the fee is going towards the Child\u0027s Play charity, and it\u0027s a one-time fee for the developer. Overall, I can\u0027t really think of any other way that Valve would be able to police the system without huge expenses for themselves. This way it discourages those who aren\u0027t really serious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatisthisidonteven","CreatedById":41660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T02:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t know how much money Americans typically earn, but in the UK \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A363 ($100) is very little. The money is going to charity and it prevents their submissions from being filled with junk (I don\u0027t think anyone will pay $100 just to spam useless stuff that will probably get deleted anyway). Also, if you aren\u0027t willing to part with even $100 - Perhaps you should reconsider game developing.
