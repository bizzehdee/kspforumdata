In English that would mean that slow craft should turn earlier and with a more shallow profile, while fast craft should climb steep and turn late - so exactly opposite to what the KSP Wiki is telling us to do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really unfortunately. I\u0027s hard to explain in detail. It\u0027s just that there are so many variables that optimal flight path would be very complicated function and would work only for one craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso one thing to improve in MJ ascent path would be to add reduction in velocity requirement as gravity drag decreases due to centripetal force (as the idea of terminal velocity is to have drag loss equal the gravity one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, searching for minimal delta-v path is also not the end point of maximizing efficiency, as it is by principal not the most efficient for any given ship. That\u0027s because of engine weight, that is required to satisfy TWR demands, that impose higher weight cost than fuel saved from delta-v difference of less optimal path. For example we can do almost the same launch with lower engine mass (lower TWR), but constant 100% thrust, never reach terminal velocity and achieve orbit on less fuel spent even thou we used more delta-v. Going even further with lower TWR we can achieve lower launch mass for given payload by exchange engine mass for a little more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: hmm that wasn\u0027t worded right either :|. Let\u0027s just say that the most efficient craft will hardly ever reach terminal velocity so its hard to create a profile based on its ability to follow such speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit2: And that would be my point... not only it would be hard to create optimal ascent profile based on things like steering looses (following vertical velocity vector) and balancing gravity and drag losses (following terminal velocity) but also depending on actual craft design there are more possible craft paths that give better results that mostly have a lot to do with craft dynamics (craft momentum, acceleration profiles, Oberth effect etc)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T20:13:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nao\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
