I went for a big boy and instantly regretted. I mean, it was cool, but my puny little dual NERVA engine \u0022tug\u0022 could barely put a dent in its velocity and even doing my best to aim for CoM on it resulted in it spinning quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried the same tug with a class C. Lot of time and effort invested, but I did get a capture on it and parked in Kerbal orbit in a 600km to 4,500km equitorial orbit. Still wobbly/rotate-y, but I managed. Only had to fuel up my tug once to manage the \u0022feat\u0022. Of course the rock probably doesn\u0027t weigh much more than my tug does (medium rockomax tank with dual NERVAs, MKIII capsule, solar, lights, RCS, docking ports to refuel. Basically it). I plan on building a station off of the thing, for fun. Then probably jettisoning the tug once I\u0027ve pulled all of the fuel out of it for the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust gotta design the first station module now, launch and attach it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T21:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to capture a few large asteroids, and it has always ended in bitter tears.

The tug was quite modest - twin NERVAs and a half-orange tank of fuel. I met the asteroid in solar orbit and only had 100 m/s of delta-V with it clawed (not helped by wasting some in a muck-up earlier), but that sufficed to aerocapture it into Kerbin orbit. Not a neat orbit, but that was deliberate; I probably could have got a much lower inclination if I\u0027d tried.

Getting enough fuel there is just a matter of assembling a large enough tug. The problem was the same as reported above stability. Second time around I broke the tug into three parts. an engine section with 7 LV-Ns and almost no structure in front of it other than 2 2.5m gyro reaction units and 4 banks of vernor engines. Squat and well braced. I connected two fuel tankers AFTER securing the engine to the asteroid. The key was to have a grapple on each large tanker to secure them during thrust. Docking the tanker so that it\u0027s grapple impacted the same time the dock coupled with the engine took some finesse, but worth the effort. A nice spread out and stable thrust and fuel element with plenty of thrust and reaction control. I was easily able to apply full thrust with no wobble and no breakup of the ship.
