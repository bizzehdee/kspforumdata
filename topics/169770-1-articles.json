In it he has added a custom building to the space center that slowly produces antimatter, and if you want to launch a spacecraft with antimatter engines or reactors, you need to fuel it from that building\u0027s reserves before launch. You cannot get pre-filled antimatter tanks in the editor at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the license, you are potentially allowed to do more than just look at it. Provided you release your mod under the exact same license, and provide clear attribution, you could go as far as lifting entire code sections wholesale out of FFT and into your own mod. Though I\u0027d advise some caution in using code you don\u0027t understand - especially since modifying the space center is something only very few modders even know how to attempt. Learning how it works first and trying to make it work yourself can teach you a lot in that regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe not what you initially had in mind, but maybe it helps? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T04:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E, thats probably where I saw it.
