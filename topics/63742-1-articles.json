We also have frigates such as \u0022Forward Unto Dawn\u0022 (From halo) and \u0022Infinity\u0022 (Also from halo) But with different names (Only used their names for examples). We will probably do stories and mission reports, Also we are most likely going to build and release crafts and have their craft files for download mostly frigates for you to use for any of your needs, Also we may release a pelican build too. If you\u0027d like to join the KNSC Reply or send a PM To me with what unit you\u0027d like to be in (Units are divisions, such as kerbaltons or marines, even airforce for driving pelicans basically piloting.
