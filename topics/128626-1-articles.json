I wanted to check the Center of mass of my lander but when you detach it then it become the transparent part and it only show the CoM of the other parts. Is there a way that the other parts become transparent and only the lander stay without building the lander seperately again ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T20:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery ship in KSP has one part that\u0027s the \u0022root\u0022 part-- that\u0027s the root of the tree that all other parts descend from, in attachment order.\u00A0 In the editor, this root part is normally the first one that you place.\u00A0 Whenever you detach a piece in the editor, one of the two halves becomes \u0022inactive\u0022 (turns transparent, is no longer accounted for in CoM), whereas the other half remains and stays solid.\u00A0 The important thing to remember is that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe active, remaining half will always be the one with the root part in it\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the behavior you\u0027re describing, it sounds as though you started building your ship outward from the main command pod, and the lander was something you added afterwards.\u00A0 Therefore, the root part isn\u0027t on the lander, which means when you separate the two, it\u0027s the lander that goes transparent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you can do:\u00A0 you can \u0022re-root\u0022 the ship.\u00A0 There\u0027s a tool in the editor that lets you change the root part to something different from what you originally placed as the first part.\u00A0 (There\u0027s a button for this at top left, or you can press the 4 key to go into re-root mode).\u00A0 Using this tool, you can (for example) change the root part from being the command module of your main ship, to being the command module of the lander instead.\u00A0 Once you do that, you can then separate off the main ship from the lander, and it will be the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elander\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that stays and the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emain ship\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that goes transparent and inactive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way you can then see where the CoM is for the lander itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe re-root tool is a little tricky to use:\u00A0 first it asks you to click on some other part \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(no idea why it asks this, folks have discussed the matter in the forum and I\u0027ve never seen any reasonable answer proposed)\u003C/span\u003E, then you click on the part you want to be the root.\u00A0 So, for example, to make the lander\u0027s command pod the root part, you would first press 4 (to go into re-root mode), then click on the part immediately beneath the command pod, then click on the command pod itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-25T20:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QuietElite","CreatedById":155890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T20:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the quick answer \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbin","CreatedById":153424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T20:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understood you right, your problem is that lander isn\u0027t you root part.
