The code between the two for setting CoM is identical, but the results affecting gimbaling but not control surfaces, reaction wheels, or control inputs indicates a CoM error. Further, that the error requires velocities \u0026lt; 750 m/s indicates that a relatively high world velocity is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s consider what happens if the VesselModule runs first: it calculates the CoM of the vessel, and then the PartModules come along to make use of the CoM calculated \u003Cem\u003Ethat frame\u003C/em\u003E; everything works as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens if the PartModules run first? The CoM location used by the gimbal PartModules is the CoM location \u003Cem\u003Efrom the previous frame\u003C/em\u003E; below 750 m/s, when Krakensbane isn\u0027t active, that can be as much as 750 m/s * 0.02s per frame = 15 m away, which could be enough to cause issues on short vehicles. It should also vary with vehicle orientation, and tests in the FAR thread seem to indicate that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so if this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the mechanism, it\u0027s an order of operations issue. Why would that happen? VesselModules and PartModules are both derived from Unity\u0027s MonoBehaviour class, which execute most of the code in the game. MonoBehaviours have each of their functions executed in the order that they were created, so if you get PartModules that exist before VesselModules, then the PartModules should run first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is an issue, it should actually be reproducible in stock as well; undock a short vehicle from a station (read: create a new vessel and new VesselModule, but with old parts and PartModules) and then bring it below 750 m/s and the issue should appear. If that shows the problem, then ultimately this is just an exacerbated stock issue of relying too heavily on order of operations to get things done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I\u0027m not sure why ModularFlightintegrator is being added late though. It should be added in the same mechanism that FlightIntegrator is, so I\u0027m a little stumped right now as to how to solve it. I should be able to get something together though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GorillaZilla","CreatedById":100625,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T07:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm after watching the video, this is Exactly the problem I\u0027m having also....
