Specifically.. if I get on an intercept, then my \u0022current\u0022 path is still that \u0022blue\u0022 line, and the \u0022new\u0022 path after the intercept becomes reflected by the purple line. I\u0027d like to try and adjust my burn at this point, but the blue lines seems to become unclickable and any manouever node I make ends up on the purple line. I\u0027ve had this across several games - is it meant to be normal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Doesn\u0027t happen all the time. Sometimes I can zoom out and back in, or time warp for a bit, and it seems to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T11:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a well-known bug in the game trying to figure out where you want to place your maneuver node. It also happens that even though there\u0027s only a blue line and no other line (if your current trajectory sends you into the lithosphere, for example), sometimes you just cannot click on that blue line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no other workarounds other than what you have mentioned. You can also place a maneuver node anywhere on the trajectory, and then drag it to the point where you want it to be. Just be sure to not drag it into the \u0022past\u0022 (where your vessel has been before), or it will be marked as \u0022executed\u0022, which will leave you only with the delete option on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T12:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T12:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the one bug that really bugs me.

If you\u0027re using conic patch mode 0 (which is otherwise more convenient) and need the maneuver really desperately, save your game, edit the config, place the maneuver, orient your ship along it, then save again and change the conic patch mode back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use a mod which allows you to switch conic patch mode during the game or a mod which allows you to change time of execution of the maneuver to slide it over breaks in the trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you can also put the maneuver on the blue part of trajectory in some other place. For instance when returning from interplanetary travel your trajectory is usually highly hyperbolic with sharp turn around the destination planet. You can usually place your maneuver around this sharp turn, then slide it where you need it to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T13:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-22-PreciseNode-0-5-Interplanetary-Maneuver-Node-Assistant\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-22-PreciseNode-0-5-Interplanetary-Maneuver-Node-Assistant\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one lets you change the conics in the game, live, without save/load hassle - and it is otherwise also one of the most useful mods for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
