It seems that anything that drops off my vessel with parachutes deployed ultimately gets treated as having crashed into the planet unless I remain close enough to watch said part until it has safely floated all the way down to the surface (which isn\u0027t really going to happen during a proper launch) and I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027m just doing something wrong or should be planning on jettisoned boosters always being total losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T01:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Patrick Kerbivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T00:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything that moves more than 2.5km away from the active craft is automatically deleted, regardless of parachutage.
