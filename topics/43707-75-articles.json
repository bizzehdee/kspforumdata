This is giving me a lot of trouble during my ascent script because when I tell it to go from a pitch of 90 degrees down to a pitch of 70 degrees in the east direction, it always first aims north for a bit and then curves around to east. by the time it does that it\u0027s already imparted enough delta-v in the northward direction that it will cause my final orbit to have a bit of inclination when I didn\u0027t want it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you accounting for roll? From the launchpad, pitch input will correlate to north-south, you\u0027ll need to do a 90 degree roll to get pitch control aligned with east-west, doing the pitch and roll at the same time tends to result in the type of behaviour you described. I start from the pad with \u0022heading 90 by 90.\u0022 (well, x by y, but whatever), which causes the ship to roll it\u0027s navball belly to east immediately on takeoff, after which changing to \u002290 by 45\u0022 or whatever pitches directly east, without passing north or collecting 200$. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYMMW if you\u0027re using the other methods of guiding direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBH that behaviour drives me bonkers in MechJeb (which does it too in it\u0027s SASS), but I don\u0027t really notice it in kOS, I tend to account for it in the programs, whereas with MJ it catches me off guard \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr I could have completely misunderstood your problem and spent the last few minutes rambling about something irrelevant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] Sma beat me to it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T21:12:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sacred Aardvark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHi Jim, I\u0026#039;d like to buy a line break\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T21:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the past I could always get around this by shutting the engines off until facing matched the desired direction, and THEN burn.
