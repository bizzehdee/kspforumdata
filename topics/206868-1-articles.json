Potentially worse, there have been enough outright scams involving blockchain.

Because there are good and exciting things about the former, and the later is a pile of dung. And the fact that there are good and legitimate uses of technology is only accenting the fact that what we\u0027re actually seeing isn\u0027t some well-intended fiasco, but a genuine scam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re running an MMO, for example, and you have items that you want to feel unique and rare, and you want people to have ability to claim ownership anonymously, for example, a public ledger with concealed identities and proof of knowledge system is a good way to achieve it. There is just no reason for that ledger to exist on a blockchain, because if your items are tied to a specific game, then that game\u0027s server should have authority to write the ledger. And even if you are pushing some sort of cross-game compatibility, you are still relying on central authority to introduce and track items, so again, that authority can simply be in charge of keeping the ledger. Making it decentralized is stupid. And if you take the blockchain out of it, you can have NFTs in all but name minus the environmental impact and minus the fraud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, artificial scarcity and FOMO in games can be exploited even without additional shady layers on top, but it\u0027s not inherently bad. It\u0027s all about how it\u0027s monetized. Getting a rare or unique item after putting in a lot of time into a game can feel rewarding and be constructive to game experience. Having it sold to you in a loot box, well, that\u0027s a different matter. But that\u0027s precisely the point I\u0027m trying to make here. We have the tech and opportunity to use the crypto technology in games in a way that does not cause a drastic increase in power usage with every transaction, having negative environmental impact, nor encourages fraud. Just like there are good ways to use artificial scarcity in games to improve player engagement without being exploitative.\u00A0And yet, we are not going that route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s intentionally pushing NFTs to increase harm we\u0027re doing on environment, so the fact that people pushing them are resisting this concept makes me fully convinced that fraud is precisely the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BekfastDerp13","CreatedById":214450,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-15T18:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI forgot to say this:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun to\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake the time to make/buy bad monkey drawings them use them to buy KSP 2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-15T18:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2022 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by BekfastDerp13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catto","CreatedById":137773,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-15T18:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never thought i would hear Blockchain and KSP in the same sentence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T1mo98","CreatedById":148056,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-15T20:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224092165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644947535\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re running an MMO, for example, and you have items that you want to feel unique and rare, and you want people to have ability to claim ownership anonymously, for example, a public ledger with concealed identities and proof of knowledge system is a good way to achieve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat just sounds like needlessly overcomplicating the Steam Inventory system.

I want to boast about it somewhere without revealing my account. If you have a searchable system where one can look up who owns what items, like Steam Inventory, a unique item points directly to a specific user account. In contrast, if public information is a ledger that only identifies an item and transfer date from creation and until the latest transactions, with new owner identified only by a secret unique to each transaction, then the only info you can get about an item is how many times it\u0027s been traded. But if somebody wants to prove that they are the owner, they can generate a time-stamped proof-of-knowledge code that identifies them as such. Technically, that can all be handled with dumb random tokens and server-side verification, but then you have to trust the game devs that the item is truly unique, that no shady transfers have been done, etc. With a public ledger, it\u0027s easy to verify any particular history of ownership without revealing the identities of specific players. So you get a bit more transparency about the in-game economy without compromising anyone\u0027s privacy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCritically, absolutely none of it requires a blockchain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs any of this ever strictly necessary? No, not really. But it\u0027s not hard to setup and so long as you have central authority that publishes the ledger, this isn\u0027t wasteful. It can still be scammy, but only in the same way that existing digital goods systems already are. This doesn\u0027t introduce additional incentives or avenues for grift. So if a game is ready meant to have some sort of player economy and unique or rare items, why not? Computational cost of running something like this is negligible compared to your normal server overhead of running a player market. There is really no strong reason not to do this from either the tech or ethics perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is entirely in trying to shoehorn all of that into a blockchain. One can have a discussion on whether a blockchain is ever the right solution to any problem, but it certainly isn\u0027t for games. Blockchain requires extra engineering effort, even if it\u0027s a 3rd party integration, it wastes resources on global scale, and it invites scams due to inherent deregulation. As such, it always makes any game economy, whether in-game or actual monetization economy, strictly worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-17T21:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224092057\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644930711\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/15/2022 at 2:11 PM, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou be you, after more than a thousand hours in TF2 (not much by tf2 standards) I don\u0027t feel scammed at all having spent some 50\u20AC in cosmetics over the course of 6 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, microtransactions don\u0027t work well with KSP and never will, but that doesn\u0027t mean that there aren\u0027t cases in which they work without being a \u0022scam\u0022 like you say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the while crypto bandwagon thought I agree that it never make sense to have them in any game (or most other applications).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy influence I mean the in game economy or balance and not eye candy.
