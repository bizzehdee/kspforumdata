As a matter of fact it would be completely boring and ruin the game. I too, like Stupid_Chris, am an explorer extraordinaire and master builder of all things rockety. Nothing shall slow down my conquest of the Kerbalverse ... such as boring, repetitive, carpal tunnel syndrome producing, been there done that a zillion times before manual tasks.
