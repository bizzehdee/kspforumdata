I\u0027ve run into the issue where big portions of the .dds part texture files are \u0022invisible\u0022 when showing up. I\u0027ve sent a message to a SQUAD dev on this matter as well (though he hasn\u0027t checked his inbox haha). NOTE that this isn\u0027t a transparency issue. No matter how many times I merge images, these sections remain completely invisible.\n\nHere are three pictures explaining the issue\\*:\n\n**Stock unedited .DDS**\n\n![E7EnhWQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/E7EnhWQ.png)\n\nThe red circled question mark shows where the invisible portion of the texture is. This section of the texture is supposed to be the top of the piece. \n\nIt shows up in game, but is completely invisible when editing regardless of transparency.\n\n**Highlighted .DDS**\n\n![gsZFjSk.png](http://i.imgur.com/gsZFjSk.png)\n\nThis snip shows where the invisible portion is. You can highlight it through similar color matching with a nearby part, but it appears as though there is no way to make it actually visible for editing.\n\n**1000\u002B layer merge to remove transparency**\n\n![nK0neSF.png](http://i.imgur.com/nK0neSF.png)\n\nStill transparent after merging 1000\u002B copies of the same image on top of each other, the invisible textures remain invisible. Is there any way to fix this!\n\n\\*I would imgur link it but the new embeds are straight trash regarding captions\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks for the read,\n\n- Avera9eJoe"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:38:27Z","Content":"You\u0027re in Photoshop, right?
