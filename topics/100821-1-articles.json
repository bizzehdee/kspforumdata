I am toying With this idea as a more generic thermodynamics model mod which my Ampyear mod can make use of it\u0027s climate control system at least to regulate cabin temperatures. Apart from that and the obvious overheating ,fire, failures etc I\u0027m researching the topic at the moment for other dynamics I could include. Do people think this would be worthwhile as a stand alone mod? Have ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T08:39:17Z","Content":"RoverDude and Nertea are working on [something with regard to thermal mechanics,](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-NFElectrical-revisions-rewrite-very-beta-release?p=1608646\u0026viewfull=1#post1608646) but it mostly seems to do with bleeding heat from nuclear reactors at the moment.
