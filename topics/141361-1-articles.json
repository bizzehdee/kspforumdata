What are the effects of this on KSC operations? Does it affect launches in any way or is it purely cosmetic? If there are specific effects, do they vary for other components of the KSC infrastructure and is there a list of these somewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnore the lander on the launchpad; I just needed to load something there to take the screenshot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JGisp6X.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JGisp6X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-07T13:34:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2016 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T15:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. It affects your ability to upgrade that facility, but your pad is already at tier 3.
