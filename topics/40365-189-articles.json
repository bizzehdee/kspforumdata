The equivalent TWR point is, I believe, somewhere between the 2.5m and 3.75m reactor and thermal rocket combination so the biggest reactor is simply invariably better than the stock one, the 2.5m one is certainly lower thrust but not massively and brings that better Isp to the table. By the time you get down to the smaller ones though, although you\u0027ve still got that improved specific impulse, you\u0027re really starting to have thrust problems.

The problem can still be solved by more radiators though. Basically, you won\u0027t see much benefit of having upgraded radiators until you get upgraded reactors because the upgraded radiators won\u0027t be able to get hot enough to work at anywhere near full capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, those inline radiators are really not designed for radiating the heat of a nuclear reactor in space, it\u0027s nowhere near big enough. They\u0027re amazing little things in atmosphere but you will need a huge quantity in space to get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a 3.75m generator/reactor, four of the second largest radiators might not be enough (at least until you get those reactor upgrades). The second largest radiator dissipates 75MW when unupgraded, without upgraded reactors you won\u0027t see substantially more than this even from an upgraded radiator - you might get 100MW. The 3.75m reactor is 3GW thermal upgraded, so four lots of 100MW is not going to do the trick, not even close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 of the huge radiators will do the trick though, provided you don\u0027t want to run the reactor at full power all the time, if you do, try three or four.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo cool the 1.25m reactor, three or four small deployable radiators or 1 medium deployable radiator will easily handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might\u0027ve missed the part where I said the design worked fine in space (with absolutely no WasteHeat accumulation for several HOURS)- and then it suddenly stopped radiating heat correctly after several unloads/reloads. ALSO, keep in mind this bug occurs with EITHER the inline radiators, OR the deployable versions. The bug also occurs when the Science Lab is off- and there is almost no electrical demand on the system, or when the generators were off- which means essentially the same thing to the reactor... I even experienced this problem on a design utilizing a 3.75m fission reactor and 2 of the LARGEST (\u0022HUGE\u0022) upgraded deployable radiators...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most power-drain any of these craft ever experienced (when the thermal rocket nozzles were inactive) was 5 MW- from a single Science Lab performing research. So the reactor only needed to run at less than 10% capacity to meet the power demands with the upgraded generators in use... 4 of the medium deployables (or two of the largest deployables for sure) *SHOULD* be more than enough to dissipate the heat of a 3.75 meter fission reactor running at low capacity to meet an electrical demand of only 5 MW...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you said about the radiators not working properly when they got HOTTER makes no sense, and you might want to re-examine the coding that went into the radiators if you programmed them that way. Radiators should always give off MORE heat the hotter they get- so if the unupgraded fission reactors allow the upgraded radiators to reach their maximum temperature, but the upgraded reactors don\u0027t, the radiators should give off MORE heat at the higher temperatures reached with the unupgraded versions according to the basic physical laws governing heat radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter what the reactor temperature is when calculating the radiator heat give-off to the vacuum of space- a given size radiator gives off a given amount of heat at a given temperature. Period. End of story. I think you\u0027re over-complicating things by thinking of the equations for the heat-transfer *TO* the radiators, instead of the equations for the heat transfer *FROM* the radiators. The radiators will heat up or cool down until the rate they receive energy is equal to the rate they give it off at- but none of that effects the rate of power give-off of the radiators themselves at a certain (set) temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe efficiency that was falling to zero, once again, was that of the electric generators, not the radiators (which indicated they were giving off more than enough energy to cool the reactors, at full output, when right-clicked). It\u0027s not exactly explained anywhere how that is related to radiator temperature- but one would think their efficiency should be related to the ambient temperature of the craft (total fractional WasteHeat levels)- NOT to the temperature of the radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I\u0027ve also noticed the WasteHeat not partitioning in any logical way- i.e. rather than spreading out evenly through the craft, one radiator or one reactor will climb to maximal levels before another starts to accumulate WasteHeat, apparently without any logical ordering (it MIGHT work by the stack-priority rule used to govern fuel drain by engines, but that wouldn\u0027t make any logical sense, as the heat sources can be placed anywhere on the craft...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter what, WasteHeat shouldn\u0027t have been accumulating with the generators OFF. This effectively decouples the reactors from all power drains, and means they should only be running on standby (0%). Considering the inline radiator used was a 170 MW radiator, and the reactor was only a 40 MW reactor, even the inline radiator should have been able to radiate the reactor\u0027s output at full-power anyways. The 3.75m reactor was a 3GW reactor, yes- but the radiators attached were either four 3.4 GW radiators, or two 13.6 GW radiators- once again more than enough for the reactor size...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven using the un-upgraded figures instead, the 3GW reactor was overheating on standby with either four 75 MW radiators,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor two 300 MW radiators attached...
