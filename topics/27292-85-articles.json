Hitchhiking along on the transfer stage were a couple of sky crane design probe rovers intended for Gilly. I landed the first one the other day but honestly, the extremely low gravity and irregular shape made the landing almost more trouble than it\u0027s worth. So my second rover was now superfluous to the mission. I only included it as a spare in case I crashed the first one and for mass symmetry on my transfer stage. So I burned all the fuel in its crasher stage and put it on an aerobraking orbit around Eve, intending to create an \u0022impactor\u0022 probe and of course get rid of useless debris around Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long, shallow atmospheric descent, my probe finally ended up crashing down at a terminal velocity of ~70 m/s; because of the high gravity, that thick atmosphere would\u0027ve worked wonders if I\u0027d included parachutes. So anyway, my rover impacted crasher-stage down and there were suitably impressive explosions ... followed by my now-detached rover skittering across the surface of Eve, fully intact (even the solar panels!) aside from one wheel. Despite the jacked-up attitude and apparently partially-impacted front wheels, it rolls around at over 1 m/s pretty well.

Again, great approach (even more efficient than the first) and solid descent, touched down less than 200 meters away from the wrecked pod from shuttle #1. Didn\u0027t realize I came down on a slope, it tipped over, and tore off one of my off-set engines. Same kick-flip\u002BRCS trick later, it\u0027s upright again. I grab Bill and take off (left the K-tanks empty this time) - and start doing mad crazy somersaults! Crashed into the surface, pod with Billy-Bob survived as did the panel with Bill in the hotseat!

Started building my KSS (first station was deorbited already a long time ago), which will be nice and symmetric, and serve as a refuelling station for interplanetary Kermanned missions of the future. 3 launches and 2 dockings later the core is ready and Jeb is happy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I was also fed up with putting so much garbage at 100x100 km, so put the station at 125x125 (126.5x126.5), and also implemented a deorbiter phase on top of the last stage to avoid too much space junk near the orbit (see first pic with junk deorbiting and solar panel stage going for an encounter with KSS). Also, although I like to keep it stock, I started using Navyfish\u0027s docking mod, because it is impossible to get perfect angles without (and I like my solar panels in line). I will probably work on this station this week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ster.kuleuven.be/~peterp/KSP/screenshot840.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot840.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ster.kuleuven.be/~peterp/KSP/screenshot842.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot842.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ster.kuleuven.be/~peterp/KSP/screenshot848.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot848.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
