The USSR had a number of projects on the go that could be called an infinite-development-cycle project - these were never intended to fly, but tests and models would be made to get effectively the same aerospace knowledge from their development, without going full-budget. These included vehicles like the Spiral and LKS, but also the Buran - Russia wanted to keep up with US knowledge, but hadn\u0027t intended to actually build the shuttle. However, a few key engineers in the project were rather smart about vehicle design and procuring supplies, and weren\u0027t entirely aware (or elected to ignore) that the Buran wasn\u0027t to be completed, and so the vehicle was fully constructed and tested, and worked very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Russians do think a shuttle potentially has its uses - evidenced by the fact that a near-complete Buran, Ptichka, is still in storage at the Baikonur cosmodrome. However, they seemed to be more interested in other uses of similar technology, such as the Energiya II / Buran-T reusable heavy launch vehicle, or Baikal reusable booster for Angara, which is currently in-development. Likely they appreciate its capability, but are rather confused at features like the unnecessary built-in cockpit, so are glad of the technology but moving it on to better things that lack a number of the strange design requirements the shuttle was driven by.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iskierka\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Iskierka\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eevidenced by the fact that a near-complete Buran, Ptichka, is still in storage at the Baikonur cosmodrome.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
