The USSR had a number of projects on the go that could be called an infinite-development-cycle project - these were never intended to fly, but tests and models would be made to get effectively the same aerospace knowledge from their development, without going full-budget. These included vehicles like the Spiral and LKS, but also the Buran - Russia wanted to keep up with US knowledge, but hadn\u0027t intended to actually build the shuttle. However, a few key engineers in the project were rather smart about vehicle design and procuring supplies, and weren\u0027t entirely aware (or elected to ignore) that the Buran wasn\u0027t to be completed, and so the vehicle was fully constructed and tested, and worked very well.\n\nI think the Russians do think a shuttle potentially has its uses - evidenced by the fact that a near-complete Buran, Ptichka, is still in storage at the Baikonur cosmodrome. However, they seemed to be more interested in other uses of similar technology, such as the Energiya II / Buran-T reusable heavy launch vehicle, or Baikal reusable booster for Angara, which is currently in-development. Likely they appreciate its capability, but are rather confused at features like the unnecessary built-in cockpit, so are glad of the technology but moving it on to better things that lack a number of the strange design requirements the shuttle was driven by."},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:20:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E evidenced by the fact that a near-complete Buran, Ptichka, is still in storage at the Baikonur cosmodrome.\n\nInteresting.

Imagine if you worked in MiG design bureau on something as elegant as MiG-105 (Spiral) and then were suddenly told to go work on Buran behemoth, you\u0027d probably be sad.\n\nBut military loved Buran. I\u0027ve read in memoirs that every high-ranking idiot coming with some sort of inspection tried to touch the black insulation/ablation cover of the Buran itself, even when there was an identical plate just lying nearby for this very purpose.
