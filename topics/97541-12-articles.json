Hey, what\u0027s that thing over there?! *Points at nothing, runs away when people look.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in my mad grab to try and squeeze USI, New Horizons, RealPlume, your mods, and all the other stuff in one install, CCC was one of the mods I thought was safe enough to get rid of. Knowing that that\u0027s where the switching ability comes from, I\u0027ll put it back in tonight. Problem solved, now if I could figure out what caused some of my ui mods to act weird, I\u0027ll be good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
