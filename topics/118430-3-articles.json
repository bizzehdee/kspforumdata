Consider loans to be very WIP at the moment.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no UI for loans. Any way of issuing loans is by creating a plugin that interfaces with BROKE and creating a loan or reverse-engineering our use of the ConfigNode format for it to create one.

Negative numbers in the payment field currently are implemented as \u0022Pay the maximum possible\u0022. We should add the option to pay off some of the remaining balance on a loan above and beyond the required payment, so I\u0027ll make sure that\u0027s included somewhere.

Now, that would ideally require an ability in RemoteTech to purchase-unlock new groundstations, which IIRC has been planned for a while but is not, AIUI, done yet?--since otherwise it would just be a fixed cost per year for everybody. Or until that point, maybe base RT stations available on tracking station level, and the FM base on that.

That said, I think that the dish time concern needs a counterpart: capcom time, as it were.

If it\u0027s included with BROKE then there might be dependency issues when BROKE tries to load it. Plus FMs are supposed to be packaged with the mod they integrate with, which is why the loader in BROKE was written the way it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146934-jkortech/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146934\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146934-jkortech/\u0022\u003E@jkortech\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0if you end up writing that, feel free to submit a PR to the KCT repo (preferably the \u0022development\u0022 branch) with the FM.
