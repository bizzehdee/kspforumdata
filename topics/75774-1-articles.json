Idk how i would play without it ...

Theoretically, KER should be better than MJ in this respect as most of the KER calculations are done in a background thread. Make sure that you close any window that shows a deltaV readout and see if the performance improves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER also has a tweakable slider that allows you to control how often the deltaV calculations are done. If you really need the calculations (I usually only open the VES tab during flight just before doing a burn to make sure I have enough) then drag the \u0022Sim Time\u0022 slider all the way to the right which will make it only calculate approx once per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also believe that FAR does quite a lot of work though I presume you\u0027ve had this installed for longer and I wouldn\u0027t expect it to do much at all while outside the atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-23T17:00:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2014 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"code99","CreatedById":113538,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T17:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELittle update, apparently i dont have FAR installed ...
