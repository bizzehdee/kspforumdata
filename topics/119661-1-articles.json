So I\u0027d love it for somebody to make a Duna lander that can easily come back up to the main vessel and rendezvous and dock, and preferably but not required to come down with parachutes mainly or only. I\u0027d like it to be manned and have a good amount of science to use, as well as maybe a Rover and definately electricity generation and storage. As many things for a science expedition to land on Duna and come back as you can! And a side note, please tell me how I would have this on the vessel. Thanks loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canberra Gaming","CreatedById":147308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T15:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to stow it in a cargo bay.
