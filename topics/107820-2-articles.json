But after using OPT\u0027s turboramjet, I decided against it. It\u0027s a pain in the ass to incorporate and I don\u0027t have the slightest idea how to make custom resources. I think that it would make the scramjets tedious.\u003Cp\u003EI am interested in making parts with custom resources though. \u0022Tripropellant Aerospike\u0022 has a nice ring to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet in touch with K.Yeon, your SCRamjets would fit well with his OPT craft, also his Turboramjets are silly OP and behave like scramjets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the two of you could benefit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenRS11","CreatedById":83261,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to fill out the pack a little, you could make a few more high temp aerospace parts, like air intakes and a nosecone.

Right now I\u0027m working on a couple of parts that could disperse heat from a craft. One would passively radiate heat away at a low rate while the other actively radiates heat by dumping oxidizer with a much higher rate. What other engines/parts/features might also fit here? I really want to add more.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a hypersonic cockpit, I know there is one in B9 but some variety is always nice. Or maybe cockpit plus other parts with cooling systems you mentioned built in. Also any thoughts on a Pulse Det engine as from the Blackswift project? The oxidizer as coolant I like gives me a reason to build SRAMs with OX.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StevenRS11\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StevenRS11\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you wanted to fill out the pack a little, you could make a few more high temp aerospace parts, like air intakes and a nosecone.
