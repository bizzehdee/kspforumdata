By properly timing the departure, it might be possible to get that plane change down to 10-degrees, maybe less. When confronted with a large plane change, I think it comes down to a choice of (1) elliptical capture, or (2) waiting for a better launch window.

I would have warped ahead until Mun\u0027s orbital path is approximately normal to the plane of the target orbit (i.e. until the target orbit is aligned roughly 10 o\u0027clock to 4 o\u0027clock as the image is currently oriented). I then would have adjusted my approach trajectory so that I came in flying over one of Mun\u0027s poles (which pole depends on the direction of the orbit). In this way the plane of my incoming trajectory would be approximately the same as the plane of the target orbit. It should be possible to get the planes close enough that only a small change is necessary, which can easily be accomplished in combination with the capture burn for very little \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Both methods are valid. My method requires a very small plane change while near Kerbin to adjust the trajectory so it comes in over one of Mun\u0027s pole. I usually do this as a separate course correction shortly after the initial trans-munar injection burn. Your method requires a plane change in munar orbit and an additional burn to lower the apoapsis. My method might require more time at Kerbin waiting for the proper alignment*, but your method takes more time after arriving at Mun. It might be six of one half dozen of the other in terms of efficiency. What\u0027s best is probably what each individual feels most comfortable with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (ETA) *On second thought, you have to wait for a proper alignment as well, so you get no advantage there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (ETA #2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve studied this situation some more and ran a test to compare the methods. Both methods should use the same \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for trans-munar injection and orbit insertion. What we need to compare is the large plane change in Otis\u0027 method, versus the course correction \u002B small plane change in my method. According to the images posted by Otis, the spacecraft\u0027s velocity at munar apoapsis is 79.4 m/s, which means a burn of about 112 m/s is needed to complete a 90 degree plane change. According to the test I just ran, the course correction needed to get into a polar trajectory was 87 m/s. This gives me 25 m/s to work with, which will buy an 11 degree plane change when included with the orbit insertion burn. Therefore is comes down to how accurately the planes can be matched when using my method. If better than 11\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E then my method is more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv efficient, if worse than 11\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E then Otis\u0027 method is better.
