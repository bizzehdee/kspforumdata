I was trying to connect two Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connectors and the new one was highlighted in red. I rotated it and it turned green. As far as I can tell, all six sides of the multi-point connector are identical but apparently there is something different that was preventing them from joining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a sample of them not matching:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kbVVSlS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kbVVSlS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here they are after I rotated the new part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W0zjQf4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W0zjQf4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong or is there something obvious I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T22:29:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AndreZero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emarked as answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T22:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s the way it works.
