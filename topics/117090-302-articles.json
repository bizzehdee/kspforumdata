If you end up doing the Data Return Capsule model. I will most likely use it more often as a regular cargo bay. Just brainstorming, let me explain:   \n\nTo start, I have to say that while I like cargo bay, I kind of hate the stock system. Stock caped versions works fine but are not to my taste aesthetically, open ended version require a part with the same bulkheadProfiles in order to work properly (incompatible with SSTU scaling). For me, they always have been painful to work with. Now, your SSTUAirstreamShield work 100% of the time regardless of the context and is not CPU intensive. Could not ask for more.\n\nWith the planed MCB-B C and D we could simply add a para-docking port on top and a shield under (built or pre-built trough config) to get the Data Return Capsule while being able to built cargo-ed ship. Now, a conic variant would be absolutely awesome. Something like a modified petal adapter with a top cap and only one opening panel it would do the job quite well I think. The bottom section would probably need to have a flat top but there is already some end cap that would fit quite well.  \n\nWhat do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-24T18:29:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)Are these part are still on the list:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - *SC-TANK-MSM* - Service Module Fuel Tank - Customizable service module, integrated solar, fuel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, probe-core, reaction-wheel, possible integrated engine.
