This balances the advantage of having a turreted gun by making the aircraft weigh more and perform worse. I\u0027m also thinking about only allowing engineers to operate the gun, so the extra pilot advantage also gets nerfed.\n\nI like this thinking, I think something like it briefly flitted through my mind. Extra pilot advantage? AFAIK, as the AI really does the flying, it doesn\u0027t matter what kind of kerbals you use?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That is a great idea! Can I clip cockpits?\n\nThe only things I think that are cheaty are clipped fuel tanks, as fuel can only be so dense. Structural parts like cockpits and wings shouldn\u0027t matter. I hate clipping control surfaces but that\u0027s just because I like them to appear not to magically pass through other parts of a plane.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yep , i build it firstly for multi-role purpose \u0026 most weapon on it are useless in dogfight . My stock Rafale got only 60 parts .\n\u003E The BD-Armory aroud 80 . I\u0027ll entry a \u0022Contest Edition\u0022 to fit with your rules with this plane base . Most of my aircraft got more than 150 Parts even in stock , erf !\n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027ll probably surprised to see how my Copters shoot down some of my aircraft in less than 30s . \u0026 ofc i got some totally crazy with auto-pilot on ! ( Like go straight onto the ground or flying backward !) The main issue with copter is the main rotor , one hit there \u0026 it\u0022s finish for you ! But i have [tweckscale] parts on most of my copter to fit with stock aero/aesthetic , that\u0027s why i probably not entry my Copter , even if it\u0027s fly well !\n\n80 parts is pushing it - remember, four planes in action, so a potential 320 parts plus the overhead of multiple craft at once. Only a top spec PC can cope with that. Throw in streaming (noname is hot for that, and I guess this would make a good spectator sport) and you have some serious krakensbane...\n\nBD Armory presumes the direction of thrust is antiparallel to the forward vector. A helicopter\u0027s is perpendicular. I have been able to get VTOL take-off but that\u0027s as close as I think I\u0027ll manage. Make a hybrid jetcopter, and it might just work, but it\u0027ll roll and pitch wrongly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T20:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T20:12:18Z","Content":"\u003E 80 parts is pushing it - remember, four planes in action, so a potential 320 parts plus the overhead of multiple craft at once.

It seems that rate of fire and muzzle velocity are the biggest factors as far as effectiveness goes. Maybe we can take a look at those numbers and give different points to each gun. As far as the missiles go theirs pretty much only AMRAAMs and Sidewinders for air to air combat, and I think they\u0027re pretty balanced.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T03:36:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by t3hJimmer**"}]}
