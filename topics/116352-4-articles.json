A heavy fighter would likely be far stronger than a light fighter, so pairing the two against each other really wouldn\u0027t work.

Truthfully, I think my planes won because they were much, much better craft.

There should definitely be some realism so watchers of the contest can get a little more invested in it, though we shouldn\u0027t go full out realism to prevent creativity.
