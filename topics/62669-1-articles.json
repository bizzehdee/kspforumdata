A timer part, quite heavy (to make sure you can\u0027t just put on 80 or so). Next they\u0027d have to be on the stage your using them on. Then, each timer could only do 1 thing. Finally, a timer could only be used on parts that require no user input (so you can only use them on parachutes, or srb\u0027s, no science stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part would trigger certain events to happen, much like an action group. this could be good if your trying to reduce debris on kerbin, after you separate a large stage, a timer starts, when that timer finishes it deploys parachutes. or, if your trying to land 3 different command pods, you separte them, a timer starts, then deploys parachutes. Or eve on duna, you can land multiple craft, by first using a timer to get a lander into the atmosphere, then use another one to allow chutes to deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charzy","CreatedById":440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T17:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you make it heavy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T17:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if timers were implemented I\u0027m afraid you\u0027d not like the result. Any object more than 2.5 km from the active ship is \u0022on rails\u0022 and no physics emulation is done on it. If it happens to be in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere below 23 km altitude it is immediately terminated (considered destroyed in crash). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce debris, it is possible to use the Terminate mission function in Tracking station. It is the most effective way to deal with debris and unwanted ships and you can always imagine they are using some powerful lasers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to land several pieces at once, it\u0027s best to land them together and keep them as close as possible as long as possible and only detach them low enough above the ground so they don\u0027t land on top of each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to land several things in different spots you need to do so from orbit and land them one by one, or you need to use a low and slow flying plane deploying them sufficiently low so they are safely landed before the plane gets more than 2.5 km away. Deploying the chute at once with decoupling is usually the least problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T18:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d certainly like to be able to have greater control over the various action, such as by adding them into staging etc. Timers, maybe.
