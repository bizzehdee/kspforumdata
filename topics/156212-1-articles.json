Leaving from Kerbin when Moho is at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E is where it\u0027s at. \u00A0That way your encounter with Moho is parallel with your orbit around Kerbol.\u00A0 My worst attempt at stopping and orbiting at Moho cost me 2500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0I\u0027ve did it on another attempt for as little as 1500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Flying over the Mohole at low altitudes (10km) causes issues. \u00A0My craft would spin out of control, I\u0027d lose camera alignment, etc... \u00A0I had to readjust my orbit after the flyby picture I took. \u00A0There is some weird crap happening close to the hole itself. You have been warned!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The rocky area\u00A0surrounding the Mohole is a hazardous. \u00A0I tried a dozen attempts to land close but it\u0027s simply too rocky and hilly. \u00A0Think of the terrain as the Mun times 10! \u00A0Forget landing there. \u00A0I picked a nice flat crater to the southwest. \u00A0I hope it\u0027s within range of the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. I had to time warp to find that nice crater in the daylight since Moho rotates so freaking slowly. \u00A0Actually, it\u0027s closer to dawn. \u00A0The sunlight in that landing site will increase as the planet rotates.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll work on next getting the mother ship into orbit in pieces and assembling it so I can send some kerbins off to their doo... uh, adventure...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-10T21:40:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2017 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Biggen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biggen","CreatedById":173719,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T21:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMothership is enroute with 4 brave kerbals!\u00A0 Updated pictures...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
