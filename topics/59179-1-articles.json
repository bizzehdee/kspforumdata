Since you\u0027re orbiting the Mun, you use its gravitational parameter (6.51x10^10). r1 will be 14,000 m, r2 will be 0 m, and R will be 200,000m. This works out to just over 9 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 will be your \u0022orbital\u0022 speed at periapsis with a 200 x 214km orbit plus or minus the Mun\u0027s rotational speed of 9 m/s. Orbital speed is sqrt(\u003Cem\u003Emu\u003C/em\u003E * (2/a - 1/r) ). In that equation, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Emu\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 is the gravitational parameter of the Mun, \u0022a\u0022 is the semi-major axis (PE \u002B AP)/2 and \u0022r\u0022 is the current radius (PE in this example). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat works out to 580 m/s. If your ship is coming down west-to-east (counterclockwise orbit), the 9 m/s rotational speed of the Mun is subtracted to get the delta-V required; since you\u0027re going in the same direction, you have to decelerate less to \u0022match\u0022 it. Coming the other direction would require adding the rotational speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the Mun (and that orbit height), the rotational speed matches the de-orbit delta-V pretty closely, hence the \u0022580\u0022 on that first map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an important note, this gives you the \u003Cem\u003Eminimum\u003C/em\u003E delta-V for a landing. We can\u0027t do instantaneous velocity changes, and surface variability means that we can\u0027t come in perfectly horizontal at PE. You can get a little closer to these numbers at launch (which is basically a landing in reverse). At launch you don\u0027t have the \u0022oh god the ground is coming at me!\u0022 factor which always causes me to brake too soon / often, adding to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ec) delta-V required for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbital insertion at 14 kilometers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm, after a bunch of typing / editing, I don\u0027t think I understand this leg enough to explain it. From the Mun\u0027s frame of reference, you\u0027re on a parabolic orbit that you need to circularize, there\u0027s gravitational acceleration going on that I\u0027m messing up somewhere, and you\u0027re entering the SOI with some relative speed that I\u0027m not accounting for right when I try to work it out.

Let\u0027s start from there and \u003Cem\u003Eignore\u003C/em\u003E atmospheric drag. The maneuvers this time (starting at the launch pad moving at 174m/s east relative to Kerbin\u0027s center)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go from 174m/s to the PE speed of a 600 x 680km orbit (where 600km is the radius of Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Circularization burn at AP to go from 600 x 680 km orbit to 680 x 680 km \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speed at PE for a 600x680 orbit around Kerbin is 2501 m/s, so you need to gain 2501 - 174 = 2327 m/s horizontal. The circularization delta-V works out to be about 73 for a total of about 2400 m/s. That\u0027s obviously way lower than you see during real launches because (1) That calculation assumes you\u0027ve already gained the horizontal speed in step #1 and (2) drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric drag (plus some buffer) adds the extra 1100 m/s requirement to get to the magic 4500 number needed to get to space. There really isn\u0027t any way to calculate this from other constants, since it depends on things like TWR (which determines how long you stay in atmosphere), timing of your gravity turn (turning sooner = more time in atmosphere = more drag), throttle management (pushing past terminal velocity increases drag) and probably size of your craft (since KSP calculates total drag by summing up each part).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T22:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd nothing.
