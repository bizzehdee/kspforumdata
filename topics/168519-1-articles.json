I am at the start of career mode with very little science unlocked and even with my weakest engine with tiny thrust the orbit changes lots in seconds.

Very easy to maneuver around. Try right-clicking your engine and setting the thrust limiter really low if just pressing the shift key once is still too fast. And 5km is a lot. You\u0027ll need to get it much closer.
