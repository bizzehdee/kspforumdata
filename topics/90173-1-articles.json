I\u0027ve completed 4 of the easy missions in career mode but seem to be having a problem with the mission that involves using a decoupler (the something-something 18\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACone of the first ones, if not actually THE first decoupler). I\u0027ve went into orbit with the decoupler, went around Kerbin (or the whatever the home planet of the Kerbals is called) a few times, and used the decoupler to, well, decouple my engine after burning to a reentry trajectory. After landing successfully two of the parameters for the mission were completed but the mission remain incomplete because it says I have to use the decoupler. Well, I did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is this a bug? I know that there are some missions that need to be completed using a plane rather than a rocket but this said nothing about flying. Any help appreciated.

Yes, indeed it said \u0022Landed\u0022 as a parameter. I thought that meant that you had to successfully land after decoupling using staging and didn\u0027t realize that it had to be done prior to or after landing.
