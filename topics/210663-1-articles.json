Can you launch multiple probes, like putting a relay into Tylo orbit so I don\u0027t need an antenna as powerful to transmit back?

There\u0027s the single Puff engine (rotated and offset so that its thrust vector points straight down and lines up with the center of mass), one monoprop tank (technically about 30% more fuel than needed for an optimal landing, but a bit of extra delta-v margin is always nice), one OKTO probe core (lightest possible, no built-in reaction wheels), six batteries (I guess I could\u0027ve left one out; did you know that the small batteries are cheaper and lighter per unit of charge than any of the bigger ones?), two solar panels (again, technically one more than needed), one antenna and of course one seismometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
