However, you dont want to actually burn exactly on the day side of kerbin. Gravity will sling you around while you move towards the SoI edge. You need to burn at the right ejection angle. \n\nTake a look here: [http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz)\n\nThis will tell you the ejection angle for your specific transferburn. Alternatively, you can always just drag the maeuvernode around on the orbit to align your exit vector with kerbin\u0027s orbit.\n\nYou actually want to do the escape *and* the transfer in a single burn in LKO.

This effect is the reason why it\u0027s more efficient to burn directly from low orbit into the transfer.\n\nShameless self-quote:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On the Oberth Effect.\n\u003E I just found that the Wikipedia article on Oberth effect is not very descriptive, and I think that adding an example will help to illustrate. \n\u003E \n\u003E For this, let\u0027s start from a circular low orbit around Kerbin. Our orbit has a certain radius r, and our ship has a certain velocity v0. We already used the formulas on the Wikipedia article on Hohmann transfers to calculate the dV needed to enter the Hohmann orbit to Duna (let\u0027s call it dVh), but that number applies only if we are already free of Kerbin\u0027s gravity. Naively one might now think, that one could simply add the dV needed to escape Kerbin to the dVh needed to go into the Hohmann transfer, but the situation isn\u0027t that easy. Thing is, there\u0027s the principle of conservation of energy, and energy is the quantity we can add here. Let\u0027s assume we burn and add to our current velocity v0 an additional velocity dV0. The kinetic energy of our ship after the burn will then be m\\*(v0\u002BdV0)^2/2. In addition, we sit in Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, adding a (negative) energy of -GM\\*m/r, where GM is the standard gravitational parameter of Kerbin. After we leave Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, we would still like to have enough kinetic energy to enter the Hohmann transfer, so we\u0027ll need a kinetic energy of m\\*dVh^2/2. This gives us the energy balance:\n\u003E \n\u003E m\\*(v0\u002BdV0)^2/2-GM\\*m/r=m\\*dVh^2/2\n\u003E \n\u003E The required dV for a burn using Oberth effect can now be found by solving this equation for dV0.\n\u003E \n\u003E (I\u0027m not sure if this is really correct.
