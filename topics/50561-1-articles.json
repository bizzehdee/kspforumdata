My testing cylce is launch, fail, revert back to VAB, perform a minor change, relaunch. The problem is not choosing the pilot for the first launch (i usually do that). The problem is that KSP forgets this selection as soon as i revert to the VAB for the minor change. Everything else on the rocket is saved, why not the pilot assignment (or worse, the removal of a Kerbal for an unmanned test flight).
