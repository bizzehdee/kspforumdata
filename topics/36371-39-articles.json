On most real rockets the fairings are jettisoned in the upper atmosphere to provide the drag to pull them away cleanly, but the payload is left attached to the rocket until it finishes it\u0027s orbital ascent. Simply use a stock decoupler above the fairing base and attach your payload on top of that. A couple of the mod parts kits like KW Rocketry and NovaPunch have some nice looking light-weight decouplers that make a nice alternative to the stock ones which IMHO are very ugly (esp. the 2.5m one).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draft","CreatedById":72633,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T02:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny actual benefits to using fairings will be welcome, though nice-looking ships is often reward enough itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA question/feature request. Would it be possible to make the decoupler on the interstage fairing adapter optional? Maybe as a separate part. What I\u0027m trying to do is combine the interstage fairing adapter with the fuselage shrouds to create a hollow segment in my rockets, the contents of which only have to be anchored at one end. The decoupler built into the fairing adapter slices the top off when triggered though, and since it is a decoupler it can\u0027t be removed from the staging stack, only delayed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
