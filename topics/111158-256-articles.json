Did they violate the rules? Or is that due to inactivity?\n\u003E \n\nIt\u0027s a significant commitment, and it\u0027s an unpaid \u0027volunteer\u0027 job.  It\u0027s not a life-sentence though.  As an example, at this point in time I am able to devote a few hours per day to moderation duties.  If work or family commitments change and I need to back out of my moderation duties, I am able to do that. My take is, again, it\u0027s not a life sentence to be assigned as a moderator.  We all have lives, both personal and professional outside of our moderator duties.  When life happens, sometimes time commitments have to be adjusted."},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-20T01:11:27Z","Content":"Can \u0022The Daily Kerbal: Daily updates from the dev team about the Kerbal universe\u0022 be buried much further down the page?

Depends on the day or Month or Year.     As a mod,  I\u0027m on the forums most days when I\u0027m on my computer, but occasionally I\u0027ll step away for a couple few weeks on a whim just to not get burned out.
