Also the cryogenic fuels were run from the tanks along the outside of the engine, not only to preheat the fuels and thereby increase internal pressure but also because blasting thousands of litres of liquid hydrogen (~ -250\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C or about 20 Kelvin) through the pipes around the nozzle has a massive cooling effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"majortimekiller","CreatedById":142463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am trying to do is operate KSP as everyone else seems to be. from a normal install I get no heat affects from engines, little temp change and no heat glow.
