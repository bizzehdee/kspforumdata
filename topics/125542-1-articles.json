In the floppy disk era at least, especially with multiple disk installs, it was always an anxious wait, because frequently on the last disk (at least so it seemed) a certain famous general would interfere (\u0022General Failure, reporting for duty, Sir!\u0022). I think it was Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis where I had to buy and return about two copies before the third copy finally worked (I think it was about 7-9 floppies, error on second to last disk).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think virtually all gamers over a certain age get sweaty palms, and start praying to the programming gods around the 75% mark on any install, even though that era has passed... just from Pavlovian conditioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CD era was \u003Cstrong\u003Eslightly\u003C/strong\u003E better.

Not once did they get anywhere close to suggesting or implying that 1.0 would not be followed by tweaks, fixes, and general polish, or that there would be no more issues with older saves breaking.

Be glad that it\u0027s an excellent developer that actually wants to properly squash every last bug, complete every last bit of polishing, and actually gives a damn about customers. Many big developers (e.g. EA and all of the names they have assimilated) slap a 1.0 label on any old incomplete barely functional crap and shovel it out the door with a price twice that of KSP; then publicly demonstrably outright lie about things to customers; then ignore major problems until everyone loses interest in it and gives up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen the game might as well be unplayable.
