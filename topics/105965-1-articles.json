Is this too high for it to operate? It would be nice if the overheat figure went over 100% so I had some idea as to how long it\u0027s going to take to cool down.\n\nAlso, does anyone else find it a bit strange that it\u0027s possible to overheat the convertor so badly that it\u0027s going to take literally months of game time for it to cool down?\n\n![lYVLxRK.png](http://i.imgur.com/lYVLxRK.png)\n\nEDIT: Apparently this is another known bug.
