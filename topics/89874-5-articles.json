So tell me, why exactly should this mod be included? Does it fix the problems with the wheel colliders? It\u0027s telling when you can turn a wheel to the left and your plane doesn\u0027t move, and yet they can all be facing straight forwards and your back end can slip and slide across the runway. Last I checked, Firespitter doesn\u0027t fix that. These wheels are nice, I\u0027m glad they exist, but I\u0027d rather Squad fix wheels being able to slip, slide and bend. Besides, these wheels only change their angle, they can still be placed such that they do not point straight ahead. They are the best we can hope for in a bad situation, they are still far from ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T20:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sagirfahmid3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sagirfahmid3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you so much Paolo.

It is just first release of mod, with some feedback from people who use this mod it will be a lot better.

There is situations on complex designs that require that, when ladders can\u0027t reach ground, or you just put some landing gears on back, just to protect tail from breaking on too high pitch when you take off from runway. Here is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/SJNg0#49\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecomparison between those two types of landing gears\u003C/a\u003E from B9 and shortest leg from this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that could be nice is to make adjustable landing gear height possible in flight. Well, not actualy in flight, it have more purpose on runway, but you know what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I need this is best explained in another \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/2Ori7#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egalery that shows my making of hidraulic landing gears with IR parts\u003C/a\u003E. If it is possible to make such thing it will be more simple to use it trough action groups instead of IR GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, there is need for even larger landing gear. That could have 8 wheels on one landing gear leg, similar to 4 x double wheel landing gear next to each other. This one should be able to distribute plane weight more easy then existing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there could be some difference between single wheeled, double wheeled and that heavy one that is still WIP in terms of crashing resistance and temperature tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, and keep the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T20:22:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kcs123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T20:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery usefull.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T20:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, very good mod...
