We should take that even further;\u00A0instead of launching a payload yourself, you could pay a little and get someone else to launch it for you on their own rocket. The main benefits\u00A0of doing it this way would be, A). Allowing you to do more things at once (example: launching\u00A0low-importance missions on\u00A0commercial rockets, while freeing up time for you to launch your high-importance missions on your own, more powerful launchers), and B). Supporting the space industry (reputation is gained). There would be 3 main types of companies that provide launch services:\u00A0simple and expendable\u00A0rockets\u00A0(Orbital ATK with Taurus, Antares, and Pegasus), reusable and stylish rockets (SpaceX with Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 Heavy), and SSTO\u0027s (Reaction Engines with Skylon). Each launcher has it\u0027s limits, so the SSTO may require you to add an upper stage to get to a geostationary orbit.\u00A0But you cannot exceed the size/volume and\u00A0payload capacities!\u00A0Each company would have pros and cons to them, so choose wisely. Invest in the one that most fits your career mode by launching with them more than the others and helping them get their technologies developed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSimple and Expendable\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMost Reliable\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlways Cheap\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAvailable from start\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReusable and Stylish\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nReliable\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInitially expensive, but cheaper once reusability is\u00A0fully going\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAvailable from start, but reusability is in an experimental phase (takes a while to get all the kinks out)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSSTO\u0027s\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUnreliable at first\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInitially extremely expensive, but extremely cheap once reusability and reliability are perfected\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022In development\u0022 at first (this period ends when the Reusable and Stylish company\u0027s reusability is perfected), \u0022Experimental\u0022 phase follows (test flights with small payloads, similar to STS-1,2,3,\u0026amp; 4), \u0022Operational\u0022 phase is next\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make this mod simple, you wouldn\u0027t actually get to see the launch of your payload on a commercial rocket, you would only be able to switch to it once it\u0027s in orbit. So this is basically a glorified HyperEdit. The main interface would be through a button in the stock toolbar where you would define the desired orbital parameters, launch date, select your launch vehicle,\u00A0and load the payload (from your VAB/SPH craft list). After you press launch you wait about 15 minutes for the rocket to reach orbit, at this point you will be notified about the success or failure of the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
