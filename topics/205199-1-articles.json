In reality, you can escape while going far slower if you\u2019re at a higher altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any situation where you\u2019re trying to capture into a body\u2019s sphere of influence, you need to reduce your relative velocity i.e. perform a retrograde burn to lower your orbital velocity. Stick a node on your Duna periapsis and pull the retrograde handle until the projected path closes into an orbit of Duna, then start burning when the time to node is ~60% of the total burn time; this extra 20% is because ion thrusters are really weak and take a long time to do anything, so starting at 50% could mean you slow down too late and end up with a bad orbit with a high apoapsis and a periapsis inside Duna\u2019s atmosphere or even Duna itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u2019s an atmosphere present, you can save some fuel by using friction from that atmosphere to slow down (aerobraking), however this is a tricky business and if misjudged even slightly can incinerate your craft, slow it down too much so that it lands/crashes or conversely not slow it down enough so that it keeps going and escapes again; Duna\u2019s atmosphere, like Mars on which it\u2019s based, is so think that you\u2019ll barely slow down in it so it\u2019s rarely worth the effort to aerobraking there, but Kerbin, Eve, Jool and Laythe can all be used for aerobraking. Another trick is to use carefully timed encounters with moons to use their gravity to slow you down into orbit, a trick which can allow a free capture around Jool with a single encounter of Tylo or Laythe but which probably won\u2019t help you here as Ike is too small and its gravity too weak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
