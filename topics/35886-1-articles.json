It also supports limited manufacturing capability, being able to produce objects weighing up to 40 tons (when fully supplied - it launches with a full set of spare parts). In short, it is designed to overcome any possible situation that it may be required to in the course of an exploration mission, and to operate indefinitely on any body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus far, the Spirit of Exploration-class clocks in at about 1000 tons (300 of which is the massive tread units), has large internal vehicle hangars on two decks, and a flight deck. In the event of equipment loss, it is capable of producing replacements using the onboard manufacturing facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn very brief: we are creating a fully-fledged colonial infrastructure, capable of supporting several hundred Kerbals indefinitely on a mission to any body in the Kerbol system, and expanding its capabilities while on-mission, conveniently rolled up into a large, mobile package. And it has a swimming pool! (Note: The Ministry of Improbable Spacecraft is in no way responsible if personnel are injured attempting to use the swimming pool while in zero-G).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are also currently seeking suggestions for what other vehicles and aircraft to add to the built-in equipment (the hangar looks a little empty).

Straight-line distance to the base is about 850m in the image.

This aircraft is uniquely suited to the mission profile due to its folding wings, all-electric propulsion, light weight, and low takeoff speed.
