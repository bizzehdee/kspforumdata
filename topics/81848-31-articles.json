It doesn\u0027t have the lift to ascend into thinner air at its best speed, and it doesn\u0027t seem to have the thrust to go any faster at the current drag, so it goes up 2km then down 2km then up 2km then down 2km... all the while pointing in the same direction. Kicking the rockets in at this point just burns the fuel out before it makes it to orbit :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve largely described my flight pattern though - mach 1\u002B by 10km, mach 2\u002B by 20km, level out, gain speed until it doesn\u0027t want to go any faster, then pull up. I tend to kick the nuke in \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E turning the rapiers to rockets, since it has ~795 ISP by that point and the extra bit of thrust can get me another km or two of altitude on air.
