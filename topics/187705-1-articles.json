Designing a fuel station is fun, and designing resupply ships for it is fun, but flying the same mission over and over is definitely not fun. Honestly, I wouldn\u0027t super mind if the ships weren\u0027t actually flown and the system was completely abstracted: Maybe you have to fly the actual mission once as a proof of concept, but then after that you can regularly schedule (maybe with some awareness of launch windows if necessary) automatic supply \u0022missions\u0022 that are actually just the game automatically deducting X amount of funds from your bank and adding Y amount of supplies to your station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T16:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are at least two mods for KSP which do that, and it probably wouldn\u0027t be that difficult to rewrite them for KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being the case, I\u0027d\u00A0 prefer this being left to mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-26T18:46:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2019 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pschlik","CreatedById":89495,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T16:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said on the wishes thread, I don\u0027t think I could manage a whole interstellar space organization doing everything manually. Even in KSP 1 I can give myself a hard time; today I plan to handle a huge kerfuffle at Duna, with 5 spacecraft\u00A0(splintered off of 3 missions) needing attention across the span of one Kerbin\u00A0day.\u00A0Oh yeah and I have a Moho flyby squeezed into the middle of all that. Even with Kerbal Alarm Clock (which I really hope is a stock feature in KSP 2) this is a complete nightmare. In fact, the Alarm Clock is mostly just reminding me of how convoluted my situation is about to get; so an alarm clock isn\u0027t suddenly the ultimate solution. Still, I wouldn\u0027t be able to do this \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E without the Alarm Clock; it\u0027s a step in the right direction! Meanwhile, in a real space program, there would probably be 4 entire teams of people (Kerbals, in this case) managing this whole situation simultaneously. But in my poor space program I have to do this all manually which means I am most definitely going to miss some science or something. Or maybe my main Duna probe will smash into Duna while I\u0027m doing something else (I\u0027ve had to leave it on a collision course for now so that it can get a close flyby of Ike).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully expect someone to come along and say \u0022But that wouldn\u0027t be fun! Flying the missions manually is a huge part of the fun!\u0022 and I agree that flying stuff is part of the fun. But flying \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eevery single mission\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E fun. Manually flying the exact same mission 10 times to deliver hydrogen to my orbital colony? Not fun. Slowing down my main Duna probe\u0027s two probe babies into polar orbits \u003Cem\u003Einstead of doing science\u003C/em\u003E with the main probe? Not fun. Sure, some people might use automation so that they (almost) never have to do anything manually, turning KSP into a management game, and that would be pretty boring, but that\u0027s not me. And with some good game design, you could always force the player into playing the game the original way until they reach the end game where things are more likely to be tedious. And even once automation is possible, there are ways to make it take effort anyway, but a different kind of effort than \u0022Hotswap to probe, hit Z button and wait for manuever to complete, hotswap back to something else.\u0022\u00A0[eg: Automation requires you to have a high level mission control (either at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or on a colony), you have to send pilots to mission control to manage the mission for you (taking them away from other jobs), they have to be high level pilots, you have to have fantastic comms connection to the craft which you want to automate, stuff like that]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the whole long-term interstellar mission stuff as well as being able to time warp during acceleration, it seems automation, or something akin to it, could very well be on the plan already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr when they talk about thrusting during time warp, that might just mean you have to be in control of the thing which is thrusting, not unlike PersistentThrust in KSP 1. That is basically a must have for Interstellar stuff, but it does nothing for automation or multitasking. Whether or not I have persistent thrust wouldn\u0027t change that running an interstellar mission would take years where the entire rest of the space program would go dormant. Personally, I do not like launching a mission to somewhere then just time warping to that location. I prefer to send off the mission, then go off and do other things as it floats toward its destination (this is how I ended up with 5 probes to manage all at once).\u00A0But I do recognize that one way to play KSP is to \u0027Launch Duna mission. Timewarp to Duna. Do Duna things. Timewarp back to Kerbin.\u0027 meanwhile nothing else happened in the space program for those last couple years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T16:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally think that KSP2 will miss not having multitask tools/features and automated recurring missions. It allows you do complex missions, divert attention, and avoid micromanagment. Factorio for example has a system where you can play at every level of complexity, and when things get too big to handle by hand, that\u0027s where automation comes in. The result is that people can do amazing things in factorio. Now KSP is not factorio, but these tools could help tremendously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could have mission control go from 1 person employed (linear missions) to multiple people employed (negative time warp for X people at a time) to an entire team being employed (automated missions).
