If you are referring to the Space Shuttle, I don\u0027t think Chaka deals with the STS system. And if you are using this version of Chaka with 1.0.4, you are in for a headache anyways due to the simple fact that Squad done a lot of work on the thermodynamics and changed the collider in lines with the 64 bit update that we hope will happen soon. And Yanfret did a complete overhaul of this mod to fit the 1.0.5 update. \n\nSo, could you be a bit more clear with what exactly is going on? Which heat shields are you referring to? What are you putting them on? Any screenshots/logs? Any of these things will help us determine what the cause of your problems are. The big thing is are you using this version of the mod on 1.0.4? or the current version of KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T09:56:22Z","Content":"A small issue with the foam tanks: one part config from \u0022NOVA-CHAKA-TANK-FOAM2\u0022 family (\u0022part5 - Copy.cfg\u0022) has the same part name as another one from the \u0022NOVA-CHAKA-TANK-FOAMWHITE\u0022 family (\u0022part5 - Copy.cfg\u0022).
