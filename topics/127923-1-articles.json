This can be very tricky without rovers or the claw. I would suggest positioning the docking ports on stations with expansion in mind. If the docking port is on top of the station you might be able to use RCS and slowly hover and land on top of the port. But that seems like it would be very difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T17:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI steer clear of such contracts.
