I had created a MM rescale pack for the old THSS trusses to address the problem that the truss lengths were not consistent. That is, two short trusses were not the same length as a medium truss, and none were any sort of standard length, which made creating modular structures effectively impossible. We have standard diameters (1.25m and multiples/fractions thereof) but not lengths. I had modified these such that the standard length was 1.25m and then welded those together to form longer trusses, reusing the same model to reduce model/texture counts to save RAM. It made them far more flexible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne option if you don\u0027t want to rescale parts already deployed would be to turn the short, atomic length parts into procedural parts, so that you could iterate through 1.25m/2.5m/3.75m (or 1, 2, 3m), etc. creating as long a truss as you needed from a single part. I\u0027m sure you could get the code for doing that from one of the procedural modders. Since procedural tanks already specify such lengths, you could easily pair up parts from different mods to put together stations and such like legos.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T02:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vrana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vrana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReally missing this mod in .25.\u003Cp\u003EI do hope it gets an update for .90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s to miss?
