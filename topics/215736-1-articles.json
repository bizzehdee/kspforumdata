That ladies and gentlemans, should be a BASIC feature in the game ! So please could you consider to add that feature as soon as possible \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E For the sake of this Game of course... Plus add real volumetric clouds just like in the KSP 2 trailer you made.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0027t take it personaI but I actually rather \u003Cem\u003E[snip]\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0 than giving you 50 bucks for that rendering with no real game physics improvments. I\u0027m 3000h\u002B on KSP actually and I was waiting for KSP 2 like for years... I\u0027m sorry I already spent enough time being frustrated on KSP for game physics issues, to not bother my self playing KSP 2. So to avoid this I suggest to point out to fix game physics issues first, then features like mouse aim flight (it litteraly a line long prompt code) the camera tracking for a more cinematic purpose like \u0022Camera Tool\u0022 modd. As we could enjoy such great visuals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I won\u0027t be grumpy about how many of us are disapointed by the actual state of the game\u0027s early acces, as it feels like the dev team spent more time doing such fancy trailers than developping the actual game features... \u0027\u0026gt;_\u0026gt; We can definitly feel it so far, so now please, for the sake of the spirit of this game also consider adding a player customized radio station feature (like building an actual Radio Station, later in the game that allow the player to play a custom playlist because when you played ksp for thousands of hours you just cut the music off lol) Thanks for your time and here is my last session on KSP 1 :\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fvZy8o3mHwo?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Then Back to KSP One : LoL\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-22T21:08:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2023 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERedacted by moderator\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
