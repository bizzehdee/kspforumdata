Relying on half-assed community patches is starting to annoy and confuse me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really loved this mod, basically gave up on it after the 1.0.x release because of the random issues. I\u0027m glad that community fixes are available, but I agree that it just makes installing this mod a much more confusing, and frustrating endeavor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like this mod has fallen off of Kyle\u0027s and Winston\u0027s radar, which I totally understand, I appreciate all of the unpaid effort that went into creating a mod that helped me create some of my best missions pre 1.0... With that in mind, is there any chance of an official handover to a new developer to maintain this mod?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"galactictaco","CreatedById":112257,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T23:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso in asking this i recognize its been asked and answered but I\u0027m still getting no where...i can\u0027t see any engines or other parts when i install the kW 2.7 and the community fixes minus the weird patches (which begs the question why they are in there) and i removed the emission thing but can\u0027t find any FX throttle animate download so i can\u0027t finish that replacement...so I\u0027ve done what the magic board told me to do, mostly, but i see no parts anywhere in tech tree or in VAB in a sandbox save. so what am i missing? i remember an older fix was replacing .cfg files, is that a possible thing i can do somehow or would that be counterproductive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T23:44:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by galactictaco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
