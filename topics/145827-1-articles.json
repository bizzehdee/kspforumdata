But where does the energy come from to accelerate the spacecraft? In fact it comes from the planet\u0027s own energy of motion. In the Sun frame, there is a transfer of momentum and kinetic energy from the planet to the spacecraft. The planet slows down very slightly in its orbit, and the spacecraft speeds up. Newton\u0027s third law states, \u0022To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,\u0022 and that\u0027s true in this case. Because the planet is so much more massive than the spacecraft, the transfer doesn\u0027t affect the planet to any measurable extent, but to the spacecraft it\u0027s a big deal. For example, we can calculate that during the Voyager encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Jupiter slowed down by roughly 10 to the -24th power kilometers per second -- a change much too small to measure. But each Voyager gained about 10 km/s, a pretty big number and enough to put them on a fast path to Saturn (and in the case of Voyager 2, to Uranus and Neptune as well) and eventual escape from the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, humanity has effectively \u0022extracted\u0022 some of the energy from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, etc., etc. Tiny fractions of the total energy of motion of these planets, but an appreciable quantity (at least from the standpoint of a spacecraft).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if using this effect, it might be possible (distant future of course) to \u0022harvest\u0022 energy from celestial bodies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-16T19:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222719257\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145827\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221471372952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276097\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Diche Bach said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if using this effect, it might be possible (distant future of course) to \u0022harvest\u0022 energy from celestial bodies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically, we already do that.

What! That gravity assist just slowed me down!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that the trick from a gravity assist (not a gravy \u0022brake\u0022 but an acceleration) is to get the periapsis from the encounter BEHIND the body being \u0022harvested\u0022 for velocity (relative to its orbital movement) and as close as possible and that if the orbit after the assist looks \u0022more\u0022 like the assisting body than it did before, then it has \u0022helped\u0022 in accelerating (to say nothing of changing the direction of the apoapsis relative to the original one). However, I\u0027m not sure how to know what the actual \u0022gain\u0022 is from such a maneuver, as I suspect the \u0022orbital speed\u0022 indicator on the NavBall and that in Kerbal Engineer are telling me things relative to benchmarks that change during the course of a flight? (or at least as different targets are selected else as different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E are passed through??).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Vel\u0022 for the asteroid is shown as \u00228,4000 m/s\u0022 (ballpark), and despite my NavBall suggesting that I had slowed down after this Mun gravity assist, it only took another 1000 or 1500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E burn to achieve an encounter with the asteroid (though I ran out of time on the sim and didn\u0027t actually complete it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
