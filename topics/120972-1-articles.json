In my experience, though, memory-intensive mods aren\u0027t the ones that bite into framerate. On my Win7 desktop, if I have too many mods for my system memory, the game won\u0027t start properly - it will crash before displaying the main menu. Then again, my computer has dedicated video-RAM. Depending on your laptop graphics processor, that could make a big difference to framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe single most demanding modset I\u0027ve used is Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack Interstellar V2.

They use some CPU but it shouldn\u0027t be a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Mods that have textures will have bigger impact on RAM. Part mods have textures, but also cloud mods, kerbal skin changers, skybox replacers, etc could ramp up the amount of RAM needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally there is a category which doesn\u0027t technically add textures but still falls somewhere in between the two I mentioned. These are mods that add non-texture graphical features like Planetshine. Planet shine adds emissives... or light sources. They add more of a strain on your graphics card than your RAM or CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind this also depends on how well the mod is programmed. Mods have the ability to choose when their program starts (except parts) so if done properly, that can have an effect. Mods that add stuff only to editors for example may not feel like as big of an impact if the same mod were used in flight, where the game is much more resource intensive anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-16T04:56:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2015 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T03:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the physics mods like FAR that can be very CPU intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
