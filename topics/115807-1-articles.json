Only this way it gets proper TWR (it can\u0027t even takeoff with full tanks).

Every side stack has 50% bonus fuel for the second stage. Although with it being halfway fueled (these engines are not powerful enough!) this is not so necessary. \n\nI like the rocket more with mainsails and 2.5 m parts, but then there aren\u0027t proper parts for the lander. Yeah, I also made this in earlier versions."}]}
