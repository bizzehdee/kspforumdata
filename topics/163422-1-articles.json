The game opens up and I successfully have a KSP window wide enough for Triple Monitor gameplay BUT if I minimize the window or move the Task bar a round a few times, the KSP window will revert back to the old 1920 resolution. I look in the settings.cfg file and confirm that it\u00A0\u00A0still says 5760 resolution width. Why am I losing the 5760 wide window?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
