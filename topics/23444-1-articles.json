It\u0027s a common misconception that space is cold; if you\u0027re in deep space, far from any star, then you\u0027ll only be a few degrees above absolute zero. But near a star, your temperature is just based on how much energy each molecule is absorbing, so just because there\u0027s very little matter in orbit doesn\u0027t mean that it doesn\u0027t get really hot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, any object in orbit around Earth is receiving the same energy density (in watts per square meter) that the surface is, and radiant energy density is proportional to the fourth power of temperature. But, there\u0027s one minor effect you have to remember: geometry. A sphere, like Earth, has a cross sectional area of pi*R^2, but a surface area four times that. Effectively, Earth\u0027s atmosphere transfers heat around the planet, to keep the dark side from freezing, and even on the part that\u0027s being directly lit there\u0027ll be areas where the light comes in obliquely and so doesn\u0027t warm as much (see: the poles). An object in orbit doesn\u0027t have that; it spends most of its orbit in direct sunlight. (Also, if it\u0027s small enough, there\u0027s really no \u0022dark side\u0022, and it\u0027s much more likely that there\u0027ll be a surface perpendicular to the sunlight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, manned craft have radiators to keep the crew from boiling. On the space shuttle, the radiators were on the insides of the cargo bay doors, which is why the doors stayed open while in orbit even if they weren\u0027t launching any payloads. Space telescopes don\u0027t worry as much about radiators, since most are built with a reflective shield that faces the Sun, and the critical bits are cryogenically cooled to prevent thermal noise from interfering with measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T05:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022radial cooling system\u0022 or whatever its called (It\u0027s under aerodynamic parts) seems to actually work with jet engines. maybe i wasn\u0027t paying close enough attention, but it seemed like if i had one in-line with the engine, i could go max throttle and not overheat at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i\u0027m not just imagining it, it\u0027s a start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azazel1024","CreatedById":44262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T14:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically on orbit stuff is getting more energy.

And radiator parts can be added to the ship release that heat resource effectively out into the vacuum of space - whereas in atmospheres, the heat drains away naturally due to convection. Maybe even some modders could then use the excess heat resource to generate electricity with some sort of Stirling engine part or something \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be difficult to do right, and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a better way but I just think it would work nicely with the existing resources \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T15:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sporkafife\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos, typos, typos!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T17:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022azazel1024\u0022 data-cite=\u0022azazel1024\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETechnically on orbit stuff is getting more energy.

Less energy hits the surface, true, but the energy absorbed by the atmosphere is still entering the system, and will heat the planet up, so you can\u0027t just subtract it. It might take a few intermediate steps of thermal emission and absorption, but about half of that energy will eventually get down to the surface. And a similar amount of thermal emission from the surface, going upward, will likewise be absorbed by the atmosphere and possibly re-radiated back down (sometimes called the \u0022Greenhouse Effect\u0022), so the energy that DOES hit the surface will have a higher impact on temperature than a similar amount of energy would in space. The net result is that the effective energy density at the surface is the same as you\u0027d get in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also left out albedo, although I mentioned it tangentially; if the thing in orbit is reflective (shiny metal or white) then it won\u0027t absorb nearly as much energy from the start, and so not need to cool off as much, although things reflective in one wavelength aren\u0027t necessarily reflective in others. Like I said before, most space telescopes have a reflective shield they place between themselves and the Sun, to minimize the amount of energy they have to dissipate, and most satellites are left as reflective metal. There\u0027s a reason we paint pretty much everything white (including the space suits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if the object is black (say, the reinforced carbon-carbon tiles on the Space Shuttle or a heat shield) then it\u0027ll absorb more energy, and so have more heat to worry about later on. For comparison, Earth\u0027s reflectivity is about 30-35% depending on how many clouds there are on a given day, so it\u0027s easily possible to have a space vessel that absorbs a larger fraction of the incoming energy than the Earth does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azazel1024","CreatedById":44262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than anything, it is a YMMV situation. The same satellite placed on Earth\u0027s surface is going to have less solar light power density than one in orbit. During the daytime with the sun hitting it, the atmosphere absorbs some of it and even though a lot is re-radiated and will be absorbed by the satellite, it is at a slower rate as it is spread through the day and night time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at any given moment, the satellite does receive less solar power than in space, even if over the course of an entire 24 hour period, the amount of radiation received is roughly the same amount. The power levels are lower during the daytime and higher at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have the issue that in space, you are radiating as a black body. There is no conduction/convection either in surfaces it is touching or in to the surrounding atmosphere. This is the biggest problem. Even ignoring solar input, the active heat of the space craft with all of its systems running is often times enough to cook the ship (Skylab, though that was a solar reflector issue more than anything). Of course, the converse is if running at little to no power, temperatures tend to plummet (Apollo 13), at least if the space craft is designed to shed heat mostly passively.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProtip, you can use any radial attached part as a heat sink, try it on SRB\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only issue is with the Jumbo-64, it\u0027s so big that heat cannot reach other parts (it\u0027s a bug), but you can fix that by putting something else between the tank and the engine, people use the smaller tanks or cubic struts for this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember someone using a lot of ladder parts as heat sinks on his Moho lander.
