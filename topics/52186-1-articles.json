My space shuttle has open-able cargo bay doors. They are held closed by 4 pairs of Jr. docking ports, with each door having one pair of two ports at each end. When undocked (using an action group), they are held in place by a ring of small cubic struts, making a hinge. I have used this design before, and it \u003Cstrong\u003Eworked flawlessly\u003C/strong\u003E. Unfortunately, upon undocking the \u0022Undocking Kraken\u0022 keeps the doors from changing position...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen this bug before, I undocked a ship from a space station, but when I tried to position the craft for a deorbit burn I found that it could only shudder, not move. SAS, RSC, engines, all only made it shudder. It can be fixed by going to the space center menu and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered that this was being caused by a bug when I tried breaking the doors off the shuttle. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe doors floated away, but despite not being held by ANYTHING \u003C/strong\u003Ethe reaction wheels could only make it shudder violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, can anyone tell me a way to get around this bug? How can I undock the doors without the them locking up?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ll just say this: The doors have probe cores, they have power, they have reaction wheels, no mods are causing this, nothing on the orbiter is holding them is place, and this design HAS worked before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOWNLOAD: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/orionshuttlea-22-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/orionshuttlea-22-2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dby6KOL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dby6KOL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T17:00:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPilot573\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T04:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone????\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T09:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea...But for those bay doors, using a hinge from a mod would be easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T09:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck each docking port it they are really undocked.
