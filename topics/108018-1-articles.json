They all also represent a radical departure from .90, which we where told was the game with all major parts in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeating:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 introduced heat as a new component to be managed. In theory this was a good thing but it was poorly implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N, the most important engine in the game once players begin to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI overheated very rapidly with most builds and still fairly rapidly even when designed around. If this was just one random engine this wouldn\u0027t have been a big deal but as the only practical engine for interplanetary flight in the game this suddenly made the Kerbol system exploration very tedious as you now had to make all your transfer burns in very short bursts to avoid overheating. This was both unrealistic and un-fun. (Some people have tried to say that the game balances realism and fun and that is why everybody can\u0027t be happy but making things BOTH unrealistic and not fun is not the solution, if something is not fun it should be at least be realistic and vise versa) Unlike many other parts of KSP, this was not a challenge as there was no way to design around it as there are no heat management parts (unlike the mods with parts that need cooling) It was simply a big nerf back to the stone age. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ISRU mining system overheated very quickly, reducing its yield to almost zero. This was unrealistic and useless as a no matter the heat level a player could simply warp speed through the extraction, making the heat system irrelevant as anything but an irritation, much like the re-entry model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumerous bugs and crashes which I will not mention as those are not really the heart of the matter except to say that gamers used to expect more out of a 1.0 release. My game does at least load much faster which makes recovering from a crash less of a chore than it used to be....so yay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.02 brought some fixes but also some new problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N\u0027s no longer overheat if properly mounted, but they only consume liquid fuel and so can now only be practically used with spaceplane fuel tanks, severely limiting the design freedom we once had, this is very odd because again, these are an extremely important engine in the game and should have had a whole new array of tank parts to go with them now that the way the work has changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining heat has been completely removed....yay? or not depending on how you feel. One hand a problem is gone, on another a potentially interesting challenge was removed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air is now thick enough for a realistic re-entry, and parachutes are destroyed by high speeds and heat...but, re-entry heating is such that now you don\u0027t need a heats shield or to really every worry about most parts overheating on re-enty as only a few small parts are really effected by heat, so again, what could have been an interesting mechanic was nerfed to oblivion instead of actually being fixed. As with everything else, this is something that careful testing should have been able to balance but which it seems was just thrown in as an emergency fix to a problem that shouldn\u0027t ever have existed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following are cosmetic problems but which seem to be widely disliked by most players and have yet to be fixed or even addressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings explode in a confetti like cloud of parts that is unattractive and unrealistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunctional Space planes, I am told, now look like hotdogs.

The difference between the camps seem to be wether that bothers people or not. Personally, when the Devs say something is done that means they are planing on walking away. Maybe not all at once but it means its basically over, they are happy, fix a few bugs and move on, and if this is where kerbal ends I find that really disappointing especially when just another month or so of community wide testing could probably fix all the gameplay issues.
