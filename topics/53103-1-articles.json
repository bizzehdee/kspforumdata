After seeing a few videos I became quite intrigued and just HAD to play! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully built a few rockets and some planes. I haven\u0027t landed on Mun yet, but I have made successful trips there and back to Kerbal. Reaching orbit, and general orbital maneuvers I have figured out (I am not proficient by any means but I can do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy super newbish question is this: In all the pictures I see of space-stations, they have (what I assume are) fuel lines running inside the struts (by struts I mean the structural cubic parts that connect different sections of the ship, usually the solar panels are mounted to them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot find these ANYWHERE in the parts list. Are these part of a mod? I am attempting to build my first space station. Just a small one for refueling on long journies, and just to say that I did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother quick question that I may just have to figure out on my own: Are geosynchronous orbits possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone and glad to be here !!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroEngy","CreatedById":92772,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T19:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am new to the forums but have been playing for a little while now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESynchronous orbits are possible in KSP. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Synchronous_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESee here for a table of altitudes.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no part that I know of that sounds like what you are describing. Maybe it was a fuel line that was somehow part clipped inside of cubic strut ... As far as I know that wouldn\u0027t be necessary because I think all of those are capable of fuel transfer on their own. I am not at my main PC so I can\u0027t test it right now. but you should be able to at least manually transfer fuel between parts connected via cubic struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T19:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel lines are in the propulsion section and have probably been no-clipped inside the strut. But if you are using them for a station you can alt-click or ctrl-click on two fuel tanks and transfer them without the need of fuel lines which automatically transfer fuel from one tank to another in a single direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes Geosynchronous orbits are possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T19:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of geo...er, Kerbisynchronous orbits, the altitude is around 2,868,750 meters.

If you mouse over a part in the VAB, it sais \u0027fuel crossfeed capable\u0027. That means it can carry fuel through the part. Only a few parts are not capable of fuel crossfeed. Mostly the stage seperators, which prevents fuel from flowing between stages. You can manually pump fuel from all parts of a craft to all other parts of a craft (that can hold fuel, obviously), regardless of fuellines or fuelcrossfeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor refueling stations, you just need a few relativly full fueltanks with a docking port on it. Dock whatever you want to it, and alt click 2 different tanks to pump between them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willwolvescry","CreatedById":71661,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T21:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! First question is that feul lines like that aren\u0027t needed because they are similar to that of struts in that things will mostly pass through them. Second question is yes but they are hard and pointless to achieve since without mods there is no true communications where as the communications mod would give them a purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weefek","CreatedById":92801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T13:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone for the great replies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a small station core last night, but missed my manuevering burn by 10s and ended up in the ocean.
