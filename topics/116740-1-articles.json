View full album](//imgur.com/a/RwHC1)\n\nParts: 11\n\nMass: 28.0t\n\nThree stages counting the one mandatory stage\n\nPersonal limitation: Both nodes must be \u003E100km above Kerbin, and must complete at least one full orbit. Must finish with zero resources for efficiency.\n\nAbout the landing: the rocket holds together if you splashdown, and most times on land. This just so happened to hit a mountainside, destroying the Hammer. Valentina and the pod were both completely intact. Hopefully no deduction for this. When it does hold together properly, every part but the first stage and decoupler are recoverable as well. If you added a radial chute preprogrammed for deploy you might also recover the first stage, making this pretty cheap to launch.\n\nI have KAS and Infernal Robotics installed (hence the icon) but no parts were used in this rocket, 100% stock.\n\nNice challenge, just doing it wasn\u0027t too hard but optimizing was tougher than I thought.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T11:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje**"},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:00:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seeing this actually made me wonder why a Gaseous Snake never showed up.
