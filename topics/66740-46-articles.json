The HX4 without the pillars will be cool though! Another very minor thing I noticed with the hollow parts, and one that may only be apparent when they\u0027re scaled very large - I don\u0027t really know the right terms, but here goes: because of that frame at the ends (I think), and because the space on the interior between the frames is sunken slightly with respect to them (on the biggest inner face of the part), attaching things like docking ports on the inside results in them being visually not connected to the \u0022floor.\u0022 Very easy to work around by just putting a big flat panel on the floor, but might be visually nice to have a continuous flat surface for a runway/hangar bay/whatever effect. Not sure it\u0027s really important enough even to think about though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of big flat panels, only other suggestion I can think of off the top of my head - it\u0027s handy for building various floor-like surfaces or whatnot to have rectangular versions of the structural panel, e.g. cut the 8x8m panel in half to make an 8x4 and make two versions - one that surface attaches on long edge, one that surface attaches on short edge. I made a quick \u0026amp; dirty pure-white version of the B9 panels for my own personal use if it would interest you example-wise.
