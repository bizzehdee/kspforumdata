You may even be able to assign a root bone in the skinned mesh component and have it all work. In your inspector panel where it says \u0022Root Bone\u0022, put a new transform there and see what happens in KSP. If it doesn\u0027t, then you probably just need to skin a bone to the mesh and export it to Unity again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T02:05:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T02:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks I\u0027ll work on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
