Your time as seen by an outside observer slows down but this is not the same thing. Relativity, while logically consistent and backed up by experiments to a very high accuracy, is not intuitive and the usual descriptions of time dilation effects usually only introduce further misunderstandings. However, the standard twins paradox is true, if one twin leaves on a fast ship and returns many years later then the twin that stayed home will be much older than the one that went and this can effectively be used to travel into the future \u0022faster\u0022 than you would normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is when approaching and crossing the event horizon of a black hole. As you approach the event horizon (carrying a clock that can be seen by an external observer), your clock will appear to that observer to run slower and slower until, at the point you cross the event horizon, your clock (and you) would appear to freeze. As far as you are concerned you would not notice any odd time effects at all and would, with a sufficiently massive black hole (where the event horizon is many light years across) continue to travel towards the singularity with no ill effects (until the tidal gravitational forces stretch/squash you into nothing).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Piscator","CreatedById":107202,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T13:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust for curiosity\u0027s sake, could someone please double-check the original claim?
