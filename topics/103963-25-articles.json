Until now, they been working on features that are basically essential for the game to work, and aesthetics were on the lower end of their priority list (except for the building and part models). \n\nNow that most of the main features are in the game, there\u0027s a chance that they start working on the graphics, but, TBH, I think the gameplay is still a bit rough around the edges (carreer mode fine tuning and expanding, more sights to see on planets, more scientific activities etc.). Also, i believe huge graphical advancements like this one can be really tedious to implement reliably, given the numerous configurations people use (settings and hardwarevise too). \n\nThis mod is EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL, so we can still hope for the best (Squads attention) anyways. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:48:55Z","Content":"Looks amazing, but doesn\u0027t work with clouds.\n\nTracking station screen also looks weird."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:32:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Gah!
