I was doing a mission to Duna, and using KER to plan the transfers. Going from Kerbin to Duna worked as well as can be expected, since Duna has an elliptical orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna to Kerbin transfer, however, was bad. Rather than giving me a transfer orbit where the apoapsis is near Duna\u0027s orbit and the periapsis is near Kerbin\u0027s orbit, the apoapsis was well above Duna\u0027s orbit, and the periapsis was just a bit below Duna\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter checking KER against \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E, I think I figured out where it went wrong. It seems that the ejection angle is getting measured in the wrong direction in the case of an anti-clockwise orbit transfer from Duna to Kerbin. It may affect all transfers to lower orbits, but I haven\u0027t had time to test it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you follow KER the way I think you\u0027re supposed to, you\u0027d place your maneuver node at about 123 degrees after Duna\u0027s retrograde, so you\u0027re still on the night side of the planet. However, the referenced web site shows the burn happening at 121 degrees before Duna\u0027s retrograde, so on the day side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2 degree difference in ejection angle isn\u0027t an issue, but if I used (360-123) = 237 degrees as the ejection angle as measured by KER, I got the kind of transfer orbit I\u0027d expect, with the apoapsis near Duna\u0027s orbit and the periapsis near Kerbin\u0027s orbit. The elliptical Duna orbit was still throwing off the intercept, but by a manageable amount provided you\u0027ve got some fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, some day I\u0027d like a transfer planner that can compensate for elliptical source/destination orbits, but until I can show the math myself, I don\u0027t expect anyone else to try to solve that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T18:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm .. yeah, I saw the same thing on my Kerbin-to-Eve transfer, exactly as you described, but I thought it was \u0022user error\u0022 on my part.

Have you managed to replicate it with 3 parts? Lately I\u0027ve been getting bug reports containing ships that are so overly complex that it is impossible to re-create these bugs people are having. Example being that someone told me that they had a re-creatable bug with their space station, but didn\u0027t tell me it had 300 odd parts. It looked fine with no obvious reasons so there\u0027s absolutely no way for me to narrow down what was causing the issue. I even sent up a few crafts myself to dock together, which worked perfectly. If it\u0027s not re-creatable with only a few parts then it is pure speculation as to what is causing the bugs. Re-creatable means that the bug can be re-created on its own with only a few parts and doesn\u0027t rely on building a 120 part ship, in which case it could be absolutely anything. It might not be the thrust or Isp causing the bug, it could be anything contained in that ship, or a bug caused when certain parts are put together in a specific order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the rant, but I\u0027m actually getting a little frustrated with all these \u0022it don\u0027t work on my 1,000,000 part ship, because of this...\u0022 bugs.
