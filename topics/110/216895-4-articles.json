But overall, it feels like all I managed to do was just screaming into the dark. The entire process after \u0022bug report sent\u0022 is a total mystery. The only tangible feedback are the patch notes and of course the game itself. \u0022Did they fix issue xyz? Oh no, they didn\u0027t... bummer...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe lack of transparency in this regard has become very frustrating for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPositive effects of a public facing bug tracker (which you, Darrin, probably are all aware of, just listing them for the public\u0027s sake):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt helps to prevent duplicate reports which reduces the QA team\u0027s overhead and the customer\u0027s time needed to report (\u0022Oh, it\u0027s already there, great, no need to spend minutes on writing it all up.\u0022)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPeople can track the status of their issue and don\u0027t have to guess whether or not the next update will fix a specific problem that plagues them\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou mentioned frequency vs. severity: With a \u0022I have the same problem\u0022 button you can gauge frequency of an issue and can sort everything better\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsers are forced to fill in the necessary information you require because of mandatory fields in the report\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEveryone has a somewhat clear picture of the size of the mountain the team has to move to make the game more playable\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I have a suspicion that the people in corporate have no interest in the last item. Even though time and time again it has been proven that transparency and honesty in business increases customer loyalty, especially when we\u0027re talking long term. And the Kerbal franchise is a long term loyalty thing. Next year will be a decade since I have started my YouTube channel focusing 95% on KSP (and KSP2). And the game already had a strong community before I even noticed it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf these corporate decision makers are worried about the game\u0027s public perception, I have a Steam review page to show them. Oh and also the old KSP bug tracker which was always filled to the brim.

Yeah yeah, I know the spiel of \u0022for legal reasons\u0022, I\u0027ve been part of a Fortune 150 company myself long enough. But seriously, if you say \u0022hey, some of the best reports we got were from this community tool, we love our modders and can\u0027t wait what else they will create once the game is in a more stable state\u0022, in no sliver of reality would that in any way shape or form be grounds for any type of lawsuit. If THAT\u0027S your (you, the corporate communications person) fear, you should stop all mention of community created vehicles on social media. You should stop sharing videos and screenshots right now. Because by the same logic that somebody could interpret that LGG\u0027s bug reporter might be your own tool, people could also interpret that the vehicles you share are stock vehicles and could sue you if they don\u0027t find them in the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry for being harsh right now, but this is not work that you are doing.

I don\u0027t know the specifics of the budget but considering that you just hired a new engineer I assume youre flexible to hire more people. I get you guys are busy as is, but hire a new person and have them design a public bug tracker, and maybe hire another person whose job it is to oversee it. Make it be accessible through both the launcher and the forums (or at least forum accounts), that way casual players dont need to make a new account just to file bugs, and experienced players can use something they already have. Add a basic way to sort through bugs, that way its easy for people to find out where the situation is on bugs and youre golden.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I\u0027d like to add here is something ShadowZone suggested:\u00A0 give people a button on the tracker to indicate they have seen a reported bug.\u00A0 And they could make that button a one-shot per player/account per given bug so no one player can spam it to increase the number of hits (if i stated that so nobody is confused).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-06T02:00:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2023 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow71\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T02:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224280416\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683334824\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112420\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShadowZone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ShadowZone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of today, I have submitted 122 bug reports, most of them including video of the occurrence, log files, save file and description of what happens and what I would like to happen.

I just want to mention that Star Citizen (\u003Cem\u003Eyeah, I know that it is a controversial game and developing process and lots of people feel disappointed there too, though I do not share that sentiment personally\u003C/em\u003E) has a bugtracker which I feel is quite good. It probably has everything you need, including the option to contribute to existing bugs (\u0022can reproduce\u0022, \u0022cannot reproduce\u0022, you can add further information, screenshots, and comments), the option to refer to other bugs directly, classify the severity of the bug (e.g. game breaking, cosmetic, etc.), the devs can acknowledge bugs and change the state, etc. It\u0027s of course not perfect either. But I think you (KSP2 dev team) should really look into creating something similar. Because as ShadowZone pointed out, having all these places to report bugs just eats up your own resources to collect and cataloging them.\u00A0 And since it doesn\u0027t seem like the game will come out within the next few weeks, proper resource management is essential. Though it is of course your prerogative on how you want to spend or waste your resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eif \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eyou are afraid of corporate finding out the real state of the game through the bug tracker: Well, it probably won\u0027t be worse than continously alienating your customers/the community/the player base. Corporate will probably make harsher decisions if they feel that the franchise has lost its potential because the community is mostly gone or at least not on board with the current project. And that\u0027s where I feel and fear you are headed right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd FWIW, I haven\u0027t reported a single bug in KSP2. Mostly because I think that many bugs I encountered have already been properly reported or QA has noticed and investigated them - but also because I refunded my copy about a month ago. And by the time I figure out why they happened, like being unable to EVA due to Kerbals being considered debris and having had persistent debris to 0, it was already all over the forums. I believe I even heard about it on steam first, believe it or not. I did however frequently contribute to the KSP1 bug tracker and still occasionally contribute to the Star Citizen bug tracker.
