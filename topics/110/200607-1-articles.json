My name\u2019s Nate Simpson, and I\u2019m the creative director for KSP2. Welcome to the first official KSP2 blog post. In the coming months, the Star Theory team will be checking in here periodically to give you glimpses of what we\u2019re making and how we\u2019re making it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that the trailer\u2019s out, I can finally tell the story of how we went from \u201Cit should probably have some rockets in it\u201D to \u201Cwhoa, this is making me cry\u201D in less than two months!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story begins with Tom Bass, the head of Private Division marketing, and Ara Josefsson, the KSP marketing lead, who put together a trailer animatic and flew out to our office in Bellevue to show it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thing was\u003Cem\u003E monumental\u003C/em\u003E. Tom is a huge fan of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCblQ_fnPpc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EThe Right Stuff\u003C/a\u003E, and his trailer had all the hallmarks that made the film one of my all-time favorites: the score, the sense of adventure, the reverence for NASA\u2019s golden age. The opening sequence showed a crowd of Kerbals gathered to watch Jeb blast off for the first time, and it was full of Spielbergian reaction shots of awed families watching history being made. Though we all loved the tone, we wondered if it was too nostalgic \u2014 after all, KSP2 is also about where we\u2019re going, not just where we\u2019ve been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom and Ara immediately pivoted into a deeper conversation about the soul of our game. I showed them \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vimeo.com/108650530\u0026amp;sa=D\u0026amp;ust=1571414613080000\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNGdmPFuG4TQdTtFMGa_HN3_O3MBpw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EWanderers\u003C/a\u003E, an amazing short film by Erik Wernquist that offered brief glimpses of humanity\u2019s expansion through the solar system. That video has always given me chills \u2013 the immense scale of everything, the increasing audacity of our interplanetary ambitions, how tiny we seem even when we\u2019re creating space elevators and O\u2019Neill Cylinders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe kicked around a few ideas, and Tom and Ara flew home to New York. To our surprise, they called us up first thing the next morning: did Star Theory have time for a surprise video conference? Something exciting was afoot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the screen, Tom and Ara performed their new trailer idea \u2013 Ara held a series of flash cards on which he\u2019d sketched storyboards (on the plane!) and narrated. Crucially, Tom also played music in the background. It was a song that we all recognized from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkDOOsGg-9I\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EBuild, Fly, Dream fan film\u003C/a\u003E created by Sean Esau for KSP (one of my favorites, and the first thing I showed our team when we learned we might get a crack at the sequel). We loved how M83\u2019s music went with the images of a lander descending from a huge mothership and landing on an alien world. It was hard to deny they were onto something, and the idea that we could pay homage to Esau\u2019s fan trailer \u2013 looking forward while acknowledging the past \u2013 was very exciting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ara-Presenting-768x568\u0022 data-ratio=\u002273.96\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/2uI3XyHAizCEJyOxfkxAdB/a4172d6ca26273eb16a2bff4910f3737/Ara-Presenting-768x568.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETom, aware that history was being made, took this pic of Ara and his flash cards\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked for permission to try putting together another animatic using the same music. Time was running out, but to my everlasting gratitude, Tom let us have one last crack at it. Over the following week, I put together an animatic that told a story about Kerbals progressing from tentative first steps on the Mun to building an interstellar civilization (with some Kerbal-style mishaps in between):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allow=\u0022accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_9460_4\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/index.html\u0022 title=\u0022Kerbal Space Program 2 Announce Animatic\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXnTR99iofs?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom and Ara loved it! We were off to the races, and there was no time to lose. PD got in touch with the animation geniuses at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.halon.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EHalon\u003C/a\u003E, who dove straight into planning the final trailer. This project presented unique challenges \u2013 a host of new environments to create, characters to animate, and most annoyingly (for me), two dozen unique vehicles to design. We all had our work cut out for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere at Star Theory, artist Steve Snoey and I divvied up the vehicle list and got to work assembling all the vessels and bases from part assets that had been created for the game (there was no time to test the rockets in-game, so we\u2019ve been relieved to witness fan recreations actually flying in KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it was all in Halon\u2019s hands. Over a month of weekly video conferences, we witnessed the miraculous birth of a full-fledged trailer. We nitpicked about everything from vehicle exhaust to solar panel deployment speed, and someone joked that Halon probably has a voodoo doll of me that\u2019s completely full of pins by now. It\u2019s a very funny joke that I\u2019m sure is just a joke. Regardless, Halon delivered a jaw-dropping trailer in an astonishingly short time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were still asking for big revisions the day before the end of Halon\u2019s contract \u2013 we needed a cool reveal for the company logos at the beginning and nothing was clicking. Halon must have done about a million versions of that first shot, and it was only on that last morning that something clicked and they came up with something we all loved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was done. Halon had knocked it out of the park. We couldn\u2019t show it to the world just yet, but we \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E show it to Squad, the creators of the original Kerbal Space Program. Was it true to the spirit of Kerbal? Did they like it? Did we do good? Thankfully, they agreed that it was a trailer for the ages. With that vote of confidence in our back pockets, we only had to keep the secret for a few more days. I passed the time by watching the trailer on repeat. That part where the radial boosters decouple still gives me chills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo give you an idea of how badly we needed to let our Kerbal flags fly \u2014 the Star Theory and Private Division folks who flew to Cologne to attend the trailer\u2019s premiere at Gamescom all wore hidden KSP undershirts, to reveal at the moment the trailer debuted. It turns out the grand t-shirt unveiling was kind of anticlimactic, as it happened at the back of a very large auditorium while the audience\u2019s attention was focused on the actual trailer. But still, it felt great not to have to hide anymore!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Michael-and-Nates-at-Gamescom-1024x768\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/3jzzqaJCHG6YuOTE1LQxUu/190210d61fb3f88e2d1225b8bbd217c3/Michael-and-Nates-at-Gamescom-1024x768.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(Left to right) \u2013 Michael Cook (Executive Producer, Private Division), Nate Simpson (Creative Director, Star Theory), Nate Robinson (Senior Producer, Star Theory)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpening night jitters are no joke. I felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest as the opening notes of our trailer began. This was it: after all the dreaming and arguing and obsessing behind closed doors, now was the moment when we would officially join the greatest game franchise of all time. Never has a trailer felt so long\u2026 how would people react? Would I need to put my overshirt back on and run for the exit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were laughs at the Kerbal reveal! A good sign! And people cheered at the end! And then the internet exploded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI told everybody beforehand: \u201CI\u2019m not going to read any of the YouTube comments. I\u2019ll be on Reddit if anybody needs me.\u201D But then the weirdest thing happened \u2014 somebody started digging through the comments on the trailer, and they were having trouble finding anything but enthusiasm. We started to get hopeful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Scott Manley, the human embodiment of all that is Kerbal, appeared in the comments. \u201CDon\u2019t mess this up,\u201D he said. The dude who taught me how to play this game was now talking to \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E about the thing \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E were making! Holy cannolis, this is \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E! We\u2019re \u003Cem\u003Edoing this\u003C/em\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA week later, Scott came to our office to see what we were working on up-close, and he was joined by a gathering of heavy hitters from the Kerbal community, including EJ, Jatwaa, DasValdez, ShadowZone, BadNewsBaron, Snark, LinuxGuruGamer and Galileo. This was another nail-biter for us \u2014 our assumptions would be questioned, and this would be our first chance to find out if we\u2019d misstepped. They\u2019re a very smart bunch, and they weren\u2019t going to pull any punches. To our huge relief, they walked out of the meeting even more excited about the game (and having shared a few useful insights with us over the course of the day).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Content-Creators-at-ST-1-768x576\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.ctfassets.net/wn7ipiv9ue5v/4SjbxOAYv4Ai3weGil13wt/2dea45cad249de03f2d41f2e3814d6c2/Content-Creators-at-ST-1-768x576.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe gathered KSP experts do their best to embody \u201Cexplodiness\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we all went to see the Apollo 11 Command Module at the Museum of Flight, where I was reminded that these guys \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E know their rockets \u2014 three of them (you can probably guess which three) were mystified that there was a tiny protuberance on the capsule that they \u003Cem\u003Ecouldn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E identify.

Huge thanks to everybody who made it out to see our gameplay presentation, especially given how long many of you had to wait in line to get inside! As slow as that line was, it was also a great chance for us to get to know a few of you \u2014 old fans, new fans, space industry professionals, even a few kids!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur team handed out KSP flags after the presentation ended, and while we were happy to sign them, we were even more excited to collect \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E signatures on \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E flag.

We can\u2019t wait for the next opportunity to share our progress with you all.
