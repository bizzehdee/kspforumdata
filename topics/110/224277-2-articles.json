To be perfectly honest, I\u0027m not a big fan of waiting for updates and blogs and other things like that but I deal with it because... to put it simply... breaking a good chunk of the rules in software engineering and development isn\u0027t easy. If I was a game developer and I was met with this much backlash even if I was trying to give the people what they wanted, I would honestly just quit and probably say something like \u0022Fine!

I don\u0027t truly believe we should let them just sit back and do what they want because when you have a big group of people together, chances are some of them are going to have separate ideas on what this thing should be. We don\u0027t need to \u0022let them cook\u0022 like I said, but we do need to trust that they are doing their best and we need to provide more constructive criticism than just saying \u0022Why can\u0027t you add this?! Or update that?!\u0022. Communication is vital in early access, but what is more vital is that we continue to provide good support and suggestions for this thing that we collectively want, and we need to open up to the fact that not everything you want will be there (and consider the reasoning for that.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*whew!*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ve been spending too much time on the discord \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-06T02:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2024 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 6\u0022\u003EApril 6\u003C/time\u003E by NexusHelium\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westinghouse","CreatedById":229582,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-06T02:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224377958\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221712368796\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022230359\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NexusHelium\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, NexusHelium said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing about that is that it seems like the community is mad at them no matter what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not the worst thing if we get mad at them from time to time.

If your craft wanders outside of that range and you can lose control, it can be reasonably inferred that you don\u0027t have a satellite in range, but even this is only reactionary to potentially losing a craft to a disasterous loss of control. Without a way to see your communications coverage, it\u0027s not a great player experience to have craft lost to communications loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding occlusion to the mix would only make it that much harder to plan a probe mission or risk an unplanned catastrophic loss. Once we have a good way to visualize safe regions of space where we can communicate and perhaps a great tutorial teaching of the dangers of communications black out, there will be a great opportunity not just to restore the gameplay elements this provides, but also teach new players about this aspect of space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy impression from the discussion is that doing this all well will require enough work that they just don\u0027t have time to devote to it now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: approachable != easy.
