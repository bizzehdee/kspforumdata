If I had to suggest something, I noticed that the sea level exhaust plumes end by simply spreading out into a narrow cone of flow and fading. With irl plumes, at low altitudes you get a mixing regime where the exhaust begins to slow down and becomes highly turbulent as it moves downwards along with air that has been dragged along by the plume. This might be ridiculously hard to model so I don\u0027t expect the team to tackle that effect. It might be possible to simply fade the shock diamond effect and attempt to seamlessly blend in a second, more sputter-y and turbulent effect which can then be made to spread out and dim in a realistic-looking fashion, through.

You know how KSP 1 would always give your craft this piddly smoke column in an atmosphere that was made of individual puffs? And how if you got going fast enough or your PC slowed down they would be really obvious? Eliminating that effect and replacing it with a much smaller but more lively turbulent stream of fire that moves with your rocket would not only look better but be way easier on the hardware since you would only need a few examples of the effect at any given time. The coordinate system for this effect can be based on the engine itself. Presto!

I am not absolutely sure why, but I suspect it is a mix of the strong infrared light overpowering the filter in the camera in the dim light and these shots showing the afterburner at almost peak efficiency, meaning very little soot in the exhaust that would glow in the yellow typical for carbon soot. The afterburner is showing some mach diamonds though, indicating that the engine is at least slightly off it\u0027s ideal design power point, as an afterburner when working exactly in the flight state range it was optimized for would ideally show no mach diamonds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022burner6.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u00221152\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.airfighters.com/articles/afterburnerphotos/burner6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s an interesting contrast: Same plane, shot on the same camera, but at daylight.

However this time the glow of the exhaust overpowers the camera and completely blows the afterburner out into white, while also lighting up the deck beneath it, showing that the afterburner here is actually being that bright. This indicates that the afterburner seems to be more dense and more sooty at lower altitudes. Though it should be kept in mind that this shot was made in very dim lighting conditions, I have never seen an example of an afterburner blowing out a camera in full daylight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e09de8fe99fd0c4b5d0945d6fbfb6f10.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002251.67\u0022 height=\u0022310\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/e0/9d/e8/e09de8fe99fd0c4b5d0945d6fbfb6f10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd another F-14 here. This picture is rather small and old, but was likely shot on a film camera similar to\u00A0the first two images I\u0027ve shown. This image shows an F-14 at takeoff from a carrier, likely under full afterburner. Yet the afterburner shows no mach diamonds, indication that the engine is likely operating exactly in the environment it was tuned best for: Heavy carrier takeoffs with maximum thrust. More noteworthy things of this afterburner is that it appear orange, even though it was also shot in somewhat dim lighting. This indicates an afterburner that is not burning completely clean, but more sooty. Another noteworthy thing is that the afterburner is showing streaks in the exhaust, lines in which the afterburner appears brighter than elsewhere. These streaks appear to vary from engine to engine, but tend to stay somewhat in the same position while the engine is running.\u00A0 A usable reference for how these streaks look in action is this video:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/Oj4w7i-TqsE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/Oj4w7i-TqsE\u003C/a\u003E.

Afterburners are not nearly as bright as rocket engines, so in full daylight they become quite dim. Only the shock diamonds remain visible, and also only their inner rings, not the full diameter rings visible with dim light.\u00A0 Also note the large amount of heat blur visible, as it almost always appears with afterburners.

Through it becomes visible how the flame behaves inside the engine, originating on the flame holder, them moving along the outside of the engine into the streaks out of the exhaust I mentioned earlier.

You can see the last turbine stage in the background. In front of that there is this ring of green-ish\u00A0 bars. As visible on the schema on the right these pans have a kind of V-shape in cross section, which creates a low pressure zone in the air stream behind them, which makes a stable combustion in the high velocity exhaust even possible.

At full power and sea level the afterburner shows no signs of mach diamonds, but as thrust decreases first an inner layer of afterburner becomes visible, that then breaks apart more and more into individual inner core mach diamonds before the engine completely shuts down. This once again highlights how mach diamonds occur when the engine is not in the state it was optimized for, in this case that being low thrust afterburner while not moving. Another interesting thing is that one can see the engine insides glowing in the cracks of the nozzle vanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the SR-71, the J-58, and the Whiplash engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Shock diamond - Wikipedia\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022106.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/J58_AfterburnerT.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe SR-71 is probably the plane that illustrates shock diamonds the best, here being used as the top image on the wikipedia article on said shock diamonds.

We rarely ever notice it directly, but it helps convey\u00A0the power and heat output an engine has, even if no flame is visible. From what I\u0027ve seen in the forum thread here the heatblur effect is currently only a displacement effect, which is also what we associate most with heat blur thinking about it. However, heatblur has more than just displacement behind it. So let\u0027s have a look at what causes heatblur to look the way it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kerbal_Space_Program_Screenshot_2020.09.\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/772485444570316831/921534015624863804/Kerbal_Space_Program_Screenshot_2020.09.03_-_18.18.25.35.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDisplacement:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAs already mentioned, this is what one usually thinks about with heatblur, the air with it\u0027s turbulent temperature and therefore (optical) density differences distorting all that is behind it.

While testing the first pre-alpha versions of the heatblur mod it only had displacement. As does current day waterfall. And that just looks a bit odd, it\u0027s still too sharp. It sure looks like distortion, but not like real heat blur. And this is where blur comes in, layering a blur onto the displacement makes the effect seem way more realistic as it helps simulate all the microscopic turbulence in real air that the displacement has not considered yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDarkening\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E This one may seem a bit odd at first, but during testing on the mod we realized that the effect looks a lot better if the blur also slightly darkens that area of the screen. This makes the effect a tiny bit more visible, and makes it seem more realistic. I have also noticed that kind of darkening notice on real blur. My explanation for this is light being scattered away from the viewer, making it appear slightly darker.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kerbal_Space_Program_Screenshot_2020.02.\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/772485444570316831/921536200538456145/Kerbal_Space_Program_Screenshot_2020.02.06_-_21.07.51.19.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout Blur: Compare this image (without blur) to the image above (which has blur) and see the difference.

The blur stream was getting holes at high speed as unity\u0027s particle system couldn\u0027t keep up, but flying low over the runway left a beautiful trail of blurred air behind that lingered for a while, then faded out. This was done through particles in worldspace that inherited the speed of the plane minus the exhaust velocity. Ideally the particles would have also had drag so they slowly come to a stop while the displacement texture keeps scrolling.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RAF_Tornado_GR4_Aircraft_Takes_off_from_\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022399\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/RAF_Tornado_GR4_Aircraft_Takes_off_from_Gioia_Del_Colle_Heading_for_Libya_MOD_45152847.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ideal implementation would probably be a trail renderer that is somewhat modified to simulate exhaust velocity, meaning it would deform to a certain point so it follows the path the particles mentioned above would have followed. Mesh based blur like in waterfall sadly is not really a solution as the beautiful lingering heat blur trails get lost. An effect like this must be world based.\u00A0A trail renderer alone would look odd from behind though, so my proposal would include few particles pinned to certain mesh intervals in the trail renderer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother possibility may be with the effect shown early on in the thread of the engine exhaust bending to outside influences. A mesh that bends like that could handle the heatblur close to the engine where the the trail is thin and concentrated, which would be an issue for particles. Further down the line particles could then take over to produce the lingering effect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002257215171.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022140.92\u0022 height=\u0022676\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57215171.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh yeah and non-afterburning and even turbofan engines still produce heatblur!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE END\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis took me about three hours to write and is basically a knowledge dump of all the things I have researched over the last three years.
