They are some of the brightest minds that I have worked with. I have friends who worked in NASA, some who still do, and even my sister who did work with NASA. One of the selling points for me, to get Kerbal, was seeing NASA worked with Kerbal Space Program developers. I had not heard of the game before then, but seeing that, I knew this game would be one of my favorite gaming experiences.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI worked with a different agency, but did some\u00A0satellite and aircraft calculations for missions and other things of that nature. I find myself in familiar territory, and am having a lot of fun with that. I really enjoyed my work then, and this is a good way to incorporate what I enjoyed with a video game, which is very rare indeed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
