Unreal is super expensive to develop on (at scale) because you pretty much need Perforce, the build system is super complex, and the minute you need to do something that can\u0027t be done with blueprints you need C\u002B\u002B coders who are expensive. Unity is just about the only other game in town if you want to do something that\u0027s at least AA ambition level. Unity has acquired or developed a quite a lot of really impressive tech but has done a terrible job of integrating it into a single product. It\u0027s a shame they killed their internal game project, if they had actually used it in-house to develop something reasonably big all the way to deployment and maintenance, there\u0027s a good chance they would have upped their game about that kind of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also really don\u0027t understand why they\u0027re so coy/expensive about source code access.

(Granted my makeshift rocket was basically a pencil) Would probably work great in multiplayer if you enable world origin rebasing,. Anyway, my world looked fantastic (fully forested) from any distance, and I had minimal cycle hitches while dealing with gravity and (primitive) drag calculations. 70\u002B fps using nanite rendering on a gtx 1660 super. My lowest dip was 42 fps and it was while I was quickly swinging my camera over lots of terrain.\u00A0 I imagine you\u0027d need someone well versed in U5 to implement the map scene calculations though. Atleast - someone way more versed than me. However, I was able to put it all together in about 2 days including the earth and moon.\u00A0 After that initial trial, I scrapped it and have started working on my own simulator.\u00A0 It\u0027s just a suggestion. You guys already have your assets created. moving over could be advantageous. I\u0027m just one guy, but you have an entire team. I\u0027m sure you could pull it off fairly easily.

This saves decimal space. basically you put the planets into decimals to take decimals away from the orbits while keeping the base relative scale intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-13T02:56:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2023 02:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Talavar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radimov","CreatedById":139108,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T07:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been working with Unity for years and I love it, it\u0027s comfortable to work with and you can get the result you want without much frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe opposite happens to me with Unreal, it is orthopedic and uncomfortable to work with, there is also something that I find especially unattractive about Unreal, it has something in the shaders, lighting and materials that as soon as you see a game you know it is made with it, I do not like it, it is impossible to get rid of that smell of Unreal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s just a personal opinion, I know many people who are happy with Unreal and have got used to work with it and like it, I didn\u0027t get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T14:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255806\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214806\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678482000\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210281\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Intercept Games\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/10/2023 at 4:00 PM, Intercept Games said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a sidenote, despite how much we love you modders, this change will definitely break most visual mods (sorry modders, sometimes we must hurt the ones we love).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince there aren\u0027t ANY visual mods yet for KSP 2, this is the best time to do it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T17:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.

In general, in your experience, when a game hits alpha, how does its performance compare to final targets? What type and kind of bugs do you expect to encounter? How does the visual fidelity compare to what you expect to see on release? How is the game balance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - it can vary quite a bit.\u00A0 I realize that\u0027s not a satisfying answer so I\u0027ll give some examples.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor instance, some friends at Turtle Rock let me test the Alpha build for L4D way back when.\u00A0 It was the best Alpha game I\u0027d ever tried.\u00A0 They only had the one level working and maybe one special zombie type, but it was amazingly fun, worked great in multiplayer - but it had limited content.\u00A0 There\u0027s a reason Valve partnered with them soon after.\u00A0 \u00A0I genuinely wanted to stay and try it more afterwards.\u00A0 (This is the sort of impression you\u0027d have of KSP2 if you only listened to Nate talk about it)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlmost all Alphas are not that - most projects I\u0027ve worked on, needless to say, are in worse shape than that.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst, there\u0027s a question of \u0027even though you\u0027re calling this alpha, is it really\u0027.\u00A0 \u00A0I\u0027d say most games, especially less well managed projects, tend to do some sort of sliding alpha where management is calling it alpha but actually you\u0027re still in production on some/many features.\u00A0 \u00A0Those projects tend to be the worst to deal with because often management is trying to pretend things are further along than they are, and the notion of having a feature-complete but content-incomplete game that you can start tuning, testing, and iterating as part of good game development practice has fallen by the wayside in favor of arbitrary management milestones (guess which style of Alpha KSP2 is in? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond - how buggy are you.\u00A0 Most games in alpha are not constantly crashing bugfests\u00A0 as you\u0027d suspect, but there are areas of the game that may be \u0027here be pirates\u0027 - places that only the dev(s) involved are navigating successfully.\u00A0 But still, the core of the game is stable, on a project that is doing ok.\u00A0 Because what you want as a developer is stability to be able to work, rather than a bunch of side-issues hampering you.\u00A0 Core stuff like, for instance, save-load is often made as bullet proof as possible so QA can hand you a save that points to an issue, for instance - games that are properly managed aim to be stable enough in the feature set that - especially for the content team who don\u0027t run the game from a local dev build, aren\u0027t losing time.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course I\u0027ve been on projects where the alpha IS a crashy bugfest, and those are painful to work on, and usually get delayed a lot, at best.\u00A0 In a well managed process though, even if the bleeding edge of the build is unstable, the content team is still working with a stable version that may be days or sometimes even a week old.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThird -\u00A0 on game balance - typically what is missing from alpha is the overall fun.\u00A0 \u00A0The content hasn\u0027t been tuned, designers haven\u0027t managed to iterate on things, features maybe work in silo\u0027d isolation but need to be integrated.\u00A0 Alpha is often when the design team gets to see just how well or badly their predictions on things coming together really works, you can\u0027t hand wave things anymore.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that said - there are typically pieces of the game that feel fun - if you\u0027re not seeing at least sections of it being fun, especially the \u0027core loop\u0027 you\u0027re probably in trouble\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s another reason Alpha being feature complete is important.\u00A0 \u00A0And as Alpha progresses, if the design team knew what it was doing, the game as a whole gets more entertaining.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t have the full feature set that you expected to have to support the gameplay pillars, though, designers can say \u0027oh, that parts missing, if we just had that it would be fun\u0027 and a project can limp through alpha still sucking.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFourth - on visual fidelity - It varies.\u00A0 Often you\u0027ll still see a bunch of missing assets.\u00A0ut you\u0027ll also see parts of the game that are at full fidelity - especially if you did your proper due diligence through the stage gate process, at least one \u0027vertical slice\u0027 of your game has remained functional to show the game in a close-to-final state.\u00A0 \u00A0This can be difficult with games that are more sandbox than level based, but I\u0027d say, for instance, in KSP2\u0027s case, one full-fidelity planet working at expected frame rate would have been a reasonable vertical slice for that.\u00A0 Also the game is not fully optimized, but it\u0027s usually \u0027close enough\u0027 - within a factor of 2x (this is a rule of thumb of course, not a law).\u00A0 If you\u0027re outside a factor of 2x of your target frame rate on target hardware, that means something needs more than just tweaking to reach it. v\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFifth - how does this compare to KSP2.\u00A0 Well, KSP2 is in a weird state.\u00A0 Pieces of it I\u0027d call Beta - buggy but finished essentially.\u00A0 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, for instance.\u00A0 The flight UI.\u00A0 And some aspects of it - like the terrain rendering performance - should have been addressed earlier in the process, as they are fundamental to the game.\u00A0 \u00A0Pieces of it are missing completely from the release build.\u00A0 \u00A0In many ways what the release version of KSP2\u00A0 is now is more like a vertical slice than an alpha product.\u00A0 Depending on who you\u0027d ask, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even an \u0027MVP\u0027.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP1 of course followed a similar course - it was developed in the meandering process of many indie games - a process that can yield good games, but more often than not its through Darwinian methods, rather than the less-failure prone structured processes that professionals typically try to use.\u00A0 Professional studios cannot afford to have the failure rate that indie developers do, after all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully this gives you some insight, let me know if not.\u00A0 I\u0027m never quite sure anymore how familiar people are with certain terms, but I\u0027m trying not to use too much jargon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T23:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223189\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223189-rocketrockington/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RocketRockington\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0And your thoughts on this PQS -\u0026gt; CBT transitions at this stage are?
