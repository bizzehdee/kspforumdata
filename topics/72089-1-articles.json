It seems to me that a new tier of extremely expensive science could add motivation for further exploration. Each technology from that tier should cost realy much, e. g. 3000 science, and unlock a superior piece of equipment that can make exploration of the outer planets and Jool moons substantialy easier. Also, the combined cost of this techs should exceed the maximum accumulated science, so that the player will have to make decisions about what to research instead of unlocking everything after a few Mun and Minmus missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample tech: advanced nuclear propulsion, requires nuclear propulsion and meta-materials, unlocks an advanced nuclear engine that has 2x mass and fuel consumption of LV-N, but 4x thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tychochallenge","CreatedById":85444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T18:55:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet the KSP interstellar mod.

One thing we do know about career mode is that money, reputation, and science will be interchangable (at least according to the current ideas the devs have), and that contracts will be optional, so we can probably assume that (in the future) you could do a full career by only gathering science, so the excessive rewards now make more sense when you\u0027re also using science to gain money and reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
