The way I envision this is a separate tab for spacesuit customization. Different suits/components would have different benefits- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnboard power would be limited. Your Kerbal could have gizmos, but you\u0027d have to manage their use in EVA. Your [future career mode] budget would also be limited, so you wouldn\u0027t be able to kit all your crew out with everything- you\u0027d need to specialize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the bottom tier you would have the most bare-bones suit, basically just a bunch of garbage bags duct taped together with a fishbowl for a helmet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome suits would be hardened against [to be implemented] radiation, or more resistant to impacts. Some might allow for better dexterity if you had to perform science or repairs in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could equip your Kerbal with a parachute allowing him to land on an atmosphered planet from space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E . You could give him varying amounts of RCS pack fuel depending on how much space/weight you need for other things like toolkits, batteries, lights, and sensors for performing science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested before...kind of. At least, I\u0027m fairly certain it has. Seems vaguely familiar, anyways \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027m always down for more ways to customize your kerbals. Though I don\u0027t know if changing individual suit parts is exactly what we need. I\u0027d honestly be fine if we could just change the colors of them. I tend to bring this up a lot, being able to edit the colors of outfits, EVA suits and even parts using a DoW army painter style utility. Or more recently, something like MWO\u0027s mech painter. Or most phenomenally, APB\u0027s editor for just about everything(clothes, cars, your character, even). Just good stuff to really make your space program feel like YOUR space program, you know?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally like this idea! Be able to change the color of the suit and pick which tools it has , or at the very least be able to select from a list of suits designed for different tasks. Suit parts/options could even be tied into te research tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T22:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am afraid that customisation of Kerbals (which applies to their suits) is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E list.
