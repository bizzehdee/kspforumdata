A friend has asked if there was an all Liquid Fuel Mk2 to 1.25m adaptor, I\u0027d amended a few parts, and they needed a test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFront to back:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam intake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1 inline cockpit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T200 tank (LFO)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock Mk2 to 1.25m (long)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort Mk2 cargo bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 to 1.35m (short) LF only (Mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CR-7_R.A.P.I.E.R._Engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECR-7 R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used canard foreplanes and tried several variations in the wings and tailfin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot into a 100km orbit with some fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I might switch from the FL-T200 to a short Mk2 rocket-fuel tank. It would be a better base for the wings. Maybe both adaptors un-modded and use a Mk2 liquid-fuel tank in front of the cargo bay. The balance was too far aft when the last of the oxidizer got used. Two Mk2 sections between the adapters would be a bit better for mounting the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the ascent angle right was a little tricky so as to be able to start the supersonic power-surge. Switching to rocket mode needs to be done right, or you burn rocket-fuel to recover a slight speed loss, and it matters later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my mods seemed to work. And, when you look through the 1.25m stock parts, you get some some idea of the differences between no-fuel/structural, jet-fuel, and LFO combinations. It\u0027s a little annoying that there are no stock jet-fuel-type adaptors, but it started me on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Yes, I know there are fuel-switch mods too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the starting balance is too far forward, you get drag from the continuously-applied pitch control. Air-breathing, the way the fuel is used there isn\u0027t a big shift. Once in rocket mode, the consumption pattern moves the balance backwards. Maybe I should have moved my fuel forwards before reentry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic of a less-successful version. It was sub-orbital only, coasting to the edge of atmosphere without the delta-V to circularise. I changed the rear-end of the fuselage to a stock component and there are the wing changes too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ofX6jwH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ofX6jwH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat Mk2 fuselage section was a no-fuel mod, could have been a cargo bay.
