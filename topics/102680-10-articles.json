Ahaz may have obtained a knowledge of it, or an actual specimen, when he visited Tiglath-Pileser at Damascus ([2 Kings 16:10](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm)), and, on his return to his capital, have caused one to be erected there. Sun-dials are of several kinds. The one here spoken of seems to have consisted of a set of steps, with a perpendicular gnomon or pole at the top, the shadow of which receded up the steps as the sun rose in the heavens, and descended down them as the sun declined. We must suppose that the sign was given in the forenoon, when the shadow was gradually creeping up the steps. Hezekiah thought that a sudden jump in the same direction would be as nothing compared with a reversal of the motion, and therefore required that the shadow should go back, which it did. How the effect was produced, whether by an eclipse as argued by Mr. Bosanquet (\u0027Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeology,\u0027 vol. 3. pp. 34-40), or by refraction, or by an actual alteration of the earth\u0027s motion, we are not told; but there is reason to believe that the cause, whatever it was, was local, not general, since the King of Babylon subsequently sent ambassadors, to inquire concerning \u0022the wonder that was done in the land\u0022 ([2 Chronicles 32:31](http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm)). The sun returned ten degrees. We must not press this expression as indicating a real alteration of the sun\u0027s place in the heavens. The meaning is that the shadow cast by the sun returned. \n\nAnd when the sun stood still:\n\nJoshua 10:13\n\nSo the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.\n\nMake of it what you will, but don\u0027t start an argument."},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T02:25:10Z","Content":"...
