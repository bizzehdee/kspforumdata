Sun-dials are of several kinds. The one here spoken of seems to have consisted of a set of steps, with a perpendicular gnomon or pole at the top, the shadow of which receded up the steps as the sun rose in the heavens, and descended down them as the sun declined. We must suppose that the sign was given in the forenoon, when the shadow was gradually creeping up the steps. Hezekiah thought that a sudden jump in the same direction would be as nothing compared with a reversal of the motion, and therefore required that the shadow should go back, which it did. How the effect was produced, whether by an eclipse as argued by Mr. Bosanquet (\u0027Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeology,\u0027 vol. 3. pp. 34-40), or by refraction, or by an actual alteration of the earth\u0027s motion, we are not told; but there is reason to believe that the cause, whatever it was, was local, not general, since the King of Babylon subsequently sent ambassadors, to inquire concerning \u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003Ethe wonder\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003Ethat was done in the land\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003E (\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2 Chronicles 32:31\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003E). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B34700;\u0022\u003EThe sun returned ten degrees\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Trebuchet;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#001320;\u0022\u003E.
