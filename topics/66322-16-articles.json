This is how you maximize vids because fewer people will watch if they can actually play the game. But Manley\u0027s vid was later, and makes no mention of a release date. He also did some recent in-person interviews with the devs at GDC. These facts, along with his use of a later version number, would suggest that he (1) created his video significantly later than the others, and (2) may have some inside knowledge of a release date.
