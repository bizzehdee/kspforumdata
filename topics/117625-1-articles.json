Or you can just put anywhere you want.\n\nAs you can see, it was not built to be flown into orbit, so you\u0027ll have to use HyperEdit or edit the save file. You can however try to fly it into orbit (good luck...), or separate it in several different parts and assemble it in orbit.\n\nI\u0027m not sure, but it has about 300 parts. You can remove some of them, like lights and fuel tanks caps and maybe some struts.\n\nYou\u0027ll need several mods, such as:\n\n- Near Future (at least solar, power, structural and fuels)\n\n- B9 Aerospace (fuel caps, lights, struts and RCS tanks)\n\n- Mk IV Space Plane system (not sure, but I think the RCS ports are from this mod)\n\n- Tweak Scale (som tank caps are scaled up)\n\nSome pics:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I intended to add crew space, but it would get gigantic...\n\n[craft file](http://www.filedropper.com/station)\n\nHope you like it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
