Or you can just put anywhere you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, it was not built to be flown into orbit, so you\u0027ll have to use HyperEdit or edit the save file. You can however try to fly it into orbit (good luck...), or separate it in several different parts and assemble it in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, but it has about 300 parts. You can remove some of them, like lights and fuel tanks caps and maybe some struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need several mods, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Near Future (at least solar, power, structural and fuels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- B9 Aerospace (fuel caps, lights, struts and RCS tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mk IV Space Plane system (not sure, but I think the RCS ports are from this mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tweak Scale (som tank caps are scaled up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6M3Cr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
