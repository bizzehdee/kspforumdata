The bottom two are the bottom shaft with the drilling head and the telescoping drill shaft above that. Both do not have colliders and can freely enter the ground. The next part up - it\u0027s mostly yellow and it cantilevers out from the craft - does have a collider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, make sure that the drill is mounted high enough that the arm that swings out doesn\u0027t touch the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
