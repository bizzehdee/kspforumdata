I would use the GCmonitor to see the memory usage ingame (which is a bit higher than taskmanager reports), but I wanted to be sure that there wasn\u0027t a memory leak coming from that somehow.\n\nHeres the output log and crash data from the last time I crashed: [http://sta.sh/0e91nkfjccm](http://sta.sh/0e91nkfjccm) Don\u0027t mind the bloated output log, that came from MechJeb.\n\nEdit: eh, I\u0027m going to put GCmonitor in because I can see what the actual memory usage is.\n\nEdit2: Ok, now I\u0027m not so sure about the terrain being the cause, but theres definetly something doing memory leak.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T21:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**\n  \nclarifying title"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:39:07Z","Content":"Any chance you have the heat thing enabled (f10) but the gauges aren\u0027t up so you don\u0027t know it?
