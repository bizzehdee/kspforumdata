Or if you don\u0027t want to use hyper-edit its still pretty easy to do a quicksave, edit the file and change the lon-lat values to a known set and reload the quicksave. Not ideal I know but it could work for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite like the idea of being able to tow the craft onto the runway but I\u0027d not like to have to do that every time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Janos1986\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Janos1986\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo you want ground service then.\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem I see with taxiing in ksp is that you should always start facing in the right direction, since there is no pushback tows to reverse your plane or park you after you land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but I quite enjoy building ground support crew. With mods like infernal robotics making ground crew is pretty easy, but with pure stock the medium landing gear acts quite well as a tow-arm as it kinda sticks to the plane a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my fully stock re-fueling team fueling a small SSTO and one of the tow truck moving a much larger craft (which it dragged up the slope to the runway);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/U8f3U1r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U8f3U1rl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U8f3U1rl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CJ96hKk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CJ96hKkl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CJ96hKkl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spin-Planet","CreatedById":78085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T18:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking right in front of the hangar doors facing the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI going to make a few ground support items.
