So gentlemen, in what ways do you think your game will change with the introduction of propellant depots?\n\nMe I think I\\\u0027ll be designing and launching a lot fewer giant boosters to loft spacecraft full of fuel into orbit. Once depot is in I see myself building spacecraft in a way so they use up most of their own fuel to reach orbit. Then they will refuel from depot before going about their mission to Mars or something. The fact that boosters \u002B spacecraft\\\u0027s own engine now only have to lift an empty spacecraft into orbit as opposed to one with full load of fuel means a dramatic reduction in size of rockets needed for the same mission at the cost of more launches to refill depots. On that note I would like to see parts like \u0027FL-T500 fuel tank (empty)\u0027 in the VAS.\n\nOther than that I think Spacecraft Exchange is going to be full of people show casing efficient and reliable tanker designs since they will become an integral part of any long range missions."},{"CreatedByName":"Stevenator1","CreatedById":10892,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T12:10:59Z","Content":"This also means that something like mechjeb would have to be implemented.

AFAIK all of NASA\\\u0027s docking are all done manually too since NASA never had a unmanned resupply spacecraft.\n\nGetting close to another craft is not that hard even in the current game, what is hard is to get both ships\\\u0027s docking interface to line up properly since currently any spacecraft not in focus will have its ASAS offline causing it to slowly rotation in random directions. To implement docking they at least need to have a way for ship to remember ASAS status when not being controlled. Ideally there should also be a docking helper module that knows how to rotate the ship one revolution per orbit so it always keeps one orientation relative to the body the ship is orbiting.\n\nA docking cam with a crosshair and showing distance and speed of approach would be pretty important too, other than that I don\\\u0027t think any other aids are needed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That would be awesome! A question though. What would one do with the fueling stations once they are empty?\n\nWell two ways:\n\nMethod 1: The propellant depot stays exactly where it is and you send up tankers to dock with the depot and refill it. Afterwards the tanker is deorbited.\n\nMethod 2: The tanker itself is the propellant depot, once it\\\u0027s empty you just deorbit it and launch another one.\n\nBoth require expandable tankers, I don\\\u0027t think SSTO reusable tankers would be a good idea given their much smaller payload - you\\\u0027ll go crazy from all the rendezvous you have to make if you use SSTO reusable tankers. Method 1 is for those who like to build up a big permanent station in orbit and will be worth it if we get a lot of space station stuff like canadarms where you probably don\\\u0027t want to throw away. Method 2 needs less rendezvous but also results in less sophisticated depots.\n\nFun fact: NASA and ULA are working on method 2 style missions using half empty Centaur upper stages"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevenator1","CreatedById":10892,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T12:49:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That would be awesome!

For example a large 100 FL-T500 capacity propellant depot when fully fuelled will be 250kg \u002B depot hardware. To lift this propellant depot fully fuelled into orbit will require a colossal booster like [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0), three times the size of the depot and impose very strict requirements on the geometry of the depot or it will simply crush the booster underneath with its sheer mass. On the otherhand launching this depot empty will only result in a payload of 30kg \u002B depot hardware, easily within the reach of your average heavy lifter and allowing more varied shapes like long docking arms more suited for a depot."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T09:41:01Z","Content":"To those who are such proponents of a mechjeb, I want to remind them that many players here have achieved stable orbit, performed a trans-munar burn and injection, and landed on the mun all by the seat of their pants.\n\nI don\\\u0027t see why a little docking maneuver makes an interface that takes so much out of their hands and makes the point of the game pointless necessary.\n\nMechjeb is nice as a modded option, but it shouldn\\\u0027t be necessary in KSP.\n\nRemember we learn by failure here at the KSC.

Harv has already stated there will be a kerbal way to dock easing the process somewhat. That is good enough for me. Getting there is the best part of the challenge and I am not about to hand it over to some calculator.\n\nAs for orbiting depots, I am all for that. Using jets for boosters, you already have a more fuel-economical way to get payloads into orbit. It is worth trying out.
