Once depot is in I see myself building spacecraft in a way so they use up most of their own fuel to reach orbit. Then they will refuel from depot before going about their mission to Mars or something. The fact that boosters \u002B spacecraft\\\u0027s own engine now only have to lift an empty spacecraft into orbit as opposed to one with full load of fuel means a dramatic reduction in size of rockets needed for the same mission at the cost of more launches to refill depots.

Afterwards the tanker is deorbited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 2: The tanker itself is the propellant depot, once it\\\u0027s empty you just deorbit it and launch another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth require expandable tankers, I don\\\u0027t think SSTO reusable tankers would be a good idea given their much smaller payload - you\\\u0027ll go crazy from all the rendezvous you have to make if you use SSTO reusable tankers.

Campaign will pretty much be a step up in the difficulty factor, when you consider the risk of losing kerbals you\\\u0027ve put a lot of training into, as well as watching a pile of cash you spent several missions building up disappear in a puff of smoke and dust on the Mun because of a failed landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch as it may cost me a cordless mouse or two after a disastrous mission, I eagerly await the added challenges of campaign. Sandbox can easily be considered a training simulator, only without the added benefits of experienced crews and other features you should be able to acquire in Campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T09:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022flaillomanz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022flaillomanz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so long as they keep a sandbox mode open (Yes, with everything unlocked - I play this game solely because it is currently a sandbox) I\\\u0027m in agreement.
