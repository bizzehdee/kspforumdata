Now, I\u0027m not talking about the old \u0022is (blank) cheating\u0022 debate. Rather, what are the idiosyncrasies in your playing style that\u00A0make your missions much more challenging (and sometimes more frustrating) to complete. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll start things off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t send Kerbals off on long duration missions alone... even if the other crew are not needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI insist on having sufficient living quarters and work space for a long duration mission. My usual crew size is around 4, so this would mean having living quarters, a capsule/cupola where the pilots work, and a science bay as a work area for the scientists and engineers (I also consider the science bay as a\u00A0general recreation/study\u00A0area).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo crew transfer through parts which would not support an tunnel/hatch. For instance, through engines, girders, service bays, the science Jr, the refinery\u00A0etc. I have complex rules about crew transfer through fuel tanks. Generally its not permitted, except for the adapters which I imagine\u00A0have a small tunnel through the centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated to this point, design to avoid EVA. The space agencies don\u0027t undertake EVA lightly. Its meticulously planned. I\u0027ll therefore try to avoid\u00A0transferring crew from one ship to another via EVA, or, in accordance with the rule above, between non-connected parts of the one ship by EVA. Docking ports between crew supporting parts are are necessity, which of course has design implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver to you.
