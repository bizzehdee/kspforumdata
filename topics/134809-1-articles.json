Pull up the list of known previous bugs and start out by testing for the bugs Squad knew about and intended to squash. Because testing for bugs you don\u0027t know about is very dicey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2: Unit testing. Instead of testing \u0022every part with every other part\u0022 (a HUGE workload!) start by testing each individual part on its own. Make sure each one works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3: Variance testing. Build some rockets and spaceplanes identically to previous models (which you flew before, so that you know they work) and see if they work any differently in the new version. The goal is to make sure the same stuff that worked, still works. If, for example, a spaceplane is suddenly acting differently when Squad specifically said they didn\u0027t change the code for the aerodynamics, something is probably wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#4: Clustered testing (a name I made up just now). Instead of testing \u0022every part with every other part\u0022 (again) build test ships that use, say, 20-30 different parts. Overengineer, add useless parts, doesn\u0027t matter. Rather than build 227x226 different ships to test every part with every other part, test a bunch of parts at once. If the entire test ship works, you know 20-30 parts all work with each other, bug-free, with one test. If something explodes, you know the problem is somewhere in that group of 20-30 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#5: Watch out for \u003Cstrong\u003Eintermittent\u003C/strong\u003E bugs. While doing all your other testing, try to record everything weird that happens, even if it seems minor. If a glitch happens once and then mysteriously disappears on a retest, don\u0027t discount it right away--a bug that only happens some of the time is extremely difficult to catch.
