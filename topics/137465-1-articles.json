Even complete new game engines share a lot from their predecessors. Speaking of engines: as you can perfectly see with the last patch, unity dictates quite a lot of the core functionality.

A Zak McKracken could be finished. Both in development and especially: the game itself. Play it through and then its done. Same as Turrican.

A platform for the meta game to evolve. Like Unreal Tournament or, more recently: world of tanks/planes/anything. And especially sandbox games like KSP, that have no end. That are not confined by a storyline that dictates \u0022the end\u0022. And these games live through constant support of the devs. Be it the original ones, or the modders. But ultimately, the devs. If squad would have stopped development after 1.0. maybe even after 1.0.5 (like most games these days: release, fix the most obvious bug, abandon the project). We would not have the unity5 support. For ever (or at for a long time if you would counter this by \u0022modders\u0022 - But you see the masses of people that where involved around the clock by squad and it\u0027s affiliates. A much smaller mod team with their own jobs would probably need 2 or more years for this step alone).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, as said before, KSP is a year old. Not 3 or 4 like we see it just because we played it so early. They have just layed a very good foundation through A LOT of effort.
