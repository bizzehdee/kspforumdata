They better be so financially stable now that they can hire alot of new developers, so that it does not take away resources from PC version.

The PS4 has a weak CPU, and several recent games have highlighted this. KSP is a very CPU heavy game, to the point where my i7 has a hard time keeping up pegged at 3ghz in turbo (its a laptop) with higher part counts (300\u0027ish).

Squad knows something I don\u0027t about PS4. \n\nI\u0027ve got no problem with consoles in principle, but I\u0027ve never seen a game so ill-suited to them as KSP. That said, in my mind the problems boil down to only three issues: controllers, performance, and mods. Each by itself seems insurmountable from where I\u0027m sitting, but then again I\u0027m not one of the devs and they surely know things I don\u0027t. If they can solve all three (and it has to be *all three*, since each alone is a potential deal-breaker) then I think it could work out for the best. \n\nPersonally, I can\u0027t picture trying to build a complicated mult-part ship in stock KSP, at 10 FPS, with a console controller.

It *will* have to be more limited. Just the lack of mouse proves this. Craft interactivity will be limited to 0.13 days.
