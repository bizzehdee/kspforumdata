I should note that I am playing Science Mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve successfully sent a couple of manned rockets into orbit with no issue. I have that down pat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it seems that I have issues with unmanned rockets. Somewhere between 10K and 25K (depending on how much boost I give the ship before I disengage boosters and switch to liquid) my rocket tips over and begins spiraling uncontrollably. This happens when I disengage booster rockets and switch to liquid fuel. Obviously this doesn\u0027t work well. I initially thought it had something to do with aerodynamics as my initial CoM and (what I think) it translates to after fuel usage seems OK, but I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, I\u0027ve tried several rocket models and all have the same issue. Are there any tips out there? Also, in terms of Kerbin orbit for a Mun orbit mission, how high should my Kerbin orbit be or does it matter? I\u0027ve been trying to get way out there in orbit but maybe that\u0027s overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T23:00:24Z","Content":"\nIt might be that your \u0022usual\u0022 kerballed designs have enough torque to compensate for your build style. Many of the pods have a fairly high torque rating, whereas the probe cores have very low (or none at all). Sounds like after staging off your boosters, there\u0026#39;s enough drag up front that your rocket doesn\u0026#39;t have the control authority to keep the rocket pointed the right way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry adding some fins or a bit of torque. Also, having several science bits up top (which is hard to avoid) also adds to the drag at the tip of the rocket. So if this particular rocket has more science bits than your usual rocket, that might be adding to the issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, welcome to the forums! :D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers,\u003Cbr\u003E\n~Claw\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S1gmoid","CreatedById":124382,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T23:10:46Z","Content":"\nWell, also probe cores are very un-aerodynamic.

If you haven\u0026#39;t unlocked the stock fairings yet, you probably have unlocked at least one nose cone. Strap that and a few fins on. See if that doesn\u0026#39;t sort it out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for number of fins. Depends. I usually go for 3 or 4, partially determined by number of boosters, partially out of sheer need, but occationally I find I need more fins, 6 or 8 to get a proper behaviour from the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: One final thought. If you haven\u0026#39;t already, put the science stuff in a service bay. This is especially true for the goo cannisters. Having them sticking out will give you more drag up front where you don\u0026#39;t want more drag.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T07:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding to post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T08:04:15Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027keyscapeunit\u0027]Thanks y\u0026#39;all!

It will still spin (slowly) like an artillery shell once I drop boosters, but I learned to let the boosters carry it over 12K, ditch them when they flame out, and then keep the engines off until the rocket starts to stabilize (the engines will finalize the stabilization). At that point I was able to get into orbit and made it to the Mun for a couple of orbits and back on my first attempt.
