Would it make sense to keep two sets of RCS thrusters, one for empty and one for full tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy way of doing this (for rockets, I\u0027m not much of a spaceplane person):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDisplay the ACoM (Average CoM) using RCS Build Aid.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPlace the RCS thrusters in order to minimise translation torque at ACoM.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECheck the maximum RCS torque at CoM and DCoM.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEnsure that the vessel has sufficient non-RCS torque (i.e. reaction wheels, command pods) to overcome this max RCS torque.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:03:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe COM and DCOM are close enough that this doesn\u0027t matter.
