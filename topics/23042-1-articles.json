At first I fiddled with some spaceplanes. This was the first time I\u0027d ever visited the Spaceplane Hanger. I managed to kill more kerbals in 20 minutes than I\u0027ve killed in years of game-time flying rockets, so I concluded that spaceplanes were not for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back to the VAB, and tried slapping some jet engines on a rocket to see if I could make that work. The image below shows the family of test vehicles I made in the process of finding out how high jets engines can operate before they flame out and start the ship tumbling around (since the two engines never seem to flame out at the same time), and what kind of flight profile is needed to get into orbit. The jet engines didn\u0027t seem to do much in the way of gaining a lot of speed (which I gather is what they do with a spaceplane SSTO), but they serve to get you above the thickest part of the atmosphere and give you a little upward and sideways velocity. Unless I\u0027m doing this wrong. But it wasn\u0027t too hard to get my first ship into orbit, and to bring it back down intact under parachutes for a landing on its legs. Then I tried a bit more fuel...but ran up against the limit that the two jet engines could lift. I briefly tried four jet engines, which accelerated upward smartly, but had the embarrassing result that the ship broke apart under its parachutes (pilot Dilger Kerman was fine...but the KSC administrators did not appreciate getting bombed by the lower section of his rocket). I tried a little \u0022air-hogging\u0022 by giving each engine two ram-air intakes, but did not carry this to unreasonably extremes that I gather some people have tried. And after getting a design that could reach orbit well, I tried to see how big of a payload I could deliver to orbit with the ship...first with a small science package satellite, and then with some fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LQXoq8Z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LQXoq8Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the SSTO Test Version 1g, with optional payload attached. Three FL-T800 fuel/oxidizer tanks, and one FL-T400 fuel/oxidizer tank (important: the side tanks feed into the central tank). Two basic jet engines, each with two ram air intakes (since this looked reasonable). The ram air intakes were attached with the magic of cubic struts. One LV-T45 rocket engine, a standard sized ASAS unit, a single-kerbal capsule (which can separate and return under its two parachutes if necessary), two more parachutes mounted on the central main tank, one docking port, four heavy-duty landing legs, and three ladders in case the kerbal actually wants to get out after landing. Action groups were set up to toggle the two jet engines on/off, and the central rocket engine on/off. And a Jeb 9000 control interface was added to handle the precision targeting of the landing location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0AQ1Z4b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220AQ1Z4b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first part of the flight is handled mainly by the jet engines. These need to be activated on the pad and allowed to spool up to speed before the launch clamps are released. These engines tend to run quite hot... the overheat warning is your constant companion during the boost. My first surprise came when I added more fuel tanks and the rocket got too heavy...then the jet engines struggled to the point where they exploded. Needless to say, this was also an unexpected surprise for Dilger, but he landed the ship handily on its rocket flame. The speed of the rocket needs to be kept above 80 m/s or so once the engines get hot...otherwise they will explode. It would be nice if I could give a little push with the rocket motor to help them along, but there is no separate throttle control for the jet engines and rocket engine, so it\u0027s a matter of briefly toggling the rocket engine on to speed up the ship and prevent the jet engines from overheating. Several intermittent bursts of the rocket engine can keep the jet engines sitting near the red line until the speed increases sufficiently that the rocket engine is no longer needed for this. I generally use an initial blast from the rocket engines just after I release the launch clamps to push the ship up to around 50 m/s... and then it can usually get to 80 m/s before the jet engines overheat and explode. With the two ram air intakes on each jet engine, the engines will operate to a little over 20,000 meters (this assumes the ship is moving more or less into the airstream, and not at too high of an angle of attack). You can watch the Air Intake resource to see when it drops down to 0.09, after which flameout will soon happen. I start the ship in a slight gravity turn starting at about 7,000 meters (about 10 degrees), and increase the tip over to 15 degrees at around 15,000 meters. The jet engines use fuel from the tanks, but not oxidizer...so you end up with an excess of oxidizer. But, the amount of fuel used by the jet engines is quite small. Still, it would be nice if I could choose to have less oxidizer or more fuel to begin with, since that excess oxidizer is just dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iGNK9VQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iGNK9VQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 20,000 meters, I use the action group keys to toggle on the rocket engine and toggle off the jet engines. I then start increasing the gravity turn to 45 degrees and beyond, keeping the apoapsis point safely ahead of the ship in the Map view. The jet engines are dead weight for the rest of the flight, but they apparently have helped enough to make this worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, I have had good results using a little more turn-over prior to 20,000 meters...but you can\u0027t turn over too much (since the jet thrust is holding the rocket up, unlike a spaceplane SSTO that has wings to provide lift). At the higher angles, I give occasional bursts from the rocket engines for a few seconds to keep the upward momentum going. At 18,000 meters, I turn on the rockets engines and keep them on after that. This more-angled trajectory allows the jet engines to operate longer, so it gives better efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried the Turbojet engines instead of the regular jet engines, but I do not get as good of results with the Turbojets. First of all, they are heavier. Secondly, the ship spends most of its time on the jet engines at lower altitudes (again, unlike a spaceplane SSTO) where the regular jet engines are more efficient -- it flies through the high-altitude region of the jet engine operation rather quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2IVXi3h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222IVXi3h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are two views of the SSTO ship in orbit at 105 km. The ship can reach a circular orbit of 500 km altitude and still have enough fuel to deorbit. But that would use up almost all of the fuel onboard, and your only landing option at that point would be to use the parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ruPyQWE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ruPyQWE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2StqR2z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222StqR2z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a low orbit, the ship has enough fuel that it can return and land on its legs using rocket power. I let MechJeb target the ship into KSC, and then either MechJeb or I can land it on its flame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A8IGXBv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A8IGXBv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDilger can easily handle the ladders, which is good since a fall from that distance might be deadly. This particular landing was from a 105 km orbit, and the ship still had 86 units of fuel left after landing. It typically takes about 35 units of fuel to deorbit the ship and target it for the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S2j5voR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S2j5voR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship goes out to a 500 km orbit, or if it carries a substantial payload into orbit, then landing on rocket power is not an option. In the picture below, the SSTO is lifting a small refueling pod into orbit. The refueling pod is made up of a FL-T200 tank, a FL-R25 RCS tank, a QBE probe core, two small solar panels and a battery pack to power the probe core, RCS thrusters for maneuvers, and docking ports on each end. The SSTO ship can put this refueling pod into a 125 km orbit and have enough fuel left over to return for a parachute landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wIVHwlW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wIVHwlW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen making a parachute landing, the two chutes that are mounted at the top end of the main fuel tank are deployed first. The timing of this deployment depends on whether the targeting for the landing location appears to be going a little long (deploy early) or short (deploy late). Do NOT deploy the two parachutes on the capsule yet. If you deploy all four chutes high up, the force of full-deployment at 500 meters can pull the ship apart. The pilot will survive on the two capsule chutes, and the lower part of the ship can probably also survive on its two chutes, but it looks embarrassing on the Kerbal Nightly News.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7WOSTmc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227WOSTmc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ship reaches 500 meters AGL, the chutes will fully open. Then the two chutes on the capsule can also be deployed to help slow the descent. And now would be a good time to lower the landing gear. If you have some fuel left, you can use the rocket engine to brake to a gentle landing. But be careful not to slow to a stop in the air, or your chutes will vanish... and then you better hope you have enough fuel to complete the landing on the engine flame. I\u0027ve cleverly had to do this few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mu25z64.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mu25z64.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while precision in landing is a great thing, you CAN get a little too close to the launch pad. In the flight shown below, the ship came down near the edge of the launch pad structure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7L1BenG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227L1BenG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and barely managed to not tip over. This was the closest Dilger came to getting blown up in this series of test flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nklUCuF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nklUCuF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELater Update\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the slightly modified 1he version. It has a probe body attached so that the ship can take a kerbal to orbit and then return empty (or vice versa). The option of separating the capsule has been eliminated (I now trust this design...and the abort mode for a problem during launch is just to cut engines and deploy the chutes in sequence as needed, then land on the legs with a little rocket assist because the ship will be heavy with fuel). RCS quads have been positioned so they don\u0027t try to cause rotations while doing translations (which save on RCS fuel) for space station docking. I have been able to get this version into a 120 km circular orbit with just over 500 m/s of delta-V remaining. This was accomplished by flying the more-angled trajectory described earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UKUzeJ0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UKUzeJ0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E3-Kerbal Crew Carrier\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original version of the SSTO ship used a single-kerbal capsule and two jet engines, so the upscaled Crew Carrier was built using a 3-kerbal capsule and six jet engines. As before, each jet engine has two ram air intakes (since it fits and seems physically reasonable). The original used one LV-T45 vectoring rocket engine, so the Crew Carrier uses three LV-T45 engines. It has RCS for orbital rendezvous and docking. It has parachutes and landing legs and MechJeb targeting for landing back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pPCJuOv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pPCJuOv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test flights for the ship were conducted by Commander Nedmy Kerman, Pilot Merfred Kerman, and Flight Attendant Rodgan Kerman. Just kidding, Rodgan! Oh, how the guys had such fun picking on Co-pilot Rodgan. While the ship is still safely secured in the launch clamps, the throttle is pushed to maximum and the jet engines are activated by pressing a switch with a big \u00222\u0022 on it. After the jet turbines spool up to full speed, the launch clamps are released at the same time the rocket engines are fired by pressing the button with the big \u00221\u0022 on it. The rocket engines are only on for a short while as the ship clears the tower and speeds up to 50 m/s, when the \u00221\u0022 is pressed again to switch off the rockets. Then it\u0027s up to the fuel-sipping jet engines to very slowly accelerate the ship, and, more importantly, lift it above the lower, dense layers of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. At 10,000 meters, a 10-degree turn is initiated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QfW54AJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QfW54AJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 18,000 meters, the rocket engines are turned on and kept on by pressing the \u00221\u0022 button. At 20,000 meters the \u00222\u0022 button is pressed to shutdown the jet engines before they flame out. Then the gravity turn begins in earnest. Depending how how good the pilots are that day, the ship could have anything from 300 to 500 units of fuel left after circularizing a 120 km orbit. At least this was true of the pilots used to test-fly this ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1nd3I0R.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221nd3I0R.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the Crew Carrier 1 about to dock with the ancient Tanker Station 1 in a 200-km orbit. Depending on how much fuel the Crew Carrier made it to orbit with, it can reach an altitude of 400-500 km or so. Just be sure you keep enough fuel to deorbit (it takes about 130 units of fuel to deorbit from a 120 km orbit). The other ship that is docked to the Tanker Station is a \u0022Fat Man\u0022 crew transfer vehicle that was launched long ago on an expendable launch vehicle. On board are Kelby Kerman, Dunsel Kerman, and Lembart Kerman, who got assigned to this mission when they kept coming up in the rotation instead of the crew I wanted. I suppose I should let them out of purgatory soon. There is no crew in the tanker\u0027s capsule, since they were extracted years ago when the second tank docked (and had a landing capsule for them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d7NWzmU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d7NWzmU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter retro fire a clever MechJeb-assisted distance away from the KSC, the Crew Carrier drops backwards onto KSC property.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/89vcKvz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002289vcKvz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have sufficient fuel and the skills of Jebadiah Kerman (or his software equivalent), you can land the Crew Carrier on its rocket engines. But that\u0027s more excitement than I typically care for...and we\u0027ve carried along all these darn parachutes, so we might as well use them. The chutes anchored the the top of the lower main tank are deployed first so that structural component can take the main deployment stress when the chutes fully open at 500 meters. Then the other two sets of chutes at the top of the upper tank and on the capsule are deployed to slow the descent. (I have two chutes on the capsule because the abort procedure for this ship is to simply shutdown all engines and deploy chutes in a judicious manner...and I wanted to be sure there were at least a couple on the capsule in case things come apart.) Although the ship can land safely under the chutes, it\u0027s polite to return it bent as little as possible (otherwise the ground crew gets all snotty and is less likely to share their Beemans with you), so any fuel left in the tank should be used to cushion the touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m8oItRA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m8oItRA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ladder is a bit circuitous, but even if the kerbal is clumsy and manages to exit the capsule without holding on to the ladder (we\u0027re looking at YOU, Rodgan), their fall is cushioned by the apparently-soft ram air intakes, so they can survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ILttWDD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ILttWDD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second varient of the Crew Carrier was also tested. It incorporates a 4-kerbal hitchhiker container in case the need arises to move seven kerbals at once. This varient can make it to 120 km orbit and return (parachute landing only, of course...there will not be fuel for a rocket flame landing), and it should only be sent to retrieve kerbals from higher altitudes if there is also some fuel there that it can have for the return. Both versions of the Crew Carrier were also constructed in probe-controlled variants so that the ship can be launched empty to retrieve kerbals from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yPMXENc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yPMXENc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ELaythe SSTO\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost recently, I\u0027ve been testing a version of the SSTO for my upcoming long-term mission to set up a base on Laythe. I originally planned to send one of the 3-kerbal Crew Carriers there to shuttle kerbals down and up from the surface as needed, but the 3-kerbal SSTO is a fairly heavy ship, and I wanted something lighter (just to make it easier to ship it to Laythe). I considered using my 1-kerbal version of the SSTO, and make multiple trips (it turns out that three trips with the 1-kerbal version uses a bit less fuel than one trip of the 3-kerbal version)... but more trips is more tedious flying for me, and more chance of accidents. So I considered stacking extra single-kerbal capsules on top of the original SSTO... at 0.8 tons each, that would be an additional 1.6 tons, which the vehicle should be able to just barely handle. But then I thought, why use a total of 2.4 tons of capsules (three of the single capsules), when I could use a 2.5-ton Hitchhiker Container and carry FOUR kerbals? So I tried it out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UorCZEZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UorCZEZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe version above can BARELY make it into a 90-km Kerbin orbit ...and Laythe is a bit easier, so it should be able to make the trip down and up starting with a full load of fuel. But it looks too non-aerodynamic to suit my tastes (and adding tapering transitions makes it too heavy to reach orbit. So I built an intermediate version of the SSTO with four jet engines and two rocket engines and a Hitchhiker Container:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JcbfOXt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JcbfOXt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intermediate version above can make it into Kerbin orbit just fine. There is a bit of a problem with flying these Hitchhiker versions compared to the capsule versions: the ship no longer has capsule torque to help you steer it. As a result, the Hitchhiker versions must be flown using RCS control. The ship above has four RCS tanks down underneath by the two rocket engines (to decrease the frontal area and decrease drag...once the program actually cares about such things. But I\u0027m trying to be more aerodynamic here). But it\u0027s flyable with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I have a successful SSTO, I always try LESS FUEL to see how it works. The version below can barely make it into a 90-km Kerbin orbit (although the return might be iffy because there is not a lot of fuel left to target your reentry). But computer simulations indicate it can handle the Laythe run down from orbit and back up to orbit with some fuel to spare.

With all eight chutes deployed, it comes down at just over 10 m/s with all that fuel on board, so some additional fuel must be used in a short braking burn just before touchdown. But at that point the ship still has enough fuel to return to an 80-km orbit around Laythe with fuel to spare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0nw6ob8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220nw6ob8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBrotoro\u0027s KSP Web pages.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T09:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like your post, but admit I did not read much of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should try using the other jet engine, and using jet fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soranno","CreatedById":58351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T10:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI enjoyed reading , although I admit I skipped a little towards the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut anyway, I too have enjoyed working with hybrid rockets, ascending on a combination of all of solid boosters, jets and rockets.

I think this may be because the jet engines on this rocket spend most of their time working at low altitudes while the slow-moving rocket is gaining altitude, and the regular jet engine is more efficient at those altitudes and speeds. The passes through the higher altitude range of the jet-powered flight relatively quickly (since it\u0027s moving faster by then...although not all that fast).

In that time they use up only 40 liters of fuel. As a result, I spend the rest of the flight carrying around the 32.7 liters of unused oxidizer.

Did you have enough fuel after the skip entry to land on the engine flame, or did you use the chutes?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T03:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soranno","CreatedById":58351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T04:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been landing on chutes.. and quite a few chutes at that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0060s been tight to say the least.
