The RAPIER is a pretty heavy engine for what you get, the LV909 is not. This would shift your CoM towards the nose of the craft throwing off the handling and balance of the aircraft. On the otherhand you have Aerospikes available which are almost the same weight and wont change the CoM that much if at all and have better ISP then the 909s or the RAPIERs. The other downside is the loss of half of your air breathing engine power will have an affect of increased climbing time, longer runways for take off and a much slower acceleration to speed for orbital burn. \u003Cp\u003EMost cases I usually design a new craft for exclusively that reason just to take stuff to and from my space station at 100km orbit. The same SSTO also takes satelites and places them in Geosync orbit, pretty sad that it flew all the way to 2868.5km x 2868.5km orbit and managed to launch 2 satelites then return back to the KSC over shoot by 400km turn around then fly back to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can understand that, but what I meant is more for after I hit my station. I designed my SSTO to primarily actually fill the role very much like the US shuttles. It lifts cargo and crew to my station, performs general operations, and then brings crew back to the ground. Emphasis on my shuttle is the general workhorse in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zfMhmLn.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy Space Station\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the bottom right hand, is where my shuttle would dock, refuel, potentially pick up probes or satellites for it to move around. So if I use two of those docking rings to park say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edocking clamp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote control ring small\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmall rcs fuel block with a ring of rcs thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen attach 2 of my RAPIER engines through docking clamps, so after I hit orbit/dock, I just eject the rapiers, swap in the LV-Ns and now it\u0027s a space workhorse, until such time as I need to land. Park the nukes back on the station, and land purely using 2 RAPIER engines. at that point I recover the plane, and if I relaunch it, it goes up with 4 RAPIER again. Or am I thinking like an idiot, and need to roll up a newspaper to hit myself for being bad? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Somtaaw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Somtaaw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow the only tricky part is figuring out how to adjust my recently completed space station mark 2, code named Hephaestus, to include a good docking section for this beauty of a plane.\u003Cp\u003ENow would you say I over muscled the base design, by going with 4 RAPIERs for the core weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, would you say that swapping out 2 of the RAPIER engines for say LV-909\u0027s or another variant of interplanetary engine would be easily done?

Because of the 100% recovery thing, the easy refuelling and the efficiency of jets and wings, there\u0027s no need to scrimp and save and economise mass like you do with rockets. You can afford to overpower it, you can afford to load up on \u0022luxuries\u0022 like science gear and mod parts (TAC-LS, Scansat, etc), you can afford to build omnicapable multipurpose things instead of having to specialise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was going for extreme long range, I\u0027d either swap the lateral engines for LV-N\u0027s or change the tail bicoupler and engines for a single Mk2-\u0026gt;1.25m adaptor and a single LV-N.

Any of the engine swaps is going to require a bit of adjustment to maintain the weight balance, but that\u0027s mostly just a matter of shifting the lateral tanks a bit forwards or back on the main fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of rigidity in docking ports makes modular engines tricky unless they\u0027re low-thrust. LV-N/909s are okay, but if you then swap out to a high-thrust option it\u0027ll probably wobble all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why the modular bits on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImpatienze\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E are just unpowered trailers: the only thrust on that ship (the lateral RAPIERs) acts to pull the docked sections straight rather than pushing them crooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is, it can easily reach orbit with tanks better than half full, and the demonstration science probes and \u003Cem\u003EFine Print\u003C/em\u003E satellites that I stuck in the cargo bay each have a few thousand m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV of their own. It can launch those satellites from LKO into pretty much any position in the Kerbin system (i.e. Kerbin/Mun/Minmus) without even visiting your space station.
