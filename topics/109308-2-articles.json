Do not bother with a refueling system within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ore is no different.\n\u003E It boils down to several things. First, there\u0027s the sheer time and hassle of it all compared to just launching what you need to start with. But on the fuel side, it\u0027s also cheaper to do that, too. This is because the heavier a ship, the more fuel it needs to generate a given amount of dV. Thus, moving large quantities of fuel (and thus a heavy ship) consumes more fuel than you save save by putting the remainder into another ship.\n\nI don\u0027t quite get it. My refinery/lander/tanker combo requires about 20-25% of it\u0027s capacity for itself, granted. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to attach a monetary cost to that overhead. I get free fuel in LKO and can SSTO many vessels which otherwise couldn\u0027t.\n\nThere is the hassle, of course, which is a more valid argument IMO. But for a one-time investment, I can get infinite fuel in LKO. How shall that not be worthwhile?"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:12:29Z","Content":"![Nvv68ui.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Nvv68ui.jpg)\n\n![cbf99e4b48.jpg](http://puu.sh/hMji7/cbf99e4b48.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:32:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Coming back from Minmus surface and rendezvousing in LKO with the fuel depot can takes anything from 500-1000m/s depending on how well you aerobrake (and more if you don\u0027t aerobrake), but this time the ferry is heavy with fuel so the amount of fuel consumed is actually rather greater than what it needed for the outward trip even with dV on the low end of that scale. Plus whatever mono the tanker uses during docking. On top of this, unless you\u0027re adept at launching straight to a rendezvous, whatever comes up from Kerbin will have to spend about 300m/s on top of its launch cost to rendezvous with the station (plus mono for docking) to use any of the fuel from Minmus.\n\nWell *there\u0027s* your problem -- you should have your fuel depot out at Minmus. Just launch or construct your interplanetary vessels with only 800 to 1km/s delta-v on board for the trip to the Minmus gas station, either dock with the depot itself or an intermediary tanker depending on your style, load up on what you need, abuse Minmus or the Mun for a free inclination change and/or gravity slingshot to make up for the lost near-kerbin Oberth effect, and enjoy the savings in lifter cost and amusingly short transfer burn times for the low low price of a more interesting mission profile plus upkeep of the fuel depot and mining operation, no silly dragging of a heavy tanker up and down Kerbin\u0027s gravity well required. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:50:52Z","Content":"I have combined mining and refinery ship.

I\u0027ve done it once or twice, but for me it\u0027s harder than an orbital rendez-vous.\n\nIt is in Minmus since the gravity is so low.\n\nMake sure you set one of the grounded ships as target for the ship that is landing and put the navball in Target mode on final approach. From there it\u0027s a bit like a docking manoeuvre with just a few extra details (for example, when your target retrogade marker is exactly at the north pole of the navball, that means you\u0027re right on top of it). You can even try and dock with a grounded ship from above by setting your landing ship\u0027s just a touch below the speed that would keep it hoovering and then using RCS for final approach (though this is still harder than docking in space).\n\nAlso, as somebody else pointed out, while deorbiting, remember that the planet will rotate for the 5-10 minutes that it will take to reach ground level, so don\u0027t aim your trajectory to intercept the ground exactly where you intend to land but rather a bit East from it."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T16:35:39Z","Content":"OH OH!

I hope to launch the converter unit sometime this weekend. Also, I don\u0027t have enough power to run even one drill. The solar panels were primarily for cooling - thinking the drills will heat up the tanks which will be cooled by the panels, don\u0027t know if this is a good design yet, I\u0027m open for suggestions. I plan on launching a power until eventually with MOAR SOLAR PANELS. Also, I plan to have a truck with an orange tank shuttle between the base and a landed orbital shuttle to transfer fuel (and the truck will probably have a fuel cell to help power the base). Neither the power until nor the tanker are designed yet.\n\nSeveral funny stories.\n\nFirst, the silver tanks and Twitchy\u0027s on the top are just the drop tanks, I\u0027ll detach them eventually. But when I was landing the drilling unit the first time I had positioned the engines directly over the tanks - for symmetry. I noticed my mistake when I wasn\u0027t getting any acceleration.. and then two tanks exploded... and then the drills started overheating. That episode ended up lithobraking at about 70m/s. The current design still heats the tanks and panels but thankfully Minmus is pretty forgiving in terms of required dV so it made it down intact.\n\nSecond, the boosters that launch these assemblies have enough dV to land on their own, it\u0027s just everything would be oriented the wrong way and I wouldn\u0027t know how to uncouple the payload on the surface. So, the result right now is the mining module launch ended up lithobraking about 1000 units of liquid fuel on Minmus. Will I ever mine that much? On Minmus, maybe, maybe not. But it\u0027s for science! (this is my first surface base and I\u0027m so proud!)\n\nLastly, I originally though I\u0027d land the fuel shuttle rocket on some sort of launch pad assembly with a docking port figuring flying up to a docking port facing up is way easier than flying to a docking port facing sideways. And hey, I\u0027m a bad\\*ss pilot (in KSP - when no one\u0027s looking) so no problem... It obviously it didn\u0027t matter too much where I landed the first module. The second module landed all of 600m away from the first. I probably could have gotten closer if I wanted to but the Twitchy\u0027s were heating the tanks and I was anxious to set down. But yeah, I\u0027m disabused of the notion that I can land on top of a docking port. Actually, I\u0027m disabused of the notion I \\*want\\* to land on top of a docking port - you know I totally could if I wanted to, because I\u0027m awesome. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:24:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And from the KMin L2-analog point\n\nLangrange points are solutions to 3-body physics and KSP uses a 2-body approximation.

The central stack of the ascent stage doubles as an orbital fuel station, and can get out to Minmus with surprisingly large quantities of fuel left. The operation is simple: mining unit extracts ore and converts, auto-rover carries the fuel over to the fuel ferry, fuel ferry takes that fuel up to the fuel station in orbit. Actually filling the station would take ages and ages, but it has the capacity for it since the base launch stage that comprises it has two of the largest fuel tanks in the game for capacity.

I expect the rendezvous will be a LOT less painful than within SOI, actually. From Minmus\u0027 surface it\u0027s a straight up burn from the equator\u0027s leading and trailing orbit points. Switch navball to Orbit, aim, shoot until velocity is 243 m/s and the only thing left to do is to just wait until you see the depot for the RCS fine-maneuvering and docking.\n\nI tested the mining feature in KSP yesterday and got the first piece in place: the mining rig is dropped and working in the Flats of Minmus. It\u0027s actually already full of ore at the moment, as I need some more science to get the Docking Sr parts and build the tanker and depot:\n\n![V6ioL12.png](http://i.imgur.com/V6ioL12.png)\n\n1 experienced engineer aboard, 1800 ore capacity.

Now I\u0027ve launched the tankers an the fuel depot that sits in a L2-analog fashion relative to Kerbin and Minmus.\n\nFirst I landed a refinery-tanker ship next to the mine:\n\n![tqDTb9e.png](http://i.imgur.com/tqDTb9e.png)\n\nThe rig is on wheels and has a Klaw for universal docking with any tanker model:\n\n![28w8ctB.png](http://i.imgur.com/28w8ctB.png)\n\nIn operation: filling the tanker from the mined ore - power capacity is a little too short for operating the drills at the same time as all 4 ISRU processes, but it\u0027s OK: the fuel tank is exactly twice the sizze of the ore tank so it wouldn\u0027t make a difference.\n\n![Q81cET1.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q81cET1.png)\n\nTransit from Minmus to Depot takes upwards of 243 m/s only: any Vinf on top of Minmus\u0027 escape velocity just shortens the trip. With 40 m/s Vinf I get to the depot in 12 days. I\u0027ll then need 40 m/s to brake there. It\u0027s very simple: transit deltaV = 243\u002B2xVinf. This stays true whichever Flats of Minmus you depart from (plus or minus the sidereal boost of 9 m/s from the little green speck\u0027s rotation).\n\n![35Lsjsc.png](http://i.imgur.com/35Lsjsc.png)\n\nTo address the limitations of this Tanker and make up a complete rotation of ships back and forth between the Minmus Mine and the L2 Depot, I am to add 3 more such tankers. I\u0027ve added one bigger, dubbed the Tanker More, depicted here:\n\n![eBvdDhS.png](http://i.imgur.com/eBvdDhS.png)\n\nI\u0027m also adding Cislunar Tankers, which are very simple fuel tugs which will bring fuel from the L2 Depot to LKO via a cheap aerocapture. You can see Tanker More refilling from one such, here.\n\n![D9knvVW.png](http://i.imgur.com/D9knvVW.png)\n\nYup, hauling fuel from Kerbin would cost 3600 m/s, whereas mining and refining the same amount of fuel from Minmus, bringing it to L2 and then dropping it into LKO costs about 500-600 m/s ! The \u0022Develop Cislunar Next\u0022 advocacy group\u0027s initiative is hereby vindicated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe Tanker More towed its empty Cislunar Tanker back to the L2 Depot and store the remaining fuels:\n\n![23ZHiCb.png](http://i.imgur.com/23ZHiCb.png)\n\nI then sent the Tanker More to Minmus for a bigger load. This time I aimed a little higher (45 degrees normal-ward from retrograde) and got a 9 day transit for a Vinf of 48 m/s:\n\n![tA0x2jS.png](http://i.imgur.com/tA0x2jS.png)\n\nTransit from Depot to Minmus is cheaper since some of the initial Vinf counts as braking push against the 243 m/s escape velocity of Minmus. So the rotation is even slightly cheaper than I anticipated.\n\nTanker More landed at the mine and the rig latched onto one of its \u0022feet\u0022. With this bigger design I can run all ISRU processes and all 4 drills at once:\n\n![Gn3yPdD.png](http://i.imgur.com/Gn3yPdD.png)\n\nAll in all I\u0027m very satified with this setup ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I can now between 2 and 3 orange-tankfull-worth of fuel in LKO or Minmus-like orbit every 3 ingame weeks, approximately, without any extra launch.

I might not even need to have a full 4-tanker rotation."},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T20:27:36Z","Content":"Hmm, I see some similarities to my mining setup:\n\n![7Zul1tW.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Zul1tW.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Khazar","CreatedById":138578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:56:23Z","Content":"This is what I have made recently. \n\n![WgQzpx8.png](http://i.imgur.com/WgQzpx8.png)\n\n![Daw1abg.png](http://i.imgur.com/Daw1abg.png)\n\n![kJnHXZo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kJnHXZo.jpg)\n\nIts orbiting mun at the moment, I want to see If I will be able to land it on Mun, then I will go for minmus.

I departed the wrong way though, and it ended up going outwards from the orbit of Minmus instead of inwards, so I wasted about 25 m/s and a day\u002Bhalf correcting this. I did the entire transit burn off RCS and got intercept in 10 days using about 60% of the gas. So I\u0027ll need slightly longer transits if I want to make the return trip off RCS purely. Also on next refueling trip with the Tanker Less I\u0027ll test a more direct burn, now that I know where to aim the ship at from the surface. That should shave (err, amputate, rather) several days off the transit and save fuel.\n\nI launched Cislunar Tanker Gamma to LKO, and since I now have a working reusable LKOBus to ferry to and from Kerbin ground, I also plan to add a Cislunar Tanker Delta (with extra crew quarters) for those LKO-MinKL2 crew rotations.\n\nFinally, Cislunar Tanker Alpha sitting at the Depot is refueled, and ready for its return to LKO. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027ll cost less than 200 m/s total: 165 m/s for catching an intercept with half of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and some spare change for recircularization. I might have to use several aerobraking passes, but I\u0027m pretty confident I can stick to my 600 m/s deltaV objective for the entire fuel hauling circuit.\n\nWit this, I have nearly everything I need now to start building a complete interplanetary infrastructure.
