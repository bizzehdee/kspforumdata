Do not bother with a refueling system within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ore is no different.\u003Cp\u003EIt boils down to several things. First, there\u0027s the sheer time and hassle of it all compared to just launching what you need to start with. But on the fuel side, it\u0027s also cheaper to do that, too. This is because the heavier a ship, the more fuel it needs to generate a given amount of dV. Thus, moving large quantities of fuel (and thus a heavy ship) consumes more fuel than you save save by putting the remainder into another ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t quite get it.

Plus whatever mono the tanker uses during docking. On top of this, unless you\u0027re adept at launching straight to a rendezvous, whatever comes up from Kerbin will have to spend about 300m/s on top of its launch cost to rendezvous with the station (plus mono for docking) to use any of the fuel from Minmus. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E your problem -- you should have your fuel depot out at Minmus. Just launch or construct your interplanetary vessels with only 800 to 1km/s delta-v on board for the trip to the Minmus gas station, either dock with the depot itself or an intermediary tanker depending on your style, load up on what you need, abuse Minmus or the Mun for a free inclination change and/or gravity slingshot to make up for the lost near-kerbin Oberth effect, and enjoy the savings in lifter cost and amusingly short transfer burn times for the low low price of a more interesting mission profile plus upkeep of the fuel depot and mining operation, no silly dragging of a heavy tanker up and down Kerbin\u0027s gravity well required. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have combined mining and refinery ship.

I hope to launch the converter unit sometime this weekend. Also, I don\u0027t have enough power to run even one drill. The solar panels were primarily for cooling - thinking the drills will heat up the tanks which will be cooled by the panels, don\u0027t know if this is a good design yet, I\u0027m open for suggestions. I plan on launching a power until eventually with MOAR SOLAR PANELS. Also, I plan to have a truck with an orange tank shuttle between the base and a landed orbital shuttle to transfer fuel (and the truck will probably have a fuel cell to help power the base). Neither the power until nor the tanker are designed yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral funny stories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the silver tanks and Twitchy\u0027s on the top are just the drop tanks, I\u0027ll detach them eventually. But when I was landing the drilling unit the first time I had positioned the engines directly over the tanks - for symmetry. I noticed my mistake when I wasn\u0027t getting any acceleration.. and then two tanks exploded... and then the drills started overheating. That episode ended up lithobraking at about 70m/s. The current design still heats the tanks and panels but thankfully Minmus is pretty forgiving in terms of required dV so it made it down intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the boosters that launch these assemblies have enough dV to land on their own, it\u0027s just everything would be oriented the wrong way and I wouldn\u0027t know how to uncouple the payload on the surface. So, the result right now is the mining module launch ended up lithobraking about 1000 units of liquid fuel on Minmus. Will I ever mine that much? On Minmus, maybe, maybe not. But it\u0027s for science! (this is my first surface base and I\u0027m so proud!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I originally though I\u0027d land the fuel shuttle rocket on some sort of launch pad assembly with a docking port figuring flying up to a docking port facing up is way easier than flying to a docking port facing sideways. And hey, I\u0027m a bad*ss pilot (in KSP - when no one\u0027s looking) so no problem... It obviously it didn\u0027t matter too much where I landed the first module. The second module landed all of 600m away from the first. I probably could have gotten closer if I wanted to but the Twitchy\u0027s were heating the tanks and I was anxious to set down. But yeah, I\u0027m disabused of the notion that I can land on top of a docking port. Actually, I\u0027m disabused of the notion I *want* to land on top of a docking port - you know I totally could if I wanted to, because I\u0027m awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jesrad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jesrad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd from the KMin L2-analog point\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELangrange points are solutions to 3-body physics and KSP uses a 2-body approximation.

The main mining unit has 4 drills, a converter, plenty of RTGs, and tons of solar panels. It lands at a mining hotspot and basically never moves again. Attached to it is a small automated rover with a 90/110 fuel tank, monoprop tank, and claw. The fuel ferry is basically all business: it\u0027s mostly fuel tank, with just a probe, power, engines, docking port, and landing gear out of necessity. The central stack of the ascent stage doubles as an orbital fuel station, and can get out to Minmus with surprisingly large quantities of fuel left. The operation is simple: mining unit extracts ore and converts, auto-rover carries the fuel over to the fuel ferry, fuel ferry takes that fuel up to the fuel station in orbit. Actually filling the station would take ages and ages, but it has the capacity for it since the base launch stage that comprises it has two of the largest fuel tanks in the game for capacity. Also, the lot of this is sent up in a single launch. Because I like efficiency.
