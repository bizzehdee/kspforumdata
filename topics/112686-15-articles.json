It\u0027s there to support most of the ship\u0027s critical functions.\n- T202 modules for comms, science equipment, electrical, small unpressurized storage.\n- T404 very large unpressurized storage, for large vehicle payloads.\n- Extra structural supports for thrust frames and extra payload attachments that work with T202 and T404\n- S6 and S3 pressurized modules for kerbals, fuel, etc.\n- Engines\n- Electrical generators\n\n![i4sTLHX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/i4sTLHX.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T01:35:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bonus Eventus**"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T03:12:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, Bonus Eventus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2) This is why I gave the behemoth engine cluster a high gimbal range of 8 and response speed of 8.

When I started K\u002B in 2014 I had no intention of making it publicly available. Originally, it was something I made just to deal with part counts on Mac. At the time my Mac couldn\u0027t handle mods like B9 without crashing. And being that I\u0027ve made mods for other games in the past, I just naturally started tinkering with KSP. Anyways, a friend of mine encouraged me to share it with the KSP community. I thought it could be fun to develop a project like this with lots of community input, so I made Kerbodyne Plus Alpha 0.1. At that time there was no specific goals for the project. I came up with the name Kerbodyne Plus, partly because I saw mods use plus in the title (read lazy) and I happened to set each part\u0027s manufacturer to Kerbodyne. I had no intentions at the time other than to publish it and see what happens.\n\nAs development progressed so did my ideas about what Kerbodyne Plus should be/was meant to be. I thought the mod should have some stated goals, to keep it moving forward. I also thought that the scope of the project should be well defined. I tried to be realistic as to what I could accomplish. That\u0027s how I arrived at not supporting other mods (less work) and the general goal of end game parts (open ended).\n\nFast forward to 2016. With tons of community feedback and learning more about spacecraft design, a vision started to develop. That vision, put simply, is to supply parts that help players build realistic motherships. However, to do that I would need to incorporate/support other life support mods. This conflicts with the stated goals of Kerbodyne Plus. The more I thought about this seeming problem, the more I realized that I had more problems from not incorporating these mods than the imagined work that supporting them would offer. Also, with KSP 1.1 changes to 64 bit Unity 5, performance has increased dramatically, marking a turning point with KSP, where the code is less likely to change drastically.\n\nI know this is a bit unexpected, however I think it\u0027s a logical and natural change.

Make realistic interplanetary motherships.
