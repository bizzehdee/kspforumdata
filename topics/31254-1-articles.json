Furthermore, we examined the problem that the following generations of satellites should be placed in an orbit so they would not crash again at some point, or if, in decades far ahead. Doryphoros II was, like his predecessor, easily assembled, but now already contained more instruments than it. To ensure a constant power supply, an external battery has been attached, which could be recharged by two solar panels. The orbit should be less eccentric than for Doryphoros I, but also located equatorial.
