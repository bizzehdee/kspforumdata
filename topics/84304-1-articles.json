There are a few really good youtube tutorials put together by some of the folks here, and that certainly worked for me. You\u0027ll want to export your model from Blender in one of the exportable formats (I\u0027ve had good luck with Collada/DAE, but OBJ has worked well too when for some reason the DAE file wouldn\u0027t import). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most parts, you can do the simple thing in Unity with part-tools like the tutorials explain. With engines, you\u0027ll have to add a thrustTransform that points the right way. If you want the engine to gimbal, you\u0027ll need to make the engine bell a separate mesh and make it a child of the thrustTransform object. If you want to have a discardable fairing, like the stock engines, it will also need to be a separate mesh, and get tagged with \u0022Icon_Hidden\u0022 so it doesn\u0027t appear in the VAB\u0027s menus.
