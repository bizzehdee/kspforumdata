The probe was one even with that fairing missing.\n\n![M9IsjMR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M9IsjMR.jpg)\n\nCraft file: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2877460/Small%20Orbital%20Tug.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2877460/Small%20Orbital%20Tug.craft)\n\nBuild ID: 008302015.04.26\n\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium - Version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601\n\nAbove all this, thank you so much for making one of the most addicting, fun, interesting and awesome games ever!

Was the fairing always missing? Did you save/load, or leave the ship and come back? Was this inside a fairing?\n\nThanks, and welcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"filipecabaco","CreatedById":141904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:46:52Z","Content":"Awesome!\n\nSo everything was normal, no quick saving or loading or anything in between. I launched, put it to orbit and then stage to eject the fairings and when it did that it also ejected the fairing between the shield and the decoupler (this one was added automatically)\n\nThere was no weird physics effects (noodling or anything like that), the ship behaved like it was still connected so it was purely graphical.\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nCheers"}]}
