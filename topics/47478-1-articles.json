There are reactions that produce less radiation than simple deuterium fusion, but they are all much harder to trigger and thus even less plausible for cold fusion, or even hot fusion, than deuterium. Maybe in the future we\u0027ll have reactors running the proton\u002Bb11 reaction, but right now we can\u0027t even get net energy from simple H2\u002BH2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T22:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParticle-beam fusion usually involves proton beams (unless it\u0027s an attempt to synthesise superheavy elements), which will produce X-ray radiation upon hitting a target even if no reactions occur, due to the \u0027bremmstrahlung\u0027 effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In most fusion reactions it\u0027s neutron radiation that\u0027s the issue, not gamma. The one I gave at the end of the last thread is a rather odd one, one that would be effectively impossible to do in any environment outside of the core of star, which is indeed where it happens. In terms of practical fusion reactions, the ones people tend to talk about as \u0027aneutronic fusion power\u0027 candidates are \u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003EH-\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB fusion and \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe-\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe fusion. \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe-\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe can effectively be ignored immediately due to the extreme difficulty of getting \u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003EHe in any real quantities, so most research looks at \u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003EH-\u003Csup\u003E11\u003C/sup\u003EB. However, the research hasn\u0027t come up which much good news.
