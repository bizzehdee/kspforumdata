I was expecting to spend hours of SceneChange-\u003ECrash-\u003ERestart just trying to get it to fly straight, let alone go to space. The very *first* (ok, second) booster-less test launch actually made it not only to space but most of the way to orbital speed. Even adding the boosters didn\u0027t throw the balance off. It flies very steady, only wobbling a bit when throttling, and stays well within control authority, but you can really see the engines gimballing toward the end there. As it is it\u0027s a bit overpowered for a mere 65 tonnes!\n\nAlso, [@insert_name](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/150339-insert_name/) once again you\u0027re too quick. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T05:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T15:40:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, I cannot *believe* how well this thing flies!\n\u003E \n\nMe neither.
