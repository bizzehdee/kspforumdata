According to the author it is written to be complimentary to Module Manager. The only downside I see to it is that it expects to use a full tree.cfg file and not manage changes to the tree provided as patch files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried running the last pull code from GitHub along with 0.25 and all the mods listed in the WIP thread that would still load along with 0.25.
