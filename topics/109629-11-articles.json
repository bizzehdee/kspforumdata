Turning the gimbals off and disabling the reaction wheels tends to roll problem worse, I guessing there something that is asymmetric. Primarly the A and D controls trigger this roll problem, turing off SAS makes the problem go away from my testing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when the wheels hit the ground it triggers the shuttle to go on a climb, landing at 88m/s is difficult as the shuttle generates lift when the wheels it and the lift from the shuttle itself, stall speed is around 34m/s from what I experienced. I suspect raising the drag will counteract the lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
