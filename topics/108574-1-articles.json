So I don\u0027t have a huge amount of materials. But I have the hitchhiker module and the rockomax brand adapter/decoupler. Those are the only things I have that are wide (2.5m?).

I\u0027m playing on the 550-science tiers, but still use a 1.25m rocket like that if I just need Kerbals in low orbit, or a low-orbit rescue. You can even do Mun and Minmus with only 1.25m parts, though the rockets get pretty silly looking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you have the fuel line unlocked, so google \u0022KSP asparagus staging\u0022.
