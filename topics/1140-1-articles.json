Yours is looking pretty awesome there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I would do, though: Use a larger fuel tank (since Energia is comparable in size to the STS), and use (or design if one doesn\u0027t yet exist) a 1x3m-4x2m coupler so you can attach four of your engines to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I really like the solids in your pack, but is there any way to make them liquid engines? Maybe make the solid booster three parts; one whole solid for when you want to use that, one liquid tank based on the upper portion of the solid, and one liquid engine based on its lower portion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo real reason for having you do all that work other than I LOVE throttling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now that I see what your parts were originally intended for, I think I\u0027m going to take a crack at making an Energia in Vulcan-Hercules configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ompldr.org/vOW91Mg\u0022 alt=\u0022vOW91Mg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso now that I think about it, the configuration you\u0027ve designed with the single engine is actually more correct to the Energia-M, which had two Zenits and a single engine on the core stage, rather than four Zenits and four engines on the core stage like the Energia configurations used for Polyus and Buran:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ompldr.org/vOW91NQ\u0022 alt=\u0022vOW91NQ\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-30T18:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s actually four boosters on the side, you just can\u0027t see them in the picture I gave =p\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
