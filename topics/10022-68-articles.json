A whole person being in two places at once makes absolutely no sense.\n\nI notice that my Alcubierre bubble surrounding what\u0027s left of the universe is still active, for certain values of such. Drawing once again on my multidimensional space powers, I change its alignment from linear to polar-contractile, superluminally compressing the space containing the Earth, its post-apocalyptic cities, the debris field of whatever that was that exploded in orbit a few pages ago, and everything else left over from the universe\u0027s destruction. The microcosm lingers for a few femtoseconds before it dips below the Planck limit.
