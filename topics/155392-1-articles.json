You have built monstrous craft to try and find a way to lift most of the station in one go. By the time the craft is done, it contains hundreds of parts. You launch it, and your system starts laughing uncontrollably,\u00A0 and finally manages to say \u201CYou want to go where?\u201D That is without any payload yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that describes you, then this is for you. You have proved you can do what it takes, you now just want to move on and colonize the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a single part \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E cargo hauler. It started out as a Delta Wing, I swear. Don\u0027t even ask how it ended up this shape. Any way. It attempts to be all things to all men at all times. It contains most of what you need to get to orbit. I was tired of long thin transport vehicles, so it has a large squarish cargo bay. Still on the flat side, the craft does have to be at least wingish in shape. The top opens up either as 2 gull wings, or as a whole. Some form of mod, like FS hangar Extender, which allows you to build outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E is highly recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It has a large number of attachment nodes on the back to try and satisfy almost any engine configuration you please. Yes I know near the middle, there are 4 pairs of nodes very close together, the reason is so you can either have a circle round the center engine, or the first row in line vertically like the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the bay I provided quite a few nodes as well on the front, back, sides and floor. If you have trouble using the nodes inside, I have found, that bringing the camera very close to the node, helps. This can especially be necessary when trying to detach parts once placed. The camera has to be at least inside the bay. Kerbals can enter the bay through the airlock in the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a set of nodes on the side, but they will most probably not see much use, it is merely as a reference for the one flat area on the center rim, but use it as you please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the front the nose folds down to reveal more nodes for things like sensors and folded up dish antennas. The center is large enough to fit a standard clamp-o-tron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe front space is cabin and control space, and can hold 20 Kerbals. The sides are for fuel. The built in tanks can be configured with Interstellar Fuel Switch (in fact it is required.) Mono Propellant is always available. Battery\u2019s are built in, as are Solar panels. Reaction Wheel built in, full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and some transmission capability. The plane Body is obviously also a lifting surface. At the moment there are two versions, one that has no control surfaces, the area around the engines provides lots of space to attach such. The second model has the back protrusions removed,\u00A0 and are provided as as control surfaces that can be re-attached. There is only pitch control enabled. Enabling Roll control as well tends to cause problems. Yaw control is envisioned as being attached on the side. (reference .craft file included). Bearing in mind this is a cargo hauler and not a fighter jet, the flywheel does a reasonable job of handling roll control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI decided not to build the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E into the craft, large payloads, could seriously change the center of mass, and it was better to provide separate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blisters. Also I provided rather large Air brakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI Included wheels, designed for the craft, that can carry the weight. With wheels wells, that smoothly merge with the body, and have a low profile. Two types are provided, the back ones attach to the flat surface at the back. The front ones have their angle and height designed to optimally\u00A0 attachment on the angled surface just a little\u00A0 forward from\u00A0 the flat section which should give you a reasonably level craft.\u00A0 Depending on the weight of you payload, you may have to increase the strength of the brakes in the right click menu, and even maybe play with the friction control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe top and bottom have air scoops that open and close, it is just cosmetic, the air intake is available whether they are open or closed. (have not looked at programing) The Windows have covers to close them for re-entry or retract them, once again just cosmetic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing one part only, has the draw back that you are very much at the mercy of the system to configure dry and wet Center of Mass and Center of Lift despite config settings. This is where the 3 strange blue blocks come in. They are purely for moving the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to a more appropriate point if your payload does not. For that reason I have made the craft lighter than it should be, so don\u0027t be shy add some weight if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat else? So the craft has pretty decent temperature resistance, because of the nice black coating on the underside and around the leading edge. In fact most of the values in the config files have been boosted quite a bit above the standard.\u00A0 This is a monster after all. That said, this is a Beta. I need feed back, Most chosen values are an attempt at best guess for what would be needed or is appropriate. Please be kind, this is my first attempt at any thing like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case it is not monster enough, all the config files have tweak scale statements included, so if you have tweak scale installed, you can scale it up to 400%. It wont fit on the runway, but have at it any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo ITS yet, I have made the cabin, but that is it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lc1q350.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETop View\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FC9Iwtv.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBack View\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OO8iHKF.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESide View\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/QkwKd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMore Images on Imgur\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spacedock.info/mod/1173/Flying%20Wing%20Cargo%20Hauler?noedit=True\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload from Spacedock\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/flying-wing-cargo-hauler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload from CurseForge\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso available on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***********************************\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have recently added support for TAC life support.

Yes they do alter the points as needed, but if for instance you ad additional fuel tanks, the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and the wet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E starts separating rather drastically and trying to rectify it in the config, makes the craft un-usable without additional fuel tanks. I spent a lot of time trying to come up with good average values, more time than the average person is going to spend trying to solve it. In the end I decided for the craft to be as versatile as possible, there just had to be a simple user mechanism for manipulating the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. I pondered the problem for a long time, and experimented for days. In the real use situation, you are going to lose a lot of weight in used fuel, and most of the weight in cargo before you return. the craft that goes up, is nothing like the one that comes down. Also a space station for instance is not necessarily build for balance. It is going to hang in space, not fly through the air. In the past my space station design was always hampered by needing to be launch able. My whole reason for making this craft, is to no longer have to worry about such tings in my design. If i could count on my payload being sensible, i agree the config file could be made optimal. I am sure I will fiddle with the values again in the future, but for now this will work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually I did not even see CoP in any of the config files I used to try and piece this mess together. Obviously this is worth trying out. The one thing that was clear very quickly, is that Squad did not want one to know how to make mods. They provide all the parameters that you could ever want, but no idea what they are or what they really do. Trying to piece it together from small hints here and there is no joke. Most is gleaned form guesswork of others, or their hard earned experience, and then the information is often contradictory. Don\u0027t even talk about different game versions. This mod is actually far from perfect. I hate having to put something like this up for use.

As the craft is now, the wet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty well placed when empty of cargo. Unfortunately the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is quite far back and can not be moved indipendant of the wet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E in the config file. This will make the craft un-flyable upon reentry when all the flue is burned. Using the config file to move the wet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E to align with the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E wil place the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E almost inside the engines, this is not a good situation. The only way to move the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward, is to increase the mass of the craft. by the time it coincides with the current wet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, the craft is far to heavy when empty of cargo. Pretty much moving the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward is accomplished by making the fuel weight insignificant compared to the craft weight. Not good either. As there is no actual tanks in the craft for fuel, there is no way of controlling its location or effect. KSP must assume the whole craft is a fuel tank. So in the end the mass distribution will depend on the payload, as it should be. How ever then your design of the payload will suffer. In the end the best way i could think to handle this, is make the craft light and provide small objects with significant weight that can just be placed to balance it all after the fact. Usually in my previous crafts, at-least i could move the wings to control the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E.

For \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP or RL to be worth it at all, you really do need dual mode engines.
