When I upgraded to Win7 recently, I could run KSP and your Soviet Pack again. Much earlier in this thread (click my user name to see) I was getting fatal crashes trying to use the Soviet Pack even with nothing else installed, even trying to load the game. That\u0027s not to say that some of the suggested solutions here aren\u0027t worthy, and optimization is always good! But for me WinXP was the major hurdle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever! I still have a few little problems... The included complete Mir craft file is good, as is the sub-assemblies for the rockets and some of the payloads. But there\u0027s still no completed Klipper craft file unfortunately. Also I just \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E get Mechjeb to complete a rendezvous with the Buran; it plots the course correctly but on the last .5 m/s thrust it moves the target pip again, and the Buran starts spinning to try and track a new course. Once it finds the new course, it loses it again and spins to a different angle once more, thus never being able to start the intercept, and eventually running out of fuel. Does no one else have this problem, or if they did, how did they solve it please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T06:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed the American/Soviet pack has tinted windows in IVA.
