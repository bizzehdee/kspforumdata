This is good advice for this situation. The little RCS on your kerbal\u0027s suit is actually quite formidable in low gravity. The OP has enough d/v to get a stable orbit even, making the maneuver much simpler. If the craft isn\u0027t very heavy, then it could potentially be enough to tip the scales for a Kerbin return without a refill... making it not very cheat-like at all!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
