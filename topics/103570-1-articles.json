You\u0027re referring to reaction wheel strength. Squad tried to clean up their broken nomenclature but they missed some things. In actual aerospace terminology, \u0022SAS\u0022 is a stability augmentation system, or basically an autopilot, which operates existing attitude control devices (control surfaces, RCS thrusters, etc). It cannot produce any torque on it\u0027s own without those devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that your much larger ship will have a bigger moment of inertia if it\u0027s of a larger size, which may have something to do with the issue. Plus Queso\u0027s note about lag..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(in stock play, it\u0027s rare for me to even use a single reaction wheel, the pod ones usually generate plenty of torque for upwards of 20-30 tons)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
