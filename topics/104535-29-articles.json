I know some of it is my own fault as in the early days i wasn\u0027t too bothered  about transform rotations and this has bitten me more than once, but I\u0027m fairly convinced something else is going on also.\n\nAny advice would be great,                                                                                                                                                                                        Also is that tutorial from 2014 still relevant with the current development of the awesome plugin? as that is the tutorial i followed to make the originals way back then ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T02:08:54Z","Content":"Hi Spanner!
