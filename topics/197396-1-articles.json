Vanilla or modded, my controller has only ever had issues related to itself and linux(typical for the device).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Im trying our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/Principia for the first time. After some effort with getting the dependencies for my system, the mods are all running properly. The game plays fine and with minimal n-body induced lag no less!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the steam controller configuration no longer has multiple layers/tabs, and I cant seem\u00A0to access any community configuration or my old saved one. The official recommended one is non-existent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I have narrowed it down to an issue with the steamworks API. Since I cant seem to follow either the steam sdk manual or the ksp api doc to figure it out, so I was hoping someone out there either had this problem too, or could point me in the right direction to look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy instincts say that I either deleted a folder squad used for this when I was pruning ones I didn\u0027t recognize from gamedata(But my perusal of the docs didn\u0027t mention its code being there), or something about Principia interferes with steamworks for some reason(Its the only mod that I used that wasn\u0027t available via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E and was therefore installed manually). Although given the scope of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, any number of mods could be interfering if that is the type of problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is certainly a chance this isn\u0027t a ksp issue at all. If I had a nickle for every steam controller issue ive fixed that was a linux edge case that only affects my dumb custom setups, I would have like, a few bucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm really just hoping someone out there can help explain how ksp uses the steamwork api or can point me to a better resource than my own google-fu can. Im pretty sure I can figure this out after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
