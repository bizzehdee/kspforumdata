Knowing it makes the development process a lot easier too, because if you\u0027re trying to import the part in at a certain scale, you\u0027ll be doing imports and exports dozens of times. Its a trial-and-error process and if you\u0027re going to depend on other people for that job, it will slow down the development of your mod immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T03:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the rocket look like it has a car engine on it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DURANDCREATIONS","CreatedById":107070,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T07:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause i used parts of a car engine in the texture for the rocket engine, these are just stand in texture currently\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DURANDCREATIONS","CreatedById":107070,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T06:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinalized textures are being converted currently\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T10:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo.... will this come with a plug-in to set a specific target?
