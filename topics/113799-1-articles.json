I\u0027ve been trying to update the game and from what I\u0027ve read the devs have said that the update is available through steam, gog, and their website, however as I\u0027ve bought it through gog I\u0027ve been trying to update through them. The issue is that I don\u0027t see a 1.0.3 patch on the gog website, only the 1.0.2 patch. Is anyone else having this issue? Is there some other way to patch the game? I\u0027ve tried updating via the launcher but from what I\u0027ve read that hasn\u0027t worked in a while either. Any help would be appreciated!

I also use Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGog tends to be a little slower with updates and it\u0027s not unusual for patches to arrive a day or two after release. This is partly because Gog doesn\u0027t have the resources of Valve and partly because they provide update packages. Not sure if this is the case for KSP but normal practise is to see an updated installer for the full game and a separate patch to avoid having to download and install the entire game. Gog Galaxy (Gog\u0027s new Steam-like client) should automatically update the game much like Steam would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upside is that with Gog it\u0027s possible to install separate versions of KSP to separate folders and keep multiple versions running or play an outdated version. Something Steam normally prevents because the client insists on only allowing the updated game to start. Don\u0027t get me wrong, i like Steam a lot but this is one of the few things that can really get in the way of enjoying the game, latest version or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGog Galaxy is supposed to introduce a rollback feature and allow the user more control over which version to install. You can still use Gog\u0027s installers even if you let Galaxy manage the game and it\u0027s updates. Also handy for downloading patches/games on one machine then installing on another where there\u0027s no internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo slow updates = bad, but more control = good.
