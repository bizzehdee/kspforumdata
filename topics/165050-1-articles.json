A pilot and his futuristic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E jet are sent back to WW1 while observing a nuclear bomb test. You can read most of the story on Google Books. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://books.google.com/books?id=GzqWCrBO7XEC\u0026amp;pg=PA21\u0026amp;source=gbs_toc_r\u0026amp;cad=4#v=onepage\u0026amp;q\u0026amp;f=false\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://books.google.com/books?id=GzqWCrBO7XEC\u0026amp;pg=PA21\u0026amp;source=gbs_toc_r\u0026amp;cad=4#v=onepage\u0026amp;q\u0026amp;f=false\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe jet in the story has only nuclear warhead missiles for armament, and its targeting systems can\u0027t lock onto the mostly wood and cloth aircraft of the \u0027teens, though I bet actual missile heat sensors could lock and track internal combustion engine exhaust heat. Their warheads proximity detonators don\u0027t trigger. The pilot then resorts to literally blowing them out of the sky with supersonic shockwaves, but the jet finally gets taken down by sucking in pieces of a biplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing BDArmory and Airplanes Plus, Firespitter, or some other mod with propeller parts, dogfight a team of propeller fighters (up to the maximum BDA supports on one team VS 1) VS one jet fighter. For the prop fighters, go realistic/replica from WW1 through WW2 era or get creative like the advanced plane prototypes and limited production ones that didn\u0027t see action in WW2, or planes like in \u0022The Sky Crawlers\u0022 anime movie or the \u0022Crimson Skies\u0022 video game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a challenge, just something to try for fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
