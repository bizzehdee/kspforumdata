Close the fairing on the upper stage, creating an interstage fairing. Try to decouple the upper stage and fire the engine. The engine will not activate, and it displays the error above. \n\nThis is obviously a problem, because it makes interstage fairings useless. An example of such an interstage is the one between the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T20:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:52:51Z","Content":"Try adding a decoupler between the fairing base and your engine."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:26:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try adding a decoupler between the fairing base and your engine.\n\nThere is a decoupler between the fairing base and the engine.

Engines should not be disabled while inside. Unable to produce thrust *if occluded*, yes. It worked that way with the old cargobays.
