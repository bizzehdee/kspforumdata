However infernal robotics is too buggy in my opinion at the moment to allow that. If you attach IR part to docking port or decoupler/separator it causes bad stuff upon separation (warped parts, no gravity, disappearing stuff etc.). It happen even if you put an intermediate part between separator and IR part :/\n\nYou would be able to test this upon next release of MFS with IR rotators and rails. Maybe if the stork legs part is treated as one-off delivery and disposable maybe there could be IR parts attached to it so bugs won\u0027t affect dropped vehicle but the legs themselves.\n\nPS.
