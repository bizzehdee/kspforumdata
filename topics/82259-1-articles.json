As that happens you\u0027ll fall more and more steeply towards the surface - keep turning your rocket so that it is always facing retrograde. Eventually you\u0027ll be falling almost straight down and your engines will, therefore, be firing almost straight up.

Delve into it\u0027s configuration and you\u0027ll find, under surface, two indicators which aren\u0027t shown by default: time for impact and, more importantly, \u0022Suicide burn\u0022. Load them up in the surface window or any other window of your choosing.

You may also lower your Ap. When your orbit is roughly near the place you want to land, create a maneuver node and pull the retrograde until you\u0027re falling vertically. What this will do is to kill your horizontal velocity, or at least, most of it. This not only lets your pinpoint your landing, it also saves fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep Mechjeb or KER\u0027s surface window on sight. You\u0027ll have \u0022time to impact\u0022 (important), \u0022horizontal speed\u0022 and \u0022vertical speed\u0022. Needlessly to say, horizontal speed is the speed you\u0027re moving across the ground below while vertical speed is the speed you\u0027re falling, or climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should kill your horizontal velocity so you don\u0027t tumble when you land. To do so, switch your navball to surface, point towards the retrograde vector and burn until your H/S is below 2 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow Mechjeb\u0027s \u0022suicide burn\u0022 indicator becomes useful. This indicator will tell you how much time you have left to burn full throttle upwards so you hit the ground at 0 m/s. It\u0027s only accurate if your horizontal speed is zero. If it\u0027s negative, you\u0027ll crash and your only chance is to augment your throttle with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it takes time for the throttle to go from zero to full, you should wait until the suicide burn is around 5 seconds, and fire full throttle while you\u0027re aiming straight into the sky (at the center of your navball). Once your vertical velocity is below 10 m/s, or less if you feel like, cut your throttle and continue falling. Your V/S and your suicide burn indicators will increase, you can rinse and repeat. Typically, you can land fine with speeds below 10 m/s unless you\u0027re landing on your engines. Some rover wheels can resist speeds of 50 m/s (the tires will break) but you will probably rebound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust in case, once you\u0027re about to land retract any solar panel and activate your RCS. If you aren\u0027t landing on a perfectly flat surface, your ship will likely tumble to a side. Use your RCS to keep it centered. Don\u0027t use the camera view to check in which direction you need to rotate (ie, press the WASDQE keys), use your navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also train your landings at Minmus rather than the Mun. It takes more DV to reach it, but landings are far easier due the lower gravity and the easier terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and about mechjeb, Neil Amstrong and Buzz Aldrin didn\u0027t descend by floating a camera nearby and eyeballing their speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T01:19:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by juanml82\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T01:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fireproof\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fireproof\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei can do the orbit just not the landing lol\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a few quick lander building tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Build wide, not tall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Economise. Don\u0027t make it too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You don\u0027t need a lot of thrust. A single LV-909 is plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use plenty of lander legs or you\u0027ll tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Make sure that your legs are mounted low enough that your engine doesn\u0027t hit the ground on a hard landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The highest mountain on the Mun is about 8,000m. Bring your orbit at least this low before starting your descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* RCS translation controls are very handy for killing horizontal velocity while remaining upright. Try to get your horizontal velocity close to zero as soon as possible. Use the main thruster pointing retrograde to start with, but finish off with translation RCS. You can come in at an angle once you get good at it, but I wouldn\u0027t recommend it when you\u0027re starting out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Downwards pointing spotlights are good for giving visual cues as to altitude (it worked for the Dambusters in WWII...). So is watching for your shadow. Position your camera so you\u0027re looking away from Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Give your RCS a few test puffs on the way down to make sure that you\u0027re facing the way you think you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Remember that the altitude readout at top of screen is height above sea level, not height above ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Try not to waste too much fuel stopping vertical velocity until you\u0027re within 1,000m of the surface; you\u0027ll end up having to do it twice due to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Make your touchdown speed as close to zero as possible, but be careful not to start going up again. Very fine throttle adjustments are important. Using the N button for downwards RCS can help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Try to pick a relatively flat landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Lower your landing gear early so you don\u0027t forget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Keep the RCS and SAS on until you\u0027re sure you won\u0027t tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you do tip over, don\u0027t give up.
