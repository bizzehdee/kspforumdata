If you want to sink faster, omit this stage, but be aware that your rate of sink may be difficult to counter if the bottom suddenly looms large beneath you. Reducing the amount of negative buoyancy makes the craft easier to manoeuvre in the vertical plane just using the normal flight controls\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://www.88qv.com/KSP/ub5.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSwitching the external lights on will help you to determine when you are getting close to the bottom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://www.88qv.com/KSP/ub6.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Additional notes[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nReturning to the surface is best done in a controlled manner, just by \u0026#39;flying\u0026#39; up. In emergencies, press action group keys 1 and 3 to introduce positive buoyancy in the fore and aft ballast tanks, but be aware that UB-40 in this configuration is likely to breach the surface at excessive speed, briefly becoming airborne and possibly resulting in damage as it smacks back down in to the water.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce back on the surface, use action group keys 1 and 3 to maintain positive buoyancy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttitude trim whilst underwater can be done by transferring ore between the fore and aft ore tanks.

Actually, that is true, but it\u0026#39;s not how this boat works. If you dump ore you come back to the surface but are then unable to submerge again. The action group keys for diving are linked to the cargo bays, which become negatively buoyant when closed. No idea why.
