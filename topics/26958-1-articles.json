I\u0027m curious, which altitude around kerbin is more or less the ideal for docking procedures? Too low, and docking is difficult because of how quickly the ships move around the planet but too far up means that getting the ship that requires refueling to the station limits the design of that craft. So great Rocketeers, what are your experiences with this issue, and the altitude you\u0027re most comfortable with?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gniuz","CreatedById":57846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T12:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI go for around the 100Km mark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T12:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lower the better because you generally fuel up if you want go to somewhere far afterwards, and going far is best done while starting out in very low orbits due to Oberth effect.

For your convenience, a major consideration is that you need to be above 120 km to enable 100x time warp (although that can be circumvented by switching to another vessel). For maximizing efficiency, lower is better. With practice, docking at any altitude is easy so that shouldn\u0027t be an issue long term. Back when I was first learning docking I put things over 200 km, but now I put any Kerbin-based refueling craft at 75 to 80 km. That said, I haven\u0027t done much LKO refueling since I installed the Kethane mod.

Your two ships are parked nose to nose, 50m apart. A quarter of an orbit later, the one out front is now pointed straight down at the planet, while the one in back is pointed straight up at the stars.

So, if you\u0027re orbiting to the east (heading 090), turn your craft to face north and south.
