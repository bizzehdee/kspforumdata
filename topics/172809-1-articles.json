I love simulating the space program, but don\u0027t necessarily want to be a literal joystick pilot. MechJeb allows me to enjoy space and leave the flying to a computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I thought I had a problem with the Maneuver Planner, specifically with the Hohmann\u00A0Transfer feature.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring a Mun mission, I would launch into Kerbin orbit, do CSM separation, turnaround, and dock with the LEM/3rd stage of rocket. Since the 3rd stage still had some fuel, I wanted to keep it and use it for the lunar injection (Hohmann Transfer). But when executing the transfer node, the rocket would turn to retrograde, fire a short burst, spin around to pro-grade, then spin again to retrograde and fire another burst, continuing the cycle until I dropped back down into the atmosphere. I clicked on the CSM and told it to \u0027control from here\u0027, but to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter consulting the flight path diagram of an historical Apollo lunar flight, I realized my error. I had to start the Hohmann transfer with the rocket with 3rd stage and CSM/LEM intact, THEN do the separation, turnaround and docking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I am curious. Why can\u0027t the Maneuver Planner correctly execute the Hohmann Transfer with the CSM turned around and docked with the LEM/3rd stage? Is it because Mechjeb is confused on which end of the rocket is in control? Because now you have a stack with an engine at both ends, one pro-grade, the other retrograde? Even though only one engine is active, the one pushing the 3rd stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease advise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

I used Mechjeb, but find I have to overestimate for \u0022fine tune closest approach to target\u0022. I used 100km to Mun orbit and it gives me a periapsis of around 30-50km. On return flight to Kerbin, i gave it a fine tune value of 200k to get a periapsis of 80-90km. Any thoughts on this?
