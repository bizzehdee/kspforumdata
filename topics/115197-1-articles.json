So I\u0027ll post them up and invite others to do the same, to see if we can form some sort of consensus that Squad might find useful in tweaking the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I won\u0027t discuss the costs MOST stuff (building upgrades, part entry costs, etc.) or the difficulty sliders for rewards/penalties. Those are things that are matters of personal taste and can be tweaked in many ways. I\u0027m more interested in the underlying mechanics of the system as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Kerbal Recruiting/Hiring, Classes, Skills, and Experience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Squad claims to be doing some work along these lines for 1.1 and that thought scares me. I really do NOT like anything at all about the current class system and what little I\u0027ve heard about what Squad\u0027s got in mind make me expect it will make what I consider an inherently flawed system and make it wose. I would prefer to see it totally scrapped and replaced with something \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EI think\u003C/span\u003E would be a lot better. I wrote up my ideas in detail \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122533-Improving-Kerbal-Classes-Experience-and-Recruitment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ein this thread\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut regardless of all that, what I would really like most of all is for the game (and mods) to NOT reference class names (i.e., pilot, engineer, scientist) but instead reference the skill name (repair, science, SAS for now, whatever new skills come along later as well). It is possible at present to create your own classes of Kerbals with multiple skills, or give all skills to the existing 3 classes. But because most functions look at the class name, this does little good. Sure, you can make it so every Kerbal can fix rover wheels but a \u0022pilot\u0022 with science and repair skills can\u0027t reset Goo experiments or build stuff with KIS because he\u0027s a \u0022pilot\u0022, not a \u0022scientist\u0022 or \u0022engineer\u0022. I find this quite annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, no matter how the rest of Kerbal systems end up, the whole way of recruiting Kerbals needs to be redone. The hiring cost is just ridiculous (soon approaching the price of a Jool mothership), for which you get a totally unskilled Kerbal. Even worse, you have no control over the class and stats of the applicants, which is bothersome if you need an engineer but none have applied, and this is exacerbated by the inability to dismiss applicants you don\u0027t want so that better ones might show up later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have to pay for Kerbals, then I want control over the applicants. I should be able to dismiss unsuitable candidates without penalty, same as with contracts. I should be able to hang up a sign saying \u0022Now hiring engineers\u0022 and have only engineer candidates appear. And 0-star Kerbals should always be dirt cheap---I should only have to shell out vast sums for Kerbals that already have several stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Tech Tree\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has gotten even sillier since 1.0, largely because all the parts you need to make a rocket of a certain size have been dispersed hither and yon. This takes away the freedom to pursue specific paths concentrating on certain things at the expense of others. Now you\u0027re forced into a \u0022broad front\u0022 strategy of having to get all (or most) nodes on the same teir before moving on, simply because 1 key part is on a node with a bunch of stuff you don\u0027t care about at the moment. The result is more grindiness because you\u0027ve increased the number of nodes needed per rocket size. So I\u0027dd rearrange some of this so that rocket stuff (like fairings and heatshields) are with other rocket stuff, airplane stuff is with airplane stuff, and rover stuff is with rover stuff (and closer to the front, too---see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also change the starter set of parts and what\u0027s available on the 1st few nodes. Instead of starting with goo, I\u0027d start with thermometers and barometers (which go back to the 1700s, way before rocketry). You\u0027d also start with the ability to make simple rovers (cars also predate rockets) so you could get the KSC biomes early on when they actually mean something, without needing a silly jet-propelled wingless airplane to do them. Next few nodes would let you make very simple airplanes for the survey contracts in the vicinity of KSC (planes also predate spacecraft). Only after this wold you get the ability to build rockets and the tree would fork at this point into rocket and more advanced airplane branches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Contracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese definitely need a pass that makes them fit in better with what the player\u0027s capabilities are at the moment, how much is a fitting reward, and not spamming low-ball contracts once the player has moved on to bigger and better things. Also, having some use for the stations and bases would be nice. There are a number of good examples of contract pack mods that address these issues so I won\u0027t go too much into details there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big thing to me, however, is the way 1.0 took most of the science out of contracts. OT1H, I can see this as the player needing to do business-stuff (tourism, launch services) for money to fund his own research program, but OTOH this turns doing the tech tree into a \u0022scavenger hunt\u0022 for part blueprints hidden on Mun. Seriously, what\u0027s the connection between observing Goo on Mun and learning how to build a bigger rocket? To me, it seems you learn just as much about rockets by moving tourists and launching satellites as you do carrying a Goo container to Mun, so why not get fairly significant science rewards for such chores? Or at least make that an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Mobile Processing Lab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to 1.0, the MPL was a very useful thing because it alone had the ability to reset experiments like Goo. Combined with its unique ability to hold multiple copies of the same experiment from the same place, and you had a key part of a major science-pillaging expedition. You could put an MPL in orbit with a bunch of fuel and have it refuel and reset a lander that hit all the biomes. Then bring the MPL home with a clean sweep of all the science in each biome (thanks to multiple copies). This was an expensive, complicated, time-consuming mission, but the rewards were worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, however, any 0-star scientist Kerbal can reset experiments on EVA, so all you need to pillage an entire moon is 1 lander with a scientist and enough fuel to hit some number of biomes and return. You don\u0027t get quite all the science this way due to the lander pod\u0027s inability to hold multiple copies, but this is made up for in cheapness and simplicity. No docking required. No huge lifter needed for the MPL and all the fuel. Less fuel required because you can go from biome to biome without returning to the MPL in between. No need to land the MPL back on Kerbin. As a result, the MPL is largely useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the MPL now has the ability to create extra science. However, just a single Minmus surface sample is all it can handle at 1 time, and with a 1- or 2-star scientist aboard (the best you can get within Kerbin\u0027s SOI), it will take about a year of gametime to convert that into science. That\u0027s ridiculously slow compared to the speed with which you can get way more science just picking it up off the ground, so that by the time the MPL is finally done with it, you could well be done with the tech tree already. You\u0027ll at least miss many transfer windows waiting on it. Not to mention your best scientist is tied up for the duration, when he\u0027d probably give you more benefit buffing science returns on conventional missions, and buying a new scientist and training him up to the same level is quite expensive. Also, if you play with life support, you have to keep him fed all that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, I think the MPL is about useless in 1.x because of EVA experiment resets and also because its new feature\u0027s timescale is so far off from that of conventional science-grabbing missions to Mun and Minmus. I think either some limit needs to be imposed on EVA experiment resets or the MPL\u0027s data-to-science conversion rate needs to be dramatically increased, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T13:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats exactly what I think about the contracts.

As well as what you\u0027ve written I just wanted to highlight the following point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from the early game being difficult (due to lack of multi-Kerbal capsules), the mid-game is difficult because the Engineer can\u0027t level up enough to perform basic repairs, which your early Mun/Minmus missions are likely to require without going to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not a complete overhaul as you suggest, at the very least the experience system needs to be changed so that people can grind away in the Kerbin SOI to get enough XP for Level 3. Just like you can either grind low-value Science in Kerbin to unlock nodes, or go on a far more lucrative mission further away. However, I would argue that repeating an activity yields progressively less XP each time until eventually the payoffs are too low to bother with. Classic RPG mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXP gain should also be somewhat linked to the skills. So every Kerbal gains XP for being on a mission, but Pilots get bonus XP for piloting, Scientists for performing science, and engineers for repairing things or transferring resources when docked etc. This might be a bit difficult to implement though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would restrict the multi-classing (skilling) of Kerbals somewhat. I think Kerbals should still be primarily Pilot/Engineer/Scientiest/\u0026lt;whatever\u0026gt;, in which (set of skills) they can progress all the way to the top, but would still be able to progress somewhat in the other disciplines. Otherwise you just end up with people having Kerbals maxxed out in all skills and being able to do everything.

So instead of a \u0022historically accurate\u0022 or \u0022tech accurate\u0022 version of the tech-tree, I\u0027d prefer to see one in which the various streams are more separated, perhaps with players being able to choose very early on whether to initially go for planes or rockets.

I like the idea of more RPG elements added to Kerbal skills... but some of that can conflict with the game balance of wishing you had X, that drives you to need every one you can get. And for that, the hiring costs are irrelevant: rescue contracts are the way to go. I only hire to fill class holes in my line-up, up to 200k funds. After that, rescues are the only way to fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I think it would be cool if the MPL could level up Kerbals out in the field. I wouldn\u0027t mind a class retraining option, if it was very expensive to keep it from being an easy way out. If career got to the point where you could have everything you want with little effort, I think it would be too much like sandbox-with-contracts.

I ignored air parts for a while, skipped ahead one level to get a \u0022cool part\u0022 when I could, but it\u0027s all needed eventually. Many forum threads have rewritten the tech tree, and there\u0027s a few overhaul mods out there. I don\u0027t know if I want rover wheels earlier; the game encourages silly contraptions, I think that\u0027s part of the charm. I found things to do with the 2.5m decoupler, before I had tanks and engines to go with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. tater has written extensively about contracts along these lines. I think removing science from contracts was a necessary balance change, even though it creates the scenario of looking for blueprints on the Mun. I think it\u0027s good that the game now pushes us farther out for science... and I \u0022made that worse\u0022 for my own career game, by nerfing science rewards. Which leads neatly into:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The MPL is an awesome science supplement in the mid-game, if you\u0027re still needing science. I brought back ~1000 science from one Minimus trip, but the MPL is hardly useless. Especially if you get a little tired of biome hopping \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E One ability you may have overlooked in this writing, is running multiple MPL\u0027s.

(And no life support.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach MPL can be loaded with the same experiments. Even after you\u0027ve recovered experiments on Kerbin, (one reason to delay this) you could obtain those same reports and experiments all over again, just to load those into a new MPL.

One would be \u0022science\u0022, where early experiments on Kerbin unlock new experiments for other surfaces, and experiments done in space unlock new experiments for space. The other tree would be for tech. It should be more focused, like all the 1.25 fuel tanks being unlocked together, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree now is not really a tech tree, it\u0027s really just a way to drive mission grinding. It\u0027s more oriented toward restricting you to find crazy Rube Goldberg designs than providing any roleplay kind of effect. For instance, early on all you get is the really stubby 1.25m tank, so you have to stack a whole bunch of them -- right when you also have a 30-part limit on your rockets. By the time you have likely paid for an upgraded VAB and now have a 255-part limit, you get the bigger tanks anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You can tell skills and experience are an afterthought. I like the Elder Scrolls approach of leveling up by repeatedly doing. Kerbals should gain science experience by doing science. They should get pilot experience by piloting. They should get repair experience by going on EVA and repairing. It\u0027s silly that they get experience just by flying past the Mun, for instance, but they only get it once. A pilot gets the same experience for being in the pilot seat for 10 Mun landings versus sitting back in a Hitchhiker for one Mun landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of cross-trained Kerbals, but there should be something that differentiates them. Maybe they can all learn everything (slowly!) but some start with a base of science, others with a base of piloting, etc. And maybe for each mission you designate the role of each Kerbal -- for this mission Jeb will be the pilot and Bob will be the science specialist, so Jeb gets experience points from this mission in piloting and Bob in science. Next mission it could be the other way around. Let the player decide on his own to create specialists because it\u0027s more efficient to train up specific Kerbals for specific jobs, or decide that the flexibility of cross-training is more important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mk1 capsule has one slot, which must be tagged as a pilot for that mission. A Mk1-2 must have one Kerbal tagged as a pilot for the mission, but the other two could be tagged as either pilot or engineer or tourist. The MPL has slots only for science specialists. Etc. You could do a lot with something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Speaking of the MPL, there maybe should be a 1/2-size MPL. It would seat 1. It would be idea for being on a lander, and you would do time-based science but you would have to do it on location. It would have it\u0027s own dedicated experiments that would require it to be in place. Something like that. the current 2-person lab could be specialized for orbital use, and could further refine the science brought to it by a lander science module. It could also do specialized orbital science experiments. Goo and thermometers and such could still be added to ships that don\u0027t have a science lab, but you should get a lot less science from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf science ends up being the high score, then the end game might be to have permanent science bases running all over the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been playing with career mode a lot recently, trying to come to grips with the various changes since 1.0, and have formed some opinions.
