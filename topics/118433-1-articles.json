If I bank less than 90^, applying pitch not only turns the plane but makes it go up, so I use bottom rudder to keep the nose on the horizon, just like in a real plane. Another excellent use of yaw for planes is to sideslip in for a steep but slow descent into a short landing field between various terrain obstacles. For this, you combine yaw in 1 direction with roll in the opposite direction while applying a bit of up pitch to keep the nose more or less level. And down you come steeply without gaining speed. Again, just like a real plane. Finally, another essential use for yaw is making sure your nose is directly on the prograde marker just before the wheels hit the gound, which tends to prevent tumbling on landing. And of course if you\u0027re into aerobatics, you need gobs of yaw to do snaprolls, hammerheads, and lomcovaks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I fly with just the keyboard, no joystick, but I find that quite enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rovers, (assuming you have remapped the rover steering to other keys than WASD), you can use torque yaw in conjunction with steering to turn tighter at higher speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe natural occurrence while making a banking maneuver is to both pitch and turn. \u003Cp\u003E1.

I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use the yaw control in it manually, but I use SAS. Is it advisable to have a rudder (for SAS to use it to make flight stable), or would it be better to use a simple vertical fin without any yaw control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely prefer having my vertical stabilizers uncontrolled. If your wings aren\u0027t perfectly level, SAS will cross-control. The longer you leave it in that state, the larger the yaw input becomes. This is not only inefficient, but also unstable. Whenever you touch a control, the SAS resets and the rudder goes temporarily neutral. This causes an overcorrection in both yaw and roll. In some cases, it can throw you out of control entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you leave the rudder uncontrolled, the plane will naturally weathervane into line so long as you have sufficient tail surface and leverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T08:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIRL, yaw keeps the G-indicator in the middle. Basically, when you bank turn, you don\u0027t need to bank 90 (or close to) degrees. Theoretically, one might think so (and yes if flying a fighter jet or so), but because of earths gravity and whatnot you dont bank that much - hence yaw to keep you turning nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T09:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find yaw the bane of my planes existence under nuFAR.
