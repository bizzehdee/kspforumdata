At high speeds, like with jets, rudders are little used (and usually computer controlled to compensate adverse yaw in aileron turns)... they don\u0027t serve much unless you\u0027re under 300kts (based on what I know of flying an F-16), on the ground keeping you on the runway centerline."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:50:28Z","Content":"The natural occurrence while making a banking maneuver is to both pitch and turn. \n\n1.

It\u0027s also used a lot when lining up for a maneuver node and when docking.\n\nFor airplanes, all my planes require coordinated controls during turns. If I bank less than 90^, applying pitch not only turns the plane but makes it go up, so I use bottom rudder to keep the nose on the horizon, just like in a real plane. Another excellent use of yaw for planes is to sideslip in for a steep but slow descent into a short landing field between various terrain obstacles. For this, you combine yaw in 1 direction with roll in the opposite direction while applying a bit of up pitch to keep the nose more or less level. And down you come steeply without gaining speed. Again, just like a real plane. Finally, another essential use for yaw is making sure your nose is directly on the prograde marker just before the wheels hit the gound, which tends to prevent tumbling on landing. And of course if you\u0027re into aerobatics, you need gobs of yaw to do snaprolls, hammerheads, and lomcovaks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nNOTE: I fly with just the keyboard, no joystick, but I find that quite enough.\n\nFor rovers, (assuming you have remapped the rover steering to other keys than WASD), you can use torque yaw in conjunction with steering to turn tighter at higher speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T03:59:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The natural occurrence while making a banking maneuver is to both pitch and turn. \n\u003E 1.

If your wings aren\u0027t perfectly level, SAS will cross-control. The longer you leave it in that state, the larger the yaw input becomes. This is not only inefficient, but also unstable. Whenever you touch a control, the SAS resets and the rudder goes temporarily neutral. This causes an overcorrection in both yaw and roll. In some cases, it can throw you out of control entirely.\n\n If you leave the rudder uncontrolled, the plane will naturally weathervane into line so long as you have sufficient tail surface and leverage.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"martinborgen","CreatedById":142875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T08:59:51Z","Content":"IRL, yaw keeps the G-indicator in the middle.
