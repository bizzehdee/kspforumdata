However, I\u0027m ending up taking up a lot of screen real estate and the default behavior allows clicking through the gui to select parts of the vessel below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this click then changes the active part, at the same time as my mod is trying to edit the action groups of the active part, it then proceeds to throw a fit. (Well, it resets and the player has to try and set the same action over again from scratch.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how do I stop this click through behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried sticking a GUI.Box in the way, a GUI.Texture in the way, I poked at HighLogic.skin.window a bit and got nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I am totally stumped.

I don\u0027t know of any way during flight but KER does this during editing so you could take a look at the CheckEditorLock method in BuildEngineer.cs. Basically it calls this every time it is asked to redraw its window. It tests to see if the mouse is inside the window. If it is and the editor is not currently locked then it locks it.
