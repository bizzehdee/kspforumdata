I\u0027ll take a crack at this.. I\u0027d love to be involved in this project.\n\nNaturally, feel free to poke holes in any of the following, suggest alternatives, etc.\n\nTo start with, I did some research on Mark Watney\u0027s trek. The journey covered some 3200 km, which is slightly more than a full circumnavigation of Duna. So as to present a significant challenge and at the same time, prevent the possibility of taking too large a shortcut, it seems to me that on Duna, we should be aiming for something approaching a journey halfway around Duna.\n\nWhile the maps in the book are a useful starting point, they\u0027re fairly limited, detail-wise, so with the aid of an excellent [topographical map of Mars](http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/mola_regional_boundaries.pdf) and a fantastic [interactive map of Mars](https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/matt.d160fd9d/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWF0dCIsImEiOiJTUHZkajU0In0.oB-OGTMFtpkga8vC48HjIg#2/-16.3/-22.5) that I found online, I took a closer look at Watney\u0027s route, as described in the book. It was soon clear to me that Andy Weir must have made good use of topographical maps when planning Watney\u0027s journey. The route, as would be expected, avoids steep terrain as much as possible.\n\nNext I downloaded the [high-res 3200x1600 topographical map of Duna](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Duna_Topo_ISA_3200x1600_compressed.png) on the Wiki and marked in the approximate locations of the 3 anomalies and the icecap boundaries. The interactive Duna map at [kerbalmaps.com](http://www.kerbalmaps.com) came in handy, too.\n\nMy plan was to at least attempt to come up with a route roughly analogous to that taken by Watney. To my mind, one significant feature of the story is that the Ares 4 MAV launchsite is fairly close to the equator. This would simplify rendezvous with Hermes considerably, so I noted that down as a desirable feature to emulate. Watney\u0027s descent into Schiaparelli Crater was another feature I wanted to include, along with, of course, his round trip to Pathfinder.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that from the perspective of a long-distance rover journey, the topography of Duna is considerably more challenging than that which Mark Watney faced. In particular, finding a route which could logically include any or all of the Duna anomalies simply doesn\u0027t appear to be feasible.\n\nThe longer I looked, the more obvious it was that there was only one potential route which could be considered a rough match for Watney\u0027s journey, and also fulfilled the criteria I\u0027d decided on. As a bonus, the crater I\u0027d picked for the Ares 4 site even had only one gently sloping route into it, just like Schiaparelli. (Ok, technically, there\u0027s a second route on the opposite side, but it\u0027s less straightforward to reach.) Part of the journey is across the icecap, but I don\u0027t really see any sensible way to avoid that.\n\nMy next task is to use the rover already crafted to explore key points of the proposed route. Specifically, the Pathfinder location, the Ares 3 site, find a possible site for the buried RTG (if you decide to incorporate that part of the story), and the Ares 4 crater. I also plan to explore the feasibility of an alternative location for Pathfinder, down at the bottom end of the canyon adjacent to the proposed location. (Basically, about where the letter \u0027a\u0027 in the word \u0027Pathfinder\u0027 is, in the maps below.) If the Rover can cope with it, that would be an interesting trip, all the way down the canyon and back out.\n\nHere\u0027s the full topographical map of Duna. The 3 small red circles indicate the locations of the anomalies, and the horizontal red lines the approximate boundaries of the icecaps. Sites and potential routes for Ares 3, Pathfinder and Ares 4 are also marked.\n\n![Copy-Duna_Topo_ISA_3200x1600_compressed_zpswgqfansb.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/Copy-Duna_Topo_ISA_3200x1600_compressed_zpswgqfansb.png~original)\n\nCloseup of one proposed route (slightly more direct routes may be viable also, of course):\n\n![Proposed%20Route_zpsx0kdcqta.png~original](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/Proposed%20Route_zpsx0kdcqta.png~original)\n\nSo.. what do you think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T19:39:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T23:00:42Z","Content":"Wow, thank you for putting so much time into this.
