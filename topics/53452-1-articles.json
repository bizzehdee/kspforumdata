On Kerbin or Laythe? It seems that Laythe has 20% lower gravity than Kerbin, but atmospheric density also seems to be 20% lower. Does this mean there is actually no difference in how planes handle in both environments? I assume piloting VTOL\u0027s on Laythe may be a tad easier when in \u0027vertical\u0027 mode, due to lower gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what celestial body would require the MOST Delta-V to land from orbit, and to get into orbit again?

The advantage of Kerbin\u0027s thicker atmosphere is that you can go pretty high and still run on jets, which isn\u0027t as feasible on Laythe although it\u0027s not as necessary either. It is easier to take off from Laythe with the lower gravity, and also easier to land provided you can kill your horizontal velocity in some way without relying on the atmosphere as much as you would on Kerbin - I find it takes longer to get a safe landing on Laythe because it\u0027s slightly harder to slow down horizontally, but that doesn\u0027t necessarily make it harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVTOLs are almost certainly easier on Laythe; less gravity, less drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part is getting there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T21:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease consider carefully where you place new threads, this one was in the wrong subforum. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERule 2.4 is in effect\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread moved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
