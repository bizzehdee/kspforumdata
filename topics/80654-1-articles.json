The fuel in normal jet engines is used to heat up the incoming air (requiring oxygen to burn the fuel), producing pressure that\u0027s ejected through the nozzle (despite contrary believe it adds only little to the amount of molecules, where 1 mol is at normal pressure/temperature equal to 22.4 litres - if it wasn\u0027t for the heat it wouldn\u0027t work). There it propels a turbine which in return shoves more air into the combustion chamber, creating a self-sustaining air flow and thus thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines replace liquid fuel (kerosene) by a thermonuclear reactor core - it heats the air (to even higher temperatures than normal jet fuel, where higher temperatures and pressures propel at some point the creation of bigger molecules to reduce the amount and thus the pressure, diminishing the effectivity), the rest is the same as above. It would work in every atmospheric environment, even with noble gases (Helium would be best I guess, since there is no such thing as combination reaction even for insane temperatures/pressures). I\u0027m not entirely sure if it would work in fluids, but if you\u0027d adjust the turbines or use pumps for injection I reckon this would even work there - injecting small amounts of liquid in the core, heating that until it vaporizes and let it shoot out of a back nozzle. Only drawback would be the intense density and thus resistance/drag of a fluid compared to gases. So I guess you wouldn\u0027t be very fast, and look like having a serious flatulence problem. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-05T13:17:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2014 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by M3tal_Warrior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T13:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve looked at the wiki article for these kinds of aircraft, but I don\u0027t see it mentioning not needing air for combustion.
