\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehorrible\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for the environment.\u00A0 But it\u0027s cheap, it\u0027s plentiful, and no, we\u0027re not going to run out of it any time soon.\u00A0 The US is basically the Saudi Arabia of coal.\u00A0 The US alone has estimated recoverable reserves of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.eia.gov/coal/reserves/\u0022 rel=\u0022external

a serious global warming problem, we\u0027re going to run out, it needs to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you\u0027re talking about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epowering a vehicle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, then the answer is simple.\u00A0 You have a ground vehicle, and you power it with batteries.\u00A0 The other answer is that you use environmentally-friendly technology that doesn\u0027t waste energy.\u00A0 Replace those incandescent bulbs with LEDs.\u00A0 Make more efficient electrical appliances.\u00A0 Drive very energy-efficient cars that aren\u0027t
