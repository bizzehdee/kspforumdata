Some systems in KSP are easy to mod and are obviously set up for modding, like part modules and such. Others seem, to my untrained eyes, locked up very tight.\n\nSpecifically I\u0027m looking into intercepting method calls from stock classes and running my own methods either before or after. I believe that\u0027s what a hook is, correct? Is this possible?\n\nMore specifically, I\u0027m trying to catch the calls that turn on the resource overlays and either modify the textures or give them new textures. I\u0027m having a hard time finding a way to do this without doing some kind techno circus routine involving checking texture changes every game update.\n\nThanks in advance."}]}
