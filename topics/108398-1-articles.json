It\u0027s bound individualy to each rocket. For example:\n\nRocket x = \u002B30% yaw and -100% roll\n\nRocket y = -50% pitch\n\nRocket z = still working fine\n\nI hoped i could fix this by using my joystick but it the joystick controlls are translated relative. So if the bug steers with 40% yaw i constantly have to steer -40% yaw to make it 0.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T13:37:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by skipan**\n  \nsolved - not a bug"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:41:55Z","Content":"Try turn up the deadzone on your joystick.
