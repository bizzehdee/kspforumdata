Last week I said I was concerned about performance on some of the tests. The design concern feature is not a list of parts a vessel has and has not. It is a set of tests which analyze your vessel for possible issues you may run into. For example a big part of these tests are dealing with resource flow and will prompt when you have resource containers which are not being drained, consumers (such as engines) not getting the fuel they need, etc. And for every of these tests the parts in question are highlighted. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis means the tests have to run every time you attach and detach a part and in the case of stack resource flow the system has to check for every resource container, and then trace back from the consumers which of these containers are not being drained.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see lag issues coming out of that, especially if you have a complex system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T01:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI always understood it to be a simplification\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to me that it was more just a mistake that was carried over through multiple versions of the engine code, not any deliberate action really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T01:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid anyone really find that fun though? I\u0027m not sure if I ever heard a solid argument as to why ISP was applied to fuel consumption rather than thrust, and if anything I think it\u0027s far more fun when rockets behave differently based on the environment they are in instead of just consuming more or less fuel.
