What we need now is a couple of people to help with the storyline!

Skype is kinda required for most of the communication (text based for now but we will do group calls eventually) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe have our own forum we are doing storyboards and the like, those interested can join there as well however won\u0027t have access to the dev forum unless they are taken on as part of the team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet me just tell you this;; this is going to change how everyone plays KSP for the better, even if only half of what were up to right now makes it in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: this is going to be a full time type gig, not a 1 quest and its done thing.

As a group we pick a quest to develop then in a series of scenes and chapters we get oir character through the quest to the end location and climax.
