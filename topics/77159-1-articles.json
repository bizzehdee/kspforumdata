There are no stock boat parts and the water behaves very strangely. About the only way to do boats with stock parts is to build a hydrofoil that floats on (wait for it) I-beams, structural panels, or radial intakes. With these parts and these parts only touching the water, you can make a boat that will move. If any tank or other round thing like your lab touches the water, then you won\u0027t go anywhere even with a Mainsail pushing. But with a hydrofoil, you can zip right along with a jet engine. Maybe an ion, give that a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: the rover wheels can\u0027t touch the water either, or they\u0027ll break off if you get to any real speed. So you\u0027ll either need Infernal Robotics to hinge them up and down, or make a landing craft hydrofoil with a ramp the rover can drive up and down on. See the last 2-3 of Wookie\u0027s \u0022Rover Adventures\u0022 videos on YouTube for ideas on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, you\u0027ve gotten the boat to move. Steering it is another issue. Basically, you can\u0027t, no matter how many rudders you put on it above or below the water, unless you\u0027re hardly moving at all. Thus, driving a stock boat is a series of sprints in straight lines, followed by a long time to coast down to low speed (no brakes), then pivot in place and off on another straight leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all with just stock. There are, however, mods that make boats a lot easier. My favorite is Firespitter. Firespitter has pontoons for making seaplanes, but a seaplane with its wings sawed off is a boat. Furthermore, the pontoons have retractable wheels in them that are powered like rover wheels, so you can put a couple of these pontoons on your Mobile Lab and have something that will float easily on water and rover on land without need of extra rover wheels. The pontoons also have built-in rudders so you can steer while moving at speed, although still no brakes. You also still need some form of propulsion to move the thing on water, but Firespitter has you covered there with several electric propeller engines if you want to go all-electric. Of course, having something with pontoons, wheels, and an engine, all you now need is wings and you\u0027ve got an amphibious seaplane, which is more flexible and faster than a boat/rover. So you might as well do that instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: The Firespitter pontoons blow up if you exceed about 120m/s on the water. Also, they have a right-click menu that allows adjusting their buoyancy. I recommend maxing that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T15:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWings work for boat hulls too, since they\u0027re reasonably low drag at modest speeds. Just be careful when entering or exiting the water since that\u0027s when their fragile impact tolerance will come into play. My Laythe boat (the \u003Cem\u003EMagellan\u003C/em\u003E in my mission albums) gets up to about 20 m/s on them, with about 150 kN of thrust. It also turns well enough just on the torque of a few reaction wheels, or by shutting down a prop on one side, though it\u0027s not advisable to take turns at full speed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for propulsion, the go-to option in stock is the jets. I think they might even be \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E fuel-efficient than the ions, due to the jet engine Isp bug. For mods, Firespitter\u0027s the obvious choice with a wide choice of propellers, which seem to work equally well above or below the waterline and many can run in either forward or reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe electric propellers are power-hungry, and you can\u0027t use deployable solar panels when underway or they\u0027ll break. You could stud your boat with OX-STATs which is fine for a small ship but will spike the part count on a big one. A better option for a large boat could be to provide lots of batteries and plan on stopping for recharges. Or if you\u0027re prepared to consider more mods, I powered my boat with a nuclear reactor from Near Future Technologies. I couldn\u0027t fully deploy the radiators or they\u0027d break like the solar panels, but even with the rads in the closed position I could run the reactor high enough to power the props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn land, bear in mind an option is to use thrust for drive, and run on aircraft landing gear which won\u0027t give you any drag problems in the water. For a modded electric craft this won\u0027t use any fuel. Alternatively, for a purely stock amphibian I might consider something that rolls over, so the wheels are on one side and the floats on the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
