Or if you have the fuel you could burn at some angle between retrograde and radial that would slow your orbit but not lower your altitude. Or between prograde and anti-radial to increase your speed but not your altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no Lagrange points in KSP at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that any orbit is approximate. Your satellites will be off significantly after the time it takes to complete a Jool visit and return.

For example, if you want a geostationary satellite over KSC, but are on the exact opposite side of the world in a geostationary orbit, you could burn retrograde until your orbital period is 5 hours (instead of 6) and wait for three orbits before burning prograde to geostationary orbit again (alternatively burn 3x as long so your period is 3 hours and after a single orbit you should be pretty close) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as SnappingTurtle said, orbits will have rounding errors and drift over time, so unless you edit the save file (and never revisit those satellites again) they will drift.

Put the apoapsis exactly on the point you want the satellite to be. Then, when you reach that Ap, do a burn to circularize. You can do this from a lower orbit or a higher orbit (using the Pe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manly did a video where he set his orbit to be a 4-hour period with the AP at Kerbin Geostationary Orbit. With Kerbit rotation at a 6 hour period, each time he hit AP it was 2 hours different from the time before. This allowed him to drop 3 satellites exactly 2 hours apart, each in Geostationary orbit. It was a clever trick that required a mod to display orbital period. But the concept can easily be done without being as precise as he was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
