That\u0027s fairly clear - curly brackets mean a call to the variable, 1 means the second variable, which is CREW\\_0\\_PRESENT, \u0022:\u0022 is a string with colon, but... what\u0027s further on? I would expect one semicolon in a style of shorthand ifs: condition ? true : false but somehow here I have 3 inputs separated by semicolons?
