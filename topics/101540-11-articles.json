I\u0027ve got a set of wheels (the KF wheels, in which I implemented the original TweakScale options for, which worked fine with the same scale type setup a while back) and at least from the launch of 1.0.2 of kSP and onward I am getting not only no option to scale them, but the place where the scale would be is replaced by a blank entry. What I mean is the context menu has a blank spot in it where I believe it is trying to render the scale slider and failing. In addition to this, the log is spammed with: \u0022ItemPrefab for control type \u0027UI\\_ChooseOption\u0027 not found.\u0022 Now I did some digging of my own and \u0027UI\\_ChooseOption\u0027 is a KSPAPIExtensions thing which, when browsing that DLL, in the version specified by the references for TweakScale\u0027s DLL, the item does in fact exist. What\u0027s even more irritating is that the same scale type options for another part type (the KF repulsors) works perfectly fine. I\u0027m about ready to pull my hair out trying to fix this. Has some form of game-changing modification been done to how the scale type has to be defined in order for this mod to continue working as it has in the past?\n\nJust checked the KF wheels, everything scales fine for me."},{"CreatedByName":"fatjoe2015","CreatedById":126558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T14:07:24Z","Content":"Got it working ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nGo to \u0022GameData \u003E TweakScale \u003E ScaleExponents.cfg\n\n Search for \u0022noScaledCrewPods = 1\u0022 and change it to \u0022noScaledCrewPods = 0\u0022\n\nSave\n\nGo to \u0022GameData \u003E TweakScale \u003E patches\u0022 and create a new Textfile\n\n Paste This Code into it:\n\n    //Shooting Star Pod@PART[Super100] // Super 100 Shooting Star{    %MODULE[TweakScale]    {        type = stack        defaultScale = 3.75    }}\n\nClick \u0022Save as..\u0022 and name it \u0022RaptorAerospacial\\_TweakScale.cfg\u0022\n\nSave\n\n// It should now be freely Scaleable\n\nPic:\n\n![iUaDrLe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iUaDrLe.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T14:49:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fatjoe2015**"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:58:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Go to \u0022GameData \u003E TweakScale \u003E patches\u0022 and create a new Textfile\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Click \u0022Save as..\u0022 and name it \u0022RaptorAerospacial\\_TweakScale.cfg\u0022\n\nIt does not matter how the .cfg file is named, or where in GameData it is located.

The problem is that all custom resources in CRP are missing specific heat, which is leading to weird heating behavior causing parts heat up too fast or lose heat too fast. But once you have compensated for that, the stock heating framework seems to function quite well\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T07:55:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Scumbag","CreatedById":70411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T23:09:03Z","Content":"Hi again,\n\nI just wanted to know how the development of the Chain scaling for a whole subassembly is going?
