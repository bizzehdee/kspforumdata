I myself am not capable of even attempting this but i am calling on the great minds of others to see if this would even be possible.of course if someone where able to pull this off they would receive all the reps and cake:D"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T03:27:30Z","Content":"So basically... a rover powered by SRBs/rocket engines/ion engines?\n\nAlready being done before, when there\u0027s still no such things as stock rover wheels:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PX2bQJqC5l8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:30:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ve built them, both with mods and stock.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4DhKEznOyI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Os3ifau3N5g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nVery difficult to reduce in size at this moment.

The paddle was powered similarly to the turboprop engine somewhere around here (basically 2 jets pushing a structural panel setup, where the jets push that, which pushes axle, which transfers that thrust to a paddlewheel that then moves said boat."}]}
