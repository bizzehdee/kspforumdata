Musk simply being a trucker service is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E how the public perceives it anymore - especially since he needed a third party to build the propellant factory. Instead, SpaceX is perceived as an independent space agency that has long outmatched NASA.

There is a finite amount of flying fraks the public has to give, and one should use them more sparingly. Considering Mars colonization will still be quite dependent on political will and thus hype, someone in the post-Musk era might find that quite a few bridges have been irreversibly burnt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are profound insights here, BUT . . . . . I don\u0027t live in the world that I think should be but the one that exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhilosophically there are several implicit issues here and I will try to unmuddle them as scientifically as I can, because they deserve to be deconvoluted and discussed. We all share the same goal here, to see human-kind advance themselves and in particular advance themselves in space. Its been a long way . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhilosophically to start with when Okkam postulated his razor he had no inclination about science or the scientific method, he just wanted to curtail the use of ad-hoc arguments [\u003Cem\u003Ethis is a hat-tip to our moderator since he does not like my commonly use perjoratives\u003C/em\u003E] in theology. As western theology self-divided itself into physical sciences and pure theological arguments, science adopted the razor as a support for the scientific method (which evolved in its current form much later). The problem he was dealing with was not about reality but perception. . [if you want to seek perception you should watch the Susskind\u0027s 1st lectures Quantum Entanglement and QM (part of a 7 part series on physics \u0026lt;-free) but also Carlo Rovelli\u0027s lecture on Time, philosophically this says everything . . if you don\u0027t you wont understand much of what I say] . .\u003Cstrong\u003E the way we perceive the world and then try to explain the world in a context we already believe to be true with generally a primitive understanding of the underlying reality\u003C/strong\u003E. In that time it was a largely ethnic oral traditions.\u00A0 None the less, there were people, who in deep reflection found ways to question these \u0027truths\u0027.\u00A0 They are not questioning the traditions, first they were interrogating themselves and it is not surprising that the first questions arose from the clergy (there are much older and deeper references). Gregor Mendel is a perfect example of when given to thought comes up with profound understandings of nature. Society has shed itself largely of these prejudices we have not exactly preserved the benefits. This discussion is not about science, it effects science, yes, but it is not about physical science, science can only explain the roots of the perception error, the scale at which we perceive the universe and the way in which our brains integrate information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are so many competing senses out there . . . the question you have to ask is what should people be interested and how do you inspire their interest. At the same time you ask the question, you have to know what is dividing those interest. And these divisors are not benign, the distributors of information are very well knowledgeable on how to take advantage of peoples emotions as distributors have always been. One competing sense is that everyone ignores space altogether, this could happen. Imagine this scenario, everyone is given a free handheld device, we are all connected. In a process of displaying the right sets of images we are turned to websites that constantly ping our adrenal glands and keep us qlued into 100 so sites (none particularly having to do with space).\u00A0 The beast you are dealing with is not Musk, its the human mind, we still carry these pain/pleasure centers that evolved as we crawled out of some primordial ocean. Its exactly the same thing Okkam was dealing with not only in his colleagues\u00A0 but in his own mind. Socrates, after all was right about Athenian society, but also true, keeping his mouth shut would have kept him alive.[Coughing very loudly]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe psychological side of the proclivities argument is what qualifies as addictive behavior and what qualifies as rational behavior and also is there ever truly a completely rational set of behaviors. And again its looking more and more that we are easily prone toward addictive behaviors but also there is a commercial sector out there that is adept and keen to exploit them . . .we need an internet Okkam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this light, how do you get kids interested in space and science but even more importantly (as noted above) how do you teach them to become abstract thinkers, to think outside of their predisposed sensibilities (break the primordial umbilical cord). Science is a means of seeing irrationality, but it is not a immunization against irrational behaviors. Hundreds of other \u003Cem\u003Eadrenal pinging\u003C/em\u003E things (randomly some of them maybe space related) also have our interests. I don\u0027t know if there is a best way to revive space interest, but I do see out on the horizon that there are easy ways that can destroy space science. Alternatively, I\u00A0 see a number of small (thrill seeking?) groups trying to build their own multi-chemical rockets; this is not an amateur sport . .\u00A0 there could be harmful ways of channeling interest. Minimally some of these new-space companies should have R\u0026amp;D apprenticeships that sponsor the small discovery market so that people who are interested enough to build their own rockets have a place that they can go and learn from professionals how to safely build and test. I am not kidding, I have seen a couple of people killed in the most horrific ways from playing with explosives (one of them lost his face and a third survivor lost his foot). Their behaviors were irrational.\u00A0 Redox reactions produce large amounts of energies in very unpredictable ways. Certainly launching a steam rocket to prove the earth is flat is irrational. Again if they are doing this for You-tube hits and popularity . . . . . . . \u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E better than Space X. [Note the inequity]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there is a deeper fundamental problem, we know, physically, what the limit to chemical energy is, we also have nearly perfected efficient energy transformation into light and information (if we so desire), but the problem that we need to study is not something you can do at home. This is a problem of social complexity, the more complex a system becomes the more one needs increasingly complex solutions to add ordered complexity. We need young people who are willing to dive deeply into the fundamentals of the universe and then apply them to RL problems including space. It is my experience that most of these are not romantic or you-tube worthy. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second philosophical underlies\u003Cstrong\u003E the fade of space interest of the public sector\u003C/strong\u003E. This has been discussed ad-nausea here so I will not rehash the problem. NASAs funding relative to GDP has steadily been falling since the late 1970s, and its not just NASA its also NSF and NIH (relative to GDP since the mid 1980s). The reflex is that we have to change the cost of doing science (very expensive now-a-days because of all the certifications and regulations added) or change who and how it is funded, or more simply move science elsewhere. Systemically for the west this is problematic, because we are competing against societies where science is evolving rapidly and increasingly funded (and this maybe the solution, evolution and kin selection). Once you do something with government money there are a whole bunch of rules that come into play, largely intended for big industries are big law enforcement that are extremely inefficiently handled (or mandated and largely unfunded or defunded) at the research level. Space X can take advantage of this by moving parts of its operation out of the public sector. This is not a SpaceX problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the space problem (see below) is that we hit a thermodynamic chemical energy wall.. You need 11,300 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to leave earth orbit, and our chemical rockets have exhaust velocities\u00A0 of 4500 m/s. There are several reason this problem has stuck to us. First our sense of risk in the Post WWII period was alot lower than current risk, and the two shuttle disasters created questions about whether \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E interests were being placed before NASAs primary interest. But there are deeper problems than that, we have been resting on our laurels with regard to the entropy problem as it pertains to space. One could almost argue given the two pioneer and voyager missions, we have back-stepped (or side-stepped). Entropy makes space (us) both possible and modern space hard. To understand entropy you have to understand that pure propulsion F = 2 * power * \u003Cstrong\u003Eefficiency\u003C/strong\u003E/Ve (stating this for light N = power/3E8 m/s),. If you set Efficiency as it starts from power at the power plant down to the drive (see fine print below) we get a sense of how important management is. To be very mass efficient you need alot of net power. This makes everything harder, more risky and potentially unpopular (nuclear impulse propulsion). Some have called the propulsion problem the tyranny of the rocket equation. Ultimately it limits space travel to small fractional C and generally low acceleration. The general public does not grasp the problem as a whole. Before KSP, i didn\u0027t. It was through playing with my creations and making them as RL as possible that the problem becomes apparent. [\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ENuclear is a solution that bad entropy management thwarts; those ships overheat and waste \u0026gt;70% of their power, in that they also expose equipment and passengers, unnecessarily, to higher levels of radiation. Avoiding fusion because even if you had fusion you could not launch it into space and also land fusion on Mars (not without a retro-propulsion-fuel depots orbiting Mars). We can think about the entropy problem like this, if you can build at 10% efficiency a 1 kw reactor with a certain sized intrinsic radiator generating 100 w of power and wasting 10% on cooling\u00A0 - - - \u0026gt; 90 watts. You can build a 2 kw reactor at 55% efficiency and getting 1095 watts of power. You can build a 4 kw at 77.5% efficiency, 3 kw net electric power. At 99% efficiency you can build a 99KW reactor and get 98KW of power. Again if you are talking about efficient electric propulsion that is a starter, but what you really need is millions of KW. So that is the entropy problem in a nutshell.]\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe fundamental philosophical question of space and space science. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEntropy is about time (or vis versa) and both are about quantum gravity. The greatest enemy of long term spaceflight is the inability to manage entropy. If we do not learn about fine-scale structure of space (i.e. the quantum-classical resolution problem) then the applied fundementals will be harder, more random.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EThe sci-fi warp drive, wormholes, etc are tantamount to promotion of false understandings, in lieu of good understanding of spacetime we instead conjecture about possibilities in imagined spacetime.\u003C/strong\u003E[tip of the hat to Carlo Rovelli]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will find it more difficult to manage heat in space and interstellar may never be a thing without sustained progress in theoretical physics.\u00A0 Understanding this problem lies the potential solution to global power production, efficiency, conservation. It is the same thing with living on Mars. The limiting resource is energy, how to make it where it is needed most and how to conserve it. How do we get to this understanding, building 10 more Ligo experiments on the surface of the Earth?\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 We need better and cheaper access to space. SpaceX is an economic forcing \u003Cstrong\u003Esprite\u003C/strong\u003E. But it is current only superficially attacking the basic problem, which i defined above . . .but its better than no attack at all or the random walks we are currently in. Cannae also needs to be fully tested in space, not because of what it can do, but what it can teach us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo for the \u003Cstrong\u003Esprite \u003C/strong\u003Eto succeed in space it will have to tackle a new set of problems, one that will require it to seek expertise well outside of the physics that it is used to dealing with, so the hope is that Musk has enough knowledge of physics (I think he does) to push also those boundaries. \u003C/span\u003EEntropy is as relevant in space as it is on Mars, Ceres, Europa, whatever you chose . . . .nuclear will be close by and needs to be efficient, ideally fast breeder reactors with no waste, safe. So that it really doesn\u0027t matter where you test the systems, just as long as you are separated from the Earth\u0027s generous heat sinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Noting again the comparison] So let me point my finger at some others (Arthur) making hypey statements, because Musk is not alone, just more popular. Fusion electric power is not a thing, and even if fusion was a thing, it needs to become 3 magnitudes more net efficient at heat conversion. By the very fact we are talking about . .\u003Cem\u003E it has barely enough energy output to sustain the fusion reaction\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E . . .means that this is generations away from being a solution . And really I think we lack a clear understanding of the fundamental thermodynamics is required. If we did we might find out that its impossible or we might find it has limited utility. Who is going to push these entropy based systems to their efficiency limits . . . Boeing, ULA, Northrup-Grumman, RSA, Morton-Thiokol, Lockheed Martin, ESA, NASA, CERN . . [note all the comparisons].\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are their vested interests at seeking out more efficient power systems for space-craft and are they dutifully progressing on those interests?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly we need more motivated people working on problems and sometime it is the interloper that stirs the pot. Critique is unbounded, once you start on SpaceX it fairly diffuses outward by comparison. Case in point the discussion between Doug Ellison and Elon Musk points to two different perspectives of how space should be done. One perspective is elitist and the other one is populist, there is harm in extremes of both perspectives. Whether or not you think ULA is a good company, they do not, given their preferential contract obligations, have any profound reason to make their organization that competitively undermines itself; that only comes with the threat of increased outside competition and recognition in the public sector. Its not a pretty way to do things, but it is the way western space interests are currently compelled. In this environment competitors are known to conflate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are three areas that I have divided this problem up, but all three come back to the issue of glittering personalities and popularity how to manage them in the public space, who is really to blame?

Because we are humans and it is Mars. Once there, we will dig in and breed away. If we take as an axiom that preserving humans is a good thing, then colonising Mars is a good thing. Forget trade. Like the good old imperial days when Europeans spread out far beyond the distance they could supply, Earth will have to prop it up for a bit (perhaps it will be mostly assets owned by a corporation\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E) but\u00A0 people will become self sufficient there - by the time we are in a position to actually make a permanent settlement there they will have the capability\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say that a precursor to this statement would require testing human compatibility with Martian gravity. Radiation, life support, etc, is an engineering issue. If the gravity won\u0027t cut it, Mars is a non-starter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTether 2 habs, spin them to martian gravity, and start raising generations of mammals, and study the embryology, development, etc. That\u0027s a boundary value. If mammals and Mars don;t get along, then a \u0022backup\u0022 for humanity require orbital stations spun to some higher gravity equivalent (we know 1g works, but some other value might be OK).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others have pointed out, however, the technology required to colonize space comes with the ability to mitigate most existential risks to Earth. If we can mine asteroids, we can divert them, in short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in the long term we should avail ourselves of our \u0022cosmic endowment,\u0022 but I\u0027m unsure if Mars will ever be part of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
