Game pad and joystick is only detected when you start kerbal so waking up the controller when game is running and setting axes causes problems. \n\nAs far as I know, when you\u0027ve got self resetting settings, only thing you can do is to rename it and let ksp create a new one.

I plugged mine in with KSP booted up and tried to change the inputs. The menu froze on that screen after I changed one input. I was able to move around in other menus and go back to the main menu, but the inputs screen would freeze again when I clicked the button to assign an input. After that, everytime I started the game, it would give me the prompt about sending game data to Squad and all of my settings would be reset. However, it was fullscreen even though the settings had reset to windowed 720p. It kept doing this even after I unplugged the controller and deleted all of the bindings. \n\nThe way I had to fix it was to delete the settings config and restart the game. It seems to be saving settings now. I also remember Squad saying they were changing the way controllers were handled in one of the dev updates. Which leads me to believe it is the controller inputs causing problems, and not just changing certain settings.\n\nSo I tried again with the controller plugged in before starting KSP up and that seems to have done it properly.

Every single time I run the game it shows me the tracking window and resets most of my settings to default. The only thing it leaves alone are the keybinds, but the graphics settings are all reset to default. \n\nIf I verify the local files, it always reports that 2 files need to be downloaded. If I tell it to verify a second time it says all files are up to date, but when I run the game it\u0027s back at defaults and when I quit and re-verify it says 2 files need to be downloaded. \n\nThe annoying thing is that this is a new machine that had no trace of KSP and I let it do the full download through steam. \n\nThe more annoying thing is that when I copied the KSP directory from my old machine through the network and set steam to run it as a non-steam game, I don\u0027t have this problem. \n\nIt\u0027s only the version that supposedly installed itself properly through steam that has this issue.\n\nIt\u0027s also a completly stock unmodded copy of the game.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI deleted the local content, got rid of the directory and let steam redownload the game. Same issue. \n\nThen I tried putting the settings how I want them, tabbed back to the desktop and used notepad to open the settings.cfg file in the KSP directory. The new graphics options seemed to take so I made the .cfg read only in it\u0027s properties. It still opens the stat tracker window, but once you close that all menu options are ghosted and you can do anything except kill the program from the desktop. It doesn\u0027t like the config file to be read only.\n\nNext I deleted the directory through windows explorer. Then I copied my directory that came from my old machine, changed the name so it would match what steam was looking for and tried running it. \n\nThis seemed to fix the problem since it keeps the resolution and UI size through multiple restarts. \n\nIt seems like the issue isn\u0027t that it needs a fresh install of the game. That seems to cause the problem not fix it.\n\nI did try using a joystick on it, but the calibration was WAY off and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to calibrate it in Win 8.1 so I finally gave up on it and unplugged it. I can\u0027t find any traces of it in the windows control panel and I tried the reinstall after I\u0027d gotten rid of it. In the input settings there\u0027s no axis listed for any of the controls.\n\nMy only non-default control is that I changed precision mode from caplock to P. \n\nI don\u0027t understand why it resets the resolution and UI size and leaves my keybinding the same when both settings are in the same config file."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:39:38Z","Content":"KSP on Windows keeps a copy of your graphics settings in the registry, so maybe something is preventing KSP from updating the registry to your new settings, causing it to revert to those each time.\n\nYou could try working around the issue by manually setting the registry entries for KSP, look for \u0022HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER/Software/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/\u0022\n\nUse decimal mode to see the actual numbers, and back up your registry before any changes."},{"CreatedByName":"Enma.Darei","CreatedById":144336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:32:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been having the same problem since the update as well. \n\nController or no controller."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:22:15Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice sal, but I don\u0027t see how it could be the registry when replacing the directory seemed to fix the problem. Renaming the directory that I brought over from my old machine so that that\u0027s where steam looks for KSP seemed to solve the issue. \n\nThat tends to indicate that the problem is inside the KSP directory.\n\nI suspect that something critical in the fresh install is set to read only and that it\u0027s supposed to be either changed or deleted once you run the game the first time and it\u0027s not happening. \n\nI tried making settings.cfg read only but KSP doesn\u0027t like that so that\u0027s not the issue. And KSP does modify the files so it\u0027s not windows access permissions. The save files work just fine and if you open settings.cfg with notepad after you run KSP and change the graphic settings, the new settings are there. I think I even verified that the new settings are there after KSP closes, but I was trying a lot of stuff and I\u0027m not sure. (maybe someone still having the problem can confirm that)\n\nThere seems to be something that KSP looks for when it runs to determine if it\u0027s the first time it\u0027s run. When it doesn\u0027t find it the game reverts to default settings and brings up the data tracking window. That something is located inside the KSP directory since I was able to fix the problem by replacing the entire directory. \n\nWhatever it is, 1.02 doesn\u0027t seem to set it to the correct state, but if an older version of KSP set it to the correct state then 1.02 is willing to accept that.\n\nSince I\u0027ve fixed the problem someone else will have to continue investigating. I was looking at these lines of the settings.cfg wondering if they\u0027re what the game looks at. These are from my installation that works but I didn\u0027t think to compare them to what\u0027s in the config file when I\u0027d run the game, fix the graphics, ALT TAB to the desktop, then open the config file while KSP is still running.\n\nCALL\\_HOME = False\n\nDONT\\_SEND\\_IP = False\n\nSEND\\_PROGRESS\\_DATA = True\n\nCHECK\\_FOR\\_UPDATES = True\n\nI didn\u0027t see anything else in the .cfg that looked likely so if it\u0027s not those then perhaps there\u0027s another file that KSP is looking at. \n\nI hope somebody figures this out since it\u0027s a really annoying problem and not everyone has other installations they can try and fix it with."}]}
