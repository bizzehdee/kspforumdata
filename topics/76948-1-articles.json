It\u0027s a pretty short video, but I hope to start to do a bit more on the visual side of music. It\u0027s better when you can see where it all comes from IMO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUdB4Xi74yi1ESiMWYVLYW4g\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T18:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much talking at the beginning. 1/3 of the video is talking with no music.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jatwaa","CreatedById":59627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T18:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, sorry about that GregroxMun, I was shooting to explain why I posted the second video of the song.

Blending instruments was fun but boy oh boy does it strain my PC with that number of samples on load up. After that its fine.
