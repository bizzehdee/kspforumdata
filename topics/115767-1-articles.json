The government has given a very generous grant for us to begin exploring outer space. We\u0027ve heard that those Koviet bastards have already made some strides and, damn it all, we can\u0027t let those commies beat us. This is going to be an exciting space program. First of all, we plan on putting a kerbal into orbit. On our very first launch! (it helps to have a very large government grant and a crack research team). We also plan on doing a great many other exciting things such as manned Mun landings, unmanned probes and maybe even manned missions to the outer planets. Not only that, but inspired by the Greek theme already implied by the name of our great agency we will be giving our projects names like Gemini, Mercury, Apollo, and Orion.\n\n::Some men in suits enter the room and whisper something into Chiron Kerman\u0027s ear::\n\nUm.... Our lawyers have informed us that there is a very popular series of science fiction novels involving a space agency called \u0022NASA\u0022 on a planet called \u0022Earth\u0022 and many of the names I mentioned are already used for vehicles and projects in that book. So for legal reasons we will be using names inspired by Norse mythology instead. Sure it doesn\u0027t match our logo but we\u0027ve already copyrighted our name and *apparently* copyrights are very important. ::Chiron looks at the lawyers who then shrug::. Anyhow... Thank you for watching this press release and I hope you are as excited as I am about this exciting new era of spaceflight. Already our engineers have begun work on what they are calling Project Bifrost and our own brave Jebediah Kerman has volunteered to be our first Kerbal in space.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that\u0027s the sort of \u0022fluff\u0022 stuff, now here are the details. First of all here\u0027s a picture of my difficulty settings\n\n![r74PmfA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/r74PmfA.jpg)\n\nAs you can see they are fairly unforgiving. I cannot quicksave or revert so I\u0027m committed to every launch. If there\u0027s a disaster, I have to live with it. Also any Kerbals who die will stay dead. This will cause me to be fairly cautious about my designs and use things like launch escape systems to try and save Kerbals who are in distress. Here are the mods I\u0027ll running.\n\nAntenna range (with the option enabled that it\u0027s required for probe control)\n\nChatterer\n\nColor Coded Cans\n\nDang It! (random part failures which will force me to get creative at times. Should breath a little life into some of my mission reports)\n\nEngine Light\n\nEnhanced Nav Ball\n\nFuel Tanks Plus\n\nHot Rockets\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nFinal Frontier (will make it even harder when I lose good men and women)\n\nRCS build aid\n\nStation parts Expansion\n\nTAC Life support and TAC life support retexture (My Kerbals will require food water and oxygen. If they get marooned out in space there will be no hope of rescue before their supplies run out.)\n\nUniversal Storage\n\n**Mission Reports**\n\n**1.** *Bifrost I*\n\n**2.** *Bifrost II*\n\n**3.** *Munin I and II* \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T23:51:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chiron0224**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T05:56:47Z","Content":"**Centaur Space Center Update**\n\nBefore we begin discussing the outcome of the Bifrost mission, let\u0027s take a moment to cut the red ribbon and announce the official opening of the newly constructed Centaur Center. As you can see in this image it boasts a level 2 Vehicle Assembly building, level 2 Launch pad, level 2 Astronaut Complex, level 2 Mission Control, level 1 Administration building, level 1 Tracking station, level 1 research lab, and level 1 Spaceplane hangar and runway.\n\n![iNyJesl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iNyJesl.jpg)\n\n**Bifrost I**\n\n![QS2Qvsd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QS2Qvsd.jpg)\n\n**Mission Parameters**\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. Successfully launch a manned rocket\n\n2. Put a Kerbal into orbit\n\n3. Gather scientific data during launch and from orbit using the Mystery Goo canister.\n\n4. Prove that Centaur Space Center wasn\u0027t a wast of money\n\n5. Place Bifrost I commemorative plaque at landing site\n\n**Vessel:**\n\nBifrost I manned rocket.\n\nThe Bifrost I rocket was constructed right away with the express goal of putting a Kerbal into orbit. Jebediah Kerman volunteered for the mission with an eagerness that, quite frankly, was alarming. The rocket used three stages. The first stage consisted of two \u0022Thumper\u0022 SRBs mounted on either side of the rocket with the next two stages being liquid fueled. The second stage was a \u0022redstone\u0022 fuel tank (from Fuel Tanks Plus) with an LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine and the third and final \u0022orbiter\u0022 stage consisted of a smaller fuel tank equipped with an LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine. The basic mission profile called for the SRBs to fire first followed by the Reliant engine to get the vessel into the upper atmosphere where the last stage with it\u0027s Terrier engine would burn to achieve orbit. To commemorate the event a plaque was installed on the Bifrost I that read \u0022Like the mythical bridge of old, may this vessel be our path to the heavens.\u0022 There was a plan to have Jebediah place the plaque wherever he happened to land to commemorate the spot.\n\n**Mission Report**\n\nHere at the Centaur Center, as we\u0027ve begun calling it, are proud to say that the mission was an almost flawless success. The craft performed exactly according to specs as can be seen in the photos to follow this report. One minor hiccup is that somebody at the VAB forgot to install the Mystery Goo canister and the flight just became a publicity and sight seeing mission in the end. The only other hiccup is that Jeb landed in the ocean and was therefor unable to place the plaque as intended.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n**Success** Successfully launch a manned rocket\n\n**Success** Put a Kerbal into orbit\n\n**Failure** Gather scientific data during launch and from orbit using the Mystery Goo canister.\n\n**Success** Prove that Centaur Space Center wasn\u0027t a wast of money\n\n**Failure** Place Bifrost I commemorative plaque at landing site\n\n**Mission Photos**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/4N9Bn\n\n\u003E http://imgur.com/a/4N9Bn\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/4N9Bn\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T15:41:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chiron0224**"},{"CreatedByName":"ygarl","CreatedById":147699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T13:43:08Z","Content":"Smashing thread.\n\nIt inspires me to try the same!"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:09:49Z","Content":"**Centaur Center Update**\n\nAfter the first Bifrost mission managed to convince the powers that be that our space program was worth funding we received a pretty hefty second grant. Much of this second grant was saved by some of it was used to start a new outsourced R\u0026D project to help us make advances in rocketry and interpret scientific data. Some of it was also used to upgrade our tracking station as our engineers decided they were sick of trying to calculate the orbit of a vessel by taking speed readings and doing calculus on the backs of envelopes. Now we will always know exactly where our Kerbonauts are and how their orbits are looking.\n\n![QCGMxsY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QCGMxsY.jpg)\n\n**Bifrost II**\n\n![q7noxtU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/q7noxtU.jpg)\n\nThe Bifrost I mission was considered a smashing success even though it failed to meet its scientific goals. It turns out that the government and the general public were far less interested in Mystery Goo mechanics in an orbital environment and far more blown away by the \u0022Holy \\*\\*\\*\\* a Kerbal in outer space!!\u0022 aspect of the mission. This led to a nice boost in funding, but the scientists in R\u0026D continued to be buzzkills by insisting that we are a scientific organization, not rock stars. So two Mystery Goo containers were installed on the Bifrost rocket and a second mission to orbit was planned. In order to continue fueling public interest in the project it was decided that a camera should be installed in the cockpit so that the kerbonaut could say hi to the folks back home and give interesting anecdotes about life as a kerbonaut. Valentina Kerman was chosen for this second Bifrost mission. Mission control insists that it was for fairness sake as Jebediah got to do the last one. Valentina pointed out how typical it was that a male Kerbal was selected for the groundbreaking first launch and that she was chosen for the mission with a camera on board. In protest of the blatant sexism Valentina didn\u0027t do her hair or make up before going on the Bifrost II launch. In words that will be remembered for generations she is quoted as having said \u0022Let the science speak for itself\u0022.\n\n**Mission Parameters**\n\n**Mission Goals:**\n\n**1.** Achieve LKO\n\n**2.** Make observations of Mystery goo during ascent and also in LKO\n\n**3.** Return safely home\n\n**4.** Plant a flag and leave a plaque should the capsule make a solid ground landing.\n\n**Vehicle:**\n\nThe same Bifrost launch vehicle was used for this mission as was used for Bifrost I with the addition of two Mystery Goo containers.\n\nMission Report:\n\nThe Bifrost II mission was a smashing success. Every single goal was achieved. Valentina was well received by the people of Kerbin in spite of looking like she just rolled out of bed. The scientific experiments were performed and data recovered successfully (during which time Valentina became the first Kerbal to ever use the jetpack and drift completely free of the vehicle). Everything came home safely and Valentina even got the opportunity to leave a flag and a plaque. As a dig to Jebediah Kerman who was supposed to have left the historic plaque about the Bifrost I Valentina\u0027s plaque simply read \u0022Suck on that Jeb!\u0022\n\nGoals:\n\nSuccess Achieve LKO\n\n**Success** Observe Mystery Goo during ascent and in LKO\n\n**Success** Return home safely\n\n**Success** Return scientific data home safely\n\n**Success** Plant a flag and leave a plaque should the capsule make a solid ground landing\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Most of them, as you can imagine, were completely stupid. But one company asked to have a satellite put into orbit for unknown reasons. When we saw what they were willing to pay, we didn\u0027t ask questions and immediately set to work making such a satellite. The name Munin was chosen in honor of the raven from Norse mythology who, along with Hunin, scouts out the nine worlds and reports back to Odin.\n\n**Mission Goals:**\n\n**1.** Launch our first artificial satellite into orbit.\n\n**2.** Achieve the desired highly eccentric orbit specified in the contract.\n\n**3.** Demonstrate the feasibility of man made satellites.\n\n**4.** Take temperature readings from a high orbit around Kerbin\n\n**Vessel:**\n\n![oJcd78t.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oJcd78t.jpg)\n\nThis mission uses the Bifrost launch vehicle but with two extra SRBs mounted to it. The satellite itself consists of a HECS probe core, 8 OX-STAT solar panels, a z-1k rechargeable battery, a 2-Hot thermometer, a COMMS DTS-M1 antenna, 2 Oscar-B fuel tanks, and a 48-7S \u0022Spark\u0022 engine. A nose cone was later added to reduce drag and some jackass in the VAB slapped it on without first relocating the thermometer.\n\n**Mission Report:**\n\nThe Munin I satellite got off to a very exciting start as it quickly became apparent that the rocket was, in the words of Chiron Kerman \u0022grotesquely overpowered\u0022. During the ascent the craft began to glow which the engineers called a \u0022bad sign\u0022. Luckily for us, their sissy pants worries turned out to be nothing and the craft was able to gain a relatively high apoapsis very quickly and escaped the atmosphere before any serious heating damage could occur. At the point of apoapsis there was still plenty of fuel in the ascent stage so an attempt was made to use it for the orbital burn but it was soon abandoned due to an inability to properly steer the massive ship. It wasn\u0027t looking good so the ascent stage was jettisoned and the orbiter established a parking orbit as intended. After achieving and tweaking the orbit a bit the orbiter was jettisoned from the satellite and using the fuel in the Oscar-Bs and the new \u0022Spark\u0022 engine the satellite was able to put itself into the proper orbit although it was not able to gather any temperature readings once in that orbit.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n**1.** **Success** Launch our first artificial satellite into orbit.\n\n**2.** **Success** Achieve the desired highly eccentric orbit specified in the contract.\n\n**3.** **Success** Demonstrate the feasibility of man made satellites.\n\n**4.** **Failure** Take temperature readings from a high orbit around Kerbin\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This time the task was to put a satellite into a polar orbit. The official story of Centaur Space Center is that a camera malfunction caused there to be no images of the mission. They also claim to have lost contact with the Satellite due to another technical error. Many suspect that this was done intentionally in order for the CSC to distance themselves from their first true failure \\*actually I didn\u0027t feel like doing a mission report for every single satellite launch but this one failed so badly I decided to include it\\*. Due to how overpowered the Munin I launch vehicle was the Munin II mission went back to the basic two SRB design of the Bifrost launch platform. Monopropellant tanks and RCS thrusters were also added to aid maneuvering and the thermometer on the probe was relocated.\n\n**Mission Parameters:**\n\n**Mission Goals:**\n\n**1.** Put a satelite into a specific polar orbit of Kerbin\n\n**2.** Gather temperature readings at the high point of that orbit\n\n**3.** Demonstrate the usefulness of RCS thrusters for future space missions\n\n**Vessel:**\n\nBasically the same vehicle from the Bifrost missions but with RCS thrusters and a Munin style satellite on top.\n\n**Mission Report:**\n\nMunin II struggled right from the beginning. The engineering team was so excited due to their winning streak that they weren\u0027t paying attention and launched the satellite immediately rather than waiting for the launch pad to be positioned under the target orbit. A basic equatorial LKO parking orbit was established and then a long hard burn was initiated to try and correct the angle to the proper polar one. This used up all of the fuel. In order of the mission not to be a total loss the thermometer was used and some temperature readings were logged in a fairly low and highly tilted orbit. Then the CSC mysteriously lost contact with the satellite.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n**1.** **Failure** Put a satelite into a specific polar orbit of Kerbin\n\n**2.** **Partial Success** Gather temperature readings at the high point of that orbit\n\n**3.** **Success** Demonstrate the usefulness of RCS thrusters for future space missions\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Smashing thread.\n\u003E It inspires me to try the same!\n\n![B6xpiGHCUAEiXUR.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6xpiGHCUAEiXUR.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T23:52:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chiron0224**"}]}
