But when there is only slight wobble that can be countered by hand, MJ will just shake the ship apart. On the other hand there are things like docking, or pin-point landings. I will freely admit in such cases i use MechJeb, because his mechanical precision is better suited than my twitchy fingers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E So, i guess for me MJ is an equivalent of a crutch or cane, not a full blown wheelchair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T13:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could play the game perfectly without mechjeb.
