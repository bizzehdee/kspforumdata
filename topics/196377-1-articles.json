I am using KSP 1.10.1 and running with all the expansions along with some mods, but I have had this issue for several versions for the last year or so. I will be playing the game for a various amount of time and usually shortly after launching a vehicle the game will freeze and I will get an error with the message \u0022unexpected mark stack overflow\u0022 then a pop up window with a kerbal pictured and once the loading bar reaches 100% the game will force exit. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game and removed mods but nothing seems to fix this issue. Sometimes I can play the game for hours and not have any issues, but other times it happens within ten minutes. Is there any way to fix this issue and/or does anyone know if the Devs are working on this issue? If there is more info that may help in trying to fix this issue or you are facing this issue please comment below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-21T15:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you provide a log?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
