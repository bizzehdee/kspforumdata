The point about the min PE orbit is that anything more than 1km below that will degrade whereas every orbit with PE over that will not. However KSP measures meters and your PE will not degrade but is not quite up to the rules standard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard was set both because it was easy to remember and because it was well clear of the atmosphere. This last factor is significant because some craft have dimensions approaching 100m so it would be fully possible for the capsule to be in space while the tail was dragging in the atmosphere !
