She should never have approved reentry - she should have called ahead for another craft to pick them up from orbit - there was plenty of time to do so. As it is, she is willingly risking the SCIENCE, and the lives of her crew as well. As for Jebediah, he hasn\u0027t been in command until now, but it appears he\u0027s doing the equivalent of what Valentina did after ascending from Duna: \u0022You are SO relieved right now\u0022, and it looks like he will try and make the best of the situation. \n\nYes, I\u0027m putting way to much thought into this."},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T18:42:26Z","Content":"Well, it is not Valentina call to have or not a second ship waiting for them or even the landing decision, but from Mission Control, so you have to blame the brass on the ground if the landing gets bad ( unless Val has not relayed this intel to Kerbin, which would be criminal ... ). \n\nAs for the command transfer, well, Bill is confused about who is in command , so surely he doesn\u0027t feel there was a clear transfer of command ... and in spite of the rules of command tranfer in KerbFleet being more lax that in RL ( in RL there are 3 calls ( Pilot A: \u0022You have the flight controls\u0022 Pilot B: \u0022I have the flight controls\u0022 Pilot A: \u0022You have the flight controls\u0022 ... Kerbfleet apparently only uses 2 ) in consensual command transfers, apparently they use the same 1 call system than RL ( Pilot B: \u0022I have the flight controls\u0022 ) in case on non consensual transfers , as Val herself showed in the Duna emergency. \n\nGiven this, there are 2 mistakes in the command transfer in the Kerbin reentry by KerbFleet rules and one in flight protocol ( as far as I understand it ): Val keeps control of the ship after entering a atmosphere, when the protocol is that Jeb is the atmospheric pilot, and even hints to Jeb for him to take control, but without formal transfer ; Jeb assumes control without formal control transfer and only requests it later ; Val does not formally give control to Jeb in a non emergency situation ( note that the emergency is only detected later ) but also does not assume it.

There have been quite a few incidents in my life where Old Man Death has had me literally dead to rights with nothing I could do except think, \u0022Vallhalla, here I come.\u0022 Then the whole world kinda blinked and shifted slightly, and I was somehow not in the path of destruction. Not like I dodged it, but like I\u0027d never been in that position to start with due to having done things slightly different beforehand. Nobody around me ever sees me teleport out of the jaws of death, instead thinking I\u0027d never been there.\n\nI figure this has to do with parallel universes. Every choice you make creates a parallel universe where another copy of you lives (or dies) with the choice you didn\u0027t make. However, you consciousness is only in one universe. But when you die, your consciousness jumps to some other parallel universe where you survive the situation.
