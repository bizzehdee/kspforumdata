However, I now find myself wishing I could replace the LOX in some of the tanks with fuel rather than just emptying them.\n\n![dnhmaw.jpg](http://oi62.tinypic.com/dnhmaw.jpg)\n\nUsing the stock-like Modular Rocket Systems Part Pack \n\nIn the above image, I\u0027ve emptied the oxidizer from the tank that supplies my nuclear engine. Is there any way I can replace the empty space with more liquid fuel? If not, are there any mods that make this possible?\n\nIf this has been brought up before I apologize, but I find it really strange that this hasn\u0027t been implemented.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T13:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nAssailant**"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:04:54Z","Content":"... or, you know, you could use jet fuel tanks? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nBit cheaty, but hey, why not."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:06:16Z","Content":"I had hoped for that to be a tweakable.
