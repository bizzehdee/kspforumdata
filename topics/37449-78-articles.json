So the standard conversion rate is 90% (i.e. 100 wastewater -\u0026gt; 90 water). This means that a tank of water \u002B a converter is equivalent to a tank 10 times the size (ie 100 units of water with a converter will provide 1000 units of water before the water has all been consumed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed in the general case the amount of water available varies based on the conversion rate as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EusableResource = takeSize/(1-conversionRate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a conversion rate of 50% gives twice the amount and a conversion rate of 99% gives 100 times the amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that there would be more interesting choices to make if different converters were available that differed not just by their capacity to convert, but their efficiency and mass.

For long term missions this would provide genuine engineering choices rather than just slapping on a converter to keep things going.

However, I have an old game and many ships on interplanetary orbits and I tried to switch TAC off by using Enable -button in configuration window. But it does not seem to work. Game reports lack of living stuff and kerbals die. How I should use it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made another copy of KSP-folder without TAC, so it does not prevent playing.
