Having the chutes only cut by user input is out of question, some very weird shennanigans can happen if a craft is completely landed and static and the chutes stay deployed. Having the parachute realistically fall alongside the capsule is even further out of question as this involves both cloth and string physics, and this is not happening in Unity with KSP without a level of complexity far out of my reach as well as the reach than the game can take. A timer would cause the same issues, and could be too short in many cases, it\u0027s an awful solutions on all sides. There needs to be something to tell the chutes \u0022job\u0027s done, you can cut\u0022, and unfortunately I\u0027m not able to see any cue to palliate for that.
