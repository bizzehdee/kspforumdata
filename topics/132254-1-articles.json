To be honest though, I\u0027m not sure I would play it a lot. The thing is, however well it works and whatever ingenious ideas are used to solve the time warp issue, space is still really really big. Apart from some relatively rare occations where you meet up with other players (which is already no easy thing to do), you will still spend most of the time alone. I can see it working with planes, but I mostly play Kerbal Space Program, not Kerbal Aircraft Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there\u0027s another kind of multiplayer that I would really enjoy, and that\u0027s having \u003Cstrong\u003Emultiple players in control of the same ship\u003C/strong\u003E. I know that sounds stupid at first, but imo KSP is a lot about learning (and teaching). Wouldn\u0027t it be great if an experienced player could act as a \u003Cstrong\u003Edriving instructor\u003C/strong\u003E on your ship, give advice in real time and take over control if necessary?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been in this situation quite of few times. Right now, the best solution is to either use some streaming service like Twitch or Steam (resulting in horrible delay) or use a desktop sharing program like Teamviewer (with horrible quality and sometimes also delay). An in-game sharing feature should work much better since there\u0027s actually not that much information that has to be transmitted.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuch a \u0022Mentor Mode\u0022 wouldn\u0027t have to be limited to flying, it could also work in the VAB. Of course there are details to be worked out (Like for instance how would one player hand control over to another? Or should one player\u0027s input always overwrite the other one\u0027s?), but I see no major technical obstacles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you about this idea? Has anything like this been suggested to and/or been taken into consideration by the devs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T14:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf multiplayer comes, several modes should be present. Ones like big multiplayer servers, some competitive individual space programs, co-op, and, there should also be something you describe. Either players could have complete control over the craft, something like a kerbal-archon, or, each player could have an own kerbonaut, one being responsible of the craft(engineer) one for the experiments(scientist) and one for orbiting and manouvers(pilot)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
