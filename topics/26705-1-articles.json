Cool, it also looks spiffy on the nosecone. I decided to give it a try on my space station resupply vehicle; since one of its lifter\u0027s middle stages has a nasty habit of occasionally nicking an engine if dropped when the rotation isn\u0027t perfectly zero (and this stage is dropped right in the middle of the gravity turn... yeah, good thing I don\u0027t work for NASA!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up some action groups - 1 decouples the stack separator and fires the escape tower, 2 deploys the parachutes since I obviously don\u0027t want those adding drag as I\u0027m trying to get my crew away from the exploding engines. Then copied the craft file into my \u0027Simulation\u0027 savegame and tried it out on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit the button and wheeeeeeee -- up went the command pod! As it was flying through the air, I noticed on the left of the screen that the stages from the lower part of the rocket started collapsing together one after the other. Finally it hit the last one -- and deployed the parachutes automatically while the pod was still flying upward. I think you can guess what happened next; as soon as the pod hit the top of its arc and its velocity crossed 0, the parachutes disappeared. D\u0027oh! That\u0027s why I put them on a separate action group to begin with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there any way to \u003Cem\u003Eremove\u003C/em\u003E a part from staging altogether? This is a ship that\u0027s designed to land on its own power back at KSC, so I really don\u0027t need the parachutes except in an emergency. Ideally I\u0027d want to take the separator and escape tower out as well to prevent them from being accidentally triggered, since I\u0027m terrible about remembering to lock the staging (and it always seems to get jumbled up after docking/undocking). I couldn\u0027t find anything in the interface to do it -- is the only way to create extra copies of all 3 parts with a modified cfg?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T19:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blackstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blackstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs it was flying through the air, I noticed on the left of the screen that the stages from the lower part of the rocket started collapsing together one after the other.

The AOD (Automatic Opening Device) take a constant reading of the air pressure.

Just decouple from the stack and fire the escape tower... The firing activates the AOD and when it is below 1200ft it detects the speed the thing is dropping (ie it wouldn\u0027t fire until the pressure difference is positive so no firing before it is actually descending) and job done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T10:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there are istg and dstg parameter for every part in the craft file (which I guesstimate as \u0022ignition stage\u0022 and \u0022decouple stage\u0022).
