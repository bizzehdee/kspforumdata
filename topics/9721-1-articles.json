Ditch the landing legs. MechJeb 1.7.3\\\u0027s landing computer can bring you to a safe touchdown on the engines themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Avoid using radial decouplers on the last stage. Gravity on Mun is so low that you don\\\u0027t need to jettison those radial fuel tanks. Of course, if you\\\u0027re doing a powered landing on Kerbin, it might be worth keeping the decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Switch to the MechJeb radial model, the flat one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Replace each radial full-size tank with 1 mini-tank and 1 mini-engine. You sacrifice only a 1/2 tank of fuel but gain a better thrust/weight ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe setup I\\\u0027m using easily shaves 3 units of weight off of your lander design. I found out that lighter landers with more thrust/weight tend to do better than ones loaded up with more fuel. Feel free to disagree with any of my design choices, I just hope you can make use of some of these ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-21T01:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm. Interesting ideas. I\\\u0027ve also had people suggest other things, such as simply replacing the lander\\\u0027s engine on the current design with the smaller variant; turns out that the fuel efficiency of the smaller engine is about the same as the larger one, and the weight difference matters not a bit due to my design having the lander\\\u0027s engine lit for the entire flight after the solid boosters drop. Replacing the 1m mechjeb with the radial one is something I hadn\\\u0027t thought of, and I\\\u0027ll be trying it out on my next redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deliberately have \\\u0027too much\\\u0027 fuel radially coupled to the lander along with landing legs for a variety of different reasons. Primarily it\\\u0027s so that I have a wider base with which to add stability when I\\\u0027m landing things manually - mechjeb is nice, but I always like to have the ability to land the thing myself if something goes wrong. There are other reasons - due to the lander *having* too much fuel, I deliberately use it to do the munar insertion orbit from kerbin and decelleration from munar orbit to landing using the fuel on the side coupled tanks. The three side coupled engines and tanks are dumped shortly after achieving initial orbit around kerbin, and so are obviously unavailable for the rest of the flight. The radial decouplers are there so when the lander\\\u0027s side tanks are empty and I want to take off from the mun, I can easily drop the unnecessary weight and conserve whatever fuel is remaining in the last tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I *have* decided is a bit redundant is the rcs fuel tank and thrusters; I\\\u0027m simply not using the things as much as I used to. It\\\u0027s possible I may not get rid of them though, it\\\u0027s always nice to use to manually change your orbit height in very small amounts rather than having to use the main engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-21T05:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecided to fiddle around with trying to make as small a lander as possible that was mechjeb certified. I had mixed success; it\\\u0027s not possible for me to land this manually, and mechjeb seemed to have serious doubts about its ability to land while the side tanks were attached. However, it\\\u0027s perfectly possible to land this without them if mechjeb is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... Unfortunately, I then neglected to realize I was launching in a clockwise orbit and wound up in an orbit around kerbin with insufficient fuel to either slow down enough to miss the mun as it approached me, nor speed up enough to avoid it. Hilarity ensued as the mun recaptured me and I was gravity assisted into an ejection from both munar and kerbin orbit. The poor fools are now orbiting kerbol with no way to return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design has many pluses to it due to the reduced weight of the lander; since I removed the rcs tank, the 1m mechjeb and replaced the lander\\\u0027s lfe and lft with the smaller variants, to orbit had slightly more fuel remaining in the launch tanks. Unfortunately due to it\\\u0027s much lower thrust, the lander has to do a much longer burn to get it into munar orbit, and although it\\\u0027s slightly more fuel efficient I don\\\u0027t particularly like its handling, especially since there is very little leeway once you land on the mun to get back to kerbin, as well as the very obvious fact that I am incapable of landing this by myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the next redesign I do will reequip the larger lft and lfe and keep the rcs fuel. There\\\u0027s a big difference having the extra thrust of that engine, and having the rcs fuel makes correcting bad orbits easier. (and gives you one last method to return to kerbin if you really screw things up.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hikaru","CreatedById":9643,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T04:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the fourth revision of this design generation. I think I\\\u0027m pretty comfortable with the end result; mostly this is the same ship as in V1 except that I removed the 1m mechjeb and replaced it with a side mounted one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to have been some confusion in discussions I\\\u0027ve had with others about how the lander\\\u0027s engine is able to fire during launch without using the fuel on the lander; more or less this is due to me chaining fuel lines from the lowest tanks on the outer ring to the innermost tank on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people had actually tried launching my ship they would have noticed the tanks on the lander weren\\\u0027t being used until orbit, but very obviously some people aren\\\u0027t doing that, and this video I made is for them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can easily see the fuel lines (and struts) in this video, as well as the fuel levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzGqv5CWBvI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
