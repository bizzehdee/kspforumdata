Just like we got invested in The Martian by following Matt Damen\u2019s struggles, if we had to pay attention to the struggles of the Kerbals we might feel more nostalgia about our past missions with them, and be more concerned about\u00A0their wellbeing. But this would need a large reimagine of the game imo, to have a greater focus on doing things actually as a Kerbal rather than as a plane with a Kerbal core tucked away inside somewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-01T03:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2020 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JamesL86","CreatedById":127321,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-01T13:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what I\u0027d want if I could make a specific recommendation is something like the mod Kerbal Space Transport System.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4351381221\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190834-18x-kerbal-space-transport-system/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever I\u0027d like the success of the mission to be based on the complexity of the said mission combined with the experience and personality of the kerbal(s) performing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven the ability to create mission profiles ourselves could also allow a means of creating our own contracts instead of relying on pregen ones.\u00A0 However, from a game design perspective we would need the ability to \u0022drop in\u0022 on the mission if we want to as well.\u00A0 I don\u0027t want to be deprived of the option to fly something myself if need be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-02T07:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223750193\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221583069127\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127321\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JamesL86\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, JamesL86 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwe would need the ability to \u0022drop in\u0022 on the mission if we want to as well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice idea.
