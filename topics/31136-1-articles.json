Sure mods and challenges and the like make it interesting again, but after a while even these begin to wear thin. Where do you turn then? Give up on the little green men and return to real life? In my case, I really felt, after having visited most planets and messing about with all kinds of ships that I was missing a certain motivation, i.e. something that kept me wanting to play. For this I went looking for a campaign mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played LordStimpy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s campaign, as well as a few others, for quite some time, and while they are all very well worked out and very enjoyable, after a while these campaigns turned into a grind. As we all know grinding is the biggest fun-killer any gamer can experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, having way too much free time on my hands, I decided to design my own campaign, in the hopes of creating something new, rewarding and challenging and most importantly something that is compatible with every type of mod. The idea I ended up with is not entirely original, but is inspired partly by \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=19388\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis guy\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to create a campaign that feels rewarding, yet doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t limit you the way a money-based campaign does.

The currency in this campaign is \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Science Points\u003C/strong\u003E (or KSPs for short). Every part in the VAB/SPH costs something. This is the amount of KSPs that are required to research it.

Researching newer and better safety measures is hard, so try not to kill too many of your astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA less common cause of Kerbal death is the cold, hard vacuum of space itself. EVA is often a necessity on missions, and the last thing we want is for your crew to be afraid of donning their spacesuit because it is made of inferior materials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kerbal on EVA is in danger of dying when his jetpack runs out of fuel and there is no ship available for a rescue mission.

While not posing much of a threat now, scientist claim that in future too much of this may make space inaccessible to Kerbals for all time.
