Basically it tries to explode but is too heavy. What do you think would happen?\n\nWhat would happen to venus depends largely on how similar it once was to Earth. Venus has alot of sulfate in its atmosphere and the heat and sulfate lock the water off the surface. On earth\u0027s crust sulfate and carbon tirnover on the surface is governed by subduction at the plate edges. As organic carbon and sulfate are subducted lower, the pressure increases but so does the heat, eventually the heat is more important and even 1000 km down the lighter elemnts will coalesce and cause a rise under the upper plate, this results in the ring o fire phenomena. But the biggest reservoir of sulfate is the ocean, the alkali elements trap both carbon and sulfate as counter ions. This is also driven by redox potntials created by phototrophs and the phototroph deposits on land and in petroleum resrvoirs. Venus does not have these, and if the acidic atmospere disappears a very alkalin surface is likely scavenge and raise the boiling point of any counter-ions that exist. Thus I would make the following prediction\n\nVenus cools, its crust will further solify and crack, you would see multiple mid atlantic typ ridge formations. This would probably go on for another 200 million years and the increase solar output would cause an equilibration. \n\nin this model if we put a giant reflector between venus and sun at L1. What might happen, venuses atmosphere would begin to collapse, but the resulting acid rain would react with th alkalin surface causing chemoturbulation of the surface. Venus would take years to equilibrate under this scenario because alkalin reserves in venus would be like coal and oil reserves on earth. In fact you really would not need a power source on venus because you could drll down, inject brine and turn the sea/drill shaft into a giant battery. Secondarily the crusts temperature at surface is ckoser to its mantle temperature, so that heat flow to the surface would provide a good source of geothermal power, add in subsurface a fissure chemothermal heat sources. IMHO Venus has probably lost some of its acidifyers due to the height and thermal convection of its atmosphere. Thus the cooler venus will tilt in favor of an extremely acidic surface. Its very diificult to loose alkali elements to degassing.\n\nVenus will always be a violent place for life, but early life formed in such a violent place so ......., better ti cool and drop the bugs first. \n\nI disagree that venus is within the goldilocks zone of Sol, I think sulfate in addition to carbon , both essential elements to life, and sulfate particularly the evolution of Archea, and bacteria are somewhat dependent on archea early on in carbon and nitrogen cycle....so. If sulfate is important, locked away in huge amounts inoy oceans, but causes venus to be a greenhouse disaster, the problem is not the sulfate, its the size and proximity of the planet to the sun. The reason we see little evidence for habitable planets is that such planets are much rarer than the optimist propose. I don\u0027t think the solar proximity effect can be reversed even with wishful technology. Venus has been marked by the sun, if sun were to blinkout in one gigantic sterlizing burst of light and forming a brown dwarf, any visitor landing on the inner planets would realize that Venus and Mercury were lifeless and Earth had and Mars might have had life. Even if you put a colony there while it was cooling they would come to the same conclusion, it was not a genesis planet."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T22:07:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It does not make difference.. earth has undersea eruptions with the same frequency and strenght than surface eruptions, the pressure of magma breaking the rock is like two orders of magnitud higher than 1000m of water.\n\nI am not sure what you are talking about.
