Every time however, the launch rocket uses the payload\u0027s RCS thrusters which disrupts the delicate balance of RCS thrusters on the rocket.

One set of four is sufficient to maneuver the underpowered rocket into position during flight. It can also be fired laterally for fine course corrections maneuvers. You can, of course, use an action group to disable those other thrusters after you have assembled your rocket in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the fuel tanks are concerned, while on the launch pad or in orbit, right click on the payload thruster tank and click on the green arrow on the right. That will disable it from being used. Any tank below that stage will now provide fuel for the payload thrusters. No fuel line is needed for the thrusters regardless of tank location. One tank below the probe stage should be sufficient for orientation maneuvers or you can arrange for the thruster tank on the current stage to be used before you stage. Just don\u0027t forget to reactivate the next tank in line after you stage. I have used just thrusters on the probe stage for landing on airless moons and parachutes for those with an atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy four stage Vanguard uses a thruster set on its probe stage with its own fuel tank. During flight, that tank is disabled and fuel is drawn from the tank on the fourth stage. Thrusters are only used for maneuvering the three stage assembly after it has reached orbit or escape velocity from a direct straight up launch at dawn. The onion booster gets it up to 40,000\u002B meters before staging. There is 20% fuel left in the second stage at escape velocity to provide a third of the thrust or more needed to intercept Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrusters can be locked out with an action group. But, Unless you disable the probe tank, the remaining ones will draw fuel from it first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-22T20:04:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2013 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
