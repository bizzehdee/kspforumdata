The trouble is, I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to do the launch. There doesn\u0027t appear to be enough dV to launch into Earth orbit prior to setting the lunar impact trajectory.

Having access to 1963 command modules before being able to recreate the 1959 Luna missions is unreasonable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree. I would also really like to have the option of researching the longer range Remote Tech dishes without having to unlock many of the moon techs. I would really enjoy playing a game where i got most of the science to develop by space program from interplanetary probes instead of land on the moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while Autochton is right, I believe that only OMNI antennas get a bonus from multiple antennas, while the directional dishes don\u0027t. The KR-14 with a 1000Gm dish reange is the first dish you can use to communicate with craft in orbit of Jupiter. I think it costs 300 science to unlock the node with the KR-14.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
