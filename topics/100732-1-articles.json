Over the course of a year and three months, in 105 videos, his Kerbals have explored the solar system in a quest to gather the knowledge to build an Interstellar drive. The moment they succeed they\u2019re forced to leave their home planet for good.\n\nWhere one door closes another one will open, as you will see in the video!  \n\n\u003Cfigure data-url=\u0022https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZRtFVnbgKeM\u0022 data-orig-height=\u0022304\u0022 data-orig-width=\u0022540\u0022 data-provider=\u0022youtube\u0022 class=\u0022tmblr-embed\u0022\u003E\u003Ciframe id=\u0022youtube_iframe\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRtFVnbgKeM?feature=oembed\u0026enablejsapi=1\u0026origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026wmode=opaque\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022281\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Kraken","CreatedById":102655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:04:22Z","Content":"Welp, it\u0027s finally over. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nTbh I stopped watching after episode 70, because it stopped interesting me.

Googling KSP, I eventually found this series from Scott Manley, as well as his tutorials for beginners. \n\nHowever, it was this series that absolutely inspired me and captured my imagination. I purchased KSP because of Manley, and I convinced 5 other people to buy the game and start playing, all because of this series. \n\nI recently rewatched the entire thing while recovering from surgery, and it is still fantastic. Scott, if you are reading this, I\u0027d love to be able to buy a copy on disc or digital download or something. I\u0027m not sure if Squad would allow that, but if so, I\u0027d be a definite purchaser. I\u0027d love to see some of the behind-the-scenes things like commentary on setup, builds, and editing of the clips too."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:16:22Z","Content":"He just posted an epilogue.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Vu6vPytoQQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:48:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wonder if Scott Manley is going to level-up to RSS for the next series?\n\nIt looks like he might."},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T23:14:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It looks like he might.\n\nI hope he does. Frankly, I stopped watching his series because it was all just too easy. The increased powers of interstellar, along with the bunny slope that is the stock kerbol system, made the series more star trek than rocket program. I\u0027ve been playing in RSS/64k for many months, basically since it appeared. Without that increased challenge I would have abandonded KSP long ago."},{"CreatedByName":"tuckjohn","CreatedById":91927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T01:13:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Same here.

Interstellar was fun for the first few dozen episodes, but the mega-tech made it to much of a cakewalk. Interesting to a point, but I\u0027ve no interest in playing KSP that way.\n\nReusable Space Program was great though. Real challenge and ingenuity, and so prescient with SpaceX\u0027s current efforts to achieve the same in real life. It inspired me to push for efficiency and economy in my designs long before career mode made that an actual advantage.\n\nSimon Hibbs"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:16:23Z","Content":"The most impressive thing about this series was the fact that he managed to keep a heavily modded save going for so long!\n\nMy saves tend to die under the weight of multiple orbiting ships and mod-related bugs much sooner. I\u0027ve had a couple that I have simply been unable to load, and have had to abandon.
