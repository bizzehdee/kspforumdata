I have assembled expeditions to Duna and Eve but maintaining bases and shipping resources seems really difficult. Getting the right phase angles for efficient transfers can take years, the transfers themselves are really long (and it gets boring to wait when you can\u0027t time wrap because of other things going on the Kerbin System), life support (I\u0027m using [RoverDude\u0027s life support mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116790-1-0-USI-Life-Support-ALPHA-0-1-0-2015-04-27)) becomes a greater concern. Not to mention rescue missions when things go wrong: on a past mission, after I accidentally blew up half my rocket, including all the life support, I was able to get a rescue ship in less than an hour (by wasting fuel and being super aggressive in the transfer/rendezvous). If something like that happened on Jool, I could kiss my brave kerbonauts good bye...\n\nSo how do you guys do to have a working economy and crew rotation on a interplanetary scale? Do you just accept longer delays and compensate with large volumes? Do you waste extra Delta-V doing inefficient transfers? Is doing a bi-elliptic transfer, with a first stop on a low Kerbol orbit, a good compromise between time and Delta-V? Or the only solution relies on technology not yet discovered (i.e. should I use a FTL mod)?\n\nAll help is appreciated!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T23:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bolche**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:04:49Z","Content":"For traveling interplanetary, I would say for the most part, you\u0027re going to be waiting for transfer windows. If you don\u0027t transfer at a window, it\u0027s going to take you much longer to get to your destination. Unless you\u0027re playing with some overpowered mods that have engines with absurd ISPs and warp drives, that is.\n\nIf you\u0027re worried about things going wrong and losing your brave little kerbals, then use a buddy system. Send two of everything and have extra space for crew. Send two motherships, multiple landers,etc. If something goes wrong on one of your ships, you can transfer crew and resources to help with the situation. You could even make automated supply ships and bases dedicated to holding extra fuel or life support resources. In other words, just compensate with larger volumes and planning."},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:12:10Z","Content":"First stop in low Kerbol orbit is almost never a good idea, unless you plan on going interstellar.

It\u0027s close enough for a rescue mission if it goes wrong, but it will let you see if you missed anything, as well as being a good staging point to top up on fuel, machinery and other consumables just before you leave.\n\nAlso, bring fertiliser. Even in an open loop system, you\u0027ll be able to make your mass go a lot further with a combination of lossy Mulch -\u003E Organics conversion and Mulch \u002B Fertiliser -\u003E Organics conversion: one unit of fertiliser is effectively worth six units of mulch, or nine units if you\u0027re using MK-V converters."}]}
