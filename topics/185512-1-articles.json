At first, I made a hexapedal walker. Eventually I got bored with that and tried to make a bipedal walker. I found it very hard to make it stable enough, and to make the walking cycle so the legs didn\u0027t impede each other. After finally building a walker which worked well on Duna, I realised it would make a good challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe walker must be bipedal - 2 legged. The legs can be made out of any selection of robotic parts, but they must be legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe walker must walk. As much as I liked the Frog Klapaucius made, it is not a walker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt must work either on Duna, or on 1/3 gravity on Kerbin. I recommend Kerbin because of the runways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should require minimal control input. That is, you do not need to be constantly righting it and preventing falls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt must have enough EC generation to work. \u003Cstrong\u003EInfinite Electricity is not allowed\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt must make it 50m without exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried to make these rules as loose as possible, so that as many crazy contraptions as you can think of are allowed. Mods are allowed, but the joints should be from Breaking Ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
