You absolutely want to do a gravity turn or similarly optimized ascent as if you were aiming for a parking orbit. The directness of the direct ascent profile comes from the zero time delay from reaching a stable orbit until burning for escape. If you take a typical ascent-park-escape mission profile and reduce the time spent in park you approach the direct profile. The nice thing about eliminating the parking orbit is you can choose a lower point at which to go hyperbolic since the time spent in the thin upper atmosphere is so small that the drag losses are overshadowed by the deltaV gains from being lower. The downside is the absurd levels of planning and precision required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T22:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth Effect\u003C/a\u003E, the lower you burn off your fuel, the more you get out of your dV.

In addition, getting into a parking orbit gives you much more flexibility on when you start your transfer burn; if you miss your burn window in a 30-something minute orbit, you can try again on the next orbit. If you miss your burn window on the launch pad, you\u0027ll have to wait six hours for Kerbin to rotate back into position.\u003Cp\u003EFor optimal efficiency, you should use a prograde parking orbit, so you can take advantage of the extra velocity from Kerbin\u0027s rotation. Then you should perform your transfer burn such that you escape Kerbin travelling in the same direction as Kerbin orbits, giving you a hohmann transfer out to Duna. This will give you the lowest possible velocity relative to Duna when you encounter it. Finally, tweak your encounter to fly as close to Duna as possible, taking advantage of the Oberth Effect again to make your capture burn easier. Then you can perform any aerobraking necessary to get your final orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same principle applies to superior planets (Dres, Jool, and Eeloo). For Eve, the principle is the same, but you want to time your burn to escape Kerbin travelling opposite Kerbin\u0027s orbital movement, cancelling out some of your orbital speed relative to Kerbol and fall inward to Eve. Moho is more complicated, because it has such an inclined and eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Augustulus91","CreatedById":63734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T22:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the response, i will go through all the different answers, but i assume that doing a gravity turn is clearly the better option (as i am not using any tools, so it\u0027s hard to time certain orbits (for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn slingshots)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T22:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETreat yourself to Engineering Redux.
