Why not turn the KIWI model into a fusion reactor?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, fusion reactors are a little bit funny, they aren\u0027t like other reactors because they need a constant supply of electrical power in order to function. Once they are running, that is not a problem, provided you keep them with a generator, they will fulfill their own power requirements with ease. The only problem is if for some reason your reactor shutsdown (overheating or whatever) you may not only lose power \u003Cem\u003Ebut also the ability to restart your reactor\u003C/em\u003E. In other words: be careful about turning your fusion reactors off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it\u0027d test it out on a plane, so I have to build a little assembly to make it work. Once the reactor is started, we can dump the launch clamps and fly! Using Fusion Power, we have something much more readily flyable than those heavy and slow fission planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the pictures below, the fusion reactor is, like the nuclear reactors, capable of breeding tritum. You can thus carry a supply of Lithium with you in order to breed more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KyNgPCy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KyNgPCy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p2LXVHj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p2LXVHj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k9IbxFx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k9IbxFx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebtw can 2 reactors share one electrical generator between them?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jaevko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jaevko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe wiki seems to be down (the main page still loads, but not any of the other pages).

I\u0027ve been experimenting with it a bit.\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that Thorium is good with respect to nuclear waste is that it is lighter than Uranium, as Uranium absorbs neutrons you get transuranic elements immediately while Thorium has to work up through a chain of several neutron captures in order to reach the same point and that\u0027s far less likely to happen, of course, you\u0027re dealing with massive collections of atoms so that just translates to a smaller proportion of those atomic species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can usually do something with actinide products when you have a breeder reactor though and turn them into something useful, you\u0027re much better off with short-lived high activity fission products than a bunch of actinide waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFTR is a really neat design but I think it has been both over and under-hyped by different groups respectively.

One of the main pressures for that might be in selling LFTRs to non-nuclear weapon states because thorium reactors are harder to produce weapons grade material from, existing nuclear states might prefer to use their large stockpiles of existing waste as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to present it as something that has some real and useful advantages but also a few slightly irritating drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantages to the LFTR reactors is that thorium is a lot more common than uranium, it takes a lot less ore to run a reactor, (1 ton compared to 150 tons of uranium ore) uses less fuel to generate the same ammount of electricity (1 ton of thorium compared to 35 tons of uranium) and the LFTR reactors are pretty foolproof, using less than 1 atmosphere of operating pressure, thermal breeding creating less inherant neutron radiation than fast breeders, liquid fuel can expand as it overheats, slowing reaction and preventing meltdown, and the freeze plug allows for dumping the fuel into a 100% passively cooled tank, preventing a chernobyl or fukushima type meltdown.

Reason we\u0027re not using it? There\u0027s too much money to be made with the current system. That\u0027s the ONLY reason.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an advantage of Molten Salt reactors, Uranium or Thorium and many of the other countless Generation IV reactor designs with passive safety features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisadvantages of Thorium include there is no infrastructure set up for Thorium fuel production, as far as I\u0027m aware even the prototype LFTRs have usually gone straight to the stage of using U-233 rather than actually starting with the Thorium so all of that would have to be established. Protractium-233 has a long half-life and is bred as an intermediary between Th-232 and U-233, meaning you have to take it out or suffer from it degrading your neutron economy until it decays to U-233 which complicates operation. You also can\u0027t just start with a Thorium fuel cycle, you need some kind of neutron source to get the whole thing going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, LFTR is a neat idea but there are lots of other good nuclear designs out there, Uranium and Thorium. Choosing between them on abudance grounds is pointless, there is enough Uranium available on land to power the world for thousands of years and enough in the sea for hundreds of thousands at only moderately increased cost - I estimate 40,000 tons of Uranium per year for 100,000 years - enough for 40,000 1GW plants (or 2.5x current worldwide energy useage). Breeder reactors might multiply that by another 100 or 200 so there\u0027s a fair bit of room to increase both supply and lifetime simultaneously. So, Thorium has plenty of time to catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main pressures I can see for Thorium use are in countries without domestic Uranium supplies already available (like India, which is actively pursuing Thorium research) or development in western countries to sell proliferation resistant power plants to other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t really care which fuel future nuclear reactors use, countries can build whichever is most convenient for them for all I care.
