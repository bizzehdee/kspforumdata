I am not convinced this is a mod problem.\n\nProblem: I had a station already in orbit around the Mun that included 2 docking ports. I docked capsules to each without incident, and undocked one of them and flew it away without incident. Then I docked a lander there for refueling before a Mun landing, but when I select \u0022undock\u0022 on the relevant clamp-o-tron, nothing happens; the ship continues to be treated as part of the station. It rotates with the station, all parts and parachutes continue to appear in staging, etc. I cannot select undock again. If I return to KSC or save/reload, the problem persists -- I can select undock again, but the same issue occurs.\n\nInterestingly, when I opened the save file to see if it could shed any light on the problem with a mismatched pair of docking ID\u0027s or some such, I found that while the functional docking port (the one from which I can detach a capsule) is correctly designated as docker and dockee, the malfunctioning pair has the line \u0022state = docked (same vessel)\u0022 on the stationside port instead of listing it as a docker. It would appear as if the lander has somehow lost its identity as a separate vessel.\n\nETA: Note -- in case it is interesting to anyone, the problem was reproducible. I backed out to an earlier save where the station existed, but the ship I docked did not. I created a similar ship, flew it out to rendezvous, and docked, and the same issue occurred.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T21:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by qvcatullus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T05:10:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m having the same issue.
