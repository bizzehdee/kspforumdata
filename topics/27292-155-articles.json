So it\u0027s another mapping mission, have a couple of viable sites at varying latitude now that look doable and have completely tapped out the science above the surface.

All can make the transfer to my HKO station with varying crew/payload ratios. Testing unfortunately claimed the lives of 4 test-pilots (whitesuits). Despite this the next project gearing up is a spaceplane designed for Laythe, which must be flight-capable by next months Jool window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork on my first vanilla Jool departure has been so anticipated that I now have 11 craft in space prepping for that window. the 11 interplanetary craft are all CM/landers, with a variety of lander designs destined for different moons. As I write this there are a further 19 support craft in LKO or higher, tankers, tugs etc. Several craft are carrying probe rovers/landers and since I use RemoteTech I am now designing a comms-hub craft to travel in the middle of the armada. Basically an unmanned vessel with a dish and the biggest omni-directional I can fit. Every CM in the fleet then carries max-ranged omni\u0027s also. This means the entire fleet must travel as a pack or I will lose control of unmanned vessels. Hopefully once at Jool there will be enough CMs sitting about round various moons that I at least get regular semi-predictable control windows for the rovers and unmanned landers to get the job done. I am carrying a couple of relay sats along to help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I also just this moment reliased that every CM/lander design i\u0027ve built, of which at least 25 are currently in space, has no re-entry ability for the CM pilot. Guess im gonna have to bring em in through the station and spaceplanes. Well that design error stops right now, its what happens when you throw kerbals everywhere and the first mission is still running as the 26th launches.
