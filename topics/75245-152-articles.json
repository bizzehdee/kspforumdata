The ones I currently have unlocked are a 1 Megameter antenna to get things into space, a 5 Megameter antenna to get things farther out, a 20 Megameter dish with a 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 wedge, and a 100 Megameter dish with a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 wedge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe arrangement on the satellites are one 5 Megameter antenna to get them into position, two 20 Megameter dishes (one points at the Mun, the other points at the next satellite in line [1 points at 2, 2 points at 3, and 3 points at 1]), and two 100 Megameter dishes (one points at Minmus and one points at active vessel, until I expand my network).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, my issue is sudden unexplained connection loss. Satellites should be in range of the 20 Megameter dishes that are the basis of their connection, and yet they just don\u0026#39;t connect. What is happening?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou are saying they point at the next satellite but there\u0026#39;s nothing pointed back? One way communications don\u0026#39;t work that well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince you have dish pointed at active vessel it may seem like the system works sometimes when you have the right satellite active.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithaniel","CreatedById":146402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T15:47:08Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Varsi\u0027]You are saying they point at the next satellite but there\u0026#39;s nothing pointed back?

Okay, well, what if I were to increase the wedge of the 20 Megameter dish to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and then point each one at Kerbin? That would place the other two satellites within the wedge and, I believe, would thus grant 2 way communication. Does this solve my problem?\n"}]}
