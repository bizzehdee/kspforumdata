You can see in the log (figure 3) that this is happening not during 2G takeoffs or any other violent manuever, but while the ship is coasting in orbit or on the way to Mun. Some time into the flight, the engines simply decide they\u0027d rather not be part of the rocket anymore and just float away. There\u0027s no sound effect or explosion, so the first time it happened I didn\u0027t know the engines were gone until I was 500m from touchdown on Mun, ejected my booster stage, and found myself falling like a rock. This keeps happening to that ship design even after I added 3 struts between the engine and the fuel tank above it. Now is this a bug, a design flaw, or some aspect of .16 parts that I haven\u0027t encountered before? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, snot.

Just yesterday, in fact. The image is pretty tiny, but I think my lander is configured similarly to yours, except that I have those LV-909 engines running at launch.

Those engines did not disconnect during the first few flights, only after loading the .craft file the next day.

I don\u0027t know if I mentioned it then, but I had those same 4 engines from your specific .craft file fall off. I remember it clearly, we were talking about design efficiency and I reached orbit with your craft, and then time warped to line up a Mun shot. Coming out of time warp all 4 engines just floated off into space, I think I even took a screenshot. I went back to the VAB, removed the engines, tanks, and associated parts, including the struts, saved it, and then rebuilt it exactly how it was.
