You are better off with something small and nimble for starters. Weight is not problem itself, but proper placement of rcs port on complicated design is. With small ship, you do not need much thrust to translate and reaction wheel can nullify small torque. On large ships you need to be very careful with rcs port placement, lest any translation swings your axis around. I\u0027d say its wise to start small, like apollo-style mun landing and work up from that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing career, retrieving all biomes is good practice for both (somewhat) precise landing and docking: Go down, grab science, get up, catch up with orbiting tanker/lab, clean up experiments, top up tanks, rinse, repeat. When i did this first time, docking was half-hour chore. At the end, I could do it in a minute with eyes closed, not to mention nice load of science at return module :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you start to fiddle with big stuff, get the RCS Build Aid mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
