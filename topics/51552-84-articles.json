The other way around works OK. This effect breaks, just for example, Apollo style missions where you have say a \u0022CSM\u0022 craft with a long range dish and an omni antenna left in orbit. You cannot then establish a comms link via omni with your lander \u0022LEM\u0022 craft\u0027s antenna. So signal loss happens as soon as your two craft undock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Re-downloaded and tested version RT2_2013.12.18.21.39 and yes it causes for me an instant KSP close to desktop if you press any of the buttons in map view (Linux only issue perhaps?).
