You may develop any type of mod with this (as long as it requires custom resources other than the vanilla liquid fuel and oxidizer).*\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Resources: There are 51 resources, each of them are intended for a specific use and have a small story!\n\nSection 1: The Future Resources\n\nResource One: Tritanium\n\nTritanium is an extremely hard material useful for building rockets that survive insane re-entry heat or high speed landings, it is popular among many government-driven space companies due to it\u0027s high availability in the large business market.\n\nUse: Most likely a economic resource that can be made using Duranium.\n\nResource Two: Dutanium\n\nDutanium is another extremely hard material used in thing similar to the uses of Tritanium, but Dutanium is used to make Duranium. It is very popular in start-up companies due to the fact that it can be found at our closest celestial neighbor, the Mun.\n\nUse: Like Tritanium it should probably be used in some economical form.\n\nResource Three: Molten Tritanium\n\nMolten Tritanium is a liquid form of tritanium, it is used when one wants to form or pump tritanium.\n\nUse: Transport for tritanium.\n\nResource Four: Molten Dutanium\n\nMolten Dutanium is a liquid form of dutanium, it is used when one wants to form or pump dutanium.\n\nUse: Transport for dutanium.\n\nResource Five: Deuterium Crystal\n\nDeuterium Crystal is a crystalline form of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It is commonly used as bug spray in the non-space industry, but in the space industry it is used as high-grade fuel for rockets that need to do a mission to a far location but not take 10 Kerbal\u0027s lifetimes to complete.\n\nUse: High grade rocket fuel.\n\nResource Six: Tritium Crystal\n\nTritanium Crystal is a crystalline form if tritium, an isotope of hydrogen. It is commonly used as matches in small quantities, but is also used as an extremely volatile fuel for rockets destined for failure.\n\nUse: High grade rocket fuel, the part should have a high chance of failure.\n\nResources Seven: Hydrogen Terate\n\nHydrogen Terate is a popular explosive among military space vessels, it\u0027s explosive power can turn class E asteroids into dust.\n\nUse: Economic, or a part that has this resource in it, the part would have to have a high chance of failure.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates: Updates are usually regular, they may come earlier or later, depending or what I am doing. Every once in a while I will do an update week, a whole week filled with updates!\n\nContribute: If you want to contribute to MMR please e-mail me at [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec898288899e9f8f959884898e999f8582899f9fac8b818d8580c28f8381) (contributions are adding resources or getting into ender\\_scythe\u0027s group, if you are in ender\\_scythe\u0027s group you agree to help with updates and future mods!)\n\nDonations: I am currently not accepting donations!\n\nDownload: Download Here-[http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230592-many-more-resources-mmr](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230592-many-more-resources-mmr)\n\nGood-bye! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe license for this add-on is All Rights Reserved\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:49:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ender\\_scythe**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:48:41Z","Content":"What makes this mod better than [this one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998) which is already in use by several popular and well-maintained mods?\n\nE: Ah, I see, this one focuses more on science-fantasy resources and has no basis in reality (your Carbon resource, for instance, is far too dense, and Hydrogen should actually have a density other than 0).
