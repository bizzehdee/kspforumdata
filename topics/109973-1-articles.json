It is very popular in start-up companies due to the fact that it can be found at our closest celestial neighbor, the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: Like Tritanium it should probably be used in some economical form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource Three: Molten Tritanium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolten Tritanium is a liquid form of tritanium, it is used when one wants to form or pump tritanium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: Transport for tritanium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource Four: Molten Dutanium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolten Dutanium is a liquid form of dutanium, it is used when one wants to form or pump dutanium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: Transport for dutanium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource Five: Deuterium Crystal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeuterium Crystal is a crystalline form of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It is commonly used as bug spray in the non-space industry, but in the space industry it is used as high-grade fuel for rockets that need to do a mission to a far location but not take 10 Kerbal\u0027s lifetimes to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: High grade rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource Six: Tritium Crystal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETritanium Crystal is a crystalline form if tritium, an isotope of hydrogen. It is commonly used as matches in small quantities, but is also used as an extremely volatile fuel for rockets destined for failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: High grade rocket fuel, the part should have a high chance of failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources Seven: Hydrogen Terate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen Terate is a popular explosive among military space vessels, it\u0027s explosive power can turn class E asteroids into dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse: Economic, or a part that has this resource in it, the part would have to have a high chance of failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdates: Updates are usually regular, they may come earlier or later, depending or what I am doing.
