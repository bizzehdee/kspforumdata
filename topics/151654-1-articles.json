suppose completing the world first missions up to a returned landing with flags from the mun would be the challenge (no minmus missions to enhance science return), i base this on how difficult science return is (especially weighted against cost if you wanted to farm kerbin, those launches are pretty heavy if youre trying to reach the poles or badlands, 12 science isnt going to be worth it after a while), im one mission from landing on the mun i think and i cannot fathom the build, ive had to cheat contracts just to keep my funds near able to afford my launches so id imagine an official challenge run would have been much more tedious and time consuming given the marginal return on investment, these launches are very costly with the need for so many engines and basically twice the normal launch size. im banking on a decent return on science from my current \u0027orbit the mun\u0027 mission because i sank the goo canisters deeper into my vessel, but i can also imagine they will explode anyway when i reload the save. this is with a 3k mps reentry, so thats already me saving a kilometer per second worth of fuel to slow down when i get back just to avoid exploding on contact with reentry plasma, this is definitely quite a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 im using the fixed version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E which would seem only fair given the amount of experimenting it takes to get the right \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and also have enough delta-v. beyond that im on 1.2 so most of my favorite mods arent updated, but given the changes to things like delta-v costs and transfer windows (youre going faster so you need way different transfers, i found trying to get to the mun without instrumentation meant a completely different path than i normally take) i would say the only thing against the rules is mod parts for your ship itself. so stock boosters engines fuel tanks etc. the spirit of the challenge is to be as stock as possible but obviously the nature of the changes means builds need more feedback in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or deta-v. contract packs would be sort of cheating in my book, considering in my opinion, the broken nature of the contract system works greatly towards the challenge. you dont get many realistic options from the standard contract system other than to charge towards world first missions just to break even and earn enough to build a bigger vessel next time and also have upgrades to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and launch pad. and those upgrades are basically essential from start because the 30 part limit and weight limit prevent you from being able to achieve orbit entirely, at least with early tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim not sure if there would be hard mode beyond the initial challenge, i havnt calculated a transfer window to duna nor have i calculated my delta v costs or my encounter velocity, i hazard a guess duna may be out of reach until you get significantly deeper into the tech tree but i suppose the inherent unknown of this mission qualifies it for hard mode. i dont see how a point system could be put in place, i havent found many ways to innovate launch builds beyond the russian route of adding engines like a motherloveer to the first stage. the main challenge to this in my opinion is that pulling off a manned landing and return from the mun will take as much effort as a manned launch and return from duna, but you will not have anywhere near the tech needed. i still cannot even exit my craft off world, so i cannot even complete the challenge once i make my first landing LOL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"galactictaco","CreatedById":112257,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T02:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso my update is landing on the mun is next to impossible, at least given this play thru. its over 100k units to launch (i was at 150k\u002B) and i didn\u0027t manage to get any landing gear tech or small construction pieces (it could be done but more trouble than its worth without higher tech level) so landing ended rather poorly,wound up sideways and stranded (altho i think had enough delta v left, about 1300 ish), science jr won\u0027t survive reentry. this challenge might be more fun to\u00A0try than it is possible to achieve.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmunar orbital velocity was around 750 at an altitude of 50k so more doable than it first appeared but still a substantial challenge. will be diving back in eventually but losing every piece of science off a cheated back craft because reentry heating at 3k mps is rather disheartening. science survived munar orbit, but the munar lander i cheated home still violently erupted on entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macktruck6666","CreatedById":118221,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T05:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say multiple difficulties. 1.5 gravity for easy.
