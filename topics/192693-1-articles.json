That\u0027s not actually the case. Both of these are actually a soup of quarks and fermions. But if you take a snapshot of the proton or neutron at any given time and start matching up particles with anti-particles they could annihilate, you\u0027ll be left over with 3 quarks. These are called valence quarks and they\u0027re always there. You can\u0027t say that it\u0027s these three specific quarks over there, because that\u0027s purely arbitrary, but in the count, there will be 3 left over. Well, what about all the other particles? A lot of them really are just these three valence quarks bouncing back and forward in time! And in fact, there are only two possibilities for a lone particle. Either any given particle is part of that valence quark trajectory, or it\u0027s part of a loop. And loops are even weirder, because it\u0027s one particle on a closed trajectory that covers some stretch of time resulting in interactions as if it was a whole bunch of particle and anti-particles, returning to the exact point in space and time where it started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes all of this a lot worse is that no particle takes just one trajectory. Each particle moves along every possible trajectory, meaning we can\u0027t say for sure if a particle is part of a loop or a valence trajectory. It can be both.\u00A0One of Feynman\u0027s important contributions was the mathematical description of this fact as part of path integral formalism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point, you\u0027re really forced to accept that the very\u00A0idea of a \u0022particle\u0022 is just us trying to assign familiar properties to unfamiliar math, not unlike people of antiquity assigning human personalities to forces of nature. It\u0027s still convenient for making some explanations easier to follow, and Feynman\u0027s diagrams are a fantastic tool for sorting through math, but you can only take the particle analogies so far before it breaks down, and it\u0027s something you have to be careful with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-31T21:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2020 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-01T23:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223764173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585687326\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/31/2020 at 4:42 PM, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat reminds me of a Feynman story.\u00A0 Feynman was looking at how to include the Pauli Exclusion principle in his QCD.\u00A0 Suddenly in a flash of insight he knew what explanation Wheeler would come up with.\u00A0 Although Feynman doubted it was true, he wrote it down anyway and then went to go see John Wheeler.\u00A0 In the course of their conversation Wheeler proposed the following theory:\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectrons travel forward in time, anti-electrons travel backward.\u00A0 The reason why two electrons cannot occupy the state is because there is only one electron!\u00A0 A positron travels back and allows another version of the electron to travel forward again along a different path.\u00A0 An almost unlimited amount of quantum states could be occupied by only one or a few particles oscillating between the past and future of the universe.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point Feynman pulled out a piece of paper and handed to Wheeler.\u00A0 Along with a few comments about wild assumptions, difficult to test, etc.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI liked the story about \u0022positrons travel backward\u0022 enough that I had to ask if enough had been assembled to observe entropy.\u00A0 Alas, entropy was moving in the right direction: no \u0022Practice effect\u0022 anti-matter for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101893.The_Practice_Effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101893.The_Practice_Effect\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-02T00:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nantimatter goes backwards makes me think\u00A0about\u00A0negative time. could an antimatter big bang be going off in the direction of negative time while antimatter goes in forward time? one big bang causes 2 universes expanding in opposite time directions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-02T00:31:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2020 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-02T06:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223764899\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585787391\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nantimatter goes backwards makes me think\u00A0about\u00A0negative time. could an antimatter big bang be going off in the direction of negative time while antimatter goes in forward time? one big bang causes 2 universes expanding in opposite time directions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth matter and antimatter have positive energy, so they move along the same trajectories in space-time - just in opposite directions.
