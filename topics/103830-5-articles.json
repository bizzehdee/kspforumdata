Heat, while MUCH better in 1.0.4 than 1.0.2, still needs some tweaking and bug-fixing. However, at least things in the present system USUALLY tend to stabilize at some less-than-fatal level, even if they glow and have thermometers on them.\n\nAs to the precoolers, they are just a new 3rd version of a 1.25m fuselage/fuel tank/air intake. They don\u0027t really do any cooling. Their advantages over the older fuselage/fuel tank/intakes are 1) they have straight sides so it\u0027s easier to radially attach stuff to them, and 2) they have less drag due to no protruding parts or bulging sides."},{"CreatedByName":"Spacetraindriver","CreatedById":149403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T17:52:12Z","Content":"I may not be a diesel locomotive expert, (STEAM ALL THE WAY!!) but that does not good."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T20:56:51Z","Content":"Hm, would radiators help?
