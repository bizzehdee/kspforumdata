While there is no official kudos for ship size relating to a specific destination the commitee recognise it was a smaller ship than the last one which made it to Moho (which is a hard place to get to) and back and would like to say it was a commendable feat of distinction which must have required great patience and planning.\n\nThanks for your video mission report and welcome back to the K-Prize party guest list aka the roll of honour.\n\nPS The K-Prize committee unanimously voted to award a discretionary  *Slingshot Supremo* for this mission for its use of multiple slingshots to reach its target  and make a landing on the innermost planet of the Kerbol system and return. Only one other *Slingshot Supremo* has been awarded, to dvader for a remarkable 2340 year Altitudinalist Record attempt, which seems an appropriate symmetry, for now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-28T14:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2021 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-30T04:15:38Z","Content":"Neat.\n\nI have a Minmus capable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but can\u2019t get back without a refuel."},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-30T14:40:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Admiral Fluffy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Neat.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have a Minmus capable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but can\u2019t get back without a refuel.\n\u003E \n\nAdd some Xenon!"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-30T15:47:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 53 minutes ago, AtomicTech said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Add some Xenon!\n\u003E \n\nHas NERVs, and that gets it most of the way there.
