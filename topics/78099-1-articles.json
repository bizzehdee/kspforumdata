YAY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is AWESOME! I\u0027m going to the MUN! Well, they only told me to orbit Kerbin, BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT! MUN!!!!! They put me in a tiny pod again. There are lots of buttons. I pressed a few of them before we started. Alrey caught on fire. It was great! They say launch is in a few hours. CAN\u0027T WAIT! I would so press the buttons now if they hadn\u0027t locked my arms to the command chair. I wanna sing a song! OHHHH, 99 tanks of fuel under me, 99 tanks of fuelllllll...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Transcript edited for length]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay Two: Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey let me push the button! I\u0027m in space. They told me to do experiments and I tried but they yelled at me for going too fast. I don\u0027t like it when people yell at me. It hurts my ears. OH, LIGHTSWITCH! Clicky on. Clicky off. Clicky on. Clicky off. CLICKYCLICKYCLICKYCLICKYCLICKYCLICKY! What was I saying? I did SCIENCE! I pressed more buttons and things scienced. Bill said I did good enough. I\u0027m a good sciencer. OH RIGHT! MUN! Hold on, recordy-thing. I need to make fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay Three: Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027M ON THE MUN! It\u0027s cold here. I like it. I have a jetpack! I spun around a bit with it. It makes FSSSHT sounds. I planted a flag. The pole hit me in the face and I fell asleep for a few hours. My head hurts now. Bill is yelling at me from the other talky-thing. He\u0027s really loud. I asked him earlier if he could come pick me up, my going up things aren\u0027t working anymore. I\u0027m gonna go play with Mun dirt now! Bye!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay Four: Bill\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate Jeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe went off-plan AGAIN! Seriously, why do they keep putting him in charge of rockets? Well, Bob, Wehrner and myself managed to scrape up enough funds to make a second rocket to rescue Jeb. Of course, our entire space program only has $157 dollars left in the budget now. Wehrner says we\u0027ll be alright as long as we get Jeb\u0027s science back. I hope he\u0027s right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay Five: Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s coming to pick me up! I knew he liked me! Bill told me how to move fuel so now I can fly a little. I\u0027m gonna go spinning round the MUN! SONG TIME! 99 piles of dirt in the pod, 99 piles of dirt! Stomp one down, kick it around-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Transcript edited for length]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 6: Bill\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright. We\u0027re about to intercept Jeb\u0027s craft. He only had enough fuel for an extremely low orbit. We\u0027re going to dive down to a mere 17k above Mun to meet with his craft, then make a strong burn to keep us within distance. Jeb should be able to gather all 8 pieces of science and jetpack over here. We hope. I am NOT looking forward to spending the next two days in the capsule with him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 6: Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! *FSSHT* WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! *FSHT FSHHHT* WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Transcript edited for length]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay 7: Jeb and Bill\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Kill me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: And look at THIS dirt! Its slightly more sparkly than the other dirt! And this goo glows a funny color. I put some up my nose. Now I smell like jam!

Science is recovered. We have enough funding for a few more months of space exploration. I can\u0027t get his stupid dirt song out of my head. Get it out. Get it out. Get it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[And that is how my 0.24 mission to the Mun went. Vostok 1 is still in orbit around the Mun, circling in the dark for all time...
