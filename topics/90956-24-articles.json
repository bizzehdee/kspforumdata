That he can use real life knowledge to achieve things in game, so I hope to have it as realistic as possible but not overcomplicated, just that things in the game behave as true to life as their Real life counterparts, So means Real Solar system and FAR ect, Hopefully the quality of the ground textures and physical interaction/terrain can be improved in RSS as I can imagine he will be playing about with car/truck/crane/boat type contraptions before he can handle flying things :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:15:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GorillaZilla\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reveral","CreatedById":148245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T14:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gkorgood\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gkorgood\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi all. Just wondering if the community fix for AVP in 1.0.4 works with EVE Overhaul? It\u0027s beautiful as is (but requires the x64 hack to work usably) but this water is just incredible, and the clouds and the sky and all of it. I\u0027ll try and find the post in the AVP thread with the community repack if anyone wants it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou kinda can make most part of AVP pack work with this version of EVE. It what I was trying to do for last 2 weeks. You just have to translate old cfg files to new system cfg cystem. Then you need manually to look up all dependand mods forum threads and look for latest versions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings that dont work is LensFlare, because doing anything with .asset file doesent work any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also I would recommend delete terrain CFGs from terrain part of EVE overhaul, both from Kerbin and Mun because it doesent work properly yet, and will mess up a bit. Reason is because terrains part of EVE messing up stock KSP terrain textures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample as soon as you plug in any kind of texture to it, - Stock steep, mountan textures disapears or goes black, and all overall ground textures goes to much darker mode. Which will make visuals wors, plugging in midtex custom textures, like cornfields would fix that, but you cant do that, because then your cornfields will be visible from space as a tiles, including from ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guewss you could use kopernicus if you really want to make ground textures look nicer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you should do, is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st. install this EVE first, delete terrain in gui from Kerbin and Mun. then ckick apply then save. Alt\u002BE is for ingame gui. In gui create clouds for any planet you want, then create atmosphere, tweak all corresponding values like colors, density and such. all the cfgs from AVP that you would use, will not work with this EVE, but you can take the values from old cfgs and translate them your self into GUI, or new cfg file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. After you done with clouds install TextureReplacer, mostly for changing skybox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Install latest Scatterer plugin. Tweak lightning in scatterers gui, so your planet does not look like a ghost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Distant objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. planet shine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. chatterer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemmember, all the CFGs from this mods that dependand of EVE will not work. You have to translate all numbers and cfgs by your self. It is easy while you get a hand of it\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:18:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reveral\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsimmons","CreatedById":85423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Reveral\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Reveral\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou actually already can.
