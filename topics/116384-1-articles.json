I got the itch and started a new career, but now all my craft seem to be exploding on re-entry! Especially the materials bay! I\u0027ve also noticed that even if something as simple as a surface-mounted battery explodes, it will usually take multiple parts with it. Honestly, I don\u0027t really have a problem with this, as I felt re-entry was too \u0022easy mode\u0022 before, but after scanning the update notes, I see no mention of this. Plus I seem to remember testing out 1.0.4 with a couple of craft and not having any problems. I just wanted to check and see if re-entry is \u0022for reals\u0022 now, or if maybe my install is screwy?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T10:36:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by archnem**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T07:41:07Z","Content":"Re entry is harder now. There is also altitudes where if you\u0027re going certain speed (interplanetary speeds) then instead of heating up very rapidly, you\u0027ll just explode as if you hit a brick wall. \n\nI believe ablator is much more important now. In 1.0.3 it was said that you could return from the mun and even minmus without an ablator shield, but in .4 you need a shield even from the mun. Personally I\u0027ve always used ablator since reentry hearing became stock, but my ablator is being used alot more in .4 than in .2. \n\n.I do miss .2 in that I could return a probe from jool and even with a periapsis of 10 km, it didn\u0027t completely explode as long as I had ablator and was pointing it prograde"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:05:19Z","Content":"One simple approach is to always survive (unless you use Life Support and have limited resources...) is to skirt the edge of the atmosphere.\n\nI don\u0027t know what would need to happen for Kerbin to kill you with 52km periapsis; if you are within Kerbin orbit you can reduce to 48km and it will keep ejecting you through the other side until you\u0027re down to a safe speed.

Sure that depends on you ship design. But on Duna you can enter atmo with a non streamlined vehicle withour airbrakes. My entry wasn\u0027t even smooth. I deorbit for around 60m/s.

They even give you Pitch and Yaw control in atmosphere.. you can ride your retrograde vector down on rails without RCS.\n\nA full blossom of 8 airbrakes on an orange tank, with engine, 2% fuel, probe body, battery and safety chutes, from an orbital trajectory of 150k and an entry vector at 14k does very well. I even tried it with a service bay attached and the chutes inside the bay to make sure the chutes would not get destroyed. Even heavier, and yet still deployed the AirBrakes while in orbit, and they brought my speed down to below 250 m/s by 5k or so, From there, you just pop the chutes... done. Or, if you want to avoid the weight, land propulsively. I do this by adding one more small fuel tank and disabling it before launch, then re-enabling it on re-entry. FYI I am playing with FMRS for testing setups for this and my new career mode attempt and it is working very well.\n\nBut even without AirBrakes, if you set the deployment pressure at the right level, you can deploy the chutes in space, then wait until a bit before they will deploy and if you saved some fuel, burn off your velocity so the chutes don\u0027t get destroyed.Its trickier, but again.. possible to do if you test a few setups first.\n\nLanding gear is another thing.. oof. I think I may try installing cubic octagonal struts to bring them down low enough. Until this point, I have been landing my orange tank stages in water because of this. I did add some linear RCS and tested it with that to prevent \u0027fall over destruction\u0027 as well as to give a bit more maneuverability during re-entry, but that seems a bit overkill, and adds too much weight.\n\nMy Next Step: Install vernier RCS engines and play with them to see if they are more efficient and controllable for re-entry retro burns than a MainSail. Using one large chute as well as AirBrakes, velocity can come way down, and you only need to cancel a small amount of Delta V to land safely."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:56:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know why more people don\u0027t talk about how magical AirBrakes are for re-entry assistance.\n\nFor me airbrake just seems too overpowered that I\u0027m not going to be surprised if it\u0027s nerfed in some future version, so I\u0027m only using it when absolutely necessarily, which doesn\u0027t include most of the Kerbin reentry."}]}
