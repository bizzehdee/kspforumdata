I got the itch and started a new career, but now all my craft seem to be exploding on re-entry! Especially the materials bay! I\u0027ve also noticed that even if something as simple as a surface-mounted battery explodes, it will usually take multiple parts with it. Honestly, I don\u0027t really have a problem with this, as I felt re-entry was too \u0022easy mode\u0022 before, but after scanning the update notes, I see no mention of this. Plus I seem to remember testing out 1.0.4 with a couple of craft and not having any problems.

I even tried it with a service bay attached and the chutes inside the bay to make sure the chutes would not get destroyed. Even heavier, and yet still deployed the AirBrakes while in orbit, and they brought my speed down to below 250 m/s by 5k or so, From there, you just pop the chutes... done. Or, if you want to avoid the weight, land propulsively. I do this by adding one more small fuel tank and disabling it before launch, then re-enabling it on re-entry. FYI I am playing with FMRS for testing setups for this and my new career mode attempt and it is working very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even without AirBrakes, if you set the deployment pressure at the right level, you can deploy the chutes in space, then wait until a bit before they will deploy and if you saved some fuel, burn off your velocity so the chutes don\u0027t get destroyed.Its trickier, but again.. possible to do if you test a few setups first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear is another thing.. oof. I think I may try installing cubic octagonal struts to bring them down low enough. Until this point, I have been landing my orange tank stages in water because of this. I did add some linear RCS and tested it with that to prevent \u0027fall over destruction\u0027 as well as to give a bit more maneuverability during re-entry, but that seems a bit overkill, and adds too much weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Next Step: Install vernier RCS engines and play with them to see if they are more efficient and controllable for re-entry retro burns than a MainSail.
