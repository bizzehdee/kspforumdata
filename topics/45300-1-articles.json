It is not a matter of thrust, delta-v or structural integrity, it\u0027s simply the fact that the craft refuses to do anything but go straight up. I have tried adding stacks of reaction wheels, removing all reaction wheel torque (including the cockpit torque), Ive even action-grouped boosters to force the craft to turn over and added side-ways firing rockets. The cargo contained one micro reaction wheel, which i have removed to no avail. I cannot make the gravity turn, so i reach my apoapsis with almost no horizontal speed. This is frustrating me to no end. Wings with control surfaces seem to make no difference either. I\u0027m close to giving up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft minus the boosters weighs about 120t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECOG \u002B COT: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OS53OaX.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/OS53OaX.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HTY75Ic.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/HTY75Ic.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire thing: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pple1qn.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/pple1qn.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d think it would flip over, right?

It is attempting to torque the craft upright, while the engines attempt to turn it over, causing the structure to bend like it does at the end of the cargo bay. Would this be a IR (infernal robotics) issue? The cargo contained one micro ASAS node (since removed) and 1 small and 1 medium size remote control node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone assist?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-09T00:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2013 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SilentWindOfDoom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T13:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that the boosters burn out asymmetrically is a pretty big problem.
