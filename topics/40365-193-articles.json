You have any tips on building a Fusion \u002B Atmospheric turbojet space plane? I have tried just about every iteration I can imagine.

There was someone building DT vista ships using fusion reactors and generators earlier in the thread, I believe you need 8 of each, assuming the fusion reactor and generators are both upgraded. You can also power it with one upgraded 3.75m nuclear reactor and 3.75m upgraded generator.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki/Reactors\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReactors List\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I thought fusion was better than that, ah well better redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T04:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually 6 helium-3 powered reactors are needed now. 8 D/T will not be enough after those changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, \u0022brayton cycle generator\u0022 sounds really bad, the only way to power DT vista with this (unupgraded generator) is 3.75m thorium reactor.
