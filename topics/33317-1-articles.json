All Gliders seem to be based on more or less hidden control probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is a concept that is working in KSP for an Kerbal controlled Hangglider. Moving on a ladder towards a barrier creates a force in direction of your movement that is affecting the whole craft. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s absolutely not physical correct but ... ok ... thats KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see by the first glider, i attached a bunch of ladders in order to change the flight direction by moving the kerbal on the plane so the center of weight would change... But Kerbals seem to have no weight when climbing on ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy accident i realised that colliding with one of the blades has an effect on my flight direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/fGusqo3QHnI\u0026amp;fmt=22\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/fGusqo3QHnI\u0026amp;fmt=22\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E \u003Cp\u003E(craft files in video description)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst one in the video is the base glider which was first build for testing controlls by changing the center of weight.
