Little heads up for when you get to trying bardge landings. Don\u0027t bother trying to put something into orbit at the same time. I\u0027ve tried for months to get mechjeb to fly my second stage to orbit while I land the stage. ( also vice versa ) with BDArmory 300km load distance. But MJ bugs out after seperstion. Its guidance goes haywire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it worked remarkably well with a single stage grasshopper. I can boost a grasshopper out over the ocean to simulate a flight, activate MJ landing guidance to the pad. Switch to a craft back at KSC and actually watch the grasshopper boost back and land right back where it took off, it\u0027s amazing. I\u0027ve also landed grasshoppers on barges I placed out at sea. Again worked amazingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the moment I put a second stage above it the guidance fails entirely. So despite floating point errors it can\u0027t be done. You cannot put something into orbit and land the first stage at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow.. I couldve maybe tried landing the stage manually. But... It was hard enough as it is to manage two craft . That for it all to come down to your piloting skills... I don\u0027t know. Barge landings would be very difficult. Boosting back to land however. Maybe not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just a heads up when you get to that point. If you just go for a \u0022for show\u0022 approach and let the second stage fly off and despawn mechjeb ( should you use it ) will give you trouble with landing the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it is possible MJ didn\u0027t like the huge load distance.
