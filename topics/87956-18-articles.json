I am playing with ADIOS tech tree that i am modifying a bit, and i just wanted to know which tradeoffs did you have in mind with propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont mind its a bit OP i will jut put it very high in the tech tree, probably just before rovers alcubierre drive\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t look at other mod tech trees yet but heres the ideas behind the engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurboramjet: Very efficient in dense atmosphere, still pretty efficient in thin atmosphere; If compare with stock turbojet, which goes out at around 30km on kerbin, turboramjet will remain active until 46~47km or speed \u0026gt; mach 7. I would think of it as a hypersonic engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinearAerospike: just an larger version of stock aerospike, slighly more efficient than normal rocket engines at all altitudes, but still consumes fuel at fairly fast rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDark Drive: Just a over powered LFO engine that looks cool. Not suitable within atmosphere but once in space you have enough dv to go any where\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EARIE: alternate to the stock rapier engine. Difference is that is much more powerful at all altitude; in high-medium dense air it can have high fuel consumption, but still much lower to that of normal rocket engine. I once did a test to compare ARIE and rapier engine, both got the small spaceplane to 700km altitude, but ARIE required only half the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grunf911","CreatedById":102151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T12:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDark drive is to use if you wanna make ssto to eloo.
