AoA-sensitive leading edge slats are helpful but not essential; AoA settings on elevators are likewise helpful but not always essential. Low wing loading allows for tighter turns; finned missile designs are interceptors, not dogfighters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne non-obvious trick: use the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDynamic Deflection\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mod with the default settings reversed (i.e. reduce deflection at low pressure, increase it at high).\u00A0This allows you to set control surfaces to deflect little at low dynamic pressure (e.g. at low speed, just after takeoff) while still retaining high-deflection ability for supersonic aerobatics. Again, it takes a lot of fine-tuning of the DD settings to get this right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T03:56:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
