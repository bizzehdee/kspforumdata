For so long I played vanilla KSP, wanting more than anything for the devs to hurry up and give us something like Infernal Robotics (which I knew existed, but I modded X3TC [i am sms_747 who made the X-Timelines universe] so much that I stopped playing the game and instead spent all my time changing things and eventually (for now) the game itself lost all of its awe and flavour* - I was not predisposed to doing the same to KSP). Eventually I heard of the grabber and could barely contain my excitement. What a disappointment it turned out to be, this large, lumbering single-purpose item which couldn\u0027t be pivoted at will or effectively packaged away when not being used. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I appreciate that it has its uses (even if I refuse to use it as a docking object because it\u0027s a blatant cheat), but nothing compares to sirkut here\u0027s creation. After being disappointed with the grabber I decided to bite the bullet, and Infernal Robotics was the first mod I downloaded (obviously). I now cannot understand why I waited so long, when used alongside TweakScale (which I wish everything could instantly be converted to be useful with) It has become possible to make vehicles which are bounded only by our imagination and creativity, which can be made neater and so much more alive and dynamic. I couldn\u0027t help but adjust the scale availability of these robotic parts so that they fit on my (invariably) small craft. There is something fascinating about a innocent-looking tube which secretly has all manner of utilities neatly stowed away. Vanilla craft, with their exposed utilities and unashamedly jutting side-slung loads seem clumsy by comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do apologise to sirkut for posting an issue which was created by my own meddling, I can understand how irritating that must be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* seriously, how pants is X-Rebirth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-24T11:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2014 11:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Stephanie the Viking\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tinyboss","CreatedById":74022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T14:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stephanie the Viking\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stephanie the Viking\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E* seriously, how pants is X-Rebirth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisappointment of the centruy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T22:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started getting this message spamming my log whenever I\u0027d switch to the launchpad view, and it was bringing my framerate down to about 1 frame every 2 seconds, making the game unplayable:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Part.OnTriggerStay (UnityEngine.Collider other) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Filename: Line: -1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally I had the following mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry Continued\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkOS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaserDist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I installed Infernal Robotics, and Procedural Fairings, and at *first* it seemed okay, and didn\u0027t cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil I tried making a larger ship (which didn\u0027t even have any IR parts on it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got that spamming message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I dis-installed Procedural Fairings.
