I\u0027ve set up a \u003Cstrong\u003Ereasonably\u003C/strong\u003E reusable space program in the Jool system, with a Kethane mining operation on Bop, a nuclear powered tug to haul it to a space station in Laythe orbit, and small reusable VTOL-SSTO vehicles to ferry crew back and forth between the ground base and the orbital base, blah blah blah... But I wanted to take it a step further, and set up a fueling station on the ground on Laythe, but most of the deposits I see are under the water! No problem, build a floating mining rig, right? \u003Cstrong\u003EFAIL.\u003C/strong\u003E It doesn\u0027t actually extract kethane unless the drills contact the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I added a bunch of telescoping sections (via the MagicSmokeIndustries robotics package) and put the drills on the end of those. It looked promising at first, a bunch of sequential parachutes brought it down safely, but it seemed to be riding a bit high in the water... As I extended the drills down, instead of pushing them down into the water, it pushed the rig up into the air!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jAz5F\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/jAz5F\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far, the majority of the mass was above the drills, so this isn\u0027t exactly what I would have expected... Is there a hard limit to how deep something can go in KSP? Do I just need to make it heavier?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T00:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you\u0027ve got a few different options.
