However, this limitation is actually due to the choice of reference frame. For example, in the solar system, we do not use the Sun for gravitational assist because if we consider two points on the same orbit around the Sun at the same distance from the Sun\u0027s center of mass, their relative velocity to the Sun does not increase, and thus there is no change in energy. But when we use a planet for gravitational assist, we change the direction of the spacecraft\u0027s velocity relative to that planet, without changing its magnitude relative to that planet. Meanwhile, because the planet is in motion relative to the Sun, we change the magnitude of the spacecraft\u0027s velocity relative to the Sun, resulting in a change in energy. Of course, the above energy changes are all relative.The content above may seem a bit confusing and strange, but what I want to convey is that rather than saying that gravitational assist only applies to black holes orbiting other objects, it is more accurate to say that whether gravitational assist works depends on the mass of the black hole relative to the mass of other stars in the game and whether there are other predetermined massive sources of gravity. (Since the game involves multiple star systems, a predetermined massive source of gravity is possible. Otherwise, there would be a black hole in the middle of the galaxy or the complex multi-body motion of multiple star systems, but this would require the introduction of interstellar multi-body gravity, which the developers probably do not intend to do.)Finally, it\u0027s possible to introduce a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy (a rotating Kerr black hole or a rotating charged Kerr-Newman black hole), and we might be able to obtain energy through the Penrose process (although the game probably won\u0027t allow us to do so). We could also introduce a black hole orbiting the center of the galaxy (a stellar mass black hole), or a black hole in a binary star system (which would involve multi-body gravity and orbiting the center of the galaxy). There may also be a small black hole within a star system (with a mass several to tens of times that of the Earth, and no one knows how it formed, which is a mystery).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224271291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221681224422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EFrom my understanding of GR, a spinning black hole would also do, even if it\u0027s not orbiting anything else.
