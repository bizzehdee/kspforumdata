Once one experiment had been processed it couldn\u0027t be processed in the other lab. I was going EVA and manually collecting the results and bringing them back to the 2nd MPL but it didn\u0027t make a difference. \n\nProbably better if you want to take along two MPLs is to have them separate on-site - it will mean doubling up on the experiments."}]}
