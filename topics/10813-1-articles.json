It has a max speed of over 370 m/s below 5000 meters, highly maneuverable and easy to take off with. If in moments of distress, the twin booms can simply be decoupled from the plane (I don\\\u0027t know why you\\\u0027d want to do this, it\\\u0027s just kerbal I guess) to let the cockpit freefall and crash glide softly to a landing. It was modeled very *roughly* like the P-38 Lightning."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:10:02Z","Content":"I normally reserve the names of large birds for large craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Jatizso","CreatedById":21720,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:21:01Z","Content":"I don\\\u0027t consider the albatros too large of a bird neither do I consider the plane too small, but I changed it."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:29:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\\\u0027t consider the albatros too large of a bird neither do I consider the plane too small, but I changed it.\n\nAn Albatross is a seagoing bird with a very wide wingspan."},{"CreatedByName":"Jatizso","CreatedById":21720,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:35:42Z","Content":"I know, but overall they\\\u0027re about as big as a goose.\n\nAnyways I think the name is of minimal importance."}]}
