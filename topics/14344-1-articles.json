I also never realized the sun could be so far away from the solar system\\\u0027s barycenter. Since the sun contains somewhere around 99.8% of the solar system\\\u0027s mass, I always thought the barycenter would be very close to the center of the sun. I mean the earth is something around 98% of the earth / moon system and the barycenter is within the earth. I guess I never took the size and density of the sun into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T15:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENifty!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve always heard that the Sun revolves very slightly because of the pull of planets, just like swinging an eraser on a string, your hand wobbles too, but I never imagined it being so irregular or so large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how, if it is, connected to the sunspot cycle.
