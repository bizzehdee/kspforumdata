Update to the new file system would break compatability with 0.19 yet provide almost no benefit on a proper install of 0.20 (some similar models, maybe a tiny memory drop but thats about it - the mod doesn\u0027t have enough similar parts to get as bigger drop as something like B9 did). My later work the Rover ASAS and Pitch Vector Engine were made and tested in 0.20.2, hence they are only on the new file system.

The more powerful an engine, the faster you\u0027ll go. The more powered wheels, the less power each gets! This has been tested and is working. Engines need their own dedicated model, and the suprisingly hacky method I\u0027ve used just for testing isn\u0027t as laggy as expected (infact I\u0027m shocked it runs smoothly, odd enough...)

I want to use it as cargo bay for truck. The truck is inside the cargo bay, with docking clamps attaching it to the fuselage, using micronodes connected to the front node of the fuselage (or the floor). When I launch on the runway, the truck falls through the floor of the fuselage. Same prob if I do two launches and I dock it afterwards. Apparently, if the object inside the bay is connected in any way to the fuselage, then on launch the object will fall though the floor, it giving the object no support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks mate, love ur mods!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kenobi McCormick","CreatedById":57254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T10:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming each engine model is one individual cylinder that one can assemble into any combination as necessary, right?

The Engine system will look for ModularWheels and assign the power output directly, skipping over anything else. So the Engines won\u0027t be usable by other mods. I don\u0027t mind if people look at the source for ideas though on how they can do something similar with plane engines for instance. Though if I was doing it with aircraft, I\u0027d probably attach props directly to engines, and then get them to go through the parent parts and count engines behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FERCONEX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FERCONEX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EErr...

Sadly there isn\u0027t any other way really, KSP doesn\u0027t detect internal collisions on a vessel, and if you dock a truck inside a plane they now count as one vessel, so it\u0027ll just sag through it. Qauntum struts can avoid this to some degree if done right, but it\u0027d be tricky. Another solution would be using KAS, as you could winch the truck to correct heights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really the best way is to go with either KAS or Qauntum Struts.
