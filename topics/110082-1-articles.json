The most I can get out of it is about 700m/s deltaV left one in an orbit of around 80k. It just feels like I\u0027m wasting fuel or something and could get more out of it. The roll of this thing was to be an all encompassing craft. Something capable of lifting 13.5 tons into orbit, having a bunch of fuel to refuel a station onboard all the while still having enough lift and all the sensors and experiments to go to other worlds built in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the problem of me being about half way in the tech tree which severely limits what stuff I can actually build this thing out of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft itself is stock. But it has scansat, protractor, kis and kas accessories. If you guys need a mod less version just let me know.

I have an SSTO which sort of resembles yours but it is slimmer, smaller and ends up with less dV on a 80km orbit, It was tweaked from a previous, smaller, version which I had in 0.90 and I had to increase its fuel capacity and use the new intakes to get it to orbit again, in 1.0.2 so, I would guess there is nothing wrong with the way it flies, things are, simply, tougher in 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, one thing that matters when climbing is to trim the aircraft for a constant, not too steep, not too shallow, climb angle, I find that a 25 to 30 degree pitch up optimal for my SSTO, this will keep a fair climb rate while, at the same time, allow speed to build up for as long as possible while using air breathing engines only, the later you switch to close circuit the more fuel, thus dV you save, since air breathing spends much less fuel. Even if you get your SSTO through lower layers of atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, heating up the fuselage ( as long as it doesnt\u0027 blows up), and wasting energy to drag, with air breathing engines it is still more optimal than to keep speeds lower untill you get to high atmosphere and turning your rocket engines on too soon and at lower speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you put your unmodded craft here I will give it a try.
