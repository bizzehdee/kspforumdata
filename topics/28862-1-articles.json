For example, you use symmetry and you put four dockingports jr. on one end of a rockomax X200-8 fuel tank. You send it up, then when you make your other craft, you start from the one that\u0027s already in orbit, you detach the fuel tank with the dockingports to have an exact copy, you dump the rest of the ship (now a lot easier to do with .20) you build your new ship, attach the fuel tank with the dockingports where you want it, send it up, and you should have two identical multiple dockingports that should give you a stong connection if attached correctly. I used this before there was the dockingport sr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I recommend Downloading HydroTech RCS autopilot. Now don\u0027t get fooled with the autopilot part, it can dock things automaticall, but I never use it for that. The interesting part is that it comes with cameras and targets you can attach to your ship. The thing is, it has an option to automatically and perfectly align the camera and target of your choice. So if you switch that thing on, you can do your docking as you wish without worrying of your orientation because it will hold it for you. Really useful when trying to dock really really large payloads. Combining this and the above said method of multiple docking ports make it a lot easier and usually docks all the ports correctly on the first try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope i could help ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Rider","CreatedById":66087,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T19:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are still having trouble just dock as normal...
