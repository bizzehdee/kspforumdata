All you need is to put 4-5 satellites in a high enough orbit so they can \u0022see\u0022 each other, and make sure the space between them are fairly even.

Then circularize at apoapsis as usual (like the others have said, the period needs to be as exact as you can make it). Repeat with the third and fourth satellites.
