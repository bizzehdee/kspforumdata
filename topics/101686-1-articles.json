For me, it was when Shinji\u0027s father willfully ordered the destruction of Eva 04 when it was discovered to have been corrupted by an Angel with the pilot still inside (the pilot was one of Shinji\u0027s friends)"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:13:52Z","Content":"Code Geass\n\nShirley."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T18:00:57Z","Content":"I\u0027m not that easily shocked.

Things pick up some in the final third, stuff hits the fan, people die, the story reaches its sufficiently satisfying conclusion. A few lose ends are tied up, music plays, the credits roll, a little after-credits scene gives warm fuzzy feelings.\n\nAnd then in the last five seconds of the runtime of the last episode, a single line of white text is displayed on a black background.\n\nAnd the watcher\u0027s jaw impacts the floor with enough velocity to make a crater."}]}
