It would be really useful for reinforcing big parts on small hinges etc all the time they\u0027re moving (not just before and after you move them.)\n\nWhat you\u0027re really talking about here are mechanisms whose length can change in response to input, which is a piston in IR terms ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nImagine if we tried to do it with a strut. Then either:\n\n1) The rate at which the strut expands and contracts would need to be set by the user, or\n\n2) The strut simply expands and contracts in response to movement at the endpoints.\n\nBut if (2), then the strut will also expand and contract in response to unwanted motion, effectively providing no benefit. And if (1), then the strut is indeed a servo.\n\nWhat might be possible (logically, at least), is some kind of \u0022damper\u0022 part. Imagine a spring-like part that requires some minimum force to extend or compress. \n\nThen, also imagine that all IR servos are configured to always transform downstream parts no matter what force is required. I believe this is in fact the case... when we talk about IR parts being \u0022weak\u0022, I don\u0027t think we mean that they *can\u0027t*  lift heavy things, but rather that the joint is just \u0022loose\u0022, moving in degrees of freedom it shouldn\u0027t have, etc. (Will confirm by testing tonight)\n\nThen, if such a \u0022spring-strut\u0022 existed as a damper, that might work.

So are you using Windows Steam Mac Linux? And as Tarheel stated there could be something wrong with your install (it happens to the best of us). First try deleting all the files created by Module manager in your game data folder (but don\u0027t delete MM itself) If KSP still hangs. Try backing up your saves, and starting with a clean install of KSP, install IR first then all your other mods one at a time. None of the mods you listed I believe will conflict with IR.

If so I\u0027ll avoid doing that and see if the problem re-occurs. \n\u003E \n\u003E -bryan\n\nNo, it\u0027s not a known bug with tweakscale, in fact I haven\u0027t had any problems with it for quite some time, just the behavior you described is very reminiscent of an old IR-TS interaction bug that was fixed in 0.21.3 \n\nIf you can reproduce the bug - can you please post the craft here alongside with the reproduction steps"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr_Goddard","CreatedById":100796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T18:13:26Z","Content":"Now here\u0027s something you\u0027re really gonna like.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ueoi5FY1XX8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n \nWow, major headaches getting the video to post.
