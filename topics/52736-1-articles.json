My ship is not equipped to splash down back on Kerbin, as I was planning on transferring the astronauts to landing capsules once they get back to the space station (International Gas Station, or IGS). Will the soil samples they take remain with them, or will they be stuck up in orbit with the ship upon return?

This is usually fine, though it made EVA reports a bit challenging to code, but it seems that until .23, once a kerbal enters any command pod or stores any science anywhere, they will be unable to pull it back out. Until you store the science in a part, recovering the kerbal on EVA will recover all science. If you do store the science, that science is now stuck in that part, and only recovering that part will recover the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want fully reusable ships in 0.22, I\u0027d suggest \u003Cem\u003Edocking\u003C/em\u003E the command pod to the spaceship, so that you only ever need to launch the command pods and fuel when going on a mission. With 0.23, it looks like the kerbals will be able to pull out science from any part and put it somewhere else on EVAs, but until then, all science must be sent home in the part it was first stored in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T21:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info.
