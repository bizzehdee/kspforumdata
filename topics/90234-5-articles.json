Its array, placed on a filed Rockomax-3200 because that totally makes sense, includes 3 Communotron-88s, 3 DTSM-1s, 8 Communotron-32s, 16(!) Communotron-16s,and a Gigatro.

It consists of 5 large SAS units, 4 large RGUs, and 4 Large Batteries. It\u0027s supposed to make calculations, handle the life support system and general station maintenance, as well as conduct research in exosphere properties. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower Storage Module \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all this useless junk just wouldn\u0027t be realistic (or useless) enough without requiring a crapload of charge, at day and night. The night is covered with 6 large batteries and 8 radial ones (Batt-man, accept no substitutes!)

That\u0027s why the boys back down at Kerbin brought us a gorgeous retrangular solar array.

Someone clever enough to ship all the construction infrastructure to a distant planet and then build a monster station in situ should be able to fully score what they manage to create.

Its array, placed on a filed Rockomax-3200 because that totally makes sense, includes 3 Communotron-88s, 3 DTSM-1s, 8 Communotron-32s, 16(!) Communotron-16s,and a Gigatro.

First, the landing mass of any manned shuttle or space plane is subtracted from the weight on the pad or runway on takeoff - basically getting a points credit for a manned reusable craft. Second, some sort of points bonus in the 2-3,000 range for a station whose components were launched entirely within the cargo bay of a shuttle or space plane. That way, if someone can make a station entirely out of components that fit within a cargo bay, they\u0027ll score both bonuses. If the station includes one or more components which were too big to fit in a cargo bay, then they would simply get reduced negative points for runway/pad mass.

Total part count: 593. Notice the two landers. They have about 2100 m/s fully fuelled, which is meant to be enough for a Moho landing and just barely enough under ideal conditions to get back to Kerbin. But since I don\u0027t have the patience to test either of those scenarios, we\u0027ll skip that for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B100 x 141.57 t final station mass = 14157 pts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2 x 1208.6 t launch mass = - 2417\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B100 x 6 Kerbals onboard = \u002B600\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u002B200 x 32 comfortable seats = \u002B6400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B500 for a manned science lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E= 19240 x 6 (Moho) = 115440 pts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECongratulation, Maolagin!

The new Mk3 parts are turning out to be pretty efficient on a kerbal per ton of station basis, so I think we\u0027ll see more of those. I can\u0027t even imagine how many solar panels you\u0027d need to make that thing work out by Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to add the badge to your sig.
