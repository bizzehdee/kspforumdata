I somehow inspired myself when making a comment somewhere a while back saying something along the lines of \u003Cem\u003E\u0022...Because the numpty who installed the accelerometer on the pod couldn\u0027t be bothered to connect it to the CAN bus\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe keyword here being CAN bus.

What it does in it simplest form is allow electronics to communicate with each other without having to implement, for example, a full TCP/IP stack. It is found in many, if not most, modern vehicles, cars being the most familiar application.
