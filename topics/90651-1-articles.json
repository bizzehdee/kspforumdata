It probably will work, but if it doesn\u0027t you are pretty much on your own (though other Mac users may be willing to help here, the addon author can not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Kethane not showing, you must scan the planet before you can see it using the scanner devices from orbit. Low polar orbits are best to ensure you can scan the whole planet. By using a polar orbit, you take advantage of the planet\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T16:11:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T16:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll-right, It works.
