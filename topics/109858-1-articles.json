One is ballistic transfer which is one elliptical trajectory which starts from Kerbin and ends to Dres. Other is three burn transfer. You boost the ship first to elliptic orbit in Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane. When you arrive to node line you make inclination correction burn to Dres\u0027s orbital plane. At arrival you make a normal braking burn. It depends of launch window which method needs less dv between Kerbin and Dres. However, the ballistic transfer is much more easy to do with KSP\u0027s defective trajectory planning tools and I recommend that for beginners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need proper tools to calculate orbits and burns. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlexmoon\u0027s launch window planner\u003C/a\u003E is a good one.
