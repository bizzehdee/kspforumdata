You can run the engines to 90% overheat with no problems; if it goes past there, just throttle down a bit."},{"CreatedByName":"Lulix","CreatedById":35117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T08:56:01Z","Content":"Thank you"},{"CreatedByName":"Black Dog","CreatedById":144087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T08:58:55Z","Content":"First of all: More engines result in more thrust, but decrease the maximum range you can get out of your fuel. So more engines will only help if you plan on landing somewhere and then getting back into orbit.\n\nSecond: I\u0027ve built more rockets with \u0022Nerv\u0022s than i can count, and even though they tend to get into the dark red overheating status they never seem to actually reach it, unless you try a non-stop 100% burn with a total of deltaV of over 4.000 m/s. And even then you can just shut them off for a minute or so and they are good to go again.\n\nSo my tipp is: if you just wanna propel a probe through the solar system use a single \u0022Nerv\u0022. If you wanna get back up from somewhere (and have a lot of time) still only use 1-4 but add an additional \u0022Poodle\u0022 or \u0022Rhino\u0022 as a kickstarter and to utilize the fuel out of all the adapters that have oxidizer on board anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:05:01Z","Content":"It helps a lot if you attach them directly to a tank, the larger the better.

The dry fuel ratio of a rocket fuel tank with no oxidizer is horrid. Dry mass percent is roughly doubled. Chemical engines also do poorly when all tanks can be half full at most.\n\nDon\u0027t use the Lv-N for probes though. That 3 tons is a lot of weight for something with a payload of under a ton. The only time nukes are good for probes is to beat 5 km/s single stage without ion engines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T11:31:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:22:56Z","Content":"I must admit to just not using the NERVA since 1.0.

Personally, I\u0027ve given up on the Universal Tug as it turned out to be way too large for almost all missions. A generic Modular Design created a lot of overhead (returning, sorting, refuelling...) and also caused part count issues. I\u0027d recommend to build one basic tug that\u0027s good enough for almost anywhere (will be about 1/3rd as large as this one) and have a rear docking port where you can attach the heavy-duty booster to eject your Jool-5 mission."}]}
