So as a second challenge can you make a low tech SSTO that can carry Jeb with a Mun capable lander. The craft must reach orbit (it can can go farther if you think it will help with the mun mission) before detaching Jeb and his lander. The SSTO craft must then return to the KSP and land in one piece. Jeb and his lander them must go one and complete the mun contract and return to Kerbin landing in one piece.
