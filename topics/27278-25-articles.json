Immediately, she saw her friends, but chose not to talk to them. They had other things on their minds. Entrance was swift and simple: just say your name. Once Abigail was in, a camp guide directed her and her friends to a cabin on the right side of the camp. In the middle of the camp, there was a smooth and shiny plane of what appeared to be fallen pine needles. Inside the cabin, it looked exactly like a normal house inside Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s neighborhood, but with a few exceptions. By the door, there was a rack.

Then, she saw a double wide bed, of which there was one for everyone in the cabin. She put her bags on the left side of her bed. Just as they were all settling in, one of the camp guides opened the door. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWelcome to the camp!

This led many parents to assume it was a fishing camp. But, in reality, it was something far more energetic, fun, and exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=2]Chapter 3: Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Arrival[/h]Abigail Darton and her mother got out of the car. They got Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s bags out of the trunk. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSee you on the 15\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mother as Abigail headed towards the entrance. Immediately, she saw her friends, but chose not to talk to them. They had other things on their minds. Entrance was swift and simple: just say your name. Once Abigail was in, a camp guide directed her and her friends to a cabin on the right side of the camp. In the middle of the camp, there was a smooth and shiny plane of what appeared to be fallen pine needles. Inside the cabin, it looked exactly like a normal house in Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s neighborhood, but with a few exceptions. By the door, there was a rack. It was labeled, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBoot Rack.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 So, Abigail took her light pink rain boots out of her bag, and put them on the rack. Then, she saw a double wide bed, of which there was one for everyone in the cabin. She put her bags on the left side of her bed. Just as they were all settling in, one of the camp guides opened the door. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWelcome to the camp! Get prepared to learn why the camp is called Camp Mudonia!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 This was exciting for Abigail. She would learn the biggest thing to know around the camp. Once she had put her rubber boots and waterproof clothes on, the camp guide opened the door again. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s go!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 All of her friends were as excited as Abigail at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=1]Chapter 4: So this is why it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s called Camp Mudonia![/h]Abigail, along with her friends Tessa and Emma were directed to the edge of the collection of pine needles. The 3 of them were lined up side to side. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COn 3, take a few steps forward!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said the guide. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COne, two, three!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Abigail stepped forward. Immediately, she realized that she was not stepping onto pine needles, but instead stepping into thick black mud, which crawled up half of her boots. Tessa and Emma appeared as surprised as Abigail felt. They realized that they should\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve realized that it was a mudding camp; it was called Camp Mudonia! They were directed to keep walking forward, getting deeper with every squelchy step. Finally, they reached the center of the camp. There, the mud was less than a millimeter from getting into their rubber boots. At this point, Abigail and Emma were getting pretty nervous. The camp guides took pictures from solid ground. For a while, Abigail, Tessa, and Emma thought they were no longer sinking. Eventually, they realized they were completely stuck. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI guess this is why we have to wear waterproof everything.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 They walked out of the mud. As they looked back at their boots, Emma\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s boot tops appeared to snap shut, and then disappeared, signaling that the mud had filled the boots. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll rescue them,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Abigail. She stepped back into the mud, but when she reached the boots, she slipped and fell, and appeared to be waist-deep in the mud. However, it did provide a good perch for rescuing the boots. She guessed where Emma\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s boots were, and pulled them up. She could hardly tell that they were even the boots, since they looked like two big lumps of mud. She threw them back to Emma. Then, she picked up Tessa\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s boots and took them back to her. Now, for Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s muddy stuck boots. She decided that instead of carrying them, she would try to put them on and wade out in them. As she put them on, however, she saw that she was not in the center of the mud. So, she took two steps forward. Abigail\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s boots slowly sank and disappeared under the mud. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh no, they disappeared!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 exclaimed Abigail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mud story that I\u0027m typing so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
