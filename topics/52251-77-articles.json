Mechjeb said the jet expended 8256m/s but that seems really high for what it did, and for only using 41 units of fuel. 591m/s of rocket dV was used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 223m/s for the parachute-less landing on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are links to 7 Imgur albums detailing the trip . I may have gotten carried away with the pictures, sorry about that. Note that the \u0022delta-V stats\u0022 that Mechjeb reports are confused by docking ports, and since the crossfeed goes on and off a lot the numbers go all over the place. The custom window \u0022DV Expended\u0022 seems quite accurate as long as I recorded the carrier dV before it redocked and got zeroed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/13tuj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/13tuj\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/yUjGt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/yUjGt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/vxPWJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/vxPWJ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/P65S0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/P65S0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/D6WaS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/D6WaS\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/DOrHC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/DOrHC\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/kXCeC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/kXCeC\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWOW OMG that is a lot of flybys. how long did that take you? i just did a \u0022hard\u0022 burn for jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaddbo","CreatedById":117784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T02:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022immelman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022immelman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep far more patient than I am that\u0027s for sure.

The low-dv path was tricky enough- trying to do it with a low-thrust ion drive, always worrying about the sunlight would have made it too tough for me. So I decided to go for the lowest dv possible since that\u0027s my favorite thing. I wish now I hadn\u0027t used the jet on Laythe since it distorts the numbers, but one of my design criteria was to keep it below 200 tons without using nukes. I\u0027ll be happy 2nd from the bottom of the low-mass subchallenge, if it mentions I did the mission with 22,124m/s. Although if I\u0027d used a rocket and parachute on Laythe I could have done it with 18,000m/s. Unless I can prove that Mechjeb records jet delta-V incorrectly.
