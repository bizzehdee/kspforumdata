The airtight pressure vessel of the cone-shaped pod would hopefully keep a Kerbal safe. Of course, to get a Kerbal up to altitude, a small boiler was filled with boompowder and a conical nozzle attached to it to provide the thrust. To guide it through the air, there are some thin bolt-on fins, and to land there are some metal girders leftover from the VAB construction.[/quote\u0027]\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CBREENQ.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CBREENQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RT-5 booster in the picture has been thrust limited to 28% and reduced to 42 units of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and so the Fat Arrow Mk1 was pulled along to the launch pad by a small steam locomotive named Tomoly, and Jebediah Kerman eyed the contraption suspiciously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HjsZYGs.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HjsZYGs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m supposed to get inside that thing?\u0022 Jebediah radioed. \u0022No.\u0022 said Gene Kerman at mission control. \u0022You\u0027re supposed to just watch it fly up.\u0022 Jeb looked disappointed. \u0022YES OF COURSE YOU\u0027RE MEANT TO GET INSIDE THAT THING!\u0022 Gene yelled, so loud the radio crackled. Jeb thought he might\u0027ve been able to hear him from all the way over at mission control if it weren\u0027t for the suit muffling all the outside sound. Jeb smiled and climbed up the repurposed boiler and sat in the capsule, making sure to close the door nice and tight. Unfortunately he knocked one of the stabilizer fins off the rocket in the process. He didn\u0027t mention it. \u0027It\u0027ll be fine\u0027 He thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dwC84dv.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dwC84dv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guys at mission control watched the clock closely, and wondered whether Jebediah Kerman really was the best idea for the first Kerbal in Space. Sure he won pretty much every car race he ever entered, but they all wondered if a fighter pilot would be a better idea. \u0022You\u0027ve got about a minute left.\u0022 Gene told him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pressed the button labeled \u0022Press this when you\u0027ve got about a minute left\u0022 and a small set of cables connected to the capsule to a small battery pack on the ground became unplugged, and the capsule was now under its own power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked out the window and saw the Mun. \u0022Oh, joy!\u0022 He thought. \u0022I should like to go there one day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was now only 15 seconds left, and the time rapidly decreased. Gene Kerman took a sip from his coffee, and set it down. He asked all of the stations if their telemetry was good, and they all replied \u0022well... er... probably. It depends...\u0022 and would eventually revise their answer to \u0022good enough I suppose.\u0022 Of course they said \u0022Good enough at the precise moment that Jeb\u0027s alarm rang and told him to press the starter key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket went up like a shot! As it went up, Jebediah looked out the window and saw the ground and ocean recede. It rocketed past the 1,100 altitude record set by the famous fighter pilot Valentina Kerman, as the fuel ran out, where it then coasted all the way up to 16 hectometers. As far as a Kerbal is concerned this is a vacuum. Low air pressure and temperature would kill a Kerbal quickly and the radiation would kill him slowly if it weren\u0027t for the protective capsule. Of course, it wouldn\u0027t matter that much considering he was only up there for a good ten seconds. But ten seconds of freefall is more freefall than any other Kerbal has experienced before. The only thing going through Jeb\u0027s mind was \u0022This is cool, I want to go higher.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe then started to descend back to the Kerbal Spaceport Complex. The fall would be fatal if not for an expertly devised system in which a parachute made from all of Gusby Kerman\u0027s sweaters was made to fold up in the tightest possible package, and the parachute unpacked itself wonderfully. The empty Fat Arrow Mk1 rocket motor hit the ground with a THUD and the parachute cut. After a few seconds contemplating his flight, he kicked open the pod door and got out, landing on the ground with a thud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KWb4P\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Live feed of Mission Control was played through, and Valentina secretly hoped this launch would fail. If not for the Space Program, she\u0027d be given the go ahead to launch her new jet plane which would be able to go fast enough to give the Fat Arrow a run for its funds. But alas, the government was siding with the Space Program because of the more practical uses of it. She held her cup of tea, and sipped it once or twice.

The pilot is Jebediah Kerman, who is currently riding on a small steam train pulling the rocket to the launch site. The time here is three o\u0027clock and the sky is clear, and we are all very excited for the mission. I am talking to Dr. Wernher von Kerman, the head rocket designer at the Kerbal Spaceport Complex.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina scowled at the designer\u0027s name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, hello Mr. Reportmanson.\u0022 The high pitched, almost squeaky voice of Dr. Wernher von Kerman said. \u0022The Fat Arrow Mark One is a great step ahead in technology, though most of it is in the crewed section. Plenty of rockets have been created in the past, one from the ancient period was once even rumored to have entered a brief orbit. In fact the rocket section is little more than repurposed junk, including an old boiler and leftover gunpowder. The real advancement is really in the capsule. Such capsules lay the groundwork for space stations which might deliver communication across the globe nearly instantly. If you live on the Eastern hemisphere you probably won\u0027t hear this broadcast for almost an hour as it gets processed at various radio stations. With a space station, two totally separate villages could communicate instantly, and a live radio broadcast would be only seconds away! Of course, the first step in maintaining a space station is the capsule, a test device which can prove that an airtight vessel can practically protect a Kerbal from the hostile environment of space.\u0022 The reporter made a sound that was something like an \u0022uh-huh\u0022 mixed with a \u0022whaaa?\u0022 He then spoke. \u0022Alright thank you Dr. von Kerman for your time.\u0022 The reporter paused for a moment, and then began again. \u0022The pilot of the rocket is the world-renowned race-car driver Jebediah Kerman, who had his claim to fame by excecuting what has since been called \u0027The Jebediah Manuever\u0027 in a race to save huge amounts of time at the cost of not having a squishy brain.

Thus the capsule could be spontaneously disassembled in an emergency.

The launch countdown proceeded normally. By this point an RT-5 type booster launch was mundane at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moment the rocket lifted off, Jebediah took the controls and yawed the rocket over to the side. The first booster was very quickly out of fuel, and the second one ignited. Even more rapidly this one ran out, and all that was left was the capsule. The problem was that Valentina saw the orbital velocity was not high enough. She had an idea that she had been thinking about as a contingency. She turned the capsule to its opposite side and burned the RCS thrusters in the nose-cone. Jeb was surprised, having no idea of what was happening. Valentina then waited until \u003Cem\u003ECorvus 1\u003C/em\u003E was at Apoapsis and thrusted backward retrograde (equivalent to forward prograde; the Corvus nosecone has no back-facing thrusters for forward thrust) to \u003Cem\u003Eincrease\u003C/em\u003E her speed. Unfortunately she forgot to account for how low power the thrusters were. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the next few minutes as the \u003Cem\u003ECorvus\u003C/em\u003E sailed into the night, she held the \u003Cem\u003ECorvus\u003C/em\u003E at the right heading and kept accelerating even until it entered the atmosphere. Jeb then realized what she was doing. \u0022Wait\u0022 he said. \u0022You don\u0027t have to keep accelerating. The A P is high enough that we will remain in space after the quick atmosphere pass.\u0022 Valentina looked at Jeb, Jeb looked at Valentina. Valentina stopped the thrust, and waited to see if Jeb was right. He was. At Apoapsis, Val pointed the \u003Cem\u003ECorvus 1\u003C/em\u003E in the retrograde direction and retrothrusted into a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina was too busy checking the velocity to notice, but Jeb took a picture of the sunrise from orbit. \u0022Wow\u0022 was all he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Frw75\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But it was obvious to Dr. Wernher von Kerman. \u0022If we want to start doing long voyages to the other planets\u0022 he said, \u0022then we need to keep them up there for a while.\u0022 Gene agreed, seeing no reason why not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher had an ulterior motive.
