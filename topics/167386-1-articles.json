Obviously I want these behaviors running without the player having to swap over and run the commands themselves but cannot seam to locate any method for Autorunning scripts in kos\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny one more experienced know of a way to make this happen..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twitchi","CreatedById":73343,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-10T13:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor people playing along at home (and future google searches) I have found a section on boot files in KOS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/general/volumes.html#boot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/general/volumes.html#boot\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears to be exactly what I am looking for.. would defiantly be if I was not loading the vessel via contract.. the wiki states that when you leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\\\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E your vessel is in a prelaunch status and I am not sure if this is the same for vessels spawn in contract..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\ntesting continues\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAppended :\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I can indeed set a boot file to be used.. but for it to start running the vessel needs to enter a prelaunch status,\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I believe this to be a ksp native variable and not KOS specific, but this is speculation based on finding an enum breakdown in the vessel section of the api)\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut unfortunately when spawning a vessel via a contract there appears to be no time spent in the prelaunch stage and the script does not run.. tho it is defiantly there loaded\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am now looking at the craft file of the vessel in case I can find some way to launch in prelaunch..
