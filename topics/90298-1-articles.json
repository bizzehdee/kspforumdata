You could sort of see it from a distance and it lit up your rover from beneath a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really nice if there were more things like this all over the system. Really subtle on the ground but visible from high altitude. If you walked over one (you would have to be stood still on eva) then vibrations would come through your boots and a tinny sound clip would be played. Maybe just a single number (in many languages)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be one at the base of the mountains near KSC that says \u0022Ten...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr they could be at the current anomalies with a random order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you visit the \u0060special places\u0060 in sequence (1-10) it activates a firework display (or other animated easter egg) on Eeloo, the last place you have to visit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit would hopefully have a small footprint and mostly just sit there waiting for you to be a, on eva b, not touching the controls c, on the surface at the right place so it can play a small sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it gets to 10 then you would be stood at the right place on the right planet and so you would be at the right place for the special event, be it fireworks or some other congratulatory thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould be fairly simple except for the \u0060prize\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reckon it would be a good long term quest type contract. You could pick only half of the anomalies and place random triggers on them so a replay would not be the same every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T20:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that there is something like what you want in Fine Print.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T22:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ve used fineprint, and mission control extended and while both are good, they are not quite it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more along the lines of the anomaly set of missions that nova wanted to put in the game (IIRC) that lead to a special easter egg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be possible to do the bones with something like fineprint or MCE but it would operate differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine it randomising after a correct sequence giving repeatability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T15:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDMagic Orbital Science have both parts to squeeze science out of anomalies and missions to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions are buggy though...
