Squad is given a break , to a certain extent, for annoying things small or bigger. All the little issues will be magnified when the game leaves beta. And squad will take the full impact of their newfound accountability, for issues and shortcuts (skybox etc) the game has had for months, sometimes even years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the game lacks anything to keep your interest long term. It needs new planets, asteroids, and maybe even a few more solar systems. While I have more faith in squad than most other developers, with the game being in early access, there was always the hope more might come, because the game wasn\u0027t finished yet. They say anything beyond 1.0 is a thank you. For all we know their gratitude might be less than we expect when they\u0027re sitting on all their full release money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would have liked to see the game use Unity 5 before release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pertrep","CreatedById":136947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T04:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen is a car polished?

This looks like a game created by a team that is passionate about the subject and therefore willing to grow it. Some of the addons are spectacular, demonstrating what a draw card it is. Reviewers may be harsh, but are they spending the time that dedicated players are spending to reap pleasure, or are they checklisting for some imagined gestalt audience that they believe hangs on their every word? Don\u0027t worry about egos, just get the next bunch of Kerbals off the bench and into space where they belong. The future is out there, not in heads of fantasists.
