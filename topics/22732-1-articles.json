I would love this thread to be a place to discuss all things astronomy related. Whether it be the sights, telescope discussion, or beginner tips feel free to put it here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for a little background I\u0027ve only recently gotten into astronomy and do all my observations either by naked eye or binoculars. I\u0027m still familiarizing myself with the various constellations and other places of interest. I would to do some amateur astrophotography but don\u0027t have a set up (tips guys?). I love just going outside and finding my favorite constellations (definitely Orion) and nebulae. Hopefully soon I\u0027ll be able to get to a place dark enough to see the Milky Way in all its glory (I\u0027ve seen the faint band before but it was very faint). Anyway my question for you; what is your favorite target and why? For me It has to be Orion, it was one of the first constellations I saw that didn\u0027t look like a bunch of random stars, plus it contains the amazing Orion Nebula and just is a major facet of the night sky. Orion really started it all for me so it has that sentimental value as well (Look at me getting emotional over stars thousands of light years away!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T04:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a TA for astronomy as a grad. student, my favorite target was always the Hercules globular cluster (M13). It was a great way to teach (and test) telescope skills. It\u0027s easy to find, and on a clear night with the little 6-inch scopes we had available the students who were careful could just barely bring things into focus enough to resolve individual stars (rather than just a fuzzy blob) - which gave them a cool reward for their efforts, and made grading easy for me. (Did they sketch some random star field? No points. Did they sketch a fuzzy blob? Half points. Did they sketch individual stars? Yay! Finding ways to make grading easy is the number one agenda when you\u0027re a TA.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GOOMH","CreatedById":8729,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T03:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast chance to catch the Lyrids tonight! \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/20769-lyrid-meteor-shower-nasa-webcast.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.space.com/20769-lyrid-meteor-shower-nasa-webcast.html\u003C/a\u003E As long you aren\u0027t like me and have overcast skies!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T04:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GOOMH\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
