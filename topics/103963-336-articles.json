No ocean on load, and the atmosphere disappears after switching to a ship in orbit. No sunflare in flight, yet it\u0027s there in map view, oddly. And in addition, kerbin looks extremely brown/tan in orbit (\u002Bno atmo) which I think is new/specific to your build.\n\nI had managed to get the dll from your branch at first and I tried dropping it in my install and I had the same issues. I figured I needed some other part that wasn\u0027t compiled and reverted to the original. Oh, one other detail, when I tried that dll the ocean DID render, but it was almost completely black. It was clear in the shallows so I think it was just reflecting the totally black sky.\n\nI tested the new build with and without eve, sve, and planetshine, but it didn\u0027t fix anything. I have way too many mods, so it could be a conflict. I will try and do a test on a new unmodded save shortly. Let me know if I can provide any more info.\n\nHere\u0027s the brownness:\n\n![dcaaxfY.png](https://i.imgur.com/dcaaxfY.png)\n\nEDIT: My sunflare is not showing up on OpenGL in orbit either. Still shows in the map.

The old builds should work with OpenGL, in theory, but these will not.\n\nI know, it sucks, but squad makes us use effectively two codepaths for OpenGL and DirectX now with the one/two camera system, and I can only personally manage to update this one.\n\nAs for your other bugs, I have not experienced them but there is an atmosphere transition issue I did see.  Please see what happens with a clean install when you get the chance, in DirectX 11 otherwise the report is useless (just remove any commandline things about OpenGL or directX12 and use the included configs in the zip to test).  Sorry I can\u0027t offer more but I\u0027m doing the best I can with limited resources and understanding of the work here. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAlso, these builds require no config fixes.  They should work with the stock config.  The only reason I can think of for that brownish terrain is that you are either using opengl or somehow have a config patch from earlier that is breaking something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-24T12:10:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2020 12:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-24T14:37:10Z","Content":"Ok people, I am happy with the state of things with my builds to the point that I feel I can temporarily support them and at least do some ahead-of-time bug gathering for blackrack.\n\nI by no-means want to hijack his work.

Fix a rare cloud-clipping bug at high angles in low atmosphere.\n\nKnown bugs in this release (Will not fix without PR):\n\n1.) The built in Scatterer shadows are jumpy/buggy, and disabled by default. Despite my best efforts I can only reduce this problem, not eliminate it, so I advise leaving them off. As KSP now provides it\u0027s own Terrain shadows, this is not such a big deal (actually, that may even be the source of the bug). The default settings are set to disable scatterer terrain shadows and I do not support changing that at this time.\n\nTest and report back.\n\nDownload at github:\n\n[https://github.com/R-T-B/Scatterer/releases](https://github.com/R-T-B/Scatterer/releases)\n\nor from my server (grab the highest number)\n\n[http://glacialsoftware.net/ScattererBuilds/](http://glacialsoftware.net/ScattererBuilds/)\n\nThanks all for the help debugging.

I\u0027m hitting more stable fps than I was in 1.8.1 or 1.7.3, or even 1.9.1 stock!  Stable.... not better..... just more steady.  lol.  I\u0027m averaging 80 fps.... slowly adding my mods back besides this one to test their interaction and so far, I\u0027ve got spectra, Eve, planetshine, real real physics extended, distant objects enhanced, and then a long list of others (total of 108).  80\u002B fps on average on ULTRA settings!  And the images are INSANE!  There are \u0022minor\u0022 bugs I\u0027m noticing but they aren\u0027t dipping my fps and they are mostly just there, not a big deal.  #1, when I hit about 200km above kerbin the clouds start to fade out and then a few hundred meters farther and it all loads properly again but it\u0027s the out of atmosphere map view type clouds after.  I\u0027m pondering if that\u0027s either real physics, or extended range though honestly.  I have some minor texture issues over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E at times during launch for brief seconds where a strange flicker will occur then stop.  Not at all sure why.  I tried to screen capture it but they\u0027re short lived, and I didn\u0027t get a good enough view without a video.  I\u0027m calling this golden.... I\u0027m switching my career over to KSP 1.9.1 pending Kopernicus and quite happy.  I mean......... honestly I might do it tomorrow because I have yet to go past Jool.................. I\u0027m en route to Laythe......... have yet to get far enough to warrant using the outer planets mod, which is sad but........... realistically it\u0027s going to be a while............ I can\u0027t for the life of me get past jool with any remaining delta V, and have not made it home from yet.............. don\u0027t tell me tricks, I\u0027ve youtubed and I\u0027ll get there.  I have to learn this on my own sooner or later lmao.\n\nAnyway, HUGE thanks.
