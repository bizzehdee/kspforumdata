Our objective is to get a spy satellite around Minmus to see what they are up to and make sure they do not compromise our own space operations. However, they would easily spot the satellite, and it might lead to lots of backlash in the already heated political picture on the ground. The current plan is to claim that the satellite is a piece of space debris that ended up within the Sphere of Influence of Minmus due to being uncontrolled. However, any significant engine thrust (even ion engine thrust, as they are looking for orbit change and not the glowing plasma from the engine) once they spot it would blow its cover and expose the plan, so we need to minimize the amount of thrust we use to stabilize our orbit around Minmus in hopes that the Kommies do not notice the orbit change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjective: get a satellite in a stable orbit around Minmus while using as little delta V as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: the satellite must be unmanned (Kerbals would get bored and eventually do something that blows the mission such as going EVA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: no glitches, exploits, cheats, Hyperedit, etc (in this case, this means you must cross the SOI border at 1x warp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: once your craft enters the Minmus SOI, you MUST screenshot the maneuver that would be used to create a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: show plenty of screenshots to prove you are not cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: almost all mods allowed due to the nature of the challenge, with a few exceptions (parts mods are fine, while mods that change orbital mechanics are not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring: Scoring is based on the Delta V used inside the Minmus SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallengers: none yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
