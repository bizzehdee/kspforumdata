Now with 0.22 on the horizon (I didn\u0027t play much during 0.21), I\u0027ve decided to release a preview version of the tool I\u0027ll be using for my career mode during 0.22. It\u0027s not actually a tool, it\u0027s an Excel 2010 workbook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR version: It\u0027s a spreadsheet that awards kerbals exp, ranks and medals based on what they do, and a way to keep track of your missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 sheets in the workbook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Mission Record\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has columns for mission name, crew, type of vessel, launcher (if you like to track that), mission objectives, outcome (success, failure), and then the experience section. Basically, you fill in the number of times each of the actions was performed, length of the mission (in days), science generated, and a few other variables. The sheet then calculates a total, which is added to the kerbal\u0027s running total on the Roster sheet (see below). It\u0027s a bit in depth, so if people want, I can write up a little tutorial, but most of the cells have notes attached that explain things a bit better. Finally there\u0027s a column to paste ribbons from the excellent ribbon generator at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/\u003C/a\u003E by Moustachauve, and a notes column to put for example, what went wrong. The only essential columns for the experience to work are the Crew and Experience columns. It\u0027s important to note as well, all the \u003Cstrong\u003EBold\u003C/strong\u003E numbers on the page are generated by formulas, so don\u0027t manually input text into these, or it may break the sheet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Roster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a record of your \u0027kerbalnaut corps\u0027. Simply enter the names of all the kerbals you\u0027ve hired, and then as long as you enter the names the same way in the Mission Record sheet, it will track their experience, rank, and mission time. The Missions column allows you to (manually) record which missions they\u0027ve flown, and the medals column is for medals (see below). The status column is for you to (manually) enter what they\u0027re doing right now (e.g. standby, aboard Kerbal I), and Notes is for anything else - I use it for recording who was first in space, first on Mun etc. Below, you\u0027ll find a black area to record the agency ribbons (like forum signatures), and finally a section for kerbals you\u0027ve killed (you monster). Similarly to the above sheet, all the \u003Cstrong\u003EBold\u003C/strong\u003E numbers on the page are generated by formulas again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Rewards \u0026amp; Ranks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where most of the values are set. Each action has it\u0027s corresponding reward here, and you can change anything in green dashed lines and it will be dynamically applied to the rest of the workbook - bear in mind it will retroactively apply to previous missions too, and could demote your kerbals! The left section is exp reward (which I\u0027ve whimsically called \u0027kp\u0027) and also records how many times each has been awarded (just for kicks). The right upper section is ranks - the kp requirement can be altered too. The abilities column is fairly arbitrary - adhere to that or not, your choice. It also records how many of each rank you have. Finally below that, you have the Medals. Again, completely whimsical, allows you to copy-paste the medal image into the corresponding roster section when you feel like honouring your kerbals - times awarded here is manual. Once more, all the \u003Cstrong\u003EBold\u003C/strong\u003E numbers on the page are generated by formulas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally there is an options sheet which I just put together today - they have explanations attached, and basically allow you to change a couple things about the experience system to your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like you to bear in mind that this isn\u0027t going to be balanced (especially the science rewards, which I\u0027ve balanced based on watching the preview stream) - the rewards are all based on my style of play, which is slowly building up to stuff and repeating things a couple times in different ways. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere will also probably be bugs.\u003C/strong\u003E I like to use ISA MapSat and RemoteTech and FAR and Deadly Re-entry and Kethane and such to challenge myself and also have reasons to launch more missions. A couple of the rewards even depend on these mods (but the options page has toggles for them). There is also a toggle I just introduced to prevent a kerbal gaining more than the their next rank - their current rank\u0027s worth of kp in one go - so if you like to hire 3 rookies and send them straight to Eeloo, turn this one off, or they\u0027ll gain next to nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am of course open to constructive criticism, comments, questions, ideas etc. - if you want to customize this to death and release your own version, go ahead, just write me a quick credit in the post. It\u0027s completely up to you how you use this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, if people want I\u0027ll consider writing a proper tutorial with diagrams and stuff. For now, I\u0027m just going to attach a dropbox link to the file with the first line of the mission record filled in with an example flight of Jeb going to Mun and returning (and you\u0027ll see the rank limiter in action, as since he starts as a Cadet, he can only gain 10kp \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ). To reset, just delete all the cells in row 3 that don\u0027t have bold numbers in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this appeals to at least some people - I know my meticulous organise-y side loves it, and it\u0027s a nice stop-gap until career mode gets some more features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0xjyewy4zsarmhr/KerbalExpTrack0.22Preview.xlsx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0xjyewy4zsarmhr/KerbalExpTrack0.22Preview.xlsx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Requires Excel 2010 or 2013 (only tested on 2010)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome to try it on any other program that open xlsx - no guarantees. I can also convert it to legacy formats, but again, I don\u0027t know what features will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if anyone fancies making a standalone application for this, be my guest. I didn\u0027t because I can\u0027t code for beans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods, please let me know if I\u0027m breaking any forum rules re: hosting or licensing - I\u0027ve never posted files to a forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
