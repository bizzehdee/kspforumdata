If you saw it, then it probably won\u0027t happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere on Mars is much thinner than on Earth. This means that there are less air molecules for the wings to create lift. The wings have to be bigger to make more lift. If the airplane uses propellers, the blades need to be bigger on a Mars airplane than they would be on an Earth airplane to make the same amount of thrust and lift as on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe force of gravity is lower on Mars. This means that the airplane won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t weigh as much on Mars as it does on Earth because there is less force pulling the airplane toward the planet. Still, if the airplane carries a lot of equipment, the wings will have to be larger to create enough lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a lot less free oxygen in Mars\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 atmosphere than there is on Earth. Most Earth airplanes use oxygen from the air to help them burn the fuel in their tanks. The Mars airplane needs to use another form of fuel, take oxygen with it, or carry technology that can separate oxygen from the carbon dioxide atmosphere. Oxygen tanks or other types of fuel, such as batteries or solar panels, add to the weight of the airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Mars is at least 35 million miles away from Earth, the airplane is going to have to fly by itself. Earth is too far away for radio signals to control it like a remote-controlled car. If the airplane has a computer onboard, flight moves can be programmed into the computer before it leaves Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T01:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rainbow Dash\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rainbow Dash\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecalm down.
