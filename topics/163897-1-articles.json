Worked fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I\u0027m now trying to use an OPT spaceplane, and when I try to take off with three modules in the bays bound for the station, I start the spaceplane engines and the throttle goes instantly to zero; engines on but zero thrust and the throttle won\u0027t respond to any command.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I take the HECS/OKTO units off all of the modules, the spaceplane now starts and takes off normally. I\u0027m assuming for some reason with the probe cores in place (one of which has a Terrier for later Kerbin return), it\u0027s getting confused as to which vehicle is the master and which ones are just being carried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the best way to do this?

Then, right-click on your two probe cores and select \u0022hibernation\u0022 until it says \u0022on\u0022. They are effectively shut off now, and will not attempt to control the ship. You\u0027ll have to remember to shut hibernation off after you detach them later. Then just make sure your staging is right and, most important of all, make sure you hit the z button.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T21:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery good idea and duh, I knew that hibernation was there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTragically, however, it didn\u0027t work.
