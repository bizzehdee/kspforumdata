I read in the wiki, that the order of placement is important, but what I ever do, the generated science doesn\u0027t get transmitted. I tried several placement orders, but it was always the same. Sometimes I\u0027ve got messages, that the science couldn\u0027t be transmitted, because there\u0027s no connection to Kerbin, but even if I placed the experiments on the Mun and don\u0027t get this message, the transmitted science was always at 0%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found out, that I can take the science with a scientist, when I pick up the experiment, but this works only as long the experiment is running. If it reached 100%, I don\u0027t get the science, when I pick it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone explain me, what I have to do in this situation? Or is this something, what happens only in sandbox mode? I know, in sandbox mode the science collection is irrelevant, but I want to do it for a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-17T19:40:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2023 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 17\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by DennisB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leganeski","CreatedById":220954,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-17T23:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn sandbox mode, all experiments (surface deployed or not) have a 0% science yield.
