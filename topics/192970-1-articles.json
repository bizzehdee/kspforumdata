And that is a good day. It is so annoying to make quicksaves to counter this. Anybody else getting paranoid about such things?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you pick up a contract to move a satellite to a different orbit. Only when you switch to it you see that it is like a ragdoll. Or just starts pinning out of control sending engine, thrusters and antennae in different directions. Sometimes when you switch to tracking station and back it fixes itself. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t. I had a Sentinel that morphed into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tank and just the red dot was peeping out while the antenna was dangling. Another time when you switch from map to ship, the screen stutters, shakes like mad and the ship is about to disintegrate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, occasionally (when you have just made it to Gilly, for example), you try to perform a maneuver only to realise that the ship is not responsive. Antenna won\u0027t unfold, ship won\u0027t lock prograde, can\u0027t fire the engine. Then it turns out it is not that the ship is not responsive. You can\u0027t switch to map view or can\u0027t even bring up the options menu. So the game is REALLY buggy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am unable to provide screenshots because these are not idle, lovely pictures like a landing and a flag next to the ship. Each time these happen, I am trying to quickly prevent a disaster from happening and a ship from desintegrating. I can\u0027t think about screenshots at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen can we have an update?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky Vagrant","CreatedById":196995,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-07T20:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play on Xbox, but same thing there. I\u0027m totally paranoid about it and save often with a specific naming convention.

I say yes, but totally understand if it\u0027s not for you. I just got the PC version for my laptop (Steam sale $10) and it loads in about five seconds rather than the two minutes on my Xbox and my laptop was NOT built for gaming.

All of that sounds like my life. From paranoid naming conventions for saves to exploding ships. It all seems to be self propelling.

I liked it but I wanted the visual experience on the big screen so I got it on PS4. Also, I am rubbish with the keyboard. I got used to the ps4 controller and I find that it works for me. I don\u0027t need mods and cheats. It gives me challenge. (I have nothing against mods, SpaceX and NASA have automation too.) Although the tracking station shows upcoming maneuvers, it does not warn you like Kerbal Alarm Clock.
