Since KSP\u0027s folder structure is quite unconventional (most games have their folders inside the application, not the application inside the folder and using the resources), I find it more convenient to put the KSP install on my desktop. As a bonus, that also allows you to add mods without having to enter the password into the dialog every single time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
