If you\u0027re getting notifications that KCT doesn\u0027t work with the current version of KSP, then you\u0027ll need to update to make those go away. If Squad releases another small update again it shouldn\u0027t be a problem.

At least, next time you rename a Kerbal from a contract, try changing the kerbalName in the contract too and see if it still happens. I\u0027m still looking through the log to see if I can find anything, but mostly there are just issues with the contract system and trying to save the RescueKerbal contract. Changing that name may allow it to save properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t see anything in the log you gave earlier that would indicate why the reputation would reset after a simulation.

I *can* recover the craft so long as there are no Kerbals inside.
