In space, there is no new life, no family, no business trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, building such a huge infrastructure only makes sense in there is massive demand for transportation.

Dated January 1997: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a structure that makes economic sense, you have to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransport enough cargo to pay back your investment. For example,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you need to earn 10% return to pay off your construction loan,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand you can lift one cargo an hour, you can make some estimates\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon the maximum mass of the structure. At 10% return, you have\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 years to earn back your cost. There are 87,660 hours in that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etime, so you can lift 87,660 cargoes. Assume that your structure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecost $100/kg, and you also charge $100/kg to deliver cargoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen your structure may mass at most 87660 times the cargo weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we divide the structure into a tower and cable, each may mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E43,830 times the cargo. Taking the natural logarithm, we get a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efigure of 10.7 scale lengths for each. The Earth\u0027s gravity well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis equivalent to 1 gee x 6375 km. This, given the 40% factor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor compressive structures, means that 6375/1.4=10.7 scale lengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the required scale length is 425 km. Existing carbon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efiber has a theoretical scale length of 382 km. Allowing for a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaximum of 60% of theoretical strength as allowable stress, 25%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoverhead structures, and the 4 out of 6 cable damage tolerant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edesign, we get a useable scale length of 122 km. Therefore we\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eneed a factor of 3.5 increase over current materials (3.5 million\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epsi vs 1 million psi).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Finally, a full space elevator is not required. You can build \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea structure in Earth orbit that is vertical, but shorter than GEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom end will move slower than orbital velocity, reaching\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ezero velocity as the length gets to the full GEO size.

When they meet, they can latch onto each other\u0027s containers, then release the ones they had originally. You could have as many tractors (thus cargoes) on the tether simultaneously as it can support, alternating orientations: north-south on the way up, east-west on the way down. Each tractor would just go up and down its own little section of the tether. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be necessary to switch orientations at each end of the tether, but since that means on Earth or in orbit, it\u0027s an easy operation. Come to think of it, you\u0027d need some means of orienting the tractors anyway, so that you wouldn\u0027t end up with torsion in the tether as two tractors meet. You could rotate the tractor against the mass of the cargo to eliminate any amount of torsion, but you still might then have to rotate the cargoes by up to 90 degrees for the exchange. A reaction wheel would do the trick, but we want to minimize non-cargo mass, so maybe some small thrusters? Or even better, you could design them with a physical shape that nudged them into alignment as they met. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I missed any embarrassing flaws with this scheme?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-22T13:32:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2014 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tinyboss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T13:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t even have to be that complicated, just drop the downward bound cargoes off the ribbon after they get a sufficient distance below geostationary orbit.
