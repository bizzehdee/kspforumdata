But the wave particle duality of light also went unexplained for a time. The device needs to be tested away from other objects which it could push off of, this is the critical problem. They show a very low level of thrust, and their electronics start to degrade after a time, so there is lots of room to speculate about flaws. I postulated that on the very minute scale the device is imparting momentum via virtual particles and if it tried to increase the force production the effect would saturate quickly (theoretically the force should not accumulate, but uncertainty does allow for random force production, just how large will fluctuations be allowed to build before its no longer random). It may be defining something not yet described in physics, that for a given frequency there is a limit to uncertainty within a given space. Either that or it something completely overlooked in the electronics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike K2 and Rakaydos, I think the only route here is to test in space or some equivalent circumstances were the proponents can test whether the effect can build indefinitely (e.g. increase a crafts orbit). For the very reasons they give, that the effect _has_ to be a flaw in design is the best reason for testing, because the more they are convinced that the reaction mass issue disallows the force, the more I see that there may be a weakness in physics that the purist are oblivious to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI postulated that on the very minute scale the device is imparting momentum via virtual particles and if it tried to increase the force production the effect would saturate quickly\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fantasize\u0022 is a better action noun here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut uncertainty does allow for random force production\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
