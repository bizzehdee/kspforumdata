For example if I add the outer planets mod last, all of the outer planets appear and THAT mod works fine, but the other star systems disappear, and when I click on certain things, like the sun, It changes it to one of the objects from the star systems mod, a black hole, and it doesn\u0027t load the sun/black hole with the proper physics of either. Does anybody know what the problem is, or better yet, how I might go about fixing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T12:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, OPM uses the Kopernicus plugin and StarSystems and PlanetFactory are both incompatible with that (this is mentioned in the OPM thread).

Sometimes when I go to launch, the craft wont be on the launchpad, instead it will be out in outer space, near the Kerbol systems orbit, but not in the solar system. After I revert to the launch to the space center, and try to launch again it usually shows up at the launch pad the second or third time. I have another problem. I launched a probe into orbit around Kerbin, and then I returned to the space center. When I later went to the tracking station to view it, it had somehow moved into orbit around Blacky Karmin (the black hole that is added with this mod). How did these things happen. Is it somehow moving the star systems and the spacecraft in their orbits the wrong way, and not at the same rate?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T14:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not about files, it\u0027s about the plugins. Loading both plugins at once will cause both to do things that break each other because they are both trying to modify the same game system differently.

I ditched the outer planets one, and gave up, but now that I\u0027m running only the star systems one, I\u0027m still having problems. When I load a save, all of my flights in progress all load in some crazy orbit around Blacky Karman. Like I said, I\u0027m only using this mod, and all other mods I\u0027m running have nothing to do with this. I reinstalled the mod even, and replaced all the necessary files, but It still does this. Any ideas how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sabanknight","CreatedById":140533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T08:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too have this issue with orbiting blacky karman.
