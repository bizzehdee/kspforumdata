I was just playing around with kOS to see if I could accomplish an automated circumnav, and I finally did it. It\u0027s just an automated version of my SOD entry. I learned a lot about coding in kOS through the process, and also lemon1324 helped me out greatly with advising me how to use the :heading field of a user defined geoposition. I wanted to share my code with you guys so that maybe you could also partake in the joy of coding in kOS a little.

It\u0027s codenamed: \u0022Blue\u0022, and although it won\u0027t be a record-setter, it\u0027ll be good experience for a future, faster jet. Do note that this is only a TEST run for me to determine performance and tweak the jet. Props to anyone who gets the name reference!\n\nEDIT: Flight is halfway done, and I\u0027m nervous I\u0027ll run out of fuel. I originally intended to cruise at 28km, but after numerous flameouts, I stuck to 18-21km as my margin. Fuel consumption is ranging from 0.4/s to 0.9/s. I have about 980km to go...\n\nEDIT2: I swear, I can see KSC\u0027s mountain ranges... 1100m/s, 200 LF left, and 600km to go...\n\nEDIT3: Nailed it! 1:06:52. Do note that this was a test flight, and NOT an official entry. I\u0027ll be tweaking her ascent pattern with a few test flights and lowering her weight before the big run.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-05T08:14:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2015 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FCISuperGuy**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T18:16:28Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see any pics. \n\nYour altitude ceiling suggests rapiers but top speed suggests whiplashes.

The plane uses 3 Whiplashes as propulsion; I found that this actually consumed less fuel and was easier to control than a 2-engine configuration. Thanks for the cruising alt tips - since I\u0027ll be attempting the run soon, I\u0027ll be sure to cruise between 19500-21500.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve redesigned it to use a 2-engine config. I\u0027m doing the run now.\n\nEDIT 2: Two questions: are East-West circumnavigations allowed? As far as I can see, all the circumnavigations here have been West-East. Also, can we do 2 circumnavigations with different jets? I\u0027m thinking of trying out for the Endurance category, but I also want to keep my regular circumnavigation badge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-06T12:44:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2015 12:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FCISuperGuy**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T11:02:04Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my attempt, with the homemade HSP - Macaw!

Not many have chosen the polar route since the runway is oriented E/W and a fly-over of the poles is disorienting. I\u0027ve noticed flying east burns less fuel and allows higher speeds but flying west offers a shorter ground track to cover. I think the entire cross-section of the atmosphere rotates along with the planet, so effectively the times are equal in either direction. Most participants have put up multiple entries, both to improve over previous runs and to compete in multiple categories. I think the rule is that only the best individual performance will be listed. Prior runs get wiped when you post an improvement.
