I know there are some serious limitations with drawing ropes (though perhaps being under constant tension could sidestep that), and this is hardly a practical idea at the best of times, but I think it would be a very neat way to deal with the problem.

Also, since you want such a lander to be as light as possible, and the orbital stage to be as heavy as possible (the bigger it is relative to the lander, the less it will be affected by the initial acceleration and drag forces), it would make sense to have it tow you back out of orbit, at least as far as it can, and only then let it go (or have it self destruct because Kerbal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn more practical terms, I think if we ever want to leave, our landers will have to be totally viable space planes, and they are going to need more efficient engines (or a fuel with a much higher energy content) than we have now if it will ever attain orbit again.

I know there are some serious limitations with drawing ropes (though perhaps being under constant tension could sidestep that), and this is hardly a practical idea at the best of times, but I think it would be a very neat way to deal with the problem. By reeling in the ship at a low constant speed, the orbiter will only have to deal with the initial acceleration, which shouldn\u0027t pull it out of orbit (and once the lander takes off, it doesn\u0027t matter if the winch starts to drift). By going at a fairly slow speed, there will be minimal drag transmitting force back to the orbiter, so you should hopefully get back before the orbit totally destabilizes. And honestly, if you get up high enough you could cut the cable and use engines, though winching the entire way would go a long way to saving all the fuel you can for escaping that king of gravity. Also, since you want such a lander to be as light as possible, and the orbital stage to be as heavy as possible (the bigger it is relative to the lander, the less it will be affected by the initial acceleration and drag forces), it would make sense to have it tow you back out of orbit, at least as far as it can, and only then let it go (or have it self destruct because Kerbal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn more practical terms, I think if we ever want to leave, our landers will have to be totally viable space planes, and they are going to need more efficient engines (or a fuel with a much higher energy content) than we have now if it will ever attain orbit again. And if these parts aren\u0027t provided, you can always modify an engine, make it more efficient and say it pulls some of its fuel out of Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... an Interplanetary Space Elevator (ISE)? The Orbiter for the craft would have to be unGODLY massive to counterweight the lowering and raising of the lander stage. It would also be better to have docking, and just use a craft like the shuttle from Avatar. Go down on a glide with wings, and come up powered. The atmosphere on Eve is so thick, you could quite likely have a rather easy glide-to-landing. Coming up would require more thrust and fuel, but once you got out into space, you could just rendezvous with the orbiter.
