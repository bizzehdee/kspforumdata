I feel like there must be someplace I can squeeze that out if I optimize everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: What is the most efficient trans-munar insertion trajectory for both getting captured by the Mun, and once captured landing with the least deltaV? My guess is that it would be to come in to the Mun\u0027s SOI low and from behind, so that the gravity well accelerates the ship both outwards and prograde to match velocities. Has anybody worked this all out for KSP physics? If so, is there a tutorial or general procedure for setting up a maneuver node to do this?

You might squeeze out a few dozen delta-v from trajectory optimizations, but getting more than 100 is probably tough. Here are the pointers I can think of that may help you, many of which you probably already know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Go for lowest possible Kerbin orbit, right at 70km, when you do your trans-Munar injection burn. In fact, you might even consider keeping your periapsis down in the atmosphere slightly-- around 60km or so, since the speed and energy pickup from the greater Oberth Effect will probably outweigh the very slight frictional loss from the atmosphere at that altitude. (That takes real guts!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. And of course do your entire Kerbin-Munar injection burn very close to periapsis (at the point of max speed). Split it across multiple orbits if necessary rather than doing any significant part of it away from perapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Any mass you can possibly shave off your craft will have an exponentially beneficial effect on Delta V. Even little things. For example, I see you\u0027re using the medium strength landing struts instead of the micro landing struts. Save a few pounds there. And use a single extendable ladder rather than multiple ladder rungs behind the cockpit. And.... parachutes? Bah! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Consider the lighter and more efficient LV-909 engines instead of the LV-T30\u0027s or -45\u0027s that you\u0027re using. That will save you up to two tons of mass, and give you better efficiency, at the expense of lower thrust, but you might be able to get away with less thrust since you\u0027re probably burning your jets almost all the way into space anyway. If you need more thrust for the final Mun landing, consider adding some very light 48-7S engines (toggled on only when necessary using action groups) to use for those thrust-critical parts of your Munar landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I think you have the trajectory about right, but remember that whatever trajectory crosses into the Mun\u0027s SOI at the lowest possible speed (as measured from within the Mun\u0027s SOI just after you enter) is going to be the lowest energy approach. Crossing in with excess velocity just means you arrive with more kinetic energy that ultimately has to be dissipated via thrusting. So find some trajectory that makes you just barely drift in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Then from there do the closest thing to a pure suicide burn that you feel comfortable handling. You want to minimimze the amount of time you are thrusting against the pull of the Mun\u0027s gravity. This would be the time where a bunch of little 48-7S engines could pay for themselves by helping you decelerate very quickly. You need a high enough thrust to weight ratio that you don\u0027t have to burn for a ridiculously long time. The theoretically most efficient approach would be to free-fall all the way to the Mun\u0027s surface, then apply a massive burst of thrust at the very last possible second to slow you to a stop right at the surface. This would cut your gravity losses to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Make sure you are getting as much out of your jets as possible. Gain all possible speed in the atmosphere before switching to rockets. And of course, don\u0027t carry extra jet fuel... If you find you\u0027re reaching space with unburnt jet fuel, then take off with the tanks only partially full. Less mass!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Related to 7, if you\u0027re really gutsy then don\u0027t carry any jet fuel for the return landing on Kerbin. With proper planning, you can glide in directly from your return trajectory to a dead-stick (gliding) landing. That\u0027s of course the most fuel efficient way but it takes amazing piloting skills... especially after you remove those parachutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re trying to do is very, very hard.

You have given me a lot of food for thought, and maybe if I optimally address to all the points you raised I can get there!. By the numbers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-2) I think I had a pretty good parking orbit the last time, but it could have been better. I boosted from very close to the periapsis of a 110/70km orbit, but probably not right on it. I had also not considered the idea of dropping down into the 60\u0027s for that little bit of extra speed. From what you said, it sounds like I could have my initial apoapsis higher and do the burn on the second go-round. I will try to set that up next time. I guess what would be ideal would be if I could set up my timing so that I can do my TMI straight from the ground and not even bother with a parking orbit, but that will be seriously difficult...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Good point about the ladder. Even more than the weight of those individual rungs, I think their combined drag might be reducing my top speed on the jets. As to the landing struts, I \u0027ll look into that, but I think I might not get enough height out of the smaller ones. Also I think the micro struts might break under that ponderous beast of a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Actually, I\u0027m using the KW Vesta engines, which are the only non-stock part on the whole craft AFAIK. They have 120kN thrust, weigh only 0.6 tons, and have an ISP of 400, which is to say they are a bit cheatsy compared to all stock. They also have a fair bit more thrust than I actually need, so I might be able to get away with the LV-909\u0027s instead. I don\u0027t think this will make ascent to orbit too difficult, but as you mentioned you ideally want to do the shortest, hardest burn possible for the Munar landing, and having underpowered engines will force you to burn longer. Ultimately, the nuclear option may be the best thing, because I can probably easily carry up several tons less fuel due to their high ISP, which should easily offset their weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Based on what you said here, it seems like the best thing I could do is shoot for a Kerbin apoapsis behind and inside of the Mun, so that I\u0027m actually moving away from it initially. If I hit it just right, I could theoretically then rise to a motionless Munar apoapsis right at the trailing boundary of the SOI, then fall vertically down to the surface from there. For leaving, It seems like boosting straight up from a spot a bit inside of the most trailing part of the MUN would get me the Lowest Kerbin periapsis at Munar escape, but I\u0027ll have to mull that one over a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) This will require some thought, as I have to balance the best ISP and TWR against not wanting to have to burn for too long to land. I may just have to try a few different configurations and see...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Right now I\u0027m topping out at just about 1900 m/s at 30km altitude before engaging the bipropellant engines, at which point I\u0027m generally using my last drop of extra jet fuel. I think I could do better than this though. Currently, I have a Communotron, 4 scientific instruments, a 70 unit monoprop tank, and 4 parachutes on board, none of which I actually need. Of course for a multi-functional spaceship you\u0027d want all these things, but what I\u0027m going for here is bragging rights not science. I also have a docking port on the front which I obviously don\u0027t really need to do this particular challenge. More than even the weight of all these things, the drag they produce is what I suspect might really be killing me on my initial trip to orbit. If I could get to 2200 m/s on the same amount of jet fuel, I\u0027d have 300 more deltaV to play with right there. I will therefore pitch all of that stuff over the side and see how things improve for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) That ship is so light when it is empty of fuel compared to at takeoff that landing it deadstick is not very hard. So long as I\u0027m not trying to actually hit the KSC runway that is, but empty that plane has such a low stall speed that I can easily land it on the grass. My only worry is that when completely empty the plane also has the COL and COM right on top of each other, so I\u0027m afraid it might get flippy on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks again for all the ideas.

I want to plant the flag and at least take a surface sample, even if I have to leave all those other draggy science bits behind. The idea of stopping with brakes after making a rolling touchdown however is quite intriguing to me. I actually made a SSTO plane that had front-mounted, downward-pointing engines that allowed it to stand up onto rear-mounted lander legs, even when fully fuelled on Kerbin. I made a sequence of screencaps that I will post some time soon with the title \u0022stupid space plane tricks\u0022.

I also have a docking port on the front which I obviously don\u0027t really need to do this particular challenge. More than even the weight of all these things, the drag they produce is what I suspect might really be killing me on my initial trip to orbit. If I could get to 2200 m/s on the same amount of jet fuel, I\u0027d have 300 more deltaV to play with right there.
