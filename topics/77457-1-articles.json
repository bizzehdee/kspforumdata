You then start planning to return directly to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you left equatorially, we know that when we get our next encounter we will again pass by the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get that encounter, you notice that you are catching up to Kerbin from \u0022behind\u0022 (we burned prograde when we left), your periapsis is, say, 1000km, and it\u0027s on the sunny side of Kerbin. That\u0027s no good... if our flyby is on the sunny side and we circularize, then we will be in a west to east orbit when we\u0027re done! And of course, 1000km is much too high to aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this scenario, you would perform a radial out burn. You can either do it in solar orbit, or wait until you enter the SOI of Kerbin and do a radial in burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAside: While you are still a long way from your eventual periapsis, the burn will be cheap. The closer you get, the more fuel you will need to spend, because you need to adjust your flyby angle more. Imagine shooting an arrow at a tree that is 100m away. If a slight breeze is blowing when you release the arrow, it will be a long way off target when it gets to the tree. But if it has already flown 95m and is on target, it will take a very strong wind to make it miss the tree. Notably, the same is not true of normal corrections, but that\u0027s a topic for another time.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning radial out will first move your trajectory down into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere on the sunny side, and then right through the planet, and finally over to the dark side of Kerbin. A radial in burn, on the other hand, would push your periapsis even further away and still on the sunny side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore generally, a radial burn rotates and elongates your orbit. Imagine you are gently holding a bicycle tire vertically, so that the base of the tire is sitting on a flat road. Now using your foot, press down on the inside of the tire slightly ahead of where it is touching the ground. The tyre will rotate and now the part under your foot will be touching the ground. This is a bit like a radial out burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-15T11:55:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2014 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T08:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use Mechjeb and the SMART ASS module combined with the maneuver planning modules to give you an idea of what radial burns are used for.

It is particularly useful when you are half-way between the apoapsis and periapsis, and want to adjust them both. An example, as mentioned above, is right after SoI change to a minor body, you will be on a hyperbolic trajectory (escaping after fly-by) - this using a radial burn can move your periapsis closer to the surface with much less Delta-V than a retrograde burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use radial burns in every mission where I have my sphere of influence changes - as in from Kerbin to Mun or Minmas, or from the Sun to Duna - each radial burn is done immediately after SoI change for maximum effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T03:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe can also be useful for adjusting intercepts/encounters.
