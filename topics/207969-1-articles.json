If your navball is showing all blue in the pic above then you need to change the control point in your probe in it\u0027s User interface so that it set up for driving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-30T10:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl points matter. The rocket part of that craft needs to have a control point facing vertically up, in line with the engine thrust; however the rover part needs to have a control point facing horizontally, in line with the direction that the wheels will turn. If you have the control point facing up but try to drive it horizontally, the wheels get confused because \u0022forwards\u0022 for the craft is perpendicular to \u0022forwards\u0022 for the wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need a forwards-facing control point to drive it on the surface and a vertical one for flying the rocket, so either add a second probe core rotated so it points forwards or use a RoveMate, which has both vertical and horizontal control points specifically for use on rovers, though that one has no reaction wheels (no biggie, you already have one) and only basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (which MechJeb doesn\u0027t care about).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
