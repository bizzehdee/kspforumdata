As stated, staging does not work while a keyboard is connected. Can do everything else on both keyboard and controller, but staging\u00A0is broken on both of them. Turned off\u00A0keyboard and that did not fix the issue. Must restart game to solve, and happens again if I use the keyboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesenip1462","CreatedById":184542,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T08:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFigured it out. For some reason, when I connect the keyboard\u00A0it is locking the staging. Just had to put in the lock stage command to unlock it, and that fixes it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
