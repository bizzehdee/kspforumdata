If you want to dock things on the surface, I strongly recommend the mod Kerbal Attachment System, which gives you an easy way to do this: just land your lander within a couple of dozen meters of your refueling station, then a kerbal goes EVA to hook up a pipe between the two and you can transfer fuel (or do whatever else you could do with docked ships).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to consider Minmus instead of the Mun.
