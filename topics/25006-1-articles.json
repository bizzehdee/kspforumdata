If you\u0027re trying to do something very delta-v intensive, like an Eve return mission, then you may not care about launchpad to landing delta-v, and only the portion of the delta-v spent getting out of the system is worth considering to you.

You can start your interplanetary vehicle off burning in the appropriate direction and burn into a highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin, with a periapsis that scrapes the clouds and an apoapsis that almost hits the Mun (or goes higher, if you\u0027ve got it timed right.) Once you\u0027ve spent the ~750 m/s you need to make that happen, you refuel in that highly elliptical orbit and finish your burn at periapsis. You get all the benefits of Oberth and need very little delta-v to finish getting out of the system. Note that this still only \u0022saves\u0022 you ~750 m/s, so if you\u0027re doing something that is emptying your fuel tanks it might be worth it, but it\u0027s just about as easy to simply add another booster stage at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T02:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ what Jason said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel doesn\u0027t magically materialize into a high-altitude orbit around Kerbin.
