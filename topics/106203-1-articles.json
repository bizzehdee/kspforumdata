It will not make them foolproof or entirely prevent overheating.\n\nYou will still need to exercise *som*e caution when constructing LV-N powered ships as attaching the engine to parts with low thermal mass will potentially result in overheating, particularly the smaller 1.25m fuel tanks. This module reduces overall heat production, increases the LV-N radiative properties (more heat is radiated away), and reduces heat conduction to attached parts. It does not alter the heat model in any way, and heat already generated will take time to dissipate. In testing, a single LV-N attached to a Jumbo tank burned for over 31 minutes at full throttle without an overheat. \n\nRequires [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-00-Module-Manager-2-6-2-%28Apr-29%29-Bonsai-Trimming-Kit-Edition) by Sarbian!\n\nInstallation: Copy LVNTempAdjustment.cfg from your downloads folder into Kerbal Space Program/GameData\n\nSince I apparently need one of these (I think)\n\nLicense: [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nDOWNLOAD: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgn3mr8pl9x1s6n/LVNTempAdjustment.cfg?dl=0)\n\nNotes:\n\n4/30/15 - With the current file, LV-N performance is such that it almost requires intentional misuse to overheat. *It is not intended to be \u0022stock\u0022 balanced.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T20:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:15:47Z","Content":"Was wondering when something like this would come along.
