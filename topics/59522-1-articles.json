Kethane adds optional toolbar support, which is more involved but worth the effort in my opinion. I believe taniwha is also adding optional support to Extraplanetary Launchpads. You might encourage mod authors to take that route so they don\u0027t have to bundle Toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T17:38:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I just see there is a toolbar folder in the mod\u0027s package, I just don\u0027t install it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boberts314","CreatedById":69216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T17:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nothke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nothke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I just see there is a toolbar folder in the mod\u0027s package, I just don\u0027t install it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do the same.
