Any recommendations on how I should record docking for my next turn? I\u0027ve tried it multiple ways. One is that I just end up with a 40 minute video of me tinkering with the intercept and the other just cuts the part where i tweak the intercept and gets right to the docking procedure.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the biggest problem with recording KSP. Sometimes it gets a bit too slow-paced. If you find some operation a bit to long (and adjusting a node is probably not too interesting for the viewers), one of the options may be recording that part without (or with minimum) commentary and cutting/speeding it to just a few seconds of showing essential parts. Also, docking something heavy and commenting may not go together too well. Don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m likely to either start babbling something not too interesting or just mess up the docking. Shuttle part of my video report turned into post-commentary over sped-up footage, but it seems to be the optimal way for me for operations at such scale (however for more fast-paced action-packed parts live commentary is better). But that\u0027s something to select individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thunderous Echo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thunderous Echo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen my turn comes around, I\u0027m going to try and bring down (or magically terminate from the Tracking Station) some of the debris that\u0027s been collecting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can land my Callisto if you wish.
