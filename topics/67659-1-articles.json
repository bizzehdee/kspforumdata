If Nasa got their way they would have probably build something very similar. Both the booster and orbiter would have been fully reusable. The military didn\u0027t just change the wing design, they also brought the requirement of having a giant cargo bay. This design would only have worked because the orbiter is packed full of rocket fuel the same as the booster. I believe Nasa still wanted to go fully reusable even with a giant cargo bay, but the the estimated costs they calculated for R\u0026amp;D were too high, so they went with semi-reusable instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image-of-North-American-General-Dynamics-shuttle.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image-of-North-American-General-Dynamics-shuttle.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrisd857","CreatedById":57291,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T03:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is an illustration of the competing shuttle designs before the Air Force stuck their fingers in the pie:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y57/kb7rky/Mythbusters/100_0213.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022100_0213.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpper right illustration looks strangely like the Mythbusters\u0027 escape from Alcatraz raft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T04:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is an illustration of the competing shuttle designs before the Air Force stuck their fingers in the pie:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s that upper left thing?
