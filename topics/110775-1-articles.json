For most mods this worked well (except ProcFairings)\n\nNow I focused on a simple 50% resizing of all hi res (2048x\u002B) **stock** textures. For example ShuttleWings.dds. \n\n(In 0.9 this worked flawless because of DDS4KSP convention tool, which did the conversion and resizing correctly)\n\nTool I used to resize now is Paint.net.\n\nProblem I run into is after resizing is: the in game resulting textures are black.\n\nIf I look at resized texture, the RGB values are off and all HSV values are all ZEROED. Which explains the black.\n\nI am no texture editing expert and I\u0027m a bit stuck on it.\n\nCan anyone help me out on how to **correctly** resize these texture correctly? Or which tool works best?\n\nNote: *I will not use half res texture setting*. Only a several 2048x/4096x textures cause the high mem usage. \n\nI did had them resized to 50%, before I notice the alpha channel issue and the KSP memory usage was *lowered quite significantly*.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T16:34:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gkirmathal**"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:53:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can anyone help me out on how to **correctly** resize these texture correctly?
