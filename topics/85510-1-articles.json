Of course the hatches on capsules are just textures but they also have a proximity function so that kerbals on EVA can click the F key to trigger the load-kerbal-into-pod code which removes the kerbal object from the scene and adds the kerbal stats entry to the pod. What I\u0027m suggesting is adding a similar proximity/collision box outside the doors of each building for EVA\u0027d kerbals to interact with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a kerbal walks up to the VAB door a prompt appears \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DAA520;\u0022\u003E[F]: Enter\u003C/span\u003E. As long as the kerbal is in a stable \u0027landed\u0027 position it executes a scene change to the VAB (or whatever building the kerbal is entering), the same as if the player had pressed ESC, clicked Exit to Space Center and then clicked on the VAB/building. A second change would be to \u003Cem\u003Eremember\u003C/em\u003E if the player reached that scene using a kerbal, basically storing a global vessel ID to indicate the player entered the scene from a \u0027vessel\u0027 or null if they came from the space center. If the player uses the exit function at the top right the game will load up the space scene focused on that vessel (kerbal) instead of going back to the space center scene, closing the loop and making it appear seamless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AvronMullican","CreatedById":60416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T04:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would happen to the kerbal that enters the building?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T06:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AvronMullican\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AvronMullican\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat would happen to the kerbal that enters the building?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d imagine the kerbal would just go back into the roster list ready to get on the next flight out of the VAB/SPH....
