I wanted to start a science mode just for fun, but I don\u0027t know how. I\u0027ve tried moving the .craft files from the different modes (the .craft files in VAB folder in career to the .craft files in the VAB folder in science, etc.). I would really, REALLY rather not have to rebuild the ships and assemblies again.
