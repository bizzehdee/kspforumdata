I talk about the Barn, but I use it in the context of the other buildings as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere absoultely MUST be an art pass on the destroyed buildings. The overlayed textures look absolutely horrible up close and there\u0027s even some shader issues with transparent textures being used for ground rubble piles, it\u0027s all messy and it\u0027s unproffessional at best, and downright ugly at worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe low-tier buildings as they are right now are also rather poor. I think there\u0027s way too much blue in it, and and there are some crappy places.

The result of that operation is then used as a mask for the top texture. It\u0027s an extremely widespread technique in the industry, used in hundreds of games, allowing you to reduce polycount and drawcalls and so on. There are some nuances and raising costs if you want to use that to blend, say, three or four textures, but two texture case is dead simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was talking about \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/onpH9fp.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe barn\u003C/a\u003E, but I think it also applies to some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, I can\u0027t believe I just bashed on a part of KSP so much.
