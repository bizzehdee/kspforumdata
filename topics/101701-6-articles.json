Not just Tier 0, but Tier 1, 2, and all destroyed ones. They are all sub-par at best. I talk about the Barn, but I use it in the context of the other buildings as well.\n\nThere absoultely MUST be an art pass on the destroyed buildings. The overlayed textures look absolutely horrible up close and there\u0027s even some shader issues with transparent textures being used for ground rubble piles, it\u0027s all messy and it\u0027s unproffessional at best, and downright ugly at worst.\n\nThe low-tier buildings as they are right now are also rather poor. I think there\u0027s way too much blue in it, and and there are some crappy places. Some corners are see through, there are floating yellow lines on the floor, and Kerbals walking through boxes!\n\nI hate to be so much of a downer, but it really just is not even close to matching the visual quality of the rest of the game. They\u0027re only a mild improvement from the old 0.20 and previous KSC Buildings!\n\nLet me quote Bac9.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Another thing I have to point out is strange reluctance to work on art techniques. The thing I hate the most about my island runway is the way I did the grass to sand transitions - with two separate materials split with an ugly sharp border, and the very same thing is everywhere here. I compensated it a bit on the runway edges with a third[transition texture](http://i.imgur.com/X1RlLYj.png) (by the way, why the hell isn\u0027t it used when it can be done with a simple loop offset operation on every sand edge?), but it still wasn\u0027t that good looking.\n\u003E Just a little bit of research and half an hour of work on a vertex-color driven shader can allow you to forget about those ugly transitions forever. Here I recorded few examples of those shaders in use:\n\u003E \n\u003E [KSP-like grass](http://i.imgur.com/Oplq2SC.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Rubble](http://i.imgur.com/BCsHPOs.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [Example of underlying vertex colors driving the result](http://i.imgur.com/g9Os12N.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Essentially, every vertex stores a color value that is then used in the shader to set the clamping point of a height map. The result of that operation is then used as a mask for the top texture. It\u0027s an extremely widespread technique in the industry, used in hundreds of games, allowing you to reduce polycount and drawcalls and so on. There are some nuances and raising costs if you want to use that to blend, say, three or four textures, but two texture case is dead simple.\n\nThis was talking about [the barn](http://i.imgur.com/onpH9fp.jpg), but I think it also applies to some other things.\n\nWow, I can\u0027t believe I just bashed on a part of KSP so much. I love KSP and all who work on it, as long as they realize that things can always be better if they\u0027re not already amazing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T21:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Coneshot","CreatedById":69785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:20:16Z","Content":"IMHO if you aren\u0027t viewing the KSC through your exhaust plume then something is amiss?
