This was not an easy decision, as it goes against the grain of our technical aspirations with this mod, but after essentially two days of fruitless work on the problem, it\u0027s time to be pragmatic and move on. This is not to rule out a return to the question in the future, of course. (Also, note that this is not the same approach that PlanetFactory used.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the technical problem seems to be that there is no way to copy (and alter) a prefab without Instantiating it, which seems to trigger diverse and complicated Bad Things. Even after a whole day of hacking on it, I was only able to kill one or the other of the following bugs: (1) it is impossible to launch anything, (2) it is impossible to see the new planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for the time being, we\u0027re moving our application of PQSmods to the new planets from prefab-modification-time (where we do everything else) to after the PSystem has been created from the (replaced) systemPrefab.

We haven\u0027t worked on the atmospheres yet, but as for the scaled version, we just cloned jool. Upon examination of the assets in KSP, Jool just uses the reference scaled model (Geosphere1000m). We cloned this and wrote a wrapper that takes the PQSMod_VertexHeightMap to apply the surface details to the scaled version (so with the mars texture, Olympus Mons is sticking out in the map and the science archives). We\u0027ll probably just clone Jool for the atmosphere as well.

We have tried setting up our custom world with the settings for Mars from Real Solar System (hence the Mars texture above), so a radius of 3389 km. The largest features of mars like the Valles Marineris and Olympus Mons look flat. It seems there may be a cap somewhere in KSP for the maximum level of allowed subdivision, even though we tried to set the maximum subdivision level to 32 (default is 12 - 14 for the high detail setting). Again, this could easily be a config option we\u0027ve yet to find. If anyone has previously found a solution to this, i\u0027m all ears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnical Update: Bryce has a custom biome and science map working for our test planet. Next steps are to write a configuration system for all the available PQS Mods (going to be modeled off EVE Overhaul edition\u0027s EVEManager) and the finish figuring out how to create an entirely custom PQS. We have isolated the issue to something in our initialization of the PQS object ourself. The current code instantiates the PQS prefab from Dres, deletes EVERY PQSMod, and adds our custom ones, which seems to be working great.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T00:25:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Teknoman117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BryceSchroeder","CreatedById":74203,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T00:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the encouragement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose sound like cool planet ideas!
