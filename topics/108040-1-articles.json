With 140t rockets unlocked, my task was easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just added a bunch of engines to my craft (solid boosters).

More than likely your ascension profile is inefficient. If you go straight up, and then vector sideways when you get into space, which is how I tried to do it when I first started, it requires a lot of fuel. There are a lot of tutorials on this website and on YouTube for getting into orbit, I would suggest checking those out. Make sure you find tutorials for version 1.0 or later, as there were changes to the game that makes some of the older tutorials obsolete.

The word \u0022freefall\u0022 actually describes pretty well what\u0027s happening: you are falling. Gravity is constantly pulling you down, hard, and you\u0027re fully affected. However... as Douglas Adams once wrote in \u0022The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u0022, the trick to flying is simply missing the ground when you fall.

And you need only a little bit of upwards speed but a lot of sideways speed, because a planet is a pretty big target to try and miss. The gravity turn maneuver is the most effective way to get your sideways speed up as quickly as possible while maintaining juuuust enough upward speed to make it above the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the LV-909 is so good: Thrust isn\u0027t everything to a rocket engine. Fuel efficiency is also very important. Two factors govern how fuel efficient an engine is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Engine weight. The engine is not fuel, so its weight is dead weight. The less of it it has, the better. The LV-909 happens to weigh very little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Specific impulse. This figure, appreviated Isp, is roughly comparable to a fuel consumption indicator. The higher this number, the more you get out of the same amount of fuel. The LV-909 happens to have a pretty good Isp in the vacuum of space, so it makes a great upper stage engine. But note: because it\u0027s optimized for space, it runs poorly inside the atmosphere - that\u0027s what the \u0022ASL\u0022 entry for Isp signifies. It stands for \u0022atmospheric/sea level\u0022. So try not to rely on it too much below 15km of height. The higher you go, the better it runs. Above 30km, it should be more or less maxed out. (This applies to any engine; you can see Isp increase as the rocket climbs if you rightclick a running engine during flight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, upper stages tend to be small.
