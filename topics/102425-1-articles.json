At first the Beta 1 only had 2 boosters and 1 launch stabilizer attached to the side of the main rocket just below the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship looked flight worthy, so the Flight Director gave the go ahead to have it sent out to the Launchpad. it was decided that Bob Kerman would be it\u0027s pilot because of all the hype that he had garnered earlier in the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisitors crowded the lawn in front of the VAB, and when the crawler came out with the Beta 1 with the van holding Bob just behind, the crowds were cheering with bob waving his hand out of the van\u0027s window. Few minutes later Bob was strapped in an did his started his preflight checks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlot was riding on this mission. New monitors had been installed in the MK1 Command Pod, and that gave the pilot a an unprecedented amount of information about the rocket and about the flight. In fact pilots were able to choose what they looked at any given moment. For the center moniter, bob loaded up the new navigation tracker with a visually generated heads up display. This one screen provided vasts amount of info that was needed on a moment to moment bases about the flight of the rocket. On his left hand side he activated the orbital data window that not only showed him everything that he needed to know to get the ship into orbit, but it would also show his orbital trajectory once he got airborne. On the right hand screen he tried activating the new cameras that were installed but two of them were not in a good position, and third failed to send imagery. So he opted to get vessel readings instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith everything set up and his pref-light checks done, bob activated the auto stabilizers and contact mission control that he was ready for launch. After a second, mission control confirmed everything was in the green and the Flight Director issued the command \u0022Go Flight!\u0022 With that, a famous announcer who had been brought in to announce the countdown and launch which would be broadcast over the radio waves, started his 30 second countdown, wowing the crowd with his grand statements every five seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the countdown came to t-minus ten, the crowd got ecstatic. Even Bob was excited, checking everything one last time to make sure that everything was okay. In fact he was so thrilled about the new moniters that he did even realize the countdown was over, when he heard a load roar as the engines ignited, and then after that faded away, there was nothing, no engine roar, no movement, no sound. He looked up and still saw the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside the crowd was hysterical, laughing like crazy, and the Flight Director was furious. What had happened is the booster ignited, launching into the sky. however it left behind the main rocket with the command pod still attached to the launch stabilizer. The Flight Director order the annoucner to take the visitors on a tour of facility while they straightened this mess, and then ordered the recovery of the Beta 1. It was brought back into the VAB in one peace and the Flight Directer watched carefully as the engineers took the launch stabilizer off, attached to new boosters, and then put two launch stabilizers on attaching them to the boosters instead of the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn hour later, Beta 1 was back on the launchpad, and Bob was back in the Command Pod, happy that they did not change the setup of his moniters, but unhappy that nothing was done about the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWanting to make sure that everything was going to work, the Flight Director order the launch before the announcer and the visitors could return from the tour. The ship launch perfectly, but with in 30 seconds it seemed that things were going awfully wrong. The rocket was veering far off to the right, and Bob was struggling to correct it. Because the boosters were not helping, Bob decided to ditch the boosters and ignite the main engines, however that did also not help and the rocket started going down. The Flight Director immediately ordered bob to shut down the engine and separate from it, then to immediately put up the parachutes. Bob did as ordered and soon enough the command pod safely landed on the ground somewhere in the fields east of the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s303.photobucket.com/user/citizenbuddysd/media/KSP%202015-03-21%2013-38-24-66.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn152/citizenbuddysd/KSP%202015-03-21%2013-38-24-66.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-03-21%2013-38-24-66.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe visitors saw the results of the failed launch as they returned from their tour, and all was worried about the fate of Bob, but they were screaming and yellling when the recovery team brought Bob back to the space... with scientific data in tow! Good Ol\u0027 Bob, always the scientist even during failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile that was going on, the team in mission control was abuzz. Everyone thought that due to what had happened, that the KSC should close down for the day giving everyone a needed rest. However the higher ups that was funding this operation demanded a tight timetable, and that meant that a launch into orbit if possible must be met by day\u0027s end, which was going to be upon them soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo despite everyone\u0027s concerns, a redesigned Beta 1 was brought to the launchpad, this time with 3 boosters for more stability during the initial phases of the mission. After only an hours rest, Bob was back in the command pod. Since everyone on the team agreed that they were sure things would work now, the announcer went live again announcing the countdown for world to see, as well as providing some comic relief for the exhausted staff and the tired visitors... and then everything went horribly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the countdown reached zero and the engines ignited, the struts connect the three boosters to the main engine broke and the boosters slammed into the main engine before falling back and exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob, not knowing what was going on, panicked and started hitting the staging button over and over. Before he realized he was on a rocket that ablaze and out of control. Mission control ordered Bob to engage the parachute and turn the capsule so that it would slide off the rocket and fall back to a safe landing, but the forward momentum of the rocket was so great that it was impossible for Bob to nudge the pod off it\u0027s end. Moments later, Bob Kerman died when Beta 1 flew nose down into the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight director broke the news before ordering the wailing visitors off the premises, promising that a memorial for Bob would be held at sunset. Then he began a strict investigation into the accident. As log reports were recovered from the sea, it was clear what happened. As the Beta 1 waited for the countdown to finish before takeoff, the directional nose indicator was all over the place. Cameras of the launchpad showed that as time went on, due to aerodynamic forces; the boosters became more unstable, slowly splitting away from the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the second launch of the Beta 1 was a failure, it\u0027s takeoff was perfect, and so it was deemed that a prolonged launch sequence meant certain doom for the the rocket and anyone who was aboard it. The Flight director declared at a press conference an hour after the accident that any launch that the KSC makes must be done as quickly as possible once the pilot is strapped in, until more technologies are unlocked that could potentially have prevented this disaster. With that, she also publicly and unceremoniously fire the announcer, saying that his speeches were deadly for any Kerbal flying a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat evening a memorial was held by the harbor at the south end of Kape Kerbal. Important people were making speeches about the life of Bob and the importance of his work. However, no one noticed that key members of the KSC were missing. As a boat with Bob\u0027s coffin floated off into the sunset, the former launch announcer was playing a loud serenade, so no one heard the muffled roar of rocket engines taking off north of the Harbor, nor did anyone hear the watery splashes as the discarded empty boosters hit the ocean off shore. People were just to fixated to see that red dot in the sky arc east as Jebudiah began his gravity turn at 10,000 meters. After the music played, Bill Kerman stepped up, explaining that Bob gave his life to see the mission of the space center march forward into the future, and that he will never be forgotten. How fitting it was that at the time the staff at Mission control were yelling in joy as Jebudiah discarded the main stage of the rocket and began his orbital insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next two hours as people wondered over to the docks where flowers were piling up, and payed their final respects to Bob before leaving in their vehicles to go home, while high overhead Jebudiah was enjoying multiple sunrises, the joy of zero gravity, and collecting valuable scientific data on space walks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat evening, rumors stirred of a shooting star flying over the desert on the continent far to the west of KSC. The following morning reporters caught up to the gleeful Jebudiah Kerman wondering the desert. There in a special report, he made the statement that he accepted the evening orbital mission even though he was going to miss the memorial in honor of Bob\u0027s name. He insisted to the Flight Director after what happened to Bob, that the mission should be launched without fanfare, so not to take everyone\u0027s attention off of what was important, the memory of bob; and that yes, Jeb did miss him. Jebudiah Kerman then set the record straigh, he was the first Kerbal to reach space, the first kerbal to reach orbit, and the first kerbal to return to Kerbin from orbit safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s303.photobucket.com/user/citizenbuddysd/media/KSP%202015-03-22%2013-40-56-32.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn152/citizenbuddysd/KSP%202015-03-22%2013-40-56-32.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-03-22%2013-40-56-32.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodbye, ol\u0027 Bob!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next chapter, the crew and staff work into the night after the memorial as the try to get a kerbal in the Beta 2 into a polar orbit to land at the north pole, while the engineering crew try in vain to figure out why their Solitare 1 Communcations Satellite won\u0027t launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 2 Epiloge: I am posting the footage of the events of this chapter to Youtube, and I will embed it here for everyone who wants to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T17:27:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OpenWorldAddict\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OpenWorldAddict","CreatedById":110661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that over 100 people have read this so far, but not a single person has told me what he/she has thought of my story.
