That crashed due to my attempt to land as close as possible and hit a fuel tank from the first crash and rolled pinning the crew hatch, used RCS to wreck it but free the hatch. Then I rebuilt the damm lander with a hitchhiker can and launched the 2nd rescue attempt with one pilot. Note do not plan rescue missions when angry at one\u0027s self at 4am, I was not thinking clearly and made a few bad calls on my maneuver nodes. Result 7 Kerbals stuck in Mun orbit with zero fuel. At 6am or thereabouts made the choice that 3 hours of sleep wouldn\u0027t help improve my day so quickly tossed together a refueler mission using my \u0027Milk Cow\u0027 a LKO space station refueler for my tank farm. My tank farm station uses 2.5m docking clamps as does my \u0027Milk Cow\u0027, my Mun transfer/lander didn\u0027t. So my next mission was to be a docking adapter to allow the to ships to dock and transfer fuel. Worked like a charm, every one saved. After that mess I fell asleep and woke up with one thought running through my head.... \u0027why the hell didn\u0027t I send up a station core in instead of docking adapter...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELesson learned, that mouse pads can prevent serious concussion. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first and so far only rescue was when Jeb put the third lunar landing mission down in a crater with too high a transverse velocity. The leading landing strut and side tank tore off and exploded, as did the ascent engine, but he was going just slow enough that the rest survived the crash - he even still had one solar panel (stowed for the landing). The problem was at that point there was no 3-man Munar lander, so the engineers had to invent one and the lift vehicle to get it there, then Doodsel had to perform a precision landing (also not tried before) to get to Jeb. Not only did they rescue him, but recovered science from the crashed mission, and set up an automated surface station. Really was a great feeling, bringing them back from the brink of disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m considering playing for TAC and Deadly Reentry.
