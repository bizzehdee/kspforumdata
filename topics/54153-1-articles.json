Those two so far are my favorites. But still.. they lacked a few details. Im looking for a long, detailed boring documentary that covers just about everything. So what are you favorites?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T00:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one - \u003Cem\u003EThe Red Stuff\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s not boring, but it isn\u0027t hardware oriented. It\u0027s interviews with famous Cosmonauts.

Enjoyed it too. Was fantastic when those 33\u0027s roared to life. And all KSP is doing is awakening in you your natural curiosity, your desire to achieve and ability to dream. Oh and if you build rockets like me, your love of a rip-roaring explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
