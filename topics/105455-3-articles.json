Their money is as valuable as ours (actually more, since they will pay full price for it). Some newbies flooding the forums for some weeks in exchage to finance the development of new features for 24 more months? Looks good.\n\nHe has been sponsored, it says it at the beginning of the video (on the bottom). I don\u0027t know how much money it costs, but if he is really capable to have 2 million people watching a KSP video in a bunch of hours, then it should be a ....load of money to be a bad business."},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:45:29Z","Content":"\\*gets his rainbow colored chainsaw ready\\* well i cant stand these guys if that happens i wish that this community will stay respectful and intelligent.

It\u0027s not as if he\u0027s on TV taking up a slot that could be filled with something better; YouTube is practically infinite. It\u0027s really easy to not watch things that you don\u0027t like.
