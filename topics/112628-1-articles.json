All you need to do is plug it in and it\u0027ll run for 10-15 years without maintenance.

Lets face it beta-fish can live in a mud puddle left by a water-buffulo eating mosquito larvae and breathing air. They don\u0027t have near the problem saltwater do with ammonia (ammonia is not poisonous at acid pH like it is at basic pH). \n\nTake a trash can, put it outside and fill it with 30 gallons of water and place one gravid mosquito fish in it.
