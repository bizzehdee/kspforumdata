Put wheels on using symmetry and right angles only (other angles will camber your wheels in or out). This should help it to drive straight. Make sure you test your rover on Kerbin first (drive down the launch pad ramp and try it out on the grassy areas below). This can help you find problems before you get the rover to its destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect control issues on low G bodies, like Minmus. For these, try to use care when driving and especially turning and braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
