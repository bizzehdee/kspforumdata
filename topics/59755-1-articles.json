You said you got a 1.5M periapse and then anything you did further would make you hit the planet proper. The way I usually deal with that, is get it as close as possible, like your 1.5M on leaving Kerbin SOI, and then if I can\u0027t refine it more, wait till maybe half the trip, and try to refine again. As you get closer, your movements do less and less, which you can use to get a really refined trajectory. For example Jool has such a huge SOI, I got my PE to about 800km and waited till I actually had my encounter to lower my PE for aerobraking. Used barely any fuel to do, and was easier than futzing with nodes for half an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sovek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sovek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWay to be an arse, the only thing I use mechjeb for is either quick turns to vectors, numbers and for the shuttle, KILL ROT during roll and upper portions of ascent, and quick node creations.

I personally dislike using it to plan EVERYTHING. I really enjoy the look of the readouts, and the fact that I can create a giant custom one with all the info I need on one screen. Plus, if I absolutely need autopilot, it\u0027s there. Like if I really need to go to the bathroom in the middle of launching something, or just really can\u0027t be bothered burning for 15 min on one of my motherships, so I can just tell it to point at a node, and walk away. That, IMO, isn\u0027t the cheaty bit. The cheaty bit is when you go to it for everything from launching to intercepts to everything else. Even then though that\u0027s your prerogative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m a fan of is newer players using MJ to see how to do something.

It\u0027s honestly how I learned. I learned how to dock (roughly) by watching ORDA do it for me back in the beginning. Best sort of tutorial I could get IMO.

Your intention is to get back into space. The point of an aerobrake is to create a stable orbit around the body. So let\u0027s say I\u0027m attempting to reach stable orbit of Eve. I come in at some stupid velocity like 8KM/sec. Orbital velocity is what, 2800 at 150km or something? Upon reaching Eve, my trajectory is hyperbolic, meaning I come close, and then shoot back out into interplanetary space. By aerobraking, I shed enough velocity that my highest point (apoapsis) of my trajectory is no longer in interplanetary space, but within Eve\u0027s SOI, so I therefore don\u0027t escape and can circularize the orbit, do science, have a picnic in the lander, blah blah...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo skipping off the atmosphere is what you want with an aerobrake. But you want to come down deep enough that you slow down to orbital velocity. You can get real fancy with it too. I sent out a basic space station to Laythe, and to do it I did an aerobrake around Jool at about 162KM, and ended up at a perfect encounter with Laythe, refined it to 30km periapsis or something, aerobraked at Laythe, and ended up in orbit around Laythe, having spent a total of like 2% my fuel to do those maneuvers. The whole point of an aerobrake is to let the atmosphere of your target do the thrusting your rocket engine would otherwise do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted with FAR it would be a bit different, but I don\u0027t think FAR changes THAT much for aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just one of the tools you\u0027ll really learn to love using if you end up messing around out of Kerbin SOI a lot. Being able to aim at Jool, and really not care how fast I come in, is great. Course if they ever get around to adding damage due to friction, I\u0027d be sort of screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerbin, I find I have to come down to maybe 25-30km to get a proper orbit. 50 is just too thin an atmosphere. It depends on where I\u0027m coming from though. I know with my shuttle/bus thing I send to Jool and back virtually every day now, I have to dip down to 27km for it to slow down enough to have a 100KM orbit at the end of it, which is where my station is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T21:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR does does change it a bit, cause the atmosphere is far less umm, \u0022soupy\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how Areobraking works, I just don\u0027t know how FAR will mess with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Immashift","CreatedById":57223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T21:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sovek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sovek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFAR does does change it a bit, cause the atmosphere is far less umm, \u0022soupy\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EI know how Areobraking works, I just don\u0027t know how FAR will mess with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess it\u0027s just trial and error then.
