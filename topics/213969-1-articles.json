Pitch and yaw did nothing. I checked the various control options for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in the parts menu, but changing them did nothing to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t out of power and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was fully enable (not just stabilisation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the way to the moon, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the launcher seemed to work fine, on the Lander Can it seemed fine before detaching from the return vehicle, but once on it\u0027s own it was useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is this some crazy new way that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E works, or (as I think more likely) just yet another serious bug in KSP2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
