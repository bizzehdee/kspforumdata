You bring up that a lunar lander is not the same as a Mars lander. This is true, but given that from what I\u0027ve heard about Musks intended Mars lander, it should frankly be easier to land on the moon using the same lander. They intend for the on board rockets to do almost all of the heavy lifting when it comes to slowing down when it hits Mars atmo. Considering the speed the system will have upon engaging in a landing on Mars will be MUCH higher than the speed the same system would have for a Moon landing it seems likely that really the only major change the system would need is a different software profile for a lunar landing. They even lose some carried mass (or at least devote it to more useful means) on the lunar setup, because it won\u0027t be carrying the parachutes that the Mars variant is intended to have (which are to only be used in the event of a descent engine failure).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think the previous question was answered (sorry if its not!) so im going to ask a question ive got going around in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Easumming we got a working albecuire drive that bends space and all, its compressing the space in front/back of it, but then either we\u0027re creating more space, or space itself is being stretched from somwhere, presumably ahead of the compressed bit, so wouldnt our ship have to cross the \u0022stretched\u0022 space too, basically negating the albecuire drives effect?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo it would not.
