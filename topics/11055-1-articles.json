Once you\\\u0027re in Minmus\\\u0027 SOI, burn retrograde until you have an elliptical orbit. (Ideally at periapsis.)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T20:51:30Z","Content":"Hi Khennes\n\nThere are lots of player made tutorials you can try but I\\\u0027ll tell you a few things here so you don\\\u0027t have to look.\n\nOnce in orbit just wait for the Mun to rise over the horizon and fire your engines, you\\\u0027ll see your orbit expand in the map screen as you gain speed, and when you get to a point where you will intercept the Mun you\\\u0027ll see the patched conics system kick in, it\\\u0027s only visible on the map though.\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
