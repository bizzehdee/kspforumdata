Set elevators to 100% pitch and 0% yaw/roll; rudders to 100% yaw and 0% pitch/roll; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Control Deflection is the maximum range of a control surface; think of it as the throttle limiter for your elevators/ailerons/etc. Wind it down if the plane is overly twitchy, wind it up if you\u0027re struggling to get it to do what you want it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Flap/spoiler in FAR doesn\u0027t mean quite the same thing as flap/spoiler in reality. In FAR, both flaps and spoilers can deflect up or down; spoilers default to up, flaps default to down, but both of them can be set to negative values to deflect the other way. The key difference is that spoilers use a single action group to toggle between full deflection and no deflection, while flaps use a pair of action groups to deflect more or less in a four-step range. Spoilers default to being linked to the brakes action group, but you don\u0027t need to leave them there. Setting a control surface as both a flap and a spoiler doesn\u0027t work; it has to be one or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* AoA is a bit complicated to explain, but it\u0027s a control surface setting that causes them to react to the plane\u0027s Angle of Attack (the angle between where the nose is pointing and the direction in which the plane is actually moving, shown by the surface prograde vector). It\u0027s what you\u0027d use if you wanted a control surface to stay parallel to the airflow regardless of how hard you pull the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Wing mass: default strength of 1 represents fighter-strength wings: almost unbreakable, but very heavy. 0.5 is plenty strong enough for anything that a sensible pilot should do; 0.25 is strong enough to go to space if flown carefully. The mass tweakable does affect connection strength.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T14:28:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T14:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFarrem4,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a serrious question for you about FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was reading about a few things on aircraft, trying to answer a question I had about the MiG-31 and why it had these fin like things on the middle of the wings.

In flight everything behave as should, but there is problem on runway before taking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have set AoA to 100% on my elevators on tail. Tail horisontal wings are set on angle to pitch tail down and in that way pushing nose up. Plane is designed in a way that nose is pitching down on runway until take off.

Elevator control surfaces moves randomly pitching up/down and doing that quite fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at FAR flight data it seems that FAR can\u0027t determine properly AoA, numbers jumping from \u002B5 to -90 AoA, it is hard to read them properly. Once I start engines and plane starting to roll on runway AoA numbers become normal and elevators starting to behave properly. Solution could be to disable AoA feature until plane gain some speed like 10-20 (m/s) and also should be disabled while plane is in space.

The wing fences are placed there to block the spanwise flow and prevent that from happening, at the cost of adding a bit more drag. There are other methods of implementing this, such as the dogtooth notch on the leading edge of the F-4 that causes a vortex to form at high AoA to block the flow, or the use of active boundary layer control to prevent stall entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, FAR does not model wing fences, the dogtooth, or active boundary layer control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutstanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning something new today.
