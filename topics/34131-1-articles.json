The mod has parts in three categories, propulsion, utility, and science. the propulsion part include various sizes of tanks to store the kethane in, as well as a rocket powered by raw kethane. the Utility parts include a large extraction drill and a small extraction drill used for taking the kethane from the ground, two converters (large and small) that wil convert your kethane to other resources at a certain efficiency, and a generator that will generate power from raw kethane. the science parts include 2 radars (large and small) that can be used to scan a planets surface for kethane deposites at a certain altitude. all parts can be used the same way you use any part in the game mid-flight; right click on the part and select the desired function.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brezzell","CreatedById":28458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T17:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the Kethane MOD to refuel my ships on other planets.
