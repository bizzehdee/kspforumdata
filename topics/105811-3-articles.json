Whatever you have available so far in the tech tree you need to throw on there. Oh, and an antenna and plenty of power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need a couple of scientists in there. Not sure this is totally necessary but I think the better the scientist the more science you\u0027ll get. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you run an experiment and make sure you choose to Process in Lab Module (the bubbling yellow flask). You should see after it finishes in the MPL that the Data has increased depending on how much science you got from running the experiment; not much at the launchpad, more on the Mun. You will also have some Rate of sci/day now, which is the important bit, its what you are trying to get high. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou repeat this for all the experiments, max 6, one of each type. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will then have a up to 500 Data depending on how many experiments you used, how good the science was (have you already done all the science before at this location?) and the quality of your scientists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit Start Research and your Science will start to go up. Whenever you like can Transmit Science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you leave it too long and Science maxes out at 500 then anymore will be lost.

The science lab vehicle or base itself doesn\u0027t have to actually have *any* experiment modules on it. It just needs to have the result of other experiments brought to it. For example, let\u0027s say I sent a science mun lander to the mun and did a mystery goo and materials research experiment. Now, normally, I\u0027d then either transmit that data to kerbin or I\u0027d bring it back to kerbin and gain its benefit when I recovered the craft. Now I have a *third* option. I can bring it back to a science lab. In the example above, on my way back to kerbin, I\u0027d have my lander dock with say, my orbiting science station, then I\u0027d have scientists remove the results of the experiments and carry them into the science lab module. Now those experiments reside in the lab, and I can now activate \u0022start research\u0022 on the lab. It will now, over time produce research steadily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe net result of this will be research that trickles in slower than I\u0027d normally get, but the final amount will be far larger than it would normally be. I haven\u0027t managed to successfully test how much more research a mobile lab gets you, nor have I determined if a lab in orbit or on another planet actually gives better multiplication than one on the surface of kerbin, but I believe I remember hearing this is the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing you might be wondering: why not just build a stationary laboratory somewhere on kerbin, maybe even just outside the launch center, and bring my experiments back to that? Well, indeed you can do that! Just remember, it\u0027s still much harder, because you\u0027ll have to actually land near it and have a kerbal cart the experiments over to it.

Some of my stations convert at a rate of like .03 science a day and others .3 science a day. The number and level of my scientists inside don\u0027t seem to make a difference. It seems like the higher the science value of the celestial body your orbiting or landed on, the faster your science is generated.\u003Cp\u003EBasically - mobile labs can quadruple the science you get from all sources, and you don\u0027t have to recover them or anything.
