Range is somewhere in the range of 110 kilometers, and cruising altitude is 6.7 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tips \u002B Tricks-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Science! is known to need a bump, or ramp of some kind to get airborne. The end of the runway will do nicely. When you have left the ground, immediately pitch up to 90 degrees. In flight, Phoenix Aerospace recommends maintaining a pitch of around 22-45 degrees to maintain horizontal flight. To land, cut the engine, and activate the quad parachutes. Be careful to maintain a horizontal position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERemember that wingless craft are inherently unstable, and thus it is reccomended to activate KILL ROT as soon as the aircraft loads, and to keep it on for the duration of the flight. Any flight of the Science! without KILL ROT activated will inevitably end in explosions. And tears. But mostly explosions. Phoenix Aerospace is not responsible for misuse of the MechJeb autopilot system, and will void your warranty.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: To maintain a constant altitude, Phoenix Aerospace reccomends a pitch of 26 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
