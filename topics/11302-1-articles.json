Three intrepid Kerbonauts, after experiencing a major malfunction, have been stranded in Munar orbit while attempting to investigate the Munar Analomy at Silisko Crater!\n\u003E \n\u003E Dateline: The Mun\n\u003E \n\u003E KSC, in conjunction with the local Kerbal government, is mounting a bold and ambitious rescue mission to recover Munolith Investigator 1c from low Munar orbit. Though this is frought with extreme danger, Jebediah Kerman, who is currently on the Mun investigating Munolith Anomaly 1, had this to say: \u0027I\\\u0027ve looked at the plans. They\\\u0027re bold. They\\\u0027re sound. They\\\u0027re very Kerbal.\u0027\n\nWhile trying to re-establish my Munolith bases after .15 Kerbalized my persistence file, I began a new and more efficient program to take Kerbonauts to the Munoliths. A new rocket was born, utilizing the Cuttlefish Delivery Vehicle and Bigtrak \u0027Puddle-Jumper\u0027 rover designs by chickenplucker (by Jeb, I love that design!). After launching Munolith Investigator 1c to Munar orbit (Kerbals don\\\u0027t talk about 1a or 1b ... or the Kraken they encountered \u003E![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)), I sent another orbiter to re-establish contact with the Munar Anomaly at Silisko Crater. Once I was able to re-establish its position, I switched over to the Investigator, only to have a catastrophic malfunction destroy most of the delivery vehicle and lander ... ie, I was left with the pod, a mechjeb, and a parachute ... no engines, no fuel, and no RCS, approximately 12km above the Munar surface in a slightly eccentric orbit.\n\nThinking quickly, I decided to embark on my first ever rescue mission. It would require a vehicle capable of going to the Mun, establish a rendez-vous and capture, and then return to Kerbin. So I thought, *Hey! Why not try the Cuttlefish for this mission, slightly modified.* I hadn\\\u0027t seen anyone else use it in such a capacity, so I figured I\\\u0027d give it a whirl.\n\nAfter many days of trying to figure out the mechjeb Rendez-Vous module, I decided to pretty much wing it. It took a GREAT MANY quicksaves before I got my orbit perfected to intercept the wayward craft. And after a series of catastrophic disasters practice runs in a simulator, I finally managed to do it!\n\nThis is the story of Rescue 1, Investigator 1c, and our six brave Kerbonauts:\n\n**Munolith Investigator 1c Flight Crew:** \n\n- [li]Henrie Kerman[/li]  \n[li]Gusble \u0027Gussie\u0027 Kerman[/li]  \n[li]Dunvin \u0027Dun-Dun-DUUUUN\u0027 Kerman[/li]\n\n**Rescue 1 Flight Crew:**\n\n- [li]Hensey Kerman[/li]  \n[li]Sidrick \u0027Spidey-sense\u0027 Kerman[/li]  \n[li]Fredrey Kerman[/li]\n\n**The Cuttlefish Modified Delivery Vehicle:**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Investigator1c_a.jpg](http://www.cshawnsmith.com/Rescue1/Investigator1c_a.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Investigator1c_b.jpg](http://www.cshawnsmith.com/Rescue1/Investigator1c_b.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**The Cuttlefish Modified Rescue Vehicle:**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Note: The \u0027Cuttlefish\u0027 legs were removed for this picture*\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Rescue1.jpg](http://www.cshawnsmith.com/Rescue1/Rescue1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**And the video of the journey:**\n\n(Side note 1: I did not realize that my video recorder was picking up audio of a Minecraft Let\\\u0027s Play series featuring Two Awesome Gamers, Whitelight and Jaeza.

I\\\u0027ve tried to make subsequent recreations as faithful to the original mission as possible, but in some instances, this was impossible. Some artistic license was required, due in part to the cinematic-esque quality I wanted to capture. The actual capture was never caught on video ... someone forgot to push the record button :-[.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Part 1/2:**\n\u003E \n\u003E *This retrieval mission - Well, sort of ...*\n\u003E \n\u003E *Note: Due to the extra RCS tanks, it was required to fire up RCS thrusters in order to get this beast off the ground.*\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://youtu.be/XKKwh9lSmig](https://youtu.be/XKKwh9lSmig)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Part 2/2:**\n\u003E \n\u003E *The return mission - Well, sort ... well, you get the idea ...*\n\u003E \n\u003E *Note: Most of this was a recreation of the original event.*\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://youtu.be/1kGm6nNtJOc](https://youtu.be/1kGm6nNtJOc)\n\u003E \n\u003E Soundtrack from KSP sounds folder: editorLoop01.ogg\n\u003E \n\u003E Taps, US Army\n\u003E \n\u003E ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E And yes, I managed to land that close to KSP by accident, although in the original mission I was a bit more east of there (about 1-2km IIRC) on both occasions.

Although I finally managed it, it was still a pain in the Kerbal-behind to do at 12km with only a 3rd warp available. Only saving grace was I had a rover on the ground to help speed things up.\n\nBtw, you\\\u0027re chart only covers circular (or nearly circular orbits), doesn\\\u0027t it? How about eccentric ones. I had a difference of about 3-5km in the vessel\\\u0027s orbit that I had to deal with, and it took a GREAT many orbits to get it right.\n\nI\\\u0027m more visually oriented (being an amateur artist), so I\\\u0027m waiting to find someone to do a perfect rendez-vous video tutorial to help explain and show it in action, against a number of scenarios. Until then, it\\\u0027s trial and error for me."}]}
