A lot of people have debts of 100 to 200k before becoming a pilot. If there were an easy way around this, everyone would do that, as you do not lightly take out loans that could buy you a house. Also be aware that the pilot market currently is pretty bad. A lot of people do not have a job and still have to pay their debts, causing very harsh and painful issues. It is no fun doing the same unskilled labour everyone does, but with a 100k debt plus interest looming over your head and eating away at your options. The hole sometimes only gets deeper because of the interest being more than your spare income. Some airlines take advantage by actually asking pilot to pay for flying, since they need to make hours to keep their licences valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to rain on your parade, because I love flying myself and very much understand the urge to do so. It is only fair to warn you of the rather dire situation pilots currently are in.
