The game is much more lenient on that, and despite the waste it still won\u0027t align xyz with target angles on dock, resulting in many docks an asterisk formation. Auto-docking should also use SRS/burn if it can and take a \u0022good enough\u0022 approach since it seems to feel that way about docking in general given the failed angle approach.

So yes you have to previously align both vessel\u0027s docking ports in order to avoid the docking system wasting tons of monoprop.

Use the RCS to realign. Generaly Mechjeb does a good job at approaching near the docking port, but his aiming is just not good. So you have to realign by translating your vessel (RCS\u0027 keys J-L and K-I).

Aligning normal \u002B/- means that the target port will only spin on it\u0027s axis, rather than crawling off around the side of the target vessel. If you try to dock with non-aligned port, with a larger vessel that can\u0027t flit around very rapidly on its RCS, then you will spend a disproportionate amount of time chasing the docking axis that is constantly moving away from you. Agile craft can still do it, but aligning the ports, or using higher orbits (which have longer periods and therefor lower rotation rates) will make life easier.
