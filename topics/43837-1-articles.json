In the screen grab, the station core is the central orange tank and everything above it. Everything went smoothly until I tried to circularize my orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I started to throttle up, and I mean I hadn\u0027t gotten to even 25% throttle, there was a springy noise, and the entire craft quickly compressed as if it was being squeezed from both ends, while simultaneously expanding in the center radially. Then there was a huge explosion from just underneath the hitchhiker container and every single part shot away from the center. It all took less than two seconds and in the end I was left with a cloud of seemingly undamaged parts floating there, and the game wasn\u0027t responding to input anymore. I couldn\u0027t even Alt-Tab out. I had to reboot my machine from the front panel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the funniest thing I\u0027d ever seen; like something out of an old Warner Brothers cartoon. I just sat there for like five minutes laughing. When I got rebooted, and started KSP again, I launched the same craft with Fraps running in the hopes of capturing the blow up on video. As luck would have it though, nothing out of the ordinary happened, and I now have a lovely station core, along with Bill and Jeb in the hitchhiker container, orbiting 175 km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5qFpiVH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225qFpiVH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
