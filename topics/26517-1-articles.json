What I found was I had so many, I started getting clones of a couple... does this mean if I was to launch and store enough Kerbals I could crew an entire ship with nothing but Jebediah clones?

This is because the part of the file that tells the game what kerbal is in the ship lists them as a number, which refers to where their details are in the crew list.
