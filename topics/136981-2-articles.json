You\u0027ll need to lengthen the wavelength to at least UV to hit targets on the surface. Although this might not be such a problem if your laser is a FEL, which can be configured for different wavelengths\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, ground based installations can already be optimized for shooting through the atmosphere. Underground systems with just the laser aperature that would be revealed when firing... they could blind your ship at long range, and blow it up in low orbit. Similar underground installations could include missile silos, mass drivers, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSitting in low orbit is just waiting for something to pop out of nowhere and snip you. point defense systems may shoot down missiles... but they\u0027d have a much harder time against mass drivers/railguns. Lasers... well, the atmosphere works for and against you... as they won\u0027t be X ray lasers, nor focused gamma rays, but UV or lower... Mirrors start to be possible... but still quite unrealistic as slight imperfections would ruin the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the issue of distinguishing \u0022civilian\u0022 stuff in orbit from military stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetecting objects is easy in space... there\u0027s no \u0022stealth\u0022... but if theres a bunch of other stuff, it can be hard to tell what stuff is a threat, and what is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could \u0022sanitize\u0022 the planets orbit from afar (such as deorbiting the stuff by ablation with a laser, like some solutions to space junk that have been proposed), then move in closer if you are willing to wipe out all orbital infrastructure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a sufficient focusing array (lets say 50m diameter), and petawatt outputs(already achieved on earth) coupled with gigajoule pulses (not achieved to my knowledge), and a wavelength in the X ray range... you could have a very very very long range laser... on for which measuring in AU is easier than meters (even if its 0.2 or 0.4 AU). Put a big enough one of these on the moon, and a couple times every few years you could start hitting targets around mars (maybe even on it... I\u0027m not sure how much protection its atmosphere gives it) ... while jupiter would be quite out of reach. One could imagine \u0022island hopping\u0022 building such installations on bodies to get closer and closer to your target... but this seems rather inefficient given that a missile will get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissiles with nukes... perhaps later... missiles with antimatter.... and that lends itself to just kinetic energy weapons... why send a ship, when you can send a missile at 0.2c at the target, 0.4c? 0.8c??? . At such high speeds, they\u0027d be hard to intercept. A huge laser defense system migh work for stuff incoming at 0.2c.... but 0.99c ... forget about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I see it, space war would likely be flinging missiles at space assets that the enemy has... and expensive laser installations to defend high value stuff (like a population center or major colony). In some cases, it may come down to a laser match.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would probably be two doctrines: a limited war in which only space assets are targeted and planetary surfaces are generally left alone... akin to limited warfare today where nukes aren\u0027t used and population centers aren\u0027t bombed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand... all out war.. asteroids get deflected, Kinetic energy weapons are launched, nukes/antimatter warheads get thrown, the objective is to anihilate all civilization on the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn neither case does this involve a warship in orbit around a hostile planet... no space marines get sent down to fight on the surface... at least for cases of two independent technologically advanced and industrialized civilizations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could happen in an imperial-colonial dynamic, where the imperial side has full knowledge of what is going on in the colony, and the colony has no weapons capable of threatening low orbit. In that case, one could imagine civil unrest and the colonial government/police forces becoming unwilling to obey the imperial commands. Then the imperial side might send space-warships to low orbit (if its just interplanetary, they could do this faster than the colony could build adequate missile/laser/mass driver systems... assuming there weren\u0027t mass driver/lasers systems for civilian purposes that could be quickly repurposed for defense)... some of which would be \u0022troop carriers\u0022 (carrying more than just troops, but armored ground vehicles, atmospheric craft etc) and oribital bombarment craft (like deploying a system of UV/visible/IR lasers for precision strikes from orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027d probably land ground forces once, in one area, rather than shuttling back and forth between orbit with \u0022dropships\u0022 (though, on a terraformed mars for instance, its a lot easier to get to and from orbit). While this would be \u0022limited war\u0022, they might carry a substantial amount of nukes... since nuking a few cities is nothing compared to obliterating a planet with a KEW/asteroid impact. The orbital bombardment would probably be done by deploying satellites, rather than warships.
