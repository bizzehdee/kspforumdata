My objective was to make an all LF SSTO. This happened while I was testing to see at what altitude the Nerv engine starts to become useful in terms of TWR and ISP. Turns out the answer is: much lower than expected, around 10km altitude. It Uses 2 Turboramjets and 2 Nerv\u0027s. The Nerv\u0027s are activated early to help squeeze more thrust out of the jets. It ends up going into low Kerbin orbit with around 1,700 m/s of Dv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/JO8L7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur Album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thingymajigy","CreatedById":136332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T04:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can embed your imgur album\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe link is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJO8L7\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[imgur]JO8L7[/imgur]\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it looks like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JO8L7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
