The wheels have sufferred considerable damage and the surface rsistance that these wheels give bouyancy is looser substrates. These substrates have now come as the rover attempts to scale the sandy slopes of mount sharp beyond its base layers, i hope it brought a flag with it, if it makes the top the only thing it would leave as a marker is its hulk.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T16:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nature.com/news/mars-contamination-fear-could-divert-curiosity-rover-1.20544?WT.ec_id=NEWS-20160908\u0026amp;spMailingID=52252265\u0026amp;spUserID=Njk3NjE5NzEwNjES1\u0026amp;spJobID=1001480448\u0026amp;spReportId=MTAwMTQ4MDQ0OAS2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nature.com/news/mars-contamination-fear-could-divert-curiosity-rover-1.20544?WT.ec_id=NEWS-20160908\u0026amp;spMailingID=52252265\u0026amp;spUserID=Njk3NjE5NzEwNjES1\u0026amp;spJobID=1001480448\u0026amp;spReportId=MTAwMTQ4MDQ0OAS2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNutshell, rover is to avoid areas that might have water in an effort to prevent contamination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it is incredibly unlikely, the salt concentration is probably way to salty and toxic minerals to allow earthen life to grow, but . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T17:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know...on Earth life pops out in some really ridiculous places (brine pools, acidic springs...insides of a nuclear reactor :P).
