What I did was first build the small plane, and then attach a decoupler to the bottom of the small plane, and then build the carrier plane under the small plane, attached to the decoupler. This plane takes off fine, but when I activate the stage to decouple the small plane, the carrier plane instantly explodes into a million pieces. The small plane doesn\u0027t explode, but it sometimes gets hit with debris from the big plane and gets sent off course and crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can I prevent the carrier plane from exploding when it releases the plane it\u0027s carrying?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-29T11:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2019 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by delta wee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratwerke_Actual","CreatedById":189744,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-29T11:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs your decoupler force set too high?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-29T13:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecoupler force \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E, make a difference.

Well, I might be wrong but I think it\u0027s best to autostrut something to a part that is heavier then another heavy part. For that matter, using \u0022heaviest\u0022 autostrut will change it to what\u0027s heaviest to begin with.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what if you decouple 2 planes where the heaviest part on the 1st stage is much lighter then on the 2nd stage as in your case. I believe many of the wing pieces on the carrier plane are set to heaviest which is the large fuel tank on the rocket plane it carries. That means a strut line is drawn from the lower wing horizontally to a center point above the vessel. That means the wings of the carrier plane are strutted on a X and Y axis. In other words, in the X relationship it\u0027s bolted on the fuselage, in the Y relationship it\u0027s held up on a cord which is the rocket plane above.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you decouple both vessels the heaviest part of the carrier plane will change to the Mk1 liquid fuel tank or mk1 cockpit presumably. In that case there is a strut line across the width, nothing is holding the wing up on the Y axis. Couple that with very wide wings, consequential physics oscillations due to re-strutting and things will break.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry to test out the carrier plane first. Also, make smaller wings. I have never used wings that large, do you want to fly very high?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf wings fail, you should place each wing segment seperately and then use the move and rotate functions to get them to the right place, instead of segmenting them together, while you could do that I would only segment 3 together and then attach a new set of 3 to the fuselage and drag them using the move tool function to get the desired wing shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem if you glue every wing piece together that the connection point of the whole wing is at the fuselage and you will get a lot of flexing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
