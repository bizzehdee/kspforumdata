After searching for a fix i with no prevail i just wrote this off at a problem with the mod and went on. then the exact thing happened with bobcats Soyuz pack. then i noticed that nearly every part in my game including the stock parts required to be fliped upside-down in order to attach them. even with no mods the problem is still there. after about an hour of reinstalling the game and verifying the cache (which had no effect) i decided to come here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance to anyone who can help me with this problem.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vampireofh8","CreatedById":114564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having the same issue but for me it seems limited to parts from the Near Future Technologies mods. All other stock parts and parts from all other mods I have work fine it seems limited to Near Future Electrical, and Near Future Construction. I have however noticed that on rare occasion even in the vanilla game with no mods on every now and then when I go to remove a part from one of the stages the connection node from the stage disappears and I cannot re-attach anything without ctrl-z to simply undo the last change I\u0027ve done. These are some annoying Issues I have been having with the connection nodes lately both with and without mods installed and I\u0027d like to find out if there may be a fix for this or if anyone else is having the same issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B3boy","CreatedById":144834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor me it seems that anything that bobcat had developed was very buggy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

That means that most mods that haven\u0027t been updated to the current version of KSP won\u0027t fit together. Make sure your mod has been updated before installing it. If it hasn\u0027t yet, there are two ways to fix it. One is to open the ALT-F12 menu and check the option to disable node orientation. Another option that is a bit more permanent but requires some coding is to open each part\u0027s .cfg file, find the node_stack_bottom line and change the fifth value to -1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -7.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshould look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -7.3, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vampireofh8","CreatedById":114564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Capt.
