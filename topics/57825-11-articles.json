In fact, it could probably launch a Salyut station with a Soyuz docked to it while INSIDE the Cargo Bay, then take the whole contraption back home and land on the runway with it, just like that.

The shuttle was $10000 per Kg to LEO and a proton about $4000. Yes it built the ISS but the ISS would likely still have been built without it as the Russians built MIR without the shuttle so there no reason NASA and Russia could have used a purely cargo lifter for ISS construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd your falling for the bigger is better.

They may look cool ect but the capsule design it alot better at the moment. That goes for Soyuz, Dragon, Orion (Capsule) ect. And it better and cheaper to launch your payload with payload only rockets. The shuttle had a role but it was very niche.

Leave cost efficiency to companies because governments are never good at it in the first place. Now if we wanted cost efficiency, NASA would still be using the space shuttle which would cost us much less that the 65 million per seat that Russia charges us for Soyuz. Now you bring up the point of costs to launch. Lets look at what we get for the prices listed. 300 million dollars to launch up to 29 metric tonnes AND 7 crew. To accomplish this using Soyuz (I am ignoring Proton and Falcon since this is an argument between the shuttle and Soyuz) I would need 4 Soyuz cargo launches and 3 Soyuz crewed launches. This brings the price to $315 million with separate crews and cargo, rather than the option to send up one large satellite. If you really wanted to compare the two (which I have stated I don\u0027t anymore) the shuttle had much better capabilities, especially for cost. Not to mention you could pick a landing site and not worry about having to fight off wolves when you landed. Now the reason Soyuz is so cheap overall would be due not to efficiency, but basic economics.You see, the more you build something typically the cheaper the cost to build it will get, especially if the design stays relatively similar, allowing for processes to become more standardized and improve as technology improves. The Soyuz is so cheap because it has been around for a long time and so many of them have been made.
