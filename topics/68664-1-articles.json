Anyone want to try working the math again, and post what they come up with today? Anyone care to take a stab at what fuel the math resembles now? The forum ate my thread from the last time I went through it, and can\u0027t make myself face it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were 2 other unresolved physics issues I was aware of when I gave up in 2012:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Atmospheric density was never connected to the temperature curve; so local mach velocity is invariant, and molar mass fluctuates wildly instead. Is this still true?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity does not consider units for physics calculations\u003C/a\u003E. KSP scales the mass to Megagrams to get around unity mass limits, and this necessitates KN for force as the acceleration is locked to m/s^2. No scaled exponents, so no problem, until you get to big G, where it turns around and rips your head off. Luckily, KSP never actually touches \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebig G\u003C/a\u003E, it just uses the shortcut of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_parameter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egravitational parameters\u003C/a\u003E handed over precomuted, which keeps the game from exploding, but doesn\u0027t make them any less bogus. Is this still true, or even verifiable given all the differing values the game reports? This was a particular pain to test with a plugin, and the numbers just did not add up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize Harv et al are human, but the team has a nasty tendency to use shortcuts with engineering equations that have critical underlying assumptions, forget about those assumptions, and scale something screwball. The problem is they make a plan to \u0022fix it in a future update\u0022, then cancel the update so they can add more graphics, and it snowballs when they start coding again having forgotten about the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T16:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can formulate specific questions, I can go through the code and find out for you.

Volume units in KSP are arbitrary. Just take them as they are. If they only make sense in 5 liter chunks, then use 5 liter chunks. As I said in another thread, Kerbals might just as well measure liquid volume as \u0022this tank holds 20 Kerbonaut helmets full of liquid\u0022.
