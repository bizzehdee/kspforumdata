I\u0027ve been watching that forever thinking it might be my only hope.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecently, though, I decided to go with one more clean install, and pushing things *only* through CKAN unless there was just no other way to get them into the game... also had to do some shortcut configuration and a few other things to my graphics card, now the thing game incredibly smooth. The first few launches I actually thought that it was somehow stuck in warp, somehow, because -since day one- ...we\u0027re talking .25 beta here... I have suffered terrible frame rates. The game played much slower as a result. Now... everything operates as it is supposed to be. It took me a few launches to adjust to how quick everything actually is now.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for the advice on the post placement as well. I had considered creating this post there. After all, it is my first post to the forums etc... however, it is not intended exactly as an introductory post, but as a thank you to those people who take the time to help the neophytes to KSP. I thought it the primary intention of the topic might get lost in the Welcome Aboard section.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince this was my first post, a moderator had to approve this being posted here as well... so they seem to be good to go.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot saying I mind if they move it, at all. Just hope that wherever it ends up living, the primary message goes through.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was seriously about to give up until 1.1 at the very least. I can\u0027t understate how frustrated I was...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI truly wish I had taken the time to read through the technical side of the forums, especially to topics as they pertained to my set-up, much more thoroughly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would have saved me so much grief because, really, all the information is right here already.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood stuff, this place!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNice to meet you, Dman! \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-19T06:19:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2016 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sKotty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sKotty","CreatedById":160308,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T06:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, any place at all works for me...\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for setting me straight!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T12:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello sKotty and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very glad to hear how helpful you found it and pleased that you\u0027ve decided to go from lurker to member.\u00A0 Glad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
