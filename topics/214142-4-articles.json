They said it would release in 2020. You\u0027re saying they restarted right before the other game was close to releasing/being done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should preface this with saying that it is a hypothetical - I have no insider knowledge, and I wouldn\u0027t be able to share it if I did. So while I\u0027m basing a lot of this on information we\u0027ve had and my industry experience, there are educated guesses sprinkled in between. Anything I claim about motivations of people and companies behind this is entirely my own invention and I can be 100% wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople have seen a rough pre-recorded tech demo behind the closed doors at 2019 E3. Some phone-captured footage of it is floating around. I\u0027m assuming, the original pitch for KSP2 was to base it heavily on KSP, give it a graphical update, and add colony mechanics and a second star system. You know how some sequels could have been a big DLC? That\u0027s what I suspect the original scope was. Star Theory seems to have been an even smaller studio\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E, and with T2 purchasing Squad in mid-2017, proper production of KSP2 at ST couldn\u0027t have started until late 2017. In order for them to be ready by early to mid-2020, I can\u0027t imagine the scope being much larger than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 2019, it was likely decided that there is enough interest to make it a bigger game. I imagine Nate S. was the main driving force behind that push from the Star Theory side, having a bigger creative pitch, one that would eventually become the KSP2 we know now, ready to go. I think the reception of KSP2 teaser at E3 was the big signal that everyone involved was waiting for, immediately giving a green light to that larger vision. So, you know, everyone who cheered for KSP2 at E3, well done. Unfortunately, that didn\u0027t go well for the Star Theory as a company. As we know, the negotiations for extended development time and budget broke down, Intercept was created, and KSP2 was effectively rebooted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0Star Theory was reportedly around 30 people before a fraction of these people jumped ship to the newly founded Intercept. Intercept\u0027s site currently claims 40 employees, but since ST was independent and Intercept is managed by the PD, I suspect a larger percentage of Intercept are directly involved in game development. So I would estimate the Intercept\u0027s dev team to be about 50% larger. That doesn\u0027t translate directly into time spent on a project, but it gives you a rough idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255580\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678377079\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022192494\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MarcAbaddon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, MarcAbaddon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027custom physics\u0027 is a wrapper that ends up calling Unity\u0027s RigidBody.

Star Theory was failing to deliver.\u00A0 What was shown in 2019 was smoke and mirrors, chewing gum and duct tape.\u00A0 Nothing that was the foundation for success.\u00A0 \u00A0They were meant to be shipping in early 2020 and they had at best a prototype.\u00A0 \u00A0 Reporting about the breakup says that they were also asking for more money and time, so this version has some credence\u00A0 and Take2 looked at a failing developer that also wanted a payday and said \u0027Nope\u0027\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Take2 took it over and took some of the team, gave them an extra 1.5 years to ship in late 2021, because they at least had that prototype working, and the team sold them on the idea that with that extra time they would be able to ship what they\u0027d originally promised - Take2 likely did this because at least they wouldn\u0027t be essentially blackmailed by Star Theory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u00A0 The project leadership was the same as Star Theory\u0027s though - while Take2 thought they were solving the problem (the owners of Uber Entertainment/Star Theory out of the loop) they just transplanted it.\u00A0 So even though they had this working prototype, essentially the same feature set as the target from 2019, and more time - they failed to get far enough.\u00A0 \u00A0But T2 owned it now, so they gave the team more time.\u00A0 Hence the delay to 2022.\u00A0 \u00A0 Likely at this point not too much progress had made because its hard to staff up a dev team, they only got their Tech director in late 2021, who would have been doing the engineering hiring\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. More delays, more slow development, more spin.\u00A0 Another delay to 2023.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Take2 gets fed up with Intercept\u0027s delays, tells them they have to ship something, so Intercept scrambles - they know their big features aren\u0027t ready, but they\u0027re a dysfunctional developer, can\u0027t manage scope, are perpetually too optimistic about their capabilities, and are only really good at selling a vision, not executing on it. so they dither on things till relatively late - what to remove from the build, what not to, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Finally they make the call, and they had to cut out a LOT to get something functional - and that didn\u0027t leave them enough time to debug the release build.\u00A0 Hence why we got the KSP2 EA in the state it\u0027s in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only part that really makes me wonder here is - what happened to the Star Theory engineers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nT2 carried over from ST the design, production, and art leadership from some LinkedIn sleuthing.\u00A0 And much of the staff.\u00A0 Not the engineers though.\u00A0 \u00A0And this is weird even in my theory where Star Theory had been doing badly (its even weirder in your theory where they\u0027d done well).\u00A0 KSP2\u0027s core need is good engineering - both because its a very systems-driven game, and also because engineers are hard to staff for, esp. in the Seattle area.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot many of the Star Theory engineers had been at Uber that long to be Uber loyalists.\u00A0 Not so they\u0027d be people who\u0027d stick with what was clearly a sinking ship.\u00A0 So, even in the case where they\u0027d done poorly, you think T2 would have taken some to maintain knowledge of the code.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy only guess here - supported by how high the turnover for engineering in Intercept has been, and how the end result has the majority of its problems in the state of the software vs the assets (the design is hard to judge because so little new is present) - is that the Intercept leadership, for whatever reason, really does not work well with engineers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-09T23:50:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2023 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by RocketRockington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T01:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255825\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678404300\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a working mid-production game you don\u0027t scrap it and start over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that it happens all the time.

typically the first 1/3rd to 1/2 of a project is concept and preproduction.\u00A0 Writing design documents,\u00A0 Doing prototypes.\u00A0 Testing what will and won\u0027t work.\u00A0 So basically, R\u0026amp;D for what you\u0027re going to build.\u00A0 For instance, this is the period of time when Star Theory SHOULD have figured out PQS was insufficient for them - which they didn\u0027t do, given today\u0027s devblog, or that they\u00A0 even bother to try to figure out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo essentially even if they started coding again in 2020 - they should have had a lot of knowledge on best practices, design work, and assets carried forward from Star Theory to use.\u00A0 \u00A0Knowledge they either didn\u0027t transfer (because the leadership team that came over were bozos who didn\u0027t even learn a little about what the Star Theory engineers had figured out) or that they ignored (ditto on being bozos) or that Star Theory\u0027s engineers weren\u0027t even asked to test (ditto\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E).\u00A0 \u00A0All this still points to a bunch of bad project leadership that wasted a lot of time for not very much benefit - and clearly failed to make up for that time with the \u0027only 3 years\u0027 of development that they did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-11T07:51:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2023 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by RocketRockington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-11T07:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224256863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678520975\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223189\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketRockington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, RocketRockington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your theory is that Star Theory managed to build on top of KSP1\u0027s code base -
