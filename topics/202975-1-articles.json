A sensor detecting and turning the fan on when you are on the toilet. Either pressure sensor or a distance sensor that turns on at a certain distance(would this need to be different for a closed environment in space?), A methane or other sensor in the fan itself that might take longer to detect. This would be for steam and smells, a delayed timer to keep it running longer, and an auto flip at the switch for manual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince a normal bathroom would be a pain to install pressure sensor without an expensive toilet and wiring I would go with a distance sensor that auto turns on anytime something trips it at a certain distance where your knees, bodymass, or similar should be above the toilet(preferably from the fan to save wiring.). I would assume these would be different in a space setting where you have expensive stuff and probably easier access to wires. Unless the electrical system is tight. I would imagine a pretty fancy one would be ideal to meet the unique circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-10T19:05:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2021 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jurassic kerbal","CreatedById":205632,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-10T18:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat makes sense or atleast to me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-10T19:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould space toilets use circulation?
