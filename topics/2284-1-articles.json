I\u0027ve imported the fuel tank and tried exporting it to test if everything is working, but the game just hangs in the loading screen. The parts lab displays a KeyNotFoundException. All the objects have materials, the units and orientation are set correctly. The dae exporter is updated to the newest version. I exported models before with the 2010 version (which worked perfectly), but since I installed 2012 that one uses the new exporter plugin too. When exported with the 2010 version it now gives a NullReferenceException in the parts lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody know what\u0027s the problem here ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-12T01:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like it\u0027s how you organized your folders, maybe not the export itself.
