But even if fuel flow would be working correctly, it is much harder to do due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E disimprovements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let me explain in detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used a simple rocket with an upper stage (including an upper stage tank and engine, let\u0027s call them UST for upper stage tank and USE for engine respectively), a main stage tank (MST) and engine (MSE), and 6 attached tanks and engines (outer stage tanks/engine A, B, C - OST/OSE A, OST/OSE B, and C - A dropped first, C dropped last, fuel pumps from A \u0026gt; B \u0026gt; C \u0026gt; MST). The MSE was more for a low pressure environment, so it was supposed to fire when I dropped the first tanks and engines, OST/OSE A. So, first stage, ignite engines OSE A-C, which should be fed from tank OST A. I started watching the tanks empty. OST A and B were emptying, A emptied twice as fast as B. So What I assume that happened is that OSE A and B were correctly fed from OST A, but OSE C was fed from OST B (because the fuel pump was going from OST B to OST C) - it looked like the fuel pumps do not daisy-chain correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond stage, I dropped OSE and OST A and ignited MSE. OST B and C were emptying (C at a slower rate). I temporarily disabled the MSE to check, and OST C wasn\u0027t been drained anymore. So same problem as above, there is a fuel pump from OST C to MST, but the MSE did not recognize the daisy chain from OST B to C. OSE C was correctly fed by OST B. Everything clear so far? Okay, now comes the weird part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I eventually dropped OST C (the last outer stage), suddenly the upper stage tank and the main stage tank were drained by the main stage engine even though there was a separator between them and cross fuel flow was disabled. But this appears to be a known bug. Not all parts have the \u0022cross fuel flow = false\u0022 parameter. That leads to an issue. If it is not present in a part, the system seems to think that cross fuel flow = true for some weird reason (at least that\u0027s what I read on steamcommunity). So some parts like a parachute, landing legs, and/or an antanna, which does not have cross fuel flow in its part parameters seems to have falsely activated that for the entire stage...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose were the current technical issues/bugs. Now let\u0027s come to the \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Edesign issues.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel Flow Priority has been removed and cannot be set manually anymore - I considered this a vital piece of KSP1. Don\u0027t ask me why it has been removed. I think it might even fix the issue the incorrect cross fuel flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you add parts in a symmetry, you cannot separate them in staging by clicking on them anymore, like we did in KSP1. So adding 6 decouplers and separating them into 3 stages is not possible. They can only be put and triggered into one stage. But the Action Group manager still allows you to decouple them in pairs. So I put the two Decouplers for OST A on button 1, for OST B on 2, and OST C on 3. That\u0027s a workaround for a \u0022small\u0022 and simple rocket design. But as soon as you have more than 10 asparagus stages or want to use the action manager for other stuff, you\u0027re gonna run out of options. So you\u0027ll have to pause the game and manually decouple stuff. Yay! -_-\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot being able to \u0022remove part from symmetry\u0022 also makes it harder to place fuel pumps, as you cannot do so in symmetry mode anymore. You have to place each one on its own. That, again, might still be fun for a small design, but as soon as you hit a big part count, that\u0027s gonna be a real nightmare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you think that you can just circumvent the current issues with fuel transfer: The new interface is just a nightmare (it can still be done, but is now under resource manager) and the fuel transfer stops once the tank was full for a split second. There is no continuous fuel transfer into a tank. Yet another disimprovement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it helped and that you could follow my explanation.

A bit in advance of where you expect to drop the tanks, pause the game, go into resource manager, and set up the transfer. Unpause the game, and watch the gauges. Once the drop tanks are empty, jettison them. You don\u0027t have to time the fuel transfer perfectly. If you start a bit early or a bit late, you\u0027ll just be carrying the extra weight a little longer, but you\u0027ll still have all the same engines firing, so the loss of efficiency is fairly minimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause building up results in very wobbly rockets, despite the inconvenience, I would still recommend relying on asparagus heavily.
