I have recently installed Remotetech and I have been trying to set up a satellite network around Kerbin. I have been unable to position the satellites however.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I tried to get a sat directly above \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I tried moving the manuverability nodes around and doing different burns each time I tried, but I couldn\u0027t get the sat in the correct spot, let alone a set of three.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is: Is there a mod that allows you to tell it where you want a satellite, and it will tell you where and when to burn? It would be even better If it can place the node for you like MechJeb can.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you to any feedback. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T13:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t reckon there is - Hyperedit can place things directly but that\u0027s a bit too much of a sidestep \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to keep an eye on your orbital period, not something you need to bother with usually. Hitting geosync over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E wasn\u0027t terribly hard - iirc you have to burn from directly the other side of the planet but I can\u0027t remember what the starting altitude was, I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be buried in the RT thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget this isn\u0027t Earth - one bouncer stationary over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is a good idea, but otherwise you generally just want four fairly low orbit relays ( or a bunch in Molinya orbits, a bit more tricky to set up ). Once again, orbital period matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T13:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
