Therefore I think we can do more parts than 1,000, perhaps 2,000?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is also the \u003Cem\u003Eppk\u003C/em\u003E (parts per kilometer) which should I think be near 300 (max. 1,500 parts loaded at any time). However we\u0027ll have to use parts that are more than 3m long! And which have the right section so that a monorail on it would be stable. Any Mk2 section doesn\u0027t work, Mk3 works and is 100 ppk, but it\u0027s a little unstable. Now the most stable section I have is square... And has 1,333 ppk.

Its section will be a 1.6 x 1.6 m square, so it\u0027s the right size. That\u0027s probably the best solution.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Plus, I\u0027ve found a way to do it without any mods.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-24T16:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nid say make them as long as you possibly can to give you more time for part loading and physics settling. however sane part counts might limit that. id say try a design that you could shorten if needed and do some tests to see how it loads. i picked 1.2 km because its in the realm of possibility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
