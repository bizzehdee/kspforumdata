It does need more than the runway available to take off, but you won\\\u0027t hit the water so long as you keep holding up. Climb up to about 9km, and from pitched up flight, press space to release the plane. Use most of your fuel to accelerate, but save the last little bit for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding: I ended up landing on water, and the crew survived (but the ship didn\\\u0027t). Keep pitching up during landing, and before you hit the water, use the last trickles of fuel to go as much horizontal as you can. Cut the power, and you\\\u0027ll skip across the water to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy, please share your thoughts for my future designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
