If it bends your orbit toward its own prograde this will add to your heliocentric velocity; if it bends it toward retrograde, this will subtract from your heliocentric velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The most a gravity assist can add to your velocity is 2x the planet\u0027s heliocentric speed, but this only occurs if you approach the planet directly from its retrograde or prograde, and are going slow enough (and/or get close enough) to bend your orbit 180 degrees around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Since your vessel\u0027s orbit around the sun is counterclockwise, like all the planets, it is impossible to approach a planet\u0027s orbit at an angle greater than 90 degrees to its prograde. This means that the most help you can get from any planet in the prograde direction is 1x the planet\u0027s speed. Effectively, it is easier to use gravity assists to descend toward the sun than to ascend away from it because everything is orbiting the same direction. One way to think about this is: if I throw a baseball directly at a train coming toward me, its velocity change when it hits the train is going to be large, but if I throw a baseball in the same direction that a train is travelling, and the train hits it from behind, the velocity change will be smaller. In the Kerbin solar system, all the trains are travelling in the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) So, a fuel efficient solution would be to ascend to Eeloo or Jool and then use gravity assists to descend from there. The problem with this strategy is the time constraint on the challenge. Orbits take so long out there that if you wait 2-3 orbits for an intercept point, you\u0027ll zero out your score for intercept in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T17:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Since your vessel\u0027s orbit around the sun is counterclockwise, like all the planets, it is impossible to approach a planet\u0027s orbit at an angle greater than 90 degrees to its prograde.

It\u0027s not very obvious what direction you will come in to the planet\u0027s SoI. If you go to a superior planet, for example from Kerbin to Duna on a Hohmann transfer, when you reach Duna you will be going slower than it, so from Duna\u0027s point of view you will be coming at it in the retrograde direction. So if you can turn that around and leave Duna\u0027s SoI in the prograde direction, you will have gained a lot of energy in your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like throwing a baseball at 40 mph in the same direction as a train going 70 mph. That baseball is still traveling at 30 mph toward the train from the perspective of the train. If it bounces off the front of the train at 30 mph, it will then be going at 100 mph relative to you. Your baseball analogy for an inferior planet is somewhat inaccurate, because both the baseball and the train are almost always going in the same direction, unless your ship is in a retrograde orbit. Going to an inferior planet is more like throwing the baseball at 100 mph at the back of a train going 70 mph. After hitting the train, the ball will bounce off at 30 mph backwards with respect to the train, or 40 mph forwards from your point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in general it\u0027s just as easy to get gravity assists to raise your orbit as it is to get gravity assists to lower your orbit. For example, if you go from planet A orbiting at 1 AU to planet B orbiting at 1.2 AU, you can get a gravity assist from planet B to kick you out to an orbit with an apoapsis of around 1.4 AU. But this is also dependent on the mass of the planet. The lower your periapsis is, the more bending the planet\u0027s gravity can do, but you can\u0027t get your periapsis below the surface/atmosphere of the planet. So there\u0027s a limit to how much energy you can get from a gravity assist, especially if you\u0027re coming in fast. Jool, Eve, and Kerbin in general can all provide significant gravity assists, the other planets can\u0027t do as much. (This is also why most real robotic probes to the outer planets use gravity assists from Venus and Earth, but not from Mars.) But if you come in at 20 km/s, even going really close to Kerbin or Eve is not going to bend your trajectory any significant amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T18:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metaphor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metaphor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIt\u0027s not very obvious what direction you will come in to the planet\u0027s SoI.

Everyone is travelling counterclockwise, so you can never get close to an optimal boost, but your speed relative to the assistant planet can be either retrograde or prograde to the planet\u0027s orbit and for non-Hohmann transfers, it\u0027s a combination of your relative speed and relative angle that determine which one it is. (For Hohmann transfers, you get a boost from higher planets and a buck from lower ones.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cdeagle.com/omnum/pdf/flyby.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis paper\u003C/a\u003E, which has a very nice formula (formula (3)) for calculating the change in angle you\u0027ll get from a gravity assist given your initial relative velocity and periapsis.
