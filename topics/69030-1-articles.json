KSP, for now, is supported by Squad primarily in Unity-32bit. 32-bit programs in general (not just Unity or Unity-based programs like KSP) have a hard ceiling of not being able to use more than 4GB of RAM, in total, at any given time. This is even if your system has many times that amount of RAM available for the entire system. Unity does have a 64-bit version that does not have this particular issue (more to the point, its hard ceiling is way way higher, I think 2TB but don\u0027t quote me) but up until very recently, Unity-64bit was extremely buggy in Windows due mostly to \u0022politics\u0022 and shenanigans behind the scenes at the company that designs and maintains the Unity engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months ago in early 2014, Unity\u0027s developer unveiled a new 64-bit version that shows a lot of promise for improving upon the poor track record it has had to this point, but we\u0027ll see. At any rate, Squad had back-burnered 64-bit development for KSP a while ago pending improvement in the Unity-64bit engine, which may or may not be upon us. Even if Unity-64bit\u0027s limitations are indeed completely addressed by the recent improvements, given what\u0027s publicly known of Squad\u0027s priorities list for KSP, even then we\u0027d prolly have to wait a good year or so (my personal guess is final sales version of the game) before large-scale 64-bit implementation is seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that Unity-64bit has been MUCH less buggy in non-Windows environments, particularly Linux. I don\u0027t use Linux or Apple, however, so I cannot report on this. (Also, to run any 64-bit program, whether a game or an internet browser, one\u0027s operating system has to also support 64-bit processing. Many \u0022starter\u0022 versions of Windows and other economy-class laptops and desktops eschew 64-bit operating systems in order to justify a lower price point, so if you\u0027re running a 32-bit system, the improvements to Unity-64bit would pass you by anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for wrapping the above computer-history lesson back to your question: I, too, run into the same problem you describe of not being able to run all of the mods I want to run at the same time. The sterile-KSP base-footprint is already sizeable on its own, and each new mod a user installs expands that footprint size upward bit by bit until, eventually, you hit the 4GB ceiling and Unity-32bit collapses, causing fatal runtime errors. Frankly, it\u0027s a testament to Windows at all that such crashes don\u0027t tend to cause bluescreen hanging instances except for rarely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, comparatively speaking, small plugin-type mods tend to sip memory, as most memory usage is in loading meshes and texture models for individual game parts (tanks, engines, SAS modules, etc.) Therefore, during startup, the part-heavy modpaks such as B9 / KW / NovaPunch tend to eat through memory like it\u0027s going out of style -- hence, modmakers have made available \u0022texture reduction packs\u0022 (a mod-of-a-mod, if you will) which reduce the resolution at which the meshes and textures are loaded (making them appear blurrier in the game) thereby compressing the memory space that those mods would otherwise consume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry those reduction packs first. For the record, I dislike the fact that they would even be necessary, since much of my own enjoyment of the game comes from the attention-to-detail items such as greebles and \u0022Warning: Don\u0027t Touch This\u0022-type markings on the parts that really lend to the fun satire-but-serious-rocket-science atmosphere of the game. I cannot believe that I would speak for no one else on this point. Anyway, if those reduction paks don\u0027t solve your problem by themselves, the only thing I can suggest at that point is to go through your mods, one by one, and delete / uninstall / disable them one by one in the reverse-order of how important you think they are to your mission ideas. After uninstalling each least-important mod, re-attempt to run KSP, and until that solves the problem, repeat the process on up the chain until you get KSP to work. (Sucks, I know.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it helps, I just posted a thread asking my own question in the same field of concern, any answer to which may be helpful to you here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76549-Any-way-to-track-how-mch-memory-each-mod-consumes?p=1091151#post1091151\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76549-Any-way-to-track-how-mch-memory-each-mod-consumes?p=1091151#post1091151\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Disclaimer* -- All of the above advice presumes the likelihood that there are no other latent \u0022conflict\u0022 errors preventing your KSP install from running. If there is a conflict preventing your KSP install from starting up that has nothing to do with the 4GB ceiling issue, that would require separate troubleshooting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-14T18:16:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2014 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MisterFister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar, clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T04:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew info: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-3-0-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-3-0-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod has two settings, and I just finished some experiments with the \u0022aggressive\u0022 setting. As far as I can tell, it actively (on the fly, during startup) compresses part textures as they get loaded into memory. The texture reduction packs that I described above are pre-compressed texture models that are already saved to your GameData folders, ready to be loaded. This mod takes the actual \u0022as intended\u0022 textures and compresses them all during startup, thereby allowing you to receive the benefit of texture reduction across \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E parts in all mod folders, and not just those for which texture reduction packs have been made available for separate download. I am apparently able to use this to support running a truly astonishing array of mods without hitting the same 4GB ceiling you are running into. I highly recommend it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited to add:\u003C/strong\u003E Note that this mod loads first before all other mods if installed correctly, and it does \u0022appear\u0022 to hang while loading, perhaps even for a minute or two. In fact, during one trial run, the KSP loader even showed under Windows Task Manager as unresponsive, though doing nothing still allowed it to finish loading with nary an error. As far as I can tell, this is normal. I recommend exercising some extra patience when attempting to start KSP after installing this mod, and it should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T04:28:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MisterFister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENoting load delays that seem normal\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T12:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB9 KILLS my computer.

Those three, without any other mods installed, might crash your game. KOSMOS especially takes up a ton of RAM. Great mod, but extremely RAM hungry. For my setup, I need to set KSP to use half-size textures, AND use the Active Texture Management mod with the aggressive configs. I have around 40 mods installed, some part mods only partially.
