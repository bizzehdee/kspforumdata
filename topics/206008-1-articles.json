Building a base on an asteroid, you essentially don\u2019t have to worry about any sort of structural integrity because there is microgravity, but building a base on a planet, you have to support your structures so that they do not fall down. If you build your base without supports, it will not stay intact. The same could be said for the weather system, as in a vacuum there will be no significant lateral forces on the base, but in a thick atmosphere winds can push base modules sideways, and if you do not build with at least a bit of sideways support, your base will fail. The most important thing in this for me is to give the player a clear indication of how much reinforcement they need to withstand weather, as with gravity they can just watch their base fall but with wind they would have to wait until a storm to test and build their base, which is not ideal.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for ships, the same thing applies where I would like them to be affected by strong wind, but probably not other random weather. Getting hit by lightning is not a design flaw in your ship, it is a completely random event that you had no control over, and cannot prepare against. Wind however can be built for by designing craft that are aerodynamic and can fly through air at many angles. On the technical side, because KSP already uses a lot of changing reference frames, they could simply make the aero model think the vessel is moving at the wind speed in the opposite direction to where the wind is going and calculate from there. It would add more navigational\u00A0challenges and opportunities, such as using wind to reduce reentry heating, take off for free, or gain some delta-v for orbit. On the whole, I think it would add a whole layer of optional challenge (avoided by simply not landing in storms) that would provide a lot of fun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-16T18:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s an example- Titan\u2019s orbital velocity is about 590 m/s so let\u2019s say you need about 700 m/s of delta-v to be safe Titan\u2019s upper atmosphere has wind speeds that reach up to 270 mph which is 120 m/s which constitutes a significant fraction of the total delta-v requirement, so you might be pushed to go into an orbit in the opposite direction if the winds were pushing west.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TLTay","CreatedById":184633,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-16T19:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know wind is at least visual because of the blowing dust, moving clouds, and wind turbines seen in videos.

I\u0027m sure, many of us can write a script, or at least do some estimate number crunching by hand, but that\u0027s not exactly a friendly experience. There are two ways I can see this going. First is taking the simple, \u0022Anywhere on the planet is fine,\u0022 kind of similar to how recovery works on Kerbin in KSP, with reasonable penalties for distance. It\u0027s not ideal, but it\u0027d be better than requiring pinpoint precision with no assistance. The second option is providing a suite of tools for precise landing. That would include trajectory indicators that take aerodynamics and wind into account, showing, say, 90% probability impact area on the planet, and nav aids during landing that can help you stay on that trajectory as you approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with aids, it will require some practice to perform precise landings, but I don\u0027t think any of us have managed docking on the first try without watching a tutorial. If the tools are good, I think it\u0027s a reasonable ask. If not, then precision requirements will have to be relaxed. Wind adds a layer of complexity, and that\u0027s part of why I think it should be a difficulty option, but it doesn\u0027t drastically change the situation with colony supply runs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lithobrake","CreatedById":185579,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-17T14:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224066225\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206008\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639679194\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for ships, the same thing applies where I would like them to be affected by strong wind, but probably not other random weather.
