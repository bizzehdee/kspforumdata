After this issue appeared I removed all of my mods installed, deleted the Squad and KSP\\_Data folder for Steam to re-acquire them, and the issue consists.*\n\n*I guess I\u0027ll have to completely delete my KSP folder and re-install from scratch, but I\u0027m really afraid of re-adding mods. I don\u0027t know which mod caused the issue.* \n\n*Mods used when I noticed the issue:*\n\n*-Kerbal Construction Time*\n\n*-Final Frontier*\n\n*-Waypoint Manager*\n\n*-Kerbal Alarm Clock*\n\n*-Ubra Life Support mod*\n\n*-Kerbal Joint Reinforcment*\n\n*-Navball Docking Alignment Indicator*\n\n*-Crowd Sourced Science Logs*\n\n*-Landing Height*\n\n*None of these mods should make any changes to this texture. If anyone knows where the data for this texture is located, please let me know. I really don\u0027t know what to do.*\n\n![sGaKwhE.png](http://i.imgur.com/sGaKwhE.png)"}]}
