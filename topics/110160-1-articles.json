In turn, because that\u0027s a directory that has software in it, it\u0027s specially protected for security reasons. Among other things, users do not have write permissions in these folders. Because of this, it\u0027s considered a major faux pas to store any form of user data under C:\\Program Files\\, such as config files, savegames, documents and images, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Windows is a multi-user OS, and while only a minority of software actually takes advantage of this, it\u0027s theoretically possible to install software in such a way that each individual user can use it in complete separation from all other users. In a game installed in such a way, you would not see the savegames created by someone who logged in with a different Windows account, for instance, and you making changes to graphics settings does not overwrite theirs - even though you\u0027ve launched the exact same game client.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to pull this off, and in order to isolate user data from the installed software, the software must actively hook into the OS in a certain way. It must be able to dynamically create folders for its user data under C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\\... whenever a user who does not have these folders launches the software - even for user accounts which didn\u0027t even exist at the time of software installation. It must keep track of these locations it has created in case the software needs to be uninstalled, so they can be removed. It needs permission to launch in a user-isolated context. And so on, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that doesn\u0027t even begin to get into more complex software that might run DRM measures or needs to supply its own runtime extensions, DLL files or even entire hardware drivers which need to be copied into Windows system folders and/or registered with the OS to be loaded when the computer starts up. Some software even installs other software it has a hard dependency on, and that software may require complicated installation procedures of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP can get away with just copying files because a.) it\u0027s completely encapsulated within the Unity runtime and does not require anything else to run; b.) it doesn\u0027t give a damn about people giving it weird looks for saving user data under Program Files (and you shouldn\u0027t install it there anyway, since some mods are broken by the restrictive permissions of that location); c.) it is not in any way, shape or form multi-user aware; and d.) it does not feature any DRM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMost games don\u0027t need much system setup, drm and anticheat is main exceptions.
