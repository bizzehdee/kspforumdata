I made some quick alternate parts that use the same models but are set up to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of monopropellant, and they work fine, but what I really want is to set up the parts so I can switch between different modes during the construction phase to reduce the number parts to sort through.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the easiest way to go about doing something like this?
