It is unfortunately quite unstable, and this can cause a lot of in-flight difficulty. However, its \\\u0027fret\\\u0027 to crash ratio is surprisingly low, since when it loses control its engines are usualy sent facing down naturally, and a crash can be prevented by simply gunning it upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also, unlike many VA craft, highly adept at multiple takeoff and landings, using much less RCS gas than other models. As with many other Veto Aerospace vehicles, it carries a heavy-duty RCS system, with both down and forward facing ports to ensure it can both slow down its forward speed and its downward fall. It is recommended that combinations of rolling and yawing, or yawing and pitch be used when steering. The first for turning port, the second for turning starboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts military applications look promising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KFzuv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KFzuv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hkpJM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hkpJM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
