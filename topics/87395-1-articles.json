Apollo 11 didn\u0027t plant an eagle flag on the Mun and they didn\u0027t have the US flag as a mission patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to do this is rename the Mission Flag option in the editors to Mission Patch and apply it to the vehicles/parts/EVA kerbals/IVA views etc. Then, when you plant a flag, it could come up with the current text box and the flag selection box as well so you can decide on which one to plant there and then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask for this mainly because designs that look good as a decal on a ship (transparent backgrounds, look clean and sharp etc) look bad as a flag and vice versa (fabric wrinkles and plain white background look out of place on a ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESupported; good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d actually like to see the option to put both on a vessel, so I can use one for the Kerbodyne logo and the other for my racing number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, what we need is an improved and stockified Kerbpaint.
