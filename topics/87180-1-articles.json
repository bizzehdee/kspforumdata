This way I\u0027m playing ksp from a space-x point of view - all the technology is there, I just have to design and test the craft I use to fulfil contracts. As such I\u0027ve set up the strategy to convert a portion of science I get from contract in to cash (basically selling data to 3rd parties). This works okay when I recover craft but doesn\u0027t seem to be working when I transmit the science. I basically want to collect science to sell as an extra income. How do I go about doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T14:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EContracts and/or mods.
