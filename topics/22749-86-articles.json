Now, the bug is that for some reason, it seems to think that you\u0027re giving rotational input when you\u0027re in fact giving translational input, and turning off stabilization when it shouldn\u0027t.

It allows you to go in first person mode with your Kerbals, but not much more, I think. You don\u0027t have to install the LAZORs for the plugin to work.
