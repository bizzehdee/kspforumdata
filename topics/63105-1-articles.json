One of the ideas that has been suggested is a sanity mod, whereby a Kerbal, his environment and bunkmates can conspire together to result in him loosing his mind, and saying something like \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Oates\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI am going out for a space walk, I may be some time\u003C/a\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several forms this could take:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) sanity is affected by parts and ship design. I hate this idea as it just becomes another life support mod \u0022add this part to stay alive\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) sanity is affected by distance from home, contact with other kerbals etc. This is better and makes use of CLS too, as it would be important to ensure that kerbals shared living space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Sanity is affected by other kerbals\u0027 attributes - such as stupidity and courage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) We add more attributes to each kerbal, such as patience, empathy, arrogance etc, and also allow each kerbal to have a relationship with each other kerbal characterised by certain attributes - friendship, admiration, jealousy, resentment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the suggestion of 4). the rich soup of attributes could be combined with certain events to change both the quality and attributes of the relationships and the attributes of each kerbal. So some examples off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If a kerbal does not have much contact with kerbals with whom there is a good level of friendship, then the kerbal becomes more lonely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If a two kerbals develop a high level of friendship, then a third may develop jealousy towards them,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If a kerbal has an achievement (eva on a body for example (could the achievements system be used for this?)) then kerbals that do not have that achievement might develop either admiration or jealousy depending on attributes of their own character, or of their relationship with that kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If a kerbal dies then when news of this reaches the other kerbals in space it may have a negative effect on some of their attributes, ie they become sad if one of their friends dies, which would actually createa consequence for loosing a kerbals in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would not quite be \u0022The Sims in space\u0022 but it would offer an oppertunity to develop a completely different aspect of the game, and could be quite fun. It would also lead to considerations for space mission other than just the physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am seeking feedback. Would it take away from the hard edged physics of the game? Would it be something folks would enjoy playing? What other ideas do folks have for how it could be developed? What attributes for kerbals, and relationships between kerbals would be needed?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T18:59:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by codepoet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T19:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elcome this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E this would give more depth to long duration voyages (Another thing would be also age for even MOAR realism be that can be done by others) I am sorry that I won\u0027t be able to provide any developing help though\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T19:23:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DasBananenbrot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T19:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DasBananenbrot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DasBananenbrot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thing would be also age for even MOAR realism \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did once entertain the thought of kerbals breading in the colonies....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T19:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsfxlw5aS21r07mwzo5_250.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_lsfxlw5aS21r07mwzo5_250.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with DasBananenbrot, this would add quite a bit of depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, please don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m trying to take control of your mod or anything of the sort; take this merely as a suggestion based on the potential I see in this mod right now.
