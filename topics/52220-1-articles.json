The Science budget as a whole is the single largest part of NASA\u0027s budget, followed by Space Operations, then Exploration (which includes the SLS and CCdev.) It\u0027s hard to parse the budget to figure out NASA\u0027s priorities, but it\u0027s simply untrue that NASA\u0027s other operations are being sidelined in favor of the SLS. It\u0027s also untrue that NASA\u0027s budgets are low; they are, in fact, historically high (excepting the anomalous Apollo years.) The biggest takeaway I see in the budget is that NASA, like any conservative organization, prioritizes operations over development and planning.
