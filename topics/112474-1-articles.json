The thing is I really like the steam tools, specially the screenshot saver and the fact that you dont need to tab out to talk with friend access browser etc.\n\nIs there any work around the auto update option? \u0022only update this game when I launch it\u0022.\n\nAny code in the \u0022set launch option\u0022 i could add so the game doesnt auto update?\n\nHow do you guys deal with this?\n\nShould i just abandon the idea of steam not auto updating my game and run with a seperate folder?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"PixelClef","CreatedById":113846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:22:44Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t jumped on the mod bandwagon myself.\n\nI also like to play from within Steam because it provides an FPS overlay. (This really needs to be available in game.) Since I\u0027m not modding, it doesn\u0027t bother me much to keep KSP on the update fast track. I also have had to disable the Steam screen shot F key so that bringing up the debug menu doesn\u0027t make a screen shot.\n\nA quick read of Steam\u0027s \u0022Do No Automatically Update\u0022 setting seems to indicate that it is fraught with inconsistency and downright bugginess, unless you want to keep your game up to date. That has got to be frustrating.\n\nToward that end, I think you\u0027re best off copying KSP out of the Steam structure so that your copy has your mods and you know that things won\u0027t be getting changed."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:24:23Z","Content":"New copy in a separate folder.
