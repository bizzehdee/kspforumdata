It\u0027s also not necessary to strictly enforce a mechanic for players to avoid abusing their way around it - I think most players of KSP have their own personal code of conduct about this sort of soft-realism. For some it\u0027s more rigid than for others, and that seems cool by me. My point really being, in the strictest sense no it wouldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Enecessarily \u003C/em\u003Ealter the underlying infinite-ness of EC, but it would limit the number of ways and ease with which it can be utilised as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-03T23:57:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2016 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T00:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason I can think of for this is for \u0027realism\u0027 sake.\u00A0 As far as realism goes, well Opportunity has been knocking around Mars for over a decade now on the same batteries and it\u0027s still going.\u00A0 These aren\u0027t your average AA Rechargeables from Energizer, they last a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of that you can really take this sort of thing to extremes, we could have the light bulbs in the Illuminators burn out, but would that really add gameplay value?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T00:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222741287\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472948088\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as realism goes, well Opportunity has been knocking around Mars for over a decade now on the same batteries and it\u0027s still going.\u00A0 These aren\u0027t your average AA Rechargeables from Energizer, they last a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is true, but KSP timescales can be orders of magnitude longer than human timescales.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor context, I was inspired to suggest this when I saw another thread about \u0027abandoned vehicles\u0027 and thought, why would I ever \u0027abandon\u0027 a vehicle if it wasn\u0027t broken and had unlimited power?

If you don\u0027t play games in which battery life could ever be a factor (because they\u0027re too short-term) it\u0027s a change that doesn\u0027t really affect you in the slightest. On the other hand, if long-term multi-generational style missions/programs are your cup of tea, it not only becomes more relevant, but it adds a neat surprise/a whole new element to your mature game, having to factor in how tired out your old equipment is instead of just assuming it\u0027s always pristine. There may be an argument here for cost of implementation vs magnitude of player appreciation (since depending how it\u0027s done it could barely effect most players most of the time), but that\u0027s not really a gameplay question.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyhow, I\u0027ve floated my thoughts, so I\u0027m going to let others debate the intricacies now. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou aren\u0027t understanding what I\u0027m saying though.\u00A0 This isn\u0027t a switch Squad can turn on, they have to develop a system to maintain running tallies on all batteries in a game.\u00A0 They spend that time to do that for a function that will not come into play but once every 200 in-game years?\u00A0 It\u0027s just not worth the time.\u00A0 Any shorter timespans and not only is it unrealistic but it become tedious to replace on space stations and satellites.\u00A0 In fact that would be even worse than implementing life support because you would not only have the tedium of resupplying them, you would have to replace parts rather than just refill them.\u00A0 So a short life is bad, a long life is pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-04T18:07:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T18:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy stop at batteries?
