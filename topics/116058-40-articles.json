So after much troubleshooting I have just finished installing GN. I was able to start a new game, but I don\u0027t see any new stars in the tracking station. Am I missing something?\n\nOk, I didn\u0027t have Kopernicus installed it seems. Now that I do, I can zoom out to see the other star systems, so that works. HOWEVER, Kerbin is.... black, and seems to be in perpetual nighttime.....![GyrMhEI.png](http://i.imgur.com/GyrMhEI.png)![vwOJxDt.png](http://i.imgur.com/vwOJxDt.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-02T03:38:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2017 03:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by zanie420**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jiraiyah","CreatedById":97667,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T18:18:49Z","Content":"[@Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113260-sigma88/)\n\nHi sir, sorry for sending this log way too late, i was in vacation and didn\u0027t have access to my pc at office, if you recall in your Pluron Khato thread I mentioned that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E throws and error and you asked for a cleaner log file, so why am i sending it here? take a look :\n\n[http://prntscr.com/dqoxpw](http://prntscr.com/dqoxpw)\n\nI think the config has some issue on galactic neighbor itself?\n\nhere is the new log file\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssa7dca82ghh2e3/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssa7dca82ghh2e3/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nRight now these are the only mods i have : Squad, GalacticNeighborhood, Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator, sigma Binary, sigma Dimensions, and sigma PluronKhato\n\nthanks for your attention."}]}
