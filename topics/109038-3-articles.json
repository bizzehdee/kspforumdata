Is there supposed to be usable atmosphere on Duna? Because the MASAMUNEs weren\u0027t working for me.\n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/CsK6M](http://imgur.com/a/CsK6M)\n\u003E \n\u003E My crew is in for quite a long vacation....\n\nThat\u0027s not right... :-/\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Seems like there is a dependancy of oxygen?! \n\u003E I found this at the bottom of the config file:\n\u003E \n\u003E  //MODULE\n\u003E \n\u003E  //{\n\u003E \n\u003E  // name = ModuleResourceIntake\n\u003E \n\u003E  // resourceName = IntakeAir\n\u003E \n\u003E  // checkForOxygen = false\n\u003E \n\u003E  // area = 0.01\n\u003E \n\u003E  // intakeSpeed = 10\n\u003E \n\u003E  // intakeTransformName = Intake\n\u003E \n\u003E  //}\n\u003E \n\u003E  // RESOURCE\n\u003E \n\u003E  //{\n\u003E \n\u003E  // name = IntakeAir\n\u003E \n\u003E  // amount = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E  // maxAmount = 1\n\u003E \n\u003E  //} \n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E MAybe this part causes it?\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: it is slashed out, but maybe it has something to do with the intakes...\n\nThe slashed out section is a testing section for the engines before I decided to go with IntakeAtm. There should be a Module Manager Patch that makes all intakes have the following added...\n\n    MODULE{  name = ModuleResourceIntake  resourceName = IntakeAtm  checkForOxygen = false  area = 0.01  intakeSpeed = 10  intakeTransformName = Intake}RESOURCE{  name = IntakeAtm  amount = 0  maxAmount = 1}\n\nI\u0027ll fly something to Duna to check it out. It was fine on Eve maybe something to do with Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere? I\u0027ll see what I come up with.\n\nEdit: Also, a preview of the Muramasa...\n\n![aoDJ9BS.png](http://i.imgur.com/aoDJ9BS.png)\n\nCredit: propellers by nli2work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T08:07:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eskandare**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:17:16Z","Content":"\\*drools\n\n![do-want-squirell.jpg](http://blogtotheoldskool.com/blog/images/do-want-squirell.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Eskandare","CreatedById":62742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:24:43Z","Content":"Ooooooooooooooppppps!
