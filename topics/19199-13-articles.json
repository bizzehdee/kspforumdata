The tanks don\u0027t fit snugly as displayed in the demo pics, there\u0027s a slight lack in height as though there\u0027s a missing part that\u0027s a 5-10 cm slither? You could fix that by adding (6) as a slither of equipment under the tank, and / or stripping the top of the tank to accommodate (E). Also the pod is oddly shaped and just the wrong size to be skinned by 2M fairings, perhaps reduce it to 1.9 meters or bring it up to 2.5-2.9 so 2.75 or 3 meter bulkheads and fairings can attach (possibly add your own reskin of the bulkhead and fairings if you want it to be a fully \u0027modular\u0027 system)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The ability to fit only one tank is limiting, not even surface attached redundancy is available, and surface attachment is pretty buggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) If the drop pod lands the wrong way up or rolls you\u0027re -****ed- as you can\u0027t right click to right it inside the pod, and opening the pod doesn\u0027t save it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE) Laser turret is cool, but it doesn\u0027t mount properly (it\u0027s like 1/6th the size of the other stuff that fits that node) and should be a turret alone that fits on that large unused node atop the DEMV4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) MechJeb and ISA MapSat should be included in parts, feel free to use \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 :: \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=80\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbal.net/mod.php?id=80\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;Internalized MechJeb \u0026amp; ISA MapSat Antennae Kit\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor them instead of their full units to keep it streamlined, or hack the DAE\u0027s, but note the ISA antenna currently won\u0027t map the planet as the developer of the plugin has hard coded the animation into the plugin code, thus if you don\u0027t use the original sat dish when it tries to animate your antenna it fails and the entire plugin ****s itself and dies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Prone to the DEMV bug where your vehicle will--for absolutely no reason, even on flats under same speed--barrel roll smashing all your peripherals and leaving you stranded and wanting to smash your monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this feedback helps, it\u0027s some pretty major stuff and I know the last thing you want to read immediately after a release are issues such as these.

I believe BlazingAngel, a BobCat Ind. team member has been updating the Mk4 \u0022Rat\u0022 relatively recently. The version you see on SpacePort is his updated version. I can\u0027t remember if the ion engines were ever included... I feel like they were, but that was before electricity was a stock resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I looked through my mod archive: the original version did indeed have the Ion Engines, but it is for 0.17.1 and uses several old versions of plugins like mumechlib.dll and zkreuzung.dll... there\u0027s no way it\u0027s compatible with any recent version of the game, and even if it was, it would overwrite any new versions of those plugins you might have installed from other mods.
