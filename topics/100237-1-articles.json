Im willing to do my own research on leads, just give me a point in the right direction. Or maybe you have found an almost perfect way of using the stock electric engines to do what ever you need to do, im willing to look into that as well! \n\nThanks so much!"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T21:13:19Z","Content":"This request for an add-on has been moved to General Add-on Affairs.\n\nKSP Interstellar has some plasma thrusters that can be upgraded to use \u0022vacuum plasma.\u0022 Whether that\u0027s realistic is matter of some debate. I believe there are also stand alone mods for similar engines.\n\nOn another note, it is possible to build stock SSTOs using the Ion engines, though that\u0027s necessarily unrealistic since Ion engines can only provide thrust in a vacuum and the stock engines provide about 2000x the thrust of the real thing."},{"CreatedByName":"jefferyharrell","CreatedById":27205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T01:10:43Z","Content":"Near Future Technologies has a wide variety of electric engines that use argon, xenon or hydrogen as reaction mass. Thing is, though, you can either have realism, or you can have high-thrust reaction-less engines. You can\u0027t really have both at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T01:33:53Z","Content":"Interstellar mod is the most long winded mod i have ever seen for this game but its well worth it."}]}
