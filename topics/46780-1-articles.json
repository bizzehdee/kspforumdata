When I looked up, I saw a very bright star right next to the moon, and a thought that it had to be Jupiter. After a little ride in my other buddy\u0027s car, I got home and ran to get my approximately new telescope, which is a Skywatcher Startravel with a 90mm EQ2 mount. I bought it right about a month ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got it out and immediately started veiwing Jupiter, began correcting the finder scope with the lowest magnification, and I instantly saw it. Jupiter appeared as a bright spot with two darker belts in it, and four other dimmer dots of light, which where the four galilean moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw them in this order from left to right: Callisto, Ganymede, Jupiter, Europa and Io.

When I did that, I could see three or four darker cloud belts on Jupiter, but it might just be me. But overall I think Jupiter were a little too bright too view further detail on the planet. I will get some filters (colour, light pollution, polarizing, moon, planetary and sun filters) to get more out more detail of my telescope. I will also buy a camera adapter for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my position in Norway, Uranus and Neptune within range, but because there\u0027s too much light pollution around, I have to go to somewhere else to view them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I am greatly satisfied with my views, and can\u0027t wait until next time! My ultimate goal is to maybe begin with astrophotography. I am aware that the EQ2 mount is below the ground for longer exposures, but I will try!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to share this experience with all you other space enthusiasts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T16:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats, it\u0027s a great feeling. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can look for Saturn and Venus, they\u0027re quite low in the sky after the sunset.

At first, I wasn\u0027t quite sure if I was looking at Jupiter. I had a feeling it may have been Venus, but the little dots to the left were making me think otherwise, plus I could have sworn I was seeing some stripes on the orb. A check-up on my astronomy software confirmed that it was, in fact, Jupiter.
