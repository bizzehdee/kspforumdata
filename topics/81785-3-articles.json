The ModuleScienceCollecter can be added to any parts with ModuleCommand \u0026amp; ModuleScienceContainer using Module Manager of course. It does not do any storage on it\u0027s own but instead stores everything in the ModuleScienceContainer. Kerbal Space Program is programmed that when a Kerbal on EVA tries to board a vessel it will try and dump any science he happens to be holding into the ModuleScienceContainer of that vessel, however at the moment there is no way to code this at all so you will always need a ModuleScienceContainer to be present or it will break a designed feature of the game. ModuleScienceCollecter however grabs the ModuleScienceContainer of the part it is added to and stores everything in there while double checking it doesn\u0027t accidently grab the any science from that storage container. The main reasoning behind this is so that you don\u0027t break a feature since by adding a ScienceContainer to the command module will add extra unnecessary buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirDargon","CreatedById":118968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T19:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy did you close the pull request?

He wants some of his experiments to have a lab boost based off of the base value of the science, instead of the transmit value but for him to that, he had to hard code the change to the transmit value once it had been processed while still in the experiments. This means, if you take the ScienceData out of the experiment (either by Kerbal or mods like mine or ship manifest) it would revert to the base 50% boost based on the transmit value. I\u0027ve finished a quick proof of concept in which I extended ScienceData and added fields for a boost amount (if you don\u0027t want the default 50%) and whether it\u0027s based of the base value or the transmit value. Along with this, I made a module that gets added to any parts that have ModuleScienceLab that and takes care of editing the transmit value before being processed so that it gets the expected boost (currently it doesn\u0027t extend ModuleScienceLab, but in the actual release it will and will replace ModuleScienceLab on the parts via a MM file).
