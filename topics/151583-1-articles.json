It was from a part that had a double reference in it\u0027s file on the ship. Once I found the part I removed it\u0027s double reference, which was on the parent part in that case, and it stopped exploding at 6k where it would almost certainly do it. It could be similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAKA, I had to edit the parts file and delete one line that should have had a double entry. It did all sorts of cool stuff like we could blow it up on the runway and make the parts dance around in an upward climb while they all moved around each other like around a black whole and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9717#change-44058\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/9717#change-44058\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138905-the-orion-and-the-kraken-6000m-auto-explosion/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139421-ye-olde-file-corruption-issue/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have resolved this earlier had I realized there was a second parts reference on the mother part for the radiator causing the problem. If I had known that earlier I would have found the issue and deleted the second reference. But I only remove the main part from the file not the reference from the part I put it on. If this is the same issue take note of that because it may not resolve it until a double reference is gone which may be on the mother part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-06T03:46:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2016 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Znath","CreatedById":38611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T04:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOH boy... yea that sounds fun.\u00A0 That sounds about right.\u00A0 I made a really quick \u0027icbm\u0027 type rocket just to test and it seemed to work fine.\u00A0 So I\u0027d bet the problem is with the main cargo itself since it\u0027s the only thing in common.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
