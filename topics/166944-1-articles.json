But, I almost always seem to have trouble with it. Many times I find myself 20 minutes into a mission when I try to quicksave, but can\u0027t. I then try to go to the space center, but this is also impossible, it shows that I click the buttons, but doesn\u0027t do anything. I then have to revert to my mates save and restart the mission. I have found this even more annoying recently because I am on my first mission to duna in my current career mode, I have a quicksave about 5 days before the encounter and can revert to it every time this happens, but I have gotten a duna encounter about 20 times now, and every time it goes into this\u00A0state where I will lose all progress on anything I do. I would really like some help on this, because I can\u0027t progress in the game at all now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-07T00:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would close KSP and come back.

There goes different effort into the different platforms, it\u0027s all a different license key.\u00A0When having a license that works on Xbox, Playstation and PC, it\u0027s just encouraging theft and a loss in profit.
