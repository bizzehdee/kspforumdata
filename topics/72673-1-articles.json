It is a world, one of the many that we will one day inhabit and own. It is a world, one of the many in which we will exploit.

It is our home world, our cradle, our nursery, but is it our final destination?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes-there are those dying everyday from cancer, starvation, sickness, and such. But as long as humanity exists, there will be third-world nations suffering from these vices. To stay and help is to limit our technologies and sciences. We must realize-there are some we have to try to forget, to leave behind on our blazing odyssey to the stars. Yes, we should provide them with aid and try to ease their suffering, but we should never, ever limit our own technologies and sciences, for any reason and for any cause, unless the fate of mankind as a whole be at stake. And while they make up an considerable of the human race, we cannot, ever, limit our horizons and technologies by trying to uplift them.

When you colonize a new planet, when you explore new star systems, when you land on new planetary bodies, you carry the spirit of humanity. In doing so, you are helping to save an entire race, freeing humanity from the constraints of our cradle. Earth, as I said, is not a limit. It is a starting ground, a \u0022testing place\u0022 for our new technologies that will help us colonize the planets in this system and at interstellar destinations. Earth. It is our cradle, our mother, our very world that we have known for our entire history. But it is time for Earth to say farewell to her children. It is time for us to leave the Earth behind, develop new technologies, find new Earth\u0027s, and colonize and expand our horizons, past the boundaries of our home system, past Mars, heading outward to the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T13:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething in our programming lets us be curious and go out to explore, humankind left its cradle in Africa and it might well leave Earth at some point in the future.
