One thing you should know about me is that I am lazy and not above cheating. I edit\u00A0config\u00A0files all the time - i already edited a file in the demo version of Kerbal because it did\u0027t give me enough fuel to finish a tutorial. In Orbiter,\u00A0I once put the Jovian moons in orbit around Earth just so I wouldn\u0027t have to fly all the way out to Jupiter to visit them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a casual user of Orbiter who\u00A0mostly just tools\u00A0around the solar system in the Delta Glider looking for weird orbits around\u00A0Callisto and such. In all probability, I will build a version of the Delta Glider in Kerbal too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey, it is my toy and I will do with it what I will. :-) But, if I find something cool, I will share it. :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T02:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, Ty Tan Tu. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T14:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I am off to a slow start. Let\u0027s hope today will be better, :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout reading anything, I built a rocket I thought might work, but when I launched it, the parachute deployed on launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I went through the first two rocket building tutorials (the first one makes a joke about what I did in my first attempt). I did the F12 fuel cheat and built a basic ship, capsule, parachute, decoupler, fuel tank, and a liquid fuel engine I pick at random just because it fit on my fuel tank. I don\u0027t remember now what it was, but it was powerful. By the time I thought to look at the map I was in escape velocity. I probably could have saved the situation, what with unlimited fuel, but I choose to start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird attempt I pick a smaller engine. I got into orbit well enough and was having fun sculpting my orbit. I considered even doing a Hohmann transfer to Mun, but I could not figure out how to align\u00A0my plane with Mun. Besides, I needed to know how to get back to Kerbin. Well if you go back and look closely at the parts to my ship, I think you can guess how THAT went. D\u0027oh!!! I forgot the heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth time is a charm. I added the heat shield and launched into orbit. I think I still came in too hot. My Kerbel was getting very nervous, but at about 8000 things cooled down and the parachute icon turned grey. I staged the chute and safely landed - somewhere. :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T17:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I made it to Mun, but I don\u0027t think I designed my ship right to land, even in a 1950\u0027s SciFi movie.
