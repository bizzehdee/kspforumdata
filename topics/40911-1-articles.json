The answer that I\u0027m going with is that the lander upon re-entry will turn sideways, turn off its main engine, and then fire two side-mounted engines helping it slow down (along with 4 parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything works fine in my tests except for the fact that on EVERY LANDING, the MK 3 Pod that I\u0027m using always detaches from the lander. And even when the craft lands at a steady 4 mps, it still topples off. The only reason I added landing engines in the first place was because the force of the parachutes opening separated the command pod (which is understandable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can I do to fix this? Should I change command pods, or is there some sort of way to strengthen the connection between the pod and the rest of the rover? The later option would probably be the most helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blubbermonkeys","CreatedById":61719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T04:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStrut the commannd pod together with the thing you\u0027re attaching it to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T04:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Blubbermonkeys stated, struts, struts, struts!
