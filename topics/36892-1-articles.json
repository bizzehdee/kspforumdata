Is there a simple tutorial on how to set up orbits to the moons and other planets? I think I must have bumped into one here, but I\u0027m not sure where. Also, would it be possible to auto-pilot, say from Kerbal orbit to Mun orbit?

Just set a node anywhere, pull prograde until your projected orbit intersects with Mun\u0027s orbit, pull a little bit more, and than move the node around until you get an encounter\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
