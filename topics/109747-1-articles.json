I\u0027ve completed about 70 contracts so far, however I\u0027m having a serious issue with my recent one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this one, I have to do \u0022run test\u0022 between 90km and 97km on the LY-10 Landing Gear while in Orbit around Kerbin. I make sure all of the conditions have green checks next to them and then right click on the gear and hit \u0022run test\u0022 but nothing happens. I\u0027ve tried this many times, each time making sure that the conditions have been met, but nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried running the test at different stages but nothing comes up on the screen saying the test is running. It just doesn\u0027t seem to do anything...I\u0027m very confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be massively appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds wierd, but one thing to try might be to right click run test with the gear both closed and open.

It will say sub-orbital when it means over 70 km apo but under 70 km peri. If you have a green check there, it should mean you have satisfied that condition though. I\u0027ve also heard that sometimes a quicksave/quickload may help if you really have fulfilled the conditions but the game has not registered it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: You can use the gear button near the altimeter or use the right click menu on the part itself to open and close it.
