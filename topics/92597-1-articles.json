When I drag landing gear across the surface of my vessel, the CoM indicator visibly moves along with it. This is troublesome, as if my understanding is correct, it no longer reflects the actual in-game center of mass. This could cause problems in a number of ways; if you\u0027re trying to balance some phisiced part with one that is actually phisicsless on a small vessel, your thrust vector could be all off. Or, as I seem to be having trouble with, you put the main gear of a plane where the wheels are just behind the CoM, but because the \u0022apparent\u0022 mass point of the gear is ahead of the wheels, the displayed CoM moves forward and you end up with the wheels too far forward and the plane drops and flips back onto its tail when simulation starts (I know this also means my CoM and gear aren\u0027t actually in the ideal placement, I\u0027m just trying to get something to work as an experiment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I seeing this correctly and the displayed/actual CoM\u0027s don\u0027t match, or do they actually contribute to the CoM calculation and I\u0027m making some other mistake which isn\u0027t as obvious to me?
