I understand that this is not a new problem, I\u0027ve found quite a few threads on how to fix it, the one I\u0027ve been trying to follow is this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found the uids and the part numbers for both docking ports and I\u0027ve managed to get everything set the way the above thread suggests to do it, except for one thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the Mk2 docking port doesn\u0027t attach at the top or bottom (attN nodes for top and bottom attach to other parts of the space plane) and I have no idea what to put where to tell the Mk2 docking port what it\u0027s attached to. I tried:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattN = front, 0 {yes, the docking port it\u0027s attached to is actually part 0}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{also tried back, don\u0027t think it\u0027s left or right, but if someone thinks that\u0027s possible, I\u0027ll happily try it}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EsrfN = srfAttach, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to build a little test ship to just launch and examine the save file to see what node the other docking port would attach to, but it seems that I can\u0027t attach anything to a Mk2 docking port in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have quite a few mods installed, I\u0027m fairly sure they\u0027re all the latest versions. If anyone needs details, let me know what I should provide. I\u0027m not concerned that this issue is occurring, I just want to know how to edit the save file to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows what node the docking port attaches to, I\u0027d really appreciate that info. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a thought that it\u0027d attached as a MODULE {} block since the docking port isn\u0027t always there, but I can\u0027t find anything useful in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
