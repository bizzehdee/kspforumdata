Turns out, this was much easier than I thought, and all you actually have to do is have a small munbase and land it on top of one of the mountains near the north pole. The only time you can\\\u0027t see the sun is during an eclipse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still built my huge tall base, so I figured I\\\u0027d issue a challenge. Build a tall munbase, launch it, and land it on the mun. Use any of the standard packs: KW, novapunch, silisko, my miscellania, and so on. The taller the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s my attempt. 45 meters from foot to antennae. Used novapunch, my novapunch-balanced supertank, and my vanilla-balanced superengines.

And launching without tearing apart was insanely tricky. If I let it tilt too far? Falls apart and explodes. Jink too hard, falls apart and explodes.
