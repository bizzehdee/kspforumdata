That change in velocity will cause your object\u0027s orbit to change, possibly decaying into whatever body you\u0027re orbiting, or being ejected out of its sphere of influence altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, if you have a 100-ton station orbiting at, say, 6 km/second (taking Earth-like speeds here) and send a 1 kg payload at it at a speed of 8 km/second, then we have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum of target = 100 tons * 6 km/s = 600000000 kg * km/s (velocity towards the orbital tangent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum of payload = 1 kg * 8 km/s = 8000 kg * km/s (velocity perpendicular to the orbital tangent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVelocity of payload \u002B target after impact = sqrt(600000000^2 \u002B 8000^2) / (100 * 1000 \u002B 1) ~ 5999.94 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat corresponds to a change in velocity of 0.06 km/s = 60 m/s, taking the target craft slightly off course off the orbital tangent. Consider how much you can change your orbit with that much delta-v. Now consider a larger payload (or multiple payloads) and the fact that surviving an orbital collision with a 1 kg payload is basically impossible, and you now know why this isn\u0027t done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you meant not actually colliding, but having the payload come very close to the target (apoapsis near your station) and then \u0022latching onto it\u0022, then something similar happens - the payload has no momentum at its apoapsis (its velocity is zero), yet when it docks with the target, the resulting payload \u002B target system has a greater mass, and the same momentum as the target alone. As a result, its velocity will be lowered, causing the orbit to slowly decay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReusing the above example, we have a 100-ton station orbiting at, say, 6 km/second (taking Earth-like speeds here) and there\u0027s a 1 kg payload hovering at its apoasis \u0022snatched\u0022 by the docking port, then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum of target = 600000000 kg * km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum of payload = 0 kg * km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVelocity of payload \u002B target = 600000000 / (100 * 1000 \u002B 1) ~ 5999.94 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA loss of 60 m/s of velocity (60 m/s delta-v spent towards decaying the orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an observation, in the first case (collision) the speed of the payload doesn\u0027t actually matter that much if it is much smaller than the target. From the point of view of the target, the main difference is that it gained mass for no additional momentum, leading to reduced velocity. The only way for velocity to the conserved is if the two momentum vectors add constructively and as such are \u003Cstrong\u003Eprecisely\u003C/strong\u003E in the same direction, which is just another way of saying that the payload must be in the same orbit as the target \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is really the same thing as having a train going at constant velocity on rails (suppose no acceleration and no friction), then putting a car on the rails in front of it. If the car survives the crash, then the train (and the car in front of it) will be going slower. Add enough cars and your train will grind to a halt. Add a huge obstacle (with a mass far greater than the train) and the train will simply smash into it and stop, period. Similarly, if you shoot enough bullets at such a train, it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E stop, eventually. It will take a lot of bullets but every bullet that bounces off will steal some momentum from the train, and every bullet that stays embedded in the train increases its mass (and hence lowers its speed), ultimately the train must stop!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplied to an orbital situation, if it were possible to design materials to survive such high speed impact, your station would still need enough fuel to restore its original orbit after every payload is received, so at that point you may as well just use that fuel on the payloads themselves and get them into the proper orbit to spare yourself the collision (which is what we are doing). You won\u0027t save any fuel either way (conservation of momentum).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-20T15:34:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2013 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Bacterius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T15:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d have to time it absolutely perfectly, so that your sub-obital craft\u0027s docking ports meat the other\u0027s at exactly apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T16:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027d have to time it absolutely perfectly, so that your sub-obital craft\u0027s docking ports meat the other\u0027s at exactly apoapsis.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027d still have a huge difference in velosity, un les you were at gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
