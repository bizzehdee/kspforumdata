Such as, one part of the vessel holding the other up in the air, or part of the vessel being forced into the ground.\n\nAnother is that this sort of thing gets into the territory of moving parts like IR. When you do that you have to deal with moving joints around on an existing vessel, trying to account for struts, or autostruts, which are things that I gather are really nasty to deal with. The animation of the docking port extending and retracting doesn\u0027t have anything to do with the physical connection between the two vessels, so you could technically retract the port, but you would just end up with a gap between the vessels.\n\nAnd, also, Flexible Docking ports is extremely finicky, and delicate. I\u0027m always hesitant to try to change things because it will probably break something else. For instance, I have a method for making the ends of the ports able to rotate significantly more than they do, something like ~40^o^ instead of 10-12^o^ like it is now. But when I do it, the math for positioning the flexible docking ports get screwed up and things don\u0027t end up in the right place anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"Fzzt","CreatedById":156473,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T04:23:34Z","Content":"Trying to use PortraitStats and not seeing any extended info when hovering over their portraits.\n\nIcons, stars are working, as do the xfr buttons.
