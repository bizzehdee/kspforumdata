You want the pitch to start at 90 (vertical) at altitude=0m, and end at zero (horizontal) at altitude=60000m. Assuming the ALT variable is in meters, and your scaling function is just x=x, you set the KAL x range to 0-60000 and mount the ALT variable to the x axis. The y axis range is set 0-90, with any ascent profile you like. The output can operate control surfaces/robot parts directly, or be mounted as the x component on another KAL graph.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boriz","CreatedById":219053,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-08T01:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEG: The x axis on the KAL graph = airspeed, call it ASP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut ASP into the KAL x coordinate, and the y output can control propeller pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
