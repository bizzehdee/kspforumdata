I\u0027ve been right and wrong.. I think.\n\u003E \n\nThre\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with reporting threads that you think might be even slightly amiss, what ever the reason.  As long as you give us a little bit of info to work with in the report editor, the worst that can happen, for the most part, is we go \u0022Eh.... nothing to see here, carry on\u0022.  We know most people are reporting threads for the good of the forums, and not some personal agenda, although that does happen every now and then.  \n\nBut the worst type of report is the one that does not explain anything about why they are reporting the post.   We only see the post you are reporting not the whole thread.  Yeah we can click on some links to get there, but If we have to do much digging to figure why it got reported in the first place, it just makes the job harder.    So a little context with each report helps.   Even if it\u0027s just a little blurb like \u0022Wrong forum\u0022 \u0022Swearing\u0022 or \u0022This user has summoned Zuul and we need to do something about it before it gets out of hand\u0022.   That way we know what we\u0027re looking for when we dive into it, and we can prioritize the workflow if we need to.   Although, that last one would require three other mods to agree to cross the streams, even though we agreed to never cross the streams, and then cover a large metropolitan neighborhood in marshmallow cream.  And given that the moderation team is a global force, getting us altogether that quick might be a logistical nightmare.   So if that happens, expect us to deputize some of you that are local to each other so we can fight the scourge as a solid front. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-18T23:27:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2019 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel**\n  \nWhoops, \\*does not"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T03:44:43Z","Content":"Speaking of reporting threads, isn\u0027t the way to nominate a thread for TOTM only by reporting it and putting a reason for your nomination as the subject?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T04:03:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, The\\_Cat\\_In\\_Space said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of reporting threads, isn\u0027t the way to nominate a thread for TOTM only by reporting it and putting a reason for your nomination as the subject?\n\u003E \n\nYup!
