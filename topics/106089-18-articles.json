Cryogenic Engines does it, and another mod that also implements boiloff and also adds fuel switching for stock tanks may also do it. What effects that may have, I can only guess - but my first gut feeling is that the boiloff mechanics simply stack. In other words, you get to deal with both mods sapping your fuel supply at once.

Nor would we add boiloff to a stock resource. Adding boiloff for LH2 but not LOX makes a certain amount of sense anyway, as boiloff is a much less severe problem for LOX compared to LH2 in the real world. Moreover, the mass \u0022penalty\u0022 for extra insulation/refrigeration for LH2 is actually relatively minor - that is, the interval mass difference between LH2 lifting tanks and ZBOs is equivalent to only 10% of the dry mass of a volume-matched LFO tank.\n\nThe true dry mass \u0022penalty\u0022 for LH2 tanks is primarily related to fuel density. LH2 is far less dense than other fuels, and therefore requires much greater (~700%) tank volume for an equivalent fuel mass. Greater tank volume means greater tank mass, though the mass per volume is actually only half as much (or less), as mentioned above, which partially offsets this penalty. The penalty is further mitigated by using 2x the real-world density of LH2.

However, when arguing that LH2 tanks ought to be lighter, based on comparisons to specific real-world rocket stages or lack of need for internal bracing (as Bluebottle was doing), I believe it\u0027s useful to step back and remember that empty LH2 tanks are actually the lightest objects in the game for their size.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T06:06:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T03:05:50Z","Content":"Some of the piping on Chelyabinsk engine clips through nozzle during animation."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T04:22:01Z","Content":"Besides, OX isn\u0027t liquid oxygen anyway, it\u0027s nitrogen tetroxide. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T04:49:23Z","Content":"If LH2 fudge factor were 1.5, it would result in much more handy (matching-wise and a bit closer to RL) 2:1 tankage ratio with OX.
