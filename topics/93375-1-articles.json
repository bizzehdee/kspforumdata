This happens both in the VAB and in flight, although it seems like mousing over the same part several times reduces the time it takes to draw the effect. A single 1.25m capsule with a basic SRB is enough to replicate the effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP version: 0.90 Windows 32 bit, steam version\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zat11upjoq1fgv/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput_log.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4l0mfb3g23knodx/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDxDiag.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibly relevant: I noticed in the output log that KSP thinks my graphics card uses shader model 3; it actually uses shader model 4, although it\u0027s one of the earliest cards that did so. Since shader model 4 added geometry shaders (at least in OpenGL), which are very useful for things like edge highlighting, my guess would be that KSP or unity is using some sort of CPU-based fallback and then caching it, hence the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously in the meantime I can just disable the effect and everything works fine, but it would be nice to enjoy the new effects like everyone else \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I decided to try -force-opengl, it seems to mostly resolve the problem. There\u0027s still a very slight frame jitter when mousing over the stage list, but it\u0027s no longer severe enough to warrant turning it off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T02:08:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound a partial workaround\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T18:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirmed, the game derps for nearly two seconds on my older machine if dare to go near the staging interface.
