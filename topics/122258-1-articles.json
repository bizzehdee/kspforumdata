My keyboard flying skills are sub-par. This despite being an instrumented rated pilot of real planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a very good autopilot mod by Crzyrndm called \u0022Pilot Assistant\u0022 (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-0-90-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-0-2-%28Jan-24%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E). But it did not have any course following abilities. I have taken the source code for Pilot Assistant and heavily modified it to add course guidance (both horizontal and vertical) so that it can autoland a spaceplane on the KSC runway. Many thanks to Crzyrndm--this mod would never have happened without the excellent starting point. Note that I did not keep all the capabilities of Pilot Assistant--I was very focused on auto-landing and things that were not really needed for that were omitted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight plans can be loaded from configuration files located in the GameData folder. There is currently no capability to create new flight plans on the fly within the game, but you can edit the GameData/KramaxAutoPilot/FlightPlans.cfg file and add flight plans that way. Look at GameData/KramaxAutoPilot/DefaultFlightPlans.cfg for the format of the flight plans. The \u0022Refresh\u0022 button on the flight plan load/save dialog will reload from that file so you do not have to restart the game every time you change a flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic Instructions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the autopilot to depart from KSC runway 09 as well as land on it.

For KSC RW09, I found that when coming from an 80km orbit, a 100m/s retrograde burn just before I get to the huge impact crater seems to work well.

Open up the \u0022Approach Speeds\u0022 pane at the bottom. Change the speeds to match your craft. You want to land as slow as possible, so make your final speed something that is a good margin above stall speed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAfter passing MAXKY you can enable auto-throttle \u0022Landing\u0022 mode to hold current speed and then decrease it to match the approach speeds as it heads for the next fixes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt 500m (above ground) it should auto-lower your landing gear.

No, I forgot that the runway changes length. Does the threshold of RW09 actually move? Is the midpoint always in a constant location? In any case, it would be easy to just create some alternate approaches (ILS 09 1000M RW say) that have the threshold point (RW) adjusted. You could just copy the ILS approach from the DefaultFlightPlan.cfg file into FlightPlan.cfg and adjust the longitude of the RW point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it currently tends to land most of my spaceplanes about 1/5 the way down the runway (as in, when the wheels touch).

Bad news--you are going like a bat out of hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou definitely need to be able to slow down when using the RW09 approach. You just cannot get low fast because of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe mountains and so you cannot start really slowing until the initial fix. If your plane does not have some type\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof braking (either natural drag or airbrakes or ...) you may have problems. But this is just like in real life. If you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecome into final approach in a citation jet at 250 knots you will not be able to get it down and stopped. So speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emanagement is important. For spaceplanes that cannot slow down while descending this approach would probably just not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a RW27 approach would be useful in those cases.

But I normally\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo not enable GS until I am level at the next fix altitude and passing it. Also, I really need to make it save the approach speeds on a per-vessel basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is annoying to have to set them each time.

Could do with a lot of smoothing, tbh, but I haven\u0027t spent that long on anything. My approach to 27 is long and flat - I usually allow for 10km over ground per 1km loss of altitude ( at most ) for the actual approach which has historically been about the right slope for my spaceplanes to glide in, but obviously that is not going to be the same for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/5rvalhpxczsz165/FlightPlans.cfg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5rvalhpxczsz165/FlightPlans.cfg?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s great, thanks for contributing!
