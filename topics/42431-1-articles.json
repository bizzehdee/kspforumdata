Your periapsis seems precariously low, so i\u0027d raise that with your final delta-V to give you some maneuvring room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, send a craft with plenty of fuel and space for your kerbals up and towards the moon. You need to have enough fuel to get to a munar orbit, preform orbital maneuvers there and preferably get back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash course Orbital Rendezvous: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to the mun with your other craft. Make sure you\u0027re orbiting around the Mun in the same direction when you arrive, and try to get the inclination of your orbit as close as possible to the target craft. Looks like you have a pretty equatorial orbit, so you should aim for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, set the base as your target, and when the rescue craft is on the side of the Mun opposite the base\u0027s periapsis, then burn prograde/retrograde untill your periapsis is the same as the bases periapsis. They should be close together too now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, set up a maneuver node. You should see an \u0027ascending\u0027 node and a \u0027descending\u0027 node indicator on your orbit. Move the maneuver node there and pull the normal and antinormal nodes untill they indicate something close to 0.1 or 0. Preform that burn at the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, timeaccelerate untill your base has just passed its periapsis. Then, timeaccelerate untill you reach your own periapsis and burn untill your apoapsis is close to the bases apoapsis, but still lower than it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should now be in an orbit with the base slightly ahead of you, and your orbit being slightly smaller than it. I\u0027d quicksave at this point. This will make that you orbit faster than the base, and so catch up to it. From there, it\u0027s maneuver nodes and guesswork. When you\u0027ve gone around the Mun enough times so you are getting close to catching up to the base, add a maneuver node at your periapsis and pull it prograde untill your orbits are equalised (don\u0027t execute it yet). You should see a marker appear for your \u0027closest intersect\u0027, along with the distance between you at this point. Pull your node more prograde or retrograde untill your closest intersect is within a few kilometres of eachother. If this doesn\u0027t work, either make another orbit or two and try again, or load your quicksave and try again, this time with less orbits. When you manage to get that node right, and your intersect within a few kilometres, execute it. When you then get to that intersect point, change your velocity meter to \u0027target\u0027 velocity and cancel that out entirely. Then point your ship towards the base and burn that way at maybe 20 m/s. When you get as close to the base as your velocity will take you, cancel out the target-relative velocity, point your nose back towards your target and repeat. In two or three goes of doing that you should be close enough to EVA your Kerbals over, ditch the moon base and fly your rescue ship back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that was clear enough :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alacrity","CreatedById":70443,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T10:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can rendevous and you have a docking option (unused port or KAS system) then I would get a fuel tug out the and refuel for a final burn to land that beast.
