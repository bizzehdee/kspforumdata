Basically a 1.25 meter Command Pod (with a reduced amount of AblativeShielding and no Hydrazine) on top of a MassiveSRB (seperated by a DRE decoupler) which was not yet activated and sitting on top of 3 thrust-limited BACC SRB\u0027s under a tricoupler, with another decoupler between the bottom of the MassiveSRB and the tricoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA basic understanding of physics would dictate VERY LOW forces on the Command Pod. Since all the heavy parts were below it, basically there should only be enough upward force left after gravity on the parts lower down to lift the Command Pod at less than 2 G\u0027s- with a little drag on it from above (FAR was installed, and the speed wasn\u0027t that high: so not a lot of drag) which shouldn\u0027t have been a very big deal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, maybe that\u0027s NOT as simple as it sounds.

If the speed is above 200 m/s, the parachutes are instantly cut (with no heating of the parachutes displayed). I had parachutes cut at 700 feet above sea level at 300m/s. The second time, they were cut as my rocket hit an apex at 15,000 feet, I deployed parachutes, and the ship accelerated downward from 0 m/s to 1,000 m/s. The parachutes cut when the speed crossed around 200 m/s.
