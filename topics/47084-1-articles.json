The game doesn\u0027t include fantastic support for unique and creative designs, with the exception of parts clipping. Designs are forced to get too big too fast, due to the currently used exponential stepping pointed out by PDCWolf. Sure, some support exists, but it\u0027s extremely limited and I feel in drastic need for an update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess technically everything after this is somewhat off-topic, though still related. Let me know if you would like me to move this to it\u0027s own thread. Of course if you feel it is taking the thread towards a positive and appropriate discussion, then there is no problem with it staying here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the tank changes shouldn\u0027t be limited to the diameters only, especially due to the ease of rescaling parts via the config file. And a larger change will allow for an opportunity for a UI change as well. I don\u0027t mean a complete redesign of the UI, perhaps it can be accomplished with just an extra window that pops out after you select your part. This slight UI change will allow for a complete redesign of the ship building process to accommodate for a more modular in-game approach to rocket designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuel tanks, it should be extremely simple: you select the design of tank you want from the current in-game UI (design explained later in more detail), a window will then appear instead of the part where the player will: select the diameters of the tank (0.625m, 1.25m, 1.875m, 2.5m, 3.125m, 3.75m), then volume of the tank (small, medium, or large), then the part will appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want a small, stock, 1.25m tank for whatever your design calls for, you just select the stock image, then a window can pop up prompting for the diameter (easily done via drop-down menu), and the volume (also easily done via drop-down, or potentially a write-in via an advanced menu). When the window disappears and the part is placed in the workspace, to be attached to your ship as how it is currently done in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if this method is used, an \u0022advanced\u0022 option can be available so the player can select the diameter of the tank from the list, then type in exactly how much volume they want. The game can then calculate the height of the tank and the weight (which will just be numbers in the config file anyway), then the model will be scaled to fit (again via config) and then placed in the game. Should be technically easy. Would be really convenient stock as it will be innately applied to all parts, be they stock or mods, and will allow for an even more modular approach to ship designs for players interested in using just as much fuel they calculate they\u0027ll need for their design. Example: if a player wants to send a probe to Jool, they can guess via small, medium, or large options like how the game currently has it. Or a more advanced player can calculate exactly how much fuel they need to design a rocket that will just get their probe to it\u0027s target without any unnecessary fuel or weight. Both options will be available with this design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may also support the eventual career mode, as more sizes may be made available via node discovery. Simple menu example: only medium volume is available at first, and after research is completed other volumes are made available. Advanced menu example: A small, medium range of values will be accepted until more research is done where the range will be expanded to a new cap. The same research-limited approach can be applied to other diameters. Perhaps only the current diameters will be allowed at first until more research is completed to allow for the larger variety of sizes to be made available late-game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EExplaining design in more detail\u003C/span\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for having a variety of tank designs, this is mostly targeted at modders. If someone designs a \u0022Saturn V First Stage\u0022 tank, it\u0027s mostly just a re-texture of a cylinder. But what if you want a square tank or any other shape of tank? Well I don\u0027t think these parts will ever be created as stock, but modders might create them. If there is a custom option in the new UI, you can select different shaped tanks that have their own creator-defined formula for determining scale so that the advanced option of the UI can still be used for these more unique, non-stock parts. To select a different design, you\u0027ll just select the image of the tank from the currently used in-game UI. Just like if you install a mod part today, it will appear in the catalog. Once it is selected, it will have the \u0022custom option\u0022 in the window where the modder can define their own diameters or other dimensions, and volumes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor complex models, or parts, with no easily definable formula for volume (or if they are parts like wings and don\u0027t have a volume), 3 simple sizes can be predetermined by the part creator and accessed via the simple menu\u0027s \u0022small, medium, and large\u0022 options. These will be default options in the event where the part doesn\u0027t have the advanced part flag (just as an example to suggest how the advanced option will work alongside the basic option).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is any interest in this, I can draw up some rough sketches to outline the idea more clearly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-01T21:16:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2013 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Natsarugiy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAquired","CreatedById":83672,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T20:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean the parts or the UI?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but for those who are serious about recreating stuff, and i understand this is a pretty scientific community, then I can understand the potential there is in adding the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T21:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stock parts are 0.625, 1.25, 2.5.
