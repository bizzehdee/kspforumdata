First one wheel feel through, then a second wheel feel through. The vehicle could not be dislodged even though it could move forward and backwards about a quarter of a meter. it could move in horizontal circles. Escaping to space center only allowed me to abandon the mission and loose the Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisually there is no difference between these death-traps and the surrounding terrain, other than being within meters from the edge of some zone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
