When I opened the game there was a loading screen for Unity. I can only assume that this was an update to unity engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, since opening, the game has become unbearably slow. It\u2019s \u00A0probably running at about 1-2 fps. I lowered the scatter density and quality as well as the render and texture quality. This seemed to help. However, the problem still persists when launching planes from the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play on my laptop and until now the game has always run fairly well on ultra shaders and the highest render setting with roughly 80% scatter density and default quality terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to fix this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T13:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVid card drivers up to date?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T14:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs? Excessively low FPS is often caused by severe exception spam which slows the game to a crawl but doesn\u2019t usually cause it to crash- the logs will show if that\u2019s the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack up your saves (copy the folders inside KSP/saves to your desktop) then completely uninstall and reinstall the game and see if that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
