For Bases, long voyages, etc?  Thank you ..\n\u003E \n\nWell, things are a bit borked right now with regard to the hab-values (possibly the multipliers not working if another vessel is within 150m...), but I did an [analysis](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154032-scrapyardbobs-ksp-12-career-dec-2016-image-heavy/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2934517) based on the subway map.\n\nIf you look at the [subway map on the KSP wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet#Maps), there are transit values, plus on the ends there are time periods which represent the average time that you\u0027ll have to wait for a return transfer window to open up.  I came up with the following estimates:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Moho - 100-120 days per transit, average of 135 days to wait for a return window.  Orbit is worth 10.5 points, but a landing is 16.1.  That would get me to 32 total easily in order to have a level 4 kerbal.  I\u0027d only need ~400 days of hab-time and supplies for each kerbal.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Eve / Gilly - 178 days per transit, but 1y 380d for a return window.  Eve orbit is 10.0 pts and a Gilly orbit is 9 pts.  Eve landing is only worth 1.5 more points, while a Gilly landing adds 4.8 points.  So Eve orbit \u002B Gilly landing = 23.8 points.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Duna / Ike - 300 days in transit each way, 2y 34d for a return window (on average).  Duna landing \u002B Ike landing = 23 points.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Dres - About 1.5 years per transit, and 1.25 years for a return window. Gives 13.8 pts for a landing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Jool - 2.5-3.0 years per transit, transit windows are every 475 days on average.  That\u0027s a 7-year mission to and back, not including any stops (which could add another 1-2 years) at moons.  Jool orbit is 9 pts, but each moon is 12 pts (or 18.4 pts for a landing).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Eeloo - 4.5 years per transit, return window about every 1.6 years.  That\u0027s at least an 11 year mission.  Gives 23 points for landing.\n\u003E \n\n1 kerbal year = 426 kerbal days (approximately), I suggest rounding everything up by a bit (10-30%) to allow for delays or slower then expected transfers."},{"CreatedByName":"Benno","CreatedById":61508,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T10:43:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, wile1411 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Changing just \u0027trait\u0027 isn\u0027t enough to fix it.
