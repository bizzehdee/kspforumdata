Since I forgot to bring a KAS winch, I had to get the two ships unreasonably close to one another - putting Bill down within twenty meters of the target craft in an area with a fifteen percent grade. Needless to say, I didn\u0027t make that on the first try. But I did eventually get him in position and from there it was a simple matter for him to screw on the two connector ports he was carrying - one on each ship - and then link them together with a pipe. Connection made, tourists piped out, science piped out and the \u003Cem\u003EHound Dog\u003C/em\u003E cannibalized most of the \u003Cem\u003ESuperfortress\u0027s \u003C/em\u003Eremaining fuel for the trip home prior to disconnect.

Bad thing about picking up pods from surface is that there is no moving part such as a telescope arm, crane or something which would allow a bit more flexible operation of the claw. In any case before going there I wanted to see what I\u0027m dealing with. So I redirected a research rover to the crash site to have a look at what\u0027s the pod to fetch. Luckily the crashed Kerbal was a scientist. I had only a pilot on the rover but already nearly max. science in the lab.
