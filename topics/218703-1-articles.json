Story of the Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals are a human-like species that originate and live on the planet Kerbin. They are green because they have chlorophyll cells that are left over from evolution. They speak Kerblingo (backwards Spanish like in the promotional shorts), the universal standard language of Kerbin. Their main currency is formally known as the Fund but is also called \u0022Kerbuck\u0022 for short. Kerbals come from different nations and provinces, with each country and location having unique cultures, like humans on Earth. Kerbals study several forms of religion, enjoy several different cuisines from different countries, and carry out traditions of their own cultures. And as for the fact that Kerbin is barren besides the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, well, I just pretend there\u0027s cities, because some KSP1 mods add city lights, so...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0I also pretend KSP has 24-hour days just for simplicity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point, Kerbin consisted of several Empires and Unions. However, the Great Kerbin War started, and by the time the war ended, no more Empires existed. The war was so terrible and costly (in lives and Funds, mostly lives) that Kerbalkind pledged that the GKW would be the last war ever fought. The Kerbin Nations was formed, where countries could settle their problems diplomatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cause of wanting to venture out into space was a result of the GKW. The Kerbals of the USSR and USA wanted to do something with the leftover ICBMs, so they began launching robotic payloads into the high atmosphere on them. The USSR got one into orbit, one thing led to another, and the Space Race happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Shameless self-promotion warning* Most of this lore is just from my Mission Report,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/216956-the-sky-is-not-the-limit-a-modded-ksp1-career-playthrough/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThe Sky is Not the Limit: A Modded KSP1 Career Playthrough\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. How do Kerbals survive in space?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have Kerbalism installed, so Kerbals are basically like humans. They breathe an oxygen-nitrogen mixture of air, they drink water, and eat food. They have a similar anatomy to humans, it seems, because they can get carbon dioxide poisoning, radiation sickness, and can asphyxiate. Kerbals appreciate having plenty of habitation space on their spacecrafts, and will not survive mentally on long voyages if given just a MK 1-3 pod to live in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals eat like humans eat: three meals a day, various kinds of foods. I assume Kerbals have similar cuisines as humans because promotional animations and KSP2 tutorial videos show Kerbals enjoying coffee, donuts, pizza, sandwiches, and various snacks. In space travel, the packaged meals are pretty minimal, so can choose from a small assortment of snacks for extra sustenance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. What are the Main Four Kerbonauts\u0027 personalities?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb is the combination of some of the best and most skilled astronauts. He\u0027s like Neil Armstrong, John Young, and Gordon Cooper, rolled into one person. In other words, he\u0027s calmed and collected under stress, he\u0027s highly skilled and precise, he can think outside the box, and is a good leader for his crew. But he also knows where his limit is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal is the fearless one. The total badass. When there\u0027s a vehicle that needs testing, Val is the one to do it. Val is a natural leader, and has several missions under her belt. She has traits similar to that of Jeb, but is definitely braver and more versatile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill is quite the jokester, but he\u0027s the best engineer the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E has ever seen. Give him some tools and some rocket parts, and he can build a satellite. He\u0027ll even do it off world, sometimes. And when the spacecraft is failing, leave it to Bill to get the crew out of the mess that one of the pilots got them into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob is less of a conversationalist and isn\u0027t exactly the most courageous out of the four, but he\u0027s one of the most experienced scientists in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. He knows every science instrument like the back of his hand and can work very efficiently when he needs to. Sometimes, unfortunately, his deep knowledge of the rockets he flies on can make him a bit skittish and unbearable to sit next to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t really thought about Tim C. Kerman\u0027s personality. Since he\u0027s based off of a real person, I don\u0027t know if how I portray his Kerbal self will be accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. What about the Easter Eggs?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I don\u0027t really know. It\u0027s probably like the actual scrapped KSP1 storyline, where the monoliths and stuff are messages from an alien precursor civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. My Space Program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy space program, the Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Administration, or KASA, is a US government-funded organization with the goal of exploring space and unlocking the secrets of the Kerbolar System by exploring it firsthand. They were originally formed to beat the Soviet Space Program in a race to land a Kerbal on the Mun. After the race was won, however, we chose to keep exploring for new reasons: the betterment of all Kerbalkind. We wanted to answer the big questions like: are we alone in the universe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKASA is led by an administration team, with Mortimer (Finances), Gene (Flight Director, Manned Flights) Bobak (Flight Director, Unmanned Flights), Wernher (Rocketry), Linus (Research), Walt (PR), and finally, Gus (Rocket Engineering).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery four years, a small selection of new Kerbonauts are chosen from thousands of applicants. Each Kerbonaut must pass various physical tests, a STEM master\u0027s, and have several other qualifications. After rigorous training, they are finally ready for space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKASA makes sure that Kerbonauts feel comfortable on longer missions, because a happy crew is an efficient crew. Several safety measures are also in place to ensure the crew\u0027s survival in dangerous situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-27T18:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2023 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 27\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by TwoCalories\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwoCalories","CreatedById":228871,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-03T21:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheaty post to unbury the thread, but seriously, it would be nice to have a megathread like this to talk about lore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerodynamic Kerbal","CreatedById":211338,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-04T09:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224307449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218703\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690830769\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228871\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TwoCalories\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/31/2023 at 10:12 PM, TwoCalories said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob is less of a conversationalist and isn\u0027t exactly the most courageous out of the four, but he\u0027s one of the most experienced scientists in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

They have at least a couple centuries to find a new home for Kerbalkind. At the right time, however, a Wormhole opens, giving Kerbalkind access to a new galaxy (Okay, this is starting to sound like Interstellar, I know). The descendants of the greatest Kerbonauts (the big four) are sent to explore the new systems on the other side of the wormhole.

When Jeb was 7 years old, he built a glider that he could ride in, and jumped off his roof in the glider to fly to Selbin\u0027s house about a mile away. Jeb was a bit of a daydreamer in school, as he was always making little wood planes instead of doing his work which led to his teachers just giving him free range of the high school\u0027s shop classroom and let him turn in whatever he built for credit. Jeb went to space camp when he was 15, and decided he wanted to become an astronaut. When Jeb was 23, he left home to go to Orbit Beach and the Orbit Beach School of Aerospace. He flew a homemade plane to get there, and he promptly crashed on the roof of an apartment building owned by Gene Kerman, a entrepreneur trying to get into the aerospace industry. Gene was impressed by Jeb\u0027s aircraft and offered him a room while he was learning at the university. There, he met Bill and Bob Kerman. Jeb got a masters degree in aviation and in math. At the university, Jeb met Valentina Kerman, another student in the aviation areas, and they began to date. Before they could get PHDs, the school ran out of funding, and had to shut down. Gene promptly bought the property, using money he got from his job selling struts, and turned the abandoned campus area into the Kerbal Space Center, and began to hire people such as Werner Von Kerman,\u00A0 Mortimer Kerman, Linus Kerman, Walt Kerman, and Gus Kerman. They had to convince the president, Harling Kerman, to make them part of the official space program, as the current one was in shambles. Harling agreed.

One day, the little vessel finally sank, and Val\u0027s family had nowhere to go. Val and her family moved into one of her relative\u0027s homes, where they put Val and her siblings into school. Val excelled in school, and would often stand up to bullies that were messing with kids in the school. During her schooling, Val was very introverted and mostly stayed in the library when she had the time. When Val graduated high school as a valedictorian, she took on lots of odd jobs to save up a lot of money to go to the Orbit Beach School of Aeronautics. When she was 21, she finally got enough money to go there. There, she got a masters in aviation and in astronomy. She met Jeb there, and the two began to date. When the school was shut down, Val immediately went on a long road trip up and down the Orbit Coast.

As they started building civilization, they stumbled across some monoliths and other Easter eggs, and couldn\u0027t help but wonder where they came from.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe disaster:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals had firmly made their prescence on Kerbin. They had civilization on every single corner of it. Until, a giant asteroid smacked into Kerbin... Most of the kerbals died, as they were mostly dependant on sunlight for power, so they were forced to eat. A few decades later, kerbals began to come back, and start to civilize again, but this time, underground (as we can\u0027t see any kerbal houses in stock, not even with ground scatter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, kerbals were in an urge to find if there was any other place to live, in case a similar disaster ever happened again...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-02T21:48:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2023 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 2\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Jeb x Valentina\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
