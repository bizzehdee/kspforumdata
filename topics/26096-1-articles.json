Plus there\u0027s a bit of debris here and there from succesfull stress-tests around 100-250k orbits and map targeting is annoying. So i refuel in 450k orbit although some may find that too high for a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reavermyst","CreatedById":65325,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T01:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esadly no, BUT you can use physical time warp by pressing ALT\u002B(.)

All other vehicles other than the current one are operating on a more limited physics model that doesn\u0027t try to calculate all those things that tend to go wrong in the calculations when time is sped up. So to speed up the time on your low-altitude craft, go switch to another vehicle that isn\u0027t low altitude, and time warp from there, then switch back to your low-altitude craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things that do not get calculated on secondary vehicles other than the current vehicle include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rotational velocity (the vehicles stay frozen in their current orientation and all rotational velocity is forgotten and zeroed out, which also has the side effect of stopping wobbling, if you\u0027re looking for a cheaty way to do that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Atmospheric drag (This is why debris can orbit Kerbin on low orbits like 30Km without degrading and falling in. That\u0027s a bit annoying because it means to de-orbit debris you have to get it to hit the surface, not just hit atmosphere.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Component stresses and impacts (i.e. the ships won\u0027t break apart from wobble, or collide with other craft - they just pass through each other).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause all these things are turned off when calculating the vehicle as a \u0022secondary\u0022 object and not the primary one, the reasons for disallowing fast time warp at low altitude are gone when the ship isn\u0027t the primary one you\u0027re looking at right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
