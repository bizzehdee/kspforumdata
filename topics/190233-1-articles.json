I have a few mods installed such as the Near Future mods, Mechjeb of course, and others. The game and every mod is up to date with the current version as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027ve gathered, these problems have only occurred around the Mun. There are a vast array of issues. Mechjeb tends to go go haywire from time to time. When I have something landed on the Mun\u0027s surface and another spacecraft gets too close to the Mun, the focus switches between the two and the craft on the surface ends of exploding. Another time I landed Val on the Mun and when she went to go EVA, the focus\u00A0kept switching back to the lander and wouldn\u0027t even let me control Val. I had to completely exit the game without saving, reload the game, and head back to Kerbin without being able to walk on the Mun. Another time I had a lander on the Mun and a probe in orbit, and when I went to land another lander, both landers exploded and the probe fell straight out of orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve blamed these problems on Physics Range Extender as everytime one of these problems happen, the mod gives a message saying something like \u0022lifting vehicles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this the case and is this mod to blame? If so, would simply uninstalling the mod fix this problem? Is this mod essential?

The devs have been doing work to have the game \u0022lift\u0022 vehicles properly in recent versions, and it sounds like the mod is fighting what the game is doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the mod is not essential in any sense. The physics ranges are a text field at the bottom of your physics.cfg file, and it is trivial to extend them by hand if you want them extended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Raging Sandwich","CreatedById":164377,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-08T13:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-08T20:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion moved to modded support, since that seems to be the issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
