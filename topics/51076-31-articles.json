Follow the directions in the readme.txt (you have to download the windows version to get the three .dll files, they do not exist in the mac version), and just make sure you CD to the KMPServer.exe directory before you try to run it. For whatever reason it has to be your currently active directory, you can\u0027t just drag and drop the .exe file after you type \u0022mono.\u0022 All the server options work and if your ports are forwarded correctly then you should be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am however having a problem with the client side on my mac - I can\u0027t stay connected to any servers for more than a split second!
