We can only afford $10,000 total mission budget (which includes initial vehicle cost as well as the cost of the batteries themselves).\n\n Objective: Deliver as many z-400 batteries as you can to LKO (72 km) for $10,000 or less.\n\n Mission criteria:\n\n-Stock parts only\n\n-Scoring will be the total number of batteries delivered to an orbit of 72x72 km.

I believe points then are 100,000 / 965.5 = 103.57 Points.\n\nIf 99% recovery = on the launchpad then the cost is 2,027$ because the 1st stage was still 66.3% recovered. Points then probably are 100,000 / 2,027 = 49.47 Points.\n\n[Click for video of the launch.](https://youtu.be/0pVllYXsamI)\n\nThere was plenty of dV left on the stage and the positioning was off by about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, this probably cancels out any bonus. I realize I didn\u0027t fast forward 6 hours, but I hope that the difference in timing between peri and apoapsis prove that the satellite is stable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T18:17:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SanderB**"},{"CreatedByName":"ikehaiku","CreatedById":74589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:56:33Z","Content":"Just out of curiosity, when is the challenge deadline?"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:40:41Z","Content":"SanderB,\n\n Golf clap and kudos on the expert piloting without any aids!! Well done.\n\n Now for the bad news: Recovery of reusable parts only counts if it\u0027s on KSC grounds.

The engine stat adjustments have left the selection of engines for this mission a bit \u0027thin on the ground\u0027.\n\nI kept trying and trying for a lighter solution. There may be one, but I didn\u0027t find it.\n\nI thought timing was the challenge, but it turned out that ascent profile was everything with this craft. The first stage has extermely high TWR and needs to be throttled back. The final stage has very low TWR and needs to have a very specific set of conditions when it lights up for the mission to be successful. My first try was a case of beginner\u0027s luck. My second try left me about 50 m/s short and then it took several tries to find the proper ascent profile.
