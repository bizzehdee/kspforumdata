The nature of your ascent vehicle coupled with the world you are ascending from\u00A0determines the appropriate flight plan, if any. There are a great many tutorials on this online already and you\u0027ll see\u00A0each tutor seems to focus on different strategies and demonstrations because the ascent vehicles are rarely the same.

In my experience, any rocketry that flies sideways or backwards in atmo meets a catastrophic end. (Yes, there are super-maneuverable missiles out there, but they usually detonate at some point too.) My advice it to focus on long, slow and deliberate maneuvers. Hotaru gave an excellent example above, but I stand by my previous statement: it\u0027s not going to work every time. The idea is to make many small adjustments over a longer period of time. Sometimes leading the prograde vector, other times gently trailing behind it. Each craft will demand at least a subtly different optimized flight plan based on individual characteristics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNever give up!
