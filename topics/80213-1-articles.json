You will be giving yourself every opportunity to disassemble your landing gear at those kind of speeds. It\u0027s best to throttle down or cut entirely your engines and flare before landing.

Also (as noted above), we really need to know if you\u0027re using FAR/NEAR/Stock aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnto the original problem: You say you\u0027re \u0022spinning\u0022. Is that spinning around like a top (yaw) or is it spinning around the long axis of the plane (roll). I\u0027m going to assume it\u0027s not a problem with \u0022pitch\u0022 because you would probably describe that as a \u0022flip\u0022 not a \u0022spin\u0022, but I could be wrong. Also, 180 m/s sounds like a pretty high stall speed (but I play with FAR, it may be different is stock). All of these have different solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem is yawing, aka a \u0022flat spin\u0022, then I think the solution is probably \u0022moar rudder\u0022. Larger rudders, multiple rudders, and moving the rudder as far behind the CoM as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem is rolling, the issue is probably stability. High wings and dihedral wings can help with that problem by allowing your CoM to rest \u003Cem\u003Ebelow\u003C/em\u003E your CoL. These are addressed in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaircraft tutorial\u003C/a\u003E, which was also linked by Taki117 above. It\u0027s awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor either, you can try adding SAS to improve control. It\u0027s... really a band-aid, and if one advance SAS unit isn\u0027t enough, more probably won\u0027t help (it\u0027s either a fundamental design issue or bad piloting). But it\u0027s still something you can try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that may help is limiting the control surface inputs. Set your rudder to only respond to yaw, ailerons to only respond to roll, and elevators/canards to only respond to pitch. This is just tends to be good advice, regardless of the situation, but in your case, you may be getting some unwanted control surface action which is causing your spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Thinking about how you\u0027re describing the problem, I gotta wonder if you\u0027re using a \u0022low-wing\u0022 design, like the space shuttle.

I think the goals were similar: Lots of lift, low mass, and a wide aft section for easy engine placement. Overall, I found they had horrid pitch authority because control surfaces simply couldn\u0027t be distant from the CoM. WHile they look cool, the benefits of the design don\u0027t outweigh the problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched the video, but the video is so fast I can\u0027t tell what happened just prior to the flip, or even in which axis/es rotation occurred. Given it\u0027s shape, I assume it was a pitch-tumble, but the player is obviously familiar enough with the craft to recover from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
