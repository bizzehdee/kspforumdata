Which not only proves the complexity of such a task, but also how fragile such a closed loop environment would be. It\u0027s all so easy to claim that we have it all figured out in theory, but when it comes to engineering the actual systems, there are always things that you forgot to model or that weren\u0027t accounted for.\u00A0Of course, the slightest imbalance can cause your a huge catastrophe, like runaway CO2 levels or losing your crops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep. Also that the way to mitigate such complications is to go for an entirely controlled construction technique. Ie: like ISS, etc. That means that the \u0022colonists\u0022 need to bring everything with them. Making a habitat out of martian concrete, or 3d printing with martian soils, etc, ad nauseum, is not impossible, but would need long-term testing while the people involved were actually safe in a plastic hab they bring with them from Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said it someplace, but Mars is only a \u0022destination\u0022 to the extent that humans construct/bring-along a destination with them. Such an environment could just as well be placed on the Moon, or simply in orbit. About the only thing that you get \u0022for free\u0022 on the Moon or Mars is the use of regolith for radiation shielding---assuming you design the habs you bring with you to support a couple meters of dirt on top of them. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T18:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimpler is better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the OP mentioned, colonization of virgin land has almost invariably been associated with the exploitation of a very small number of very valuable resources.

In the end, all exploration is driven by humans. We just use the proper tools for the job. Some jobs allow boots on the ground, but human exploration with tools such as telescopes, sensors\u00A0and robots is just as valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, Martian rocks aren\u0027t going anywhere, so the latency\u00A0is no big deal.\u00A0Actually, since a robot moves rather slowly over the terrain with a whole array of sensors\u00A0followed by a whole team of geologists, there are actually less chances that it will miss something than if you have a single human geologist with a single set of eyes, who also has to handle the task of navigating, watching his O2 supply, and not falling over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, there is no reason that by the time we get the technology required to build an outpost on Mars, we won\u0027t also have the technology for better AI and VR to both make the robot\u00A0autonomous and to provide a shared\u00A0experience close to actually being there. Surgeons in hospitals already use teleoperation for remote surgical operations. There is a slight latency, but it can be handled by the system and by the surgeon. In the future, a robot could record and extrapolate a 3D map of its environment that an operator could explore in VR and decide what is worth taking a closer look at. We use robots on Earth\u00A0as tools for exploring extreme environments all the time, because it makes sense to preserve human life rather than to go to the expense of putting it in danger. You can argue that a manned lab would be more versatile, but there is really nothing preventing you from designing a teleoperated lab with the exact same versatility as a manned one. You could have something like a teleoperated Robonaut running the lab and fixing the fleet of rovers and sweeping solar panels, without all the pesky life support and the heavy launcher to bring everything back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Earth, we use robots as tools to work in extreme environments. I\u0027m aware that it\u0027s not as inspiring or romantic, but sending robots to Mars is just using the proper tool for the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, an outpost and two rovers, like the Ares missions in The Martian.\u00A0100 tons on the ground. I get it. It is still limited to a small area and a short period. The rover will always have a limited safety range and the humans will always have a limited supply.\u00A0If one of your rovers becomes inoperable, that range means walking distance. And you can\u0027t grow potatos in Martian regolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost of such an expedition would still be orders of magnitude higher than a\u00A0fleet of telepresence robots that could cover the entire surface for well over 2 years. There is simply no science that can be done with a human that couldn\u0027t also be done by a properly designed teleoperated\u00A0system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA manned mission has better public stigma, and is more likely to be funded.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0And flagship robotic missions are not as good as you make them out to be. You might be able to make a hopper covering the entire Marian surface for less than a manned mission, (as risky as that would be)\u00A0but robotic rovers are VERY slow. They can go faster, but that means a larger, more expensive rover. And even then you would need numerous missions to cover all of Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with teleoperation is that Mars has a time delay of at least thirteen minutes, and spacecraft have a limited lifetime too. Oppurtunity is likely the exception of Mars rover endurance, not the norm. Latency is a big deal when every major command takes thirteen minutes to get to the craft, then another thirteen coming back. You can bypass this by teleoperating from a Mars Moon, but at that point, it\u0027s probably not worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
