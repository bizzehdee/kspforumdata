They do this because their event horizons disturb Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations, pairs of particles that flash into existence and then annihilate each other. This means that very small singularities will only last a few fractions of a second, due to the large surface area of their event horizons when compared to their mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, conventional theories assume that black holes evaporate until there is nothing left, but I have to wonder if it might leave some remnant. Is it possible that a singularity could reach so low a mass that its event horizon is no longer large enough to interact with the vacuum fluctuations? (I want to say something like \u0022a radius below the Planck Length\u0022, but I honestly don\u0027t know enough about that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a singularity would be unable to interact with normal matter, would (probably) be neutrally charged, but would still have some small amount of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now this is starting to sound like it would fit the definition of Dark Matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, all the black holes that have ever existed wouldn\u0027t be enough to produce enough of these singularity remnants to account for the mass of Dark Matter in the universe? Is it possible that they could have been created by the high energies of the first few moments of the Big Bang though? If these singularities are possible, it would be hard to say how many of then might be floating around\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it would be pretty easy to shoot down this idea with some research and a bit of math. It might be that a tiny singularity would not actually have the properties I\u0027ve described. Also, it may be that a singularity simply cannot have an event horizon that small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I\u0027ll do the math to determine what size event horizon would be produced by a singularity with the mass of the lightest elementary particle...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-16T19:33:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2014 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jfull\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T19:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve read (Phil Plait) there\u0027s no matter in there anymore to leave a remnant, it\u0027s just a point, and once it boils off thanks to Hawking radiation there\u0027s nothing left behind :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T19:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve read (Phil Plait) there\u0027s no matter in there anymore to leave a remnant, it\u0027s just a point, and once it boils off thanks to Hawking radiation there\u0027s nothing left behind :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but what if there\u0027s a point where it can no longer evaporate due to its size?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T19:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, also you\u0027d expect the rate of evaporation to go down as the surface area is reduced, but this seems not the case, if anyone can correct me on this please do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T19:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf my memory serves me right, the evaporation is due to the quantum tunneling effect.

Of course, we expect that to be in need of correction once you hit the Planck scale, but that\u0027s also the scale where we suspect the final evaporation to take place on... so no, this is very unlikely. It could be that Hawking radiation generation is heavily suppressed in the final stages and that they take longer to decay than simple extrapolation would make you assume, but completely inhibited?
