But for a much different and principled reason. At the cornerstone of personal liberty is the concept of self-determination. While it is foolhardy to insist the earth is flat, it is not for someone to reject the concept of human-caused global warming. We have concrete proof the earth is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot \u003C/strong\u003Eflat - satellite images from various vantage points and altitudes. However, we only have concrete proof the earth has been in a warming trend for the last 11,700 years ago, give or take. Human industry did not begin the cycle of global warming that ended the last ice age. So, to blame humankind for global warming does not make sense to me. NO, it is not my intent to start an argument, but to illustrate that I do have the right to not only demand more proof and facts, but to also have the right to reject \u0022theories\u0022 that I feel do not match the evidence I am seeing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt is healthy to have a skeptical attitude about anyone who claims to have the absolute \u0022correct\u0022 theory about anything. Humans are naturally skeptical and it has served the species well. This drive to create a consensus on every aspect of society, to include science, is simply a recreated folly of the Dark Ages when kings and priests controlled \u0022pure science\u0022 and \u0022pure religion\u0022 and no one had the ability to have any other opinion on the matter than what was prescribed. When I read things like PackledHostage said, it scares me that there are those who would prefer to create a consensus through \u0022reeducation\u0022 into what science is. Should the world regard Drs. Steven Hawking and Richard Dawkins as the absolute authorities on climate change and \u0022pure science\u0022 as they have deemed themselves experts? Absolutely not. For both men have taken science and bent it to a certain set of core ideologies that not only restrain the individual\u0027s right to self determination, but removes the individual\u0027s right of self-identity and thought.

It is not my job to tell anyone, including my students, what the facts \u0022means\u0022. It is my job to teach them how to interpret the facts and base opinions, regardless if they are different than mine, on those facts. It is the same with science. We call certain things \u0022theories\u0022 because we do not have the definitive answer in how they work, such as electricity (which is why we call it the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://library.automationdirect.com/basic-electrical-theory/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etheory of electricity\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 rather than fact).

However, the data should be there for those who have inquiring minds and do want a deeper understanding. But at the same time, I have no right do demand that someone comply with the notion of either completely understanding the theory of electricity or not using electricity at all. What I have learned is the best approach for learning is to simply present the information and allow each individual the opportunity to learn, interpret the data, and make their own conclusions rather than to force any sort of consensus.

I\u0027m 46 and have a six year old daughter in Kindergarten this year. Back when she was 5, we began working at home on her math, writing, and reading skills. In less than six months, my daughter was doing single digit addition and subtraction (without finger aids) as well as writing her name and the abcs. She also learned how to tell time, tie her shoes, and the days of the week and the names of the first five planets of our solar system. When she went to Kindergarten, her teacher and I had an argument about learning. I believe in a student led approach - if the student asks, then teach what is asked. Don\u0027t force... and the teacher was all about \u0022forced learning.\u0022 My daughter has the highest grades in her class and on the recent achievement tests, scored low second grader scores for several categories -- and she is not even in first grade!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also are in the age of misconceptions. At an open house, my daughtere\u0027s teacher asked each parent where they worked. When I told her the university I worked at, she asked me if I worked as a groundskeeper or support staff... I then handed her a business card and introduced myself as Dr.... and you should have seen the woman\u0027s face change - as well as her attitude. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E The reason I brought that up is to illustrate that often we jump to the wrong conclusions because we only have a small sliver of data, even if we do not know the rest, we jump to trying to make the data fit into boxes of \u0022ideas\u0022 we already have. This is why the marriage between government and science is so dangerous - as is the relationship between the military and industry (the military-industrial complex, as stated by President Eisenhower). Some scientists (who have no integrity) will create experiments and theories that match the need for desired government policy to increase government support. Even at the extent of data manipulation and ignoring undesired results from experiments.
