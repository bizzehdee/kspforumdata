\u00A0On this one, I have the gear mounted low enough I can rotate to about 15 degrees without hitting the tail. \u00A0Interestingly, this plane actually flies just fine even after losing everything aft of the wings! \u00A0I had some CG/CL issues, which I corrected by adding Canards to the front. \u00A0You can\u0027t see the canards because I rotated them into the fuselage, hiding them. \u00A0But, they still work (thanks to KSP\u0027s take on aerodynamics), and have enough authority to control the pitch of the plane even after I lose the entire tail during takeoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h1qvtBDh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.50\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/h1qvtBDh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-14T19:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s some shots of a MK3 version I built. \u00A0This was built earlier than the one shown in the original post. \u00A0I didn\u0027t like the look of this fuselage, although it worked fine. \u00A0I also had to do the canard trick to balance out CG/CL issues, and then hid them inside the nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the trick of hiding the canards inside the nose, if you look close you can still see a little evidence of the canards poking outside the fuselage. \u00A0I do this on purpose, because if I hide them all the way, I tend to forget they are there, which causes problems when I\u0027m troubleshooting. \u00A0You can hide them all the way inside the fuselage, and they still work just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of these are tricky to land. \u00A0They are not very maneuverable. \u00A0Also, I originally used the really small Jet engines, the Juno, because they looked a little more appropriate. \u00A0However, the thrust from the Junos was not enough to make any difference, so I went with the next size up. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of advantages to using the MK3 form, or I guess disadvantages to using the round form-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the MK3 cockpit hold 4 Kerbals, and more important has a useable cockpit view. \u00A0The round cockpit (MK1-3) only holds 3 Kerbals, and the view from that cockpit isn\u0027t really useable for flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the MK3 cargo bay looks a little more realistic as a bomb bay. \u00A0The round fuselage really doesn\u0027t have anything as cool. \u00A0I used the SM-25 Service Module on the round plane in the original post, but it doesn\u0027t look the same. \u00A0Also, sometimes when I blow the Service Module\u0027s panels to open it up, my wings blow off too, so that\u0027s a potential problem. \u00A0Never had much interest in dropping things just to make explosions anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, with the new seismic experiments, there\u0027s a legitimate reason for dropping stuff and making explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JhEQPiUh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.50\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JhEQPiUh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223ucRTUnh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.50\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3ucRTUnh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-14T20:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what happens if you rotate too far during takeoff. \u00A0I\u0027m not saying it flies great this way (it doesn\u0027t), but it does indeed fly. \u00A0Landing is going to be painful, because the main landing gear is gone too. \u00A0Anyway, it flies, and actually looks like it\u0027s going to get a little more speed after getting rid of the back of the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ljxsa7vh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.50\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ljxsa7vh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
