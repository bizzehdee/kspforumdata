You can actually go over a big swath of deep pink (or whatever color you use) with the narrow scanner and find that in fact the concentration there is garbage. This is because (as an example) there are 2 good areas just north and south of the area that looks good on the map, so the global scan combined them into a blob. Likewise, those two good areas may appear lesser on the big map because they are bordered by low concentration areas, making the average concentration poor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, without a stock way to drop waypoints based on what you find, the scanner itself has limited utility.

mountains and poles but you need flat terrain in proximity to the equator. \u00A0This means you\u0027ll be building your base on the best mediocre biome that meets these requirements. \u00A0\u0022Mediocre\u0022 means 5-6% Ore on average, but the local variation with elevation can produce hotspots up to like 8% and coldspots down to like 3%. \u00A0That\u0027s a 50% swing possible in either direction, which makes a HUGE different in mining speed in these mediocre biomes, so it\u0027s definitely worth your while to avoid the coldspots and find the hotspots. \u00A0Which means

possible (although time-consuming) to determine local variation with just the Surface Scanner by driving up and down hills with its right-click menu open, to determine how the Ore varies with terrain elevation. \u00A0Once I know that, I can eyeball the local terrain to spot the nearby hills and valleys and drive to them to verify my guesses and find the best locally available Ore. \u00A0I can also use the ALT=F12 biome overlay to show me the biome boundaries if I need to move to a different one. \u00A0Having the NBS takes the eyeball estimation out of it and also shows me biome boundaries

mapping the planet instead of instantly). \u00A0However, the resolution is not so high that I can immediately build a mine based on the SCANSat map, so I still need to land rovers with both Surface

average Ore values for the biome, not the actual value at any particular location. \u00A0This can be important due to the local variation of Ore within a biome. \u00A0If you site your mine based solely on NBS, you might well end up with less Ore than you expected to find there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, at most planets/moons, the best Ore is usually in the mountains and poles but you need flat terrain in proximity to the equator. \u00A0This means you\u0027ll be building your base on the best mediocre biome that meets these requirements. \u00A0\u0022Mediocre\u0022 means 5-6% Ore on average, but the local variation with elevation can produce hotspots up to like 8% and coldspots down to like 3%. \u00A0That\u0027s a 50% swing possible in either direction, which makes a HUGE different in mining speed in these mediocre biomes, so it\u0027s definitely worth your while to avoid the coldspots and find the hotspots. \u00A0Which means it\u0027s quite risky to site your base judging only from an NBS overflight without first doing a Surface Scan there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I ALWAYS use the Surface Scanner and never use the NBS from orbit. \u00A0I put both on the same vehicle ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely agree.
