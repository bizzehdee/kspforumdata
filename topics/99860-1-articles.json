Payload is anything you\u0027re hauling up that doesn\u0027t help the plane fly itself up into space (like say you want to go interstellar with your craft so you give it a pair of nukes and dedicated fuel supplies; that would count as payload). For the Bat, that would be the 18 tonne lander it hauls up there. So I multiply that mass times 4 and get the estimated mass of my plane - 72 tonnes. I then pick an engine array that is capable of supporting that much mass. For 72 tonnes, that would either be 6 RAPIER engines (72/13 = 5.538) or 5 Turbojet/24-77 clusters (72/15 = 4.8). I went with Turbojets on the Bat because it\u0027s a career-built plane and I only have access to the Level 2 R\u0026amp;D, so RAPIERs are still locked. Plus truthfully I think I like the Turbojet/24-77 combos better, especially since I started using Intake Build Aid (that mod saves some serious headaches). With my engine setup selected, I assume the plane will have the maximum mass the engine units can support, and use that to determine how much fuel I\u0027ll need. For example, I have 5 turbojets, so I\u0027ll assume the plane will be 75 tonnes at takeoff. That means I need 75x40 = 3000 units of Liquid Fuel and 75x25 = 1875 units of Oxidizer (I think you can actually get away with a mere 10-15 units of oxidizer per takeoff mass with a Turbojet setup but I need to do more experimentation with that figure; your oxidizer needs will depend a lot on the speed at which you switch over to rocket mode, and the 25 per tonne figure originates from use of RAPIERs with a switchover Surface speed of roughly 1750 m/s). I then go about selecting a combination of fuel tanks that will give me at least that calculated amount. From there it\u0027s a matter of adding the wings, gear, ASAS (for 75 tonnes, you want 112.5 kN of SAS, so 4 Large ASAS Wheels, 8 Stabilizers or 24 Wheels or a combination thereof), command core, and power generation. I set things up so the plane\u0027s CoM doesn\u0027t shift, the CoT is aligned with the CoM and the CoL is slightly aft but aligned with the CoM. I do use canards; the soup likes canards. Last things I do before launch are to unlock the steering and disable the brakes on the nose gear and to make sure I\u0027ve got any fuel lines I\u0027m using correctly configured. I set up my action groups generally as 1 = toggle jets, 2 = toggle rockets, 3 = toggle intakes, though nothing says you can\u0027t set the jets and intakes onto the same action group. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding an engine unit cluster is simple - you start with the Nacelle on your craft\u0027s centerline, put the Turbojet on the back, then turn on radial symmetry, add 2-4 24-77s (this one I\u0027m fuzzy about; I think you could get away with 2 but I use 4 in case I botch the ascent; by the time of switchover a Turbojet is usually outputting about 60 kN anyway, so 3 is a good balance there), and then remove the Nacelle. Go back to mirror symmetry, put the nacelle along side your fuselage, add a tricoupler, and add a Ram Intake to each. When you need to copy it, hit ALT and click the Nacelle. Works well enough for initial placement purposes anyway; when time comes to re-order your intakes/jets, you can just pick them off one by one and then reset them as needed (to minimize the issue of assymetric thrust when the jets start flame out). Or you could just install Intake Build Aid and hit the magic button prior to takeoff, which will do the same thing for you automatically. Seriously useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, those are the formulas I follow and the process I use when I go about designing a plane.
