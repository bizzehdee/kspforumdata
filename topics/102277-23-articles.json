I don\u0027t see a simple way to find out which vessel belongs to which id...\n\u003E \n\nI cross referenced the vessel ID in PR with the ID for the craft in the save file. What I think happened was somehow while trying to document a bug with another mod, the act of repeatedly quicksaving and reverting led to something going wrong with the plugindata (the incremental plugindata configs were all gone apart from two new ones that had been created after the error occurred). I pulled the plugindata files from a backup I had and this fixed the majority of them but obviously not any vessels launched after the backup date. I tried copying the vessel momentum/direction information from a probe that was spinning correctly into the ones that weren\u0027t and had 0,0,0 values but it didn\u0027t help.\n\nNone of these vessels have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled or any form of attitude correction. They\u0027re spin stablised during launch and just carry on spinning.\n\nIt\u0027s not a massive issue if they can\u0027t be manually spun up by editing the configs. It\u0027s mainly a visual thing but I\u0027ve just gotten used to seeing them spinning away forever so it feels wrong now they\u0027re not.\n\nThanks for making the mod btw, it\u0027s one of those mods that you had no idea was missing until you had it and then can\u0027t live without. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-08T17:47:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2017 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Damien212**"},{"CreatedByName":"CalvinWinz","CreatedById":183343,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-10T23:30:18Z","Content":"I want to clear this up, is this compatible with 1.3.1?
