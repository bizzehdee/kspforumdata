Really all im doing is changing directories ect, part names, and removing many options from the alt-b menu (so noone can enable teh cheaty stuff). This is NOT ALOT OF WORK, so i by no means making a mod from the ground up. Part/directory changes are done so that someone cant just use the normal BDA mod and rename the .dll, to prevent people from cheating (although that atm should be minor since there are few mp players anyways as of now). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for parts im releasing (once i make models workable), those will be released in my mod, and in a version compatible with this one, so anyone whether MP or SP can use em. Im also gonna need to extensively test the parts and all to make sure they are as balanced as i can get them to be, and probvably the biggest change here is removal of ability to use aim assist (this is for autoaim balance since autoaim is OP with target leading especially in space as one can just enable target autoaim and wipe out anyone who gets near with 0 effort). The other change im planning is a generic lowered damage across teh board. While not all may agree with me, i feel the current amount of damage is way to high for a fun MP battle. Thing just die way to quickly, and a smaller plane is pretty much a 1 shot instant cripple with the 20mm or 30mm. I have plenty of options here, but i feel making the 30mm do a hair more damage then the 12.7mm would make battles more interesting in general. This is especially true for space combat, as those at least how i envision it would involve ships slugging it out, with individual shells doing minor is any damage. Only explosive weapons are going to stay as is, so that there is an actual reason to use any gun aside form the 30mm turret (which has no drawbacks aside from mass and size, although teh 2nd one is only limiting small things, doesnt matter on larger craft at all). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the sync issue, i will have to test that out myself, hopefully at least the cannons will sync properly. Even client side damage calcs would work fine, as long as my client tells the server that x part was destroyed. Ideally all players would sync everything, but i would be happy to live with client side hit detection FOR NOW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i plan to make the tracers red/blue, based on team selection. i may make them tweakeable per gun, but i feel red/blue would make the tracers much neater both visually and as a nice visual IFF indicator. If i manage to implement this, and you would be interested, feel free to ask me for the code, ill give it to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESkillful is a completely different damage system and wile I was once a fan I have become more accustomed to and now prefer BD armory.
