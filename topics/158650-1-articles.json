Lower tech tanks heavier for the same size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDitto engines, better Isp, better thrust, better gimbal, lower mass over time, possibly lower cost as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll stuff like this, then once on a specific path, it\u0027s cheaper to marginally upgrade an existing engine, than to start from scratch. That\u0027s why programs advance the way they tend to unless they get huge infusions of cash (and sometimes even then).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent propellants should be a thing, as well, but those are lines of research. Kerlox (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E), hydrolox, hypergolics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer is trivial, and really needs the player to be put in a position where they think, \u0022I really should have researched the right line of engines, this was a mistake!\u0022 (say you started with hydrolox, and have a bunch, but now wish you had a hypergolic stage to use at Jool because of boiloff).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplexity in what players have to do (design wise) is a GOOD THING.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailures would help, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
