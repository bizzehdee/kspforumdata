But I quickly discovered that taking off with the gear extended was better than having them retracted. The lift from the wing on the front of the rocket has a very strong tendency to pull it over so having the drag of the extended wheels pulling on the other side tended to balance that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T02:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI checked ladders and many other things for clues like that with no success.

That will let you connect the tank to whatever holds it to the shuttle even if the landing gear protrude into the tank.
