How to determine the impact point of a reentry vehicle on bodies with atmospheres, particularly when using a more traditional, shallow reentry profile, as opposed to a steeper, \u0022direct drop\u0022 profile. Are there any mods out there that take into account the planet\u0027s rotation, time to entry interface, the initial velocity at the interface point,\u00A0and the ballistic flight characteristics of the entry vehicle to plot an approximate impact point, or does anybody have quick, easy way to plot it manually?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T14:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod gives predictions (look for the red X on the map), but it\u0027s not been hugely accurate for me in 1.0.5.

Experience playing the game has given me a general idea of where to begin re-entry if I want to land at a certain area, but a lot of that also has to do with the craft. If you have a basic capsule and/or something that\u0027s designed for ballistic re-entry, then you pretty much have one chance to hit the mark. If you\u0027re long, revert to a quicksave and re-enter sooner. If you\u0027re short, revert and wait a little longer. If your craft has lifting bodies or wings or some manner of propulsion, you can control your re-entry a lot more and make up for any deviations. The fun for me is figuring all that out for myself via trial and error, not using a mod to do it for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T16:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the old souposphere MJ could drop a ship almost on the mark. You often had to compensate for this when sending a rescue mission, less a second rescue\u00A0mission be needed. In 1.0.5 with MJ a close landing at KSC might be in the ocean to the east or in the rough grass on the KSC side of the western mountains. Yes, that\u0027s close enough for career (so I\u0027ve been told as I personally never play career), however you better send a rover if you need to be exact.
