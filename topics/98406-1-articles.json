I got the HullcamVDS for the cameras and I got BHDarmory for the 500km load distance. I just need somehow to track the target rocket as it ascends. I want to watch my launches from the ground. Ive been able to do it in the past with the LazorCam, but that is so out of date im scared to even try it fearing it may corrupt something. Now my other obstacle is im still on v.25. So whatever the solution is it has to work on the older version of KSP. ( BHDArmory is also still .25, so.. ) Any suggestions? The only thing I\u0027ve tried sop far is a sphere. A scaled up Sputnik probe with a lot of reaction wheels and the camera mounted on the bottom. Turn the probe upside down and the reaction wheels can act as my tracking. But its not good enough. No matter how much SAS I put on it the camera cannot fight gravity as the target lets lower in the sky. So I need some sort of tracking motor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-31T22:13:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T23:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know of any mods but BDarmroy\u0027s load distance is only 5km not 500km it wouldn\u0027t be fun with all your stations flying within load range when you launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T02:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally yes. But you can change it in the config from 5000 ( im guessing meters ) to 500,000. And yes you have to make sure LKO is clear of both debris and other craft. I actually just launched a Mun probe and was able to return the first stage to the pad while the second went to orbit on its own. It works really well depending on what you want to do. Switching to and from craft from those distances is explosive. So what I\u0027ve been trying to do is have the first stage land itself with mechjeb\u0027s landing guidance, but it goes haywire once you move focus off it. But the accent guidance WILL work on its own. So now what Id like to do is observe my launches from the ground and watch it go to orbit.

I had to work hard to get MJ to even get it close to being right. For some reason SmartASS didn\u0027t know which way was up despite me being able to manually move the camera perfectly in all axis. That craft there is the best I could do to get SmartASS to actually track the target. But its not good enough. For some reason it shakes around the target marker and doesn\u0027t stay still enough.
