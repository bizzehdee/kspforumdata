This is a little surprising because it\u0027s a very simple plugin and seems to break in 1.1.3 on any GameEvents Add() call, a call that I\u0027m sure most addons use. My guess is that it\u0027s due to some of the reorganization of assemblies that has gone into 1.2, but I really don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m not looking for specific debugging help. Not yet at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just curious if KSP mods are generally backward compatible. Seems unfortunate to have to drop support for a previous release so quickly, especially when I can imagine many people holding off on upgrading for various reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T21:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really given the amount of change in 1.2 and that the dll references and bunches of other things change. Trying to support multiple versions in the one dll is not really something you want to try and do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut you can still support it by having multiple versions of your mod available. EG: Spacedock, curse, etc maintain versions of your mod distribution.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you can just say version x supports 1.1.3 and version y supports 1.2 in your thread and your download page.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore there is no reason for you to drop support if you don\u0027t want to. You just have multiple versions of your mod available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T22:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone. I account for backwards compatibility none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically that\u0027s not true. I upload to Spacedock and they allow people to download old versions, so I guess technically I do that.
