What I would like to see is another building (idk what to call it, possible a university, museum, or tourist office) where all the parts are shown with all of their stats, the short blurb about them that already exists, a picture of the part, and a \u0022manufacturers notes\u0022 section that gives the player an idea of how, when, and where to use this part. The parts list would be able to go from showing only parts currently unlocked (as to not overwhelm the new player) to the entire parts list (to show what can be unlocked). This new building would also include a description, summary and directions on, each building (what it does, what the player can do in that building).There would be a section that shows what each key does, and access to the tutorials. At the start of a new game, whether it be sandbox, science, or career mode, the player would be encouraged to check out this building first, perhaps by Gene Kerman saying \u0022hey you should check out the Kerbal University\u0022 and maybe with an arrow pointing to it. One could, of course opt out of this, by clicking an X or another building or something. I believe this would be a great way to ease new player into the game, especially sandbox mode which can be incredibly overwhelming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T11:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think OP is asking for an online web browers, just a wiki that\u0027s stored with the game.
