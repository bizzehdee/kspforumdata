It has 4 sidewinders but they almost never even got close to the MiG. Most of the fight was fought with the twin M230s.\n\n[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0autr4guyoxbnbn/Hunter%20BD.craft?dl=0)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nE1bm/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe first fight was so evenly matched that the MiG ran out of fuel and landed before either plane could damage the other.\n\nThe next few fights seemed to show the hunter having a slight advantage, although I\u0027m not sure why since it has a lower TWR and comparable wing loading to the MiG, and lacks thrust vectoring. The most common result was that it managed to shoot the MiG\u0027s engine, forcing it to land."}]}
