Specifically, burning to zero heliocentric velocity in this sense means you have \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E orbital period. Since Lagrange points are, in effect, locations where the rotating reference frame of a spacecraft or satellite will orbit with the same period as the much larger co-orbiting bodies (e.g. Earth-Sun), you have found a unique way of simulating this with KSP physics. Well done! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, L4 and L5 will only be stable (in a real system) if the mass ratio of the co-orbiting bodies is sufficiently large. Thankfully for us, Kerbin-Mun L4/5 and Kerbol-Kerbin L4/5 satisfy this requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe responses so far have covered the important points, but I thought it would be useful to provide the reference SOI data:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin - SOI: 84275 km (140 body radii)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun - SOI: 2430 km (12 body radii)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
