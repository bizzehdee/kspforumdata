A way of dealing with that is using power caps. Though current implementations do not prevent any and all damage, it does offer a fair degree of protection, whereas others have none. And yes, I have seen a number of people deal with the consequences of these so called POR-issues.

This would allow you to keep your RAM, so you would only need a CPU/mainboard. While a bit older than Skylake Haswell is still very good and only slower by a few %, also cheaper than Skylake by quite a bit (at least in Germany). It doesnt come with the newest stuff like DDR4, but that shouldnt matter that much when you are looking for gaming performance. You could go with a cheaper i5 and a B85 mainboard or with the i5 4690k and a Z97 mainboard to overclock. Anyway, you wont have to upgrade again for a long time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. An AMD FX 6300 or 6350. While ok for most games its not very good in KSP, since AMD processors have poor single thread performance. If you can afford an i5 i would choose that, but maybe thats not possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. The Intel Pentium G3258. Its only a dualcore, but can be overclocked, which results in extreme single thread performance for its price. Not that good in other games, but perfect for current KSP (no idea how that will change with Unity 5).\n"}]}
