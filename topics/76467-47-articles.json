Did I miss a required mod or something? If I already have the tanks, how do I pressurize them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When you have an engine that still has a TEATEB left to ignite it, if you go to 10x time warp and then come back out of time warp to 1x, it seams to waste the igniter. Is this a bug that hasn\u0027t been tracked down yet?
