Given that you could be out of control in a flat spin heading towards a crash landing you really do not need an extra symbol on there. This is what lead to the ghosted view of the pre-existing symbol, also saved me having to add an extra game asset to be loaded in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suspect that I can make my existing code overwrite the new symbol with the ENB version, or simply disable the stock version and drop in ENB\u0027s version at a config option, but will have to wait till release is available to do the modifications, whatever happens it is likely going to be the longest delay for me to get a new version out, up until now I have not had to interact with new code, I fully expect 0.25 to be incompatible with the current mod release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the link to the vid of this AndreyATGB \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iFlyAllTheTime","CreatedById":111190,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T20:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell there\u0027s your first and likely only problem.
