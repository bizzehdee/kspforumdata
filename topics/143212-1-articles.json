Hence, the energy and size of the explosion is always auto-limited to that first tiny initial bit, and the rest of the matter is dispersed, regardless of the size/amount of the

\u003Cem\u003Edesigned \u003C/em\u003Etoo, but really it\u0027s pretty common to want to make your software compatible with the oldest system you can to improve sales, I usually make sure my software can handle at least 10 year old computers.\u00A0 Best though is be able to run on older systems and take advantage of newer ones (so for example when writing a complex programmers calculator I can check if there are processor features to enhance certain functions and use them, the check is quick then just set a flag after that it still works on older systems but is faster on newer ones but only adds a very few processor cycles over all).\u00A0 As far as the calculations involved in tracking each individual part with a unique explosion for it I don\u0027t really have any idea how much more processing it would take (not much probably for 20 part ships, but 200 part ships, it might slow down even a modern i7 system would be my guess).\u00A0 Also keep in mind that they started work on this roughly five years ago and if you read the developer notes you will see they are working on code clean up and improvements like using good old fashioned for\u00A0loops instead of the more modern stuff Microsoft added to C# (which looks nice but is less efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T15:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a huge obstacle.
