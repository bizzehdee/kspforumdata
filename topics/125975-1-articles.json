Check to make sure that your lander had power because without that you won\u0026#39;t be able to run your reaction wheels or use SAS.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Side note: I\u0026#39;ve gotten into the habit of locking the electric charge on pods and probe cores by default. This leaves them with some amount of reserve power in case I SNAFU on the dark side of a planet or something.)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T14:27:38Z","Content":"\nshort answer: no\u003Cbr\u003E\nlong answer: no, it\u0026#39;s not broken.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Choctofliatrio","CreatedById":153260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T14:34:13Z","Content":"\nI just landed a pilot on the Mun with it yesterday.
