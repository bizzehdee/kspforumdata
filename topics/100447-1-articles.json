All stock.\n\nSo this is what I came up with.\n\nA custom cockpit for 2 Kerbals, including an eject system for both, and access to the cockpit from inside the craft. The plane\u0027s design was inspired by my other [SSTO](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108186-For-the-Fairest-Prettiest-Spaceplane-Challenge?p=1742954\u0026viewfull=1#post1742954) - in particular the vertical turbo jet and tanks arrangement. Some tanks are a bit clipped, but I adjusted their fuel levels accordingly.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also, its far away from the CoM so I was busy keeping the bird on its tracks. Needs more SAS. Reentry went perfectly stable with an easy landing. The langing gears need to be a bit more apart from each other to make it more stable on the ground, but otherwise there was no reason to complain.\n\nThe ejection system needs some refining before it works reliably, but I wanted to show some pics already.
