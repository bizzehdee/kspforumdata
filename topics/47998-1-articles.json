Also i like SSTO\u0027s. So i decided to combine the 2! The only problem is that i am crap at replicating and at making SSTO\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i would be very grateful if some1 could make 1 for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease?

Stock aerodynamics tends to favour the delta wing planform and you also need a lot more wing area, thus making it difficult to achieve any other wing configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/79128516897112670/3E062C31696CF438FA8FD71CBBF40B36CF645306/\u0022 alt=\u00223E062C31696CF438FA8FD71CBBF40B36CF645306\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
