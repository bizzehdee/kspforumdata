Maybe the player needs high heat resistance, so they opt for thicker heat shielding (or a better material) that increases heat resistance, but also increases cost and weight. Maybe they can\u0027t increase the weight due to other limitations, so they use a more advanced material that has similar heat resistance, the same weight as the standard material, but is much more expensive (and maybe less resistant to radiation, physical impacts, or other factors). Sliding bars may be too complicated, but having a select few materials/options for parts could give the player more control over how they choose to design their vehicle. Maybe you can afford lightweight but still strong structural pieces for your interstellar craft, or maybe you can\u0027t and you need to opt for the cheaper, yet heavier version. This could be communicated to the player via a set of bars to show modified stats, with green on the positive sign and red on the negative sign (with descriptive words at each end; more weight =/= positive and that should be specified).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this feature could effectively be extended to parts such as engines, but for \u0022body parts\u0022 it is definitely something I\u0027m interested in.

You\u0027d be able to choose between things like Stainless Steel, Aluminum alloy, Al-Li alloy, Fiberglass composite (IDK why no rocket ever used that as a fuel tank material, it\u0027s stronger than aluminum mass-for-mass, but not quite as strong as carbon fiber), Carbon fiber composite, Titanium alloys, maybe even Nickel Super-Alloys (like Inconel) if you need to contain hot high pressure and potentially oxidizing gases in a tank rather than a rocket engine for some unknown reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction method is where you\u0027d choose between options like \u0022Sheet metal tank with internal ribs (the one you\u0027d start off with)\u0022, \u0022Isogrid (hex/triangle grid, strong and light)\u0022, \u0022Orthogrid\u0022 (same as isogrid, but with squares instead of hex/triangle), \u0022COPV\u0022 (for low temperature high pressure gases or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propellants, only shows up if you selected a composite base material), \u0022Bladder tank\u0022 (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propellants and monopropellants only (if there\u0027s a

we get modular (not procedural) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s), as well as \u0022Structural tube\u0022, which would be a heavier option that can\u0027t hold any resources but is hollow and has a higher impact tolerance (material permitting, it would have a higher heat tolerance as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInsulation type would be things like \u0022Foam (Pre-cast)\u0022 (starter cryogenic tank insulation, foam insulation panels cast to the correct shape before being applied to the tank in tiles and retained with fasteners), \u0022SOFI\u0022 (spray on foam insulation, higher tech, slightly lighter because it\u0027s just stuck on there rather than needing fasteners, and more insulating launch vehicle cryogenic tank insulation based on that used by Shuttle/SLS), \u0022Multi-Layer-Insulation\u0022 (the gold foil stuff you see on satellites, better than foam of any kind in vacuum, but useless if there\u0027s a significant atmosphere), and things of that nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface finish would have options like \u0022Bare\u0022 (lowest mass option, might have penalties for insulation or tank durability), \u0022Painted\u0022 (required if you want to put fancy designs on the side of the tank, and maybe useful to mitigate exposure to the elements), \u0022TUFROC\u0022 (ablative paint that increases the maximum skin temperature of the part, at least until it\u0027s all burned away), and maybe even \u0022TPS Tile\u0022 (basically shuttle heat shield tiles, with options for White (lower temperature) and Black (higher temperature) tiles, the tile option would be a non-ablative heat shield option usually used for spaceplanes if they have a base material incompatible with high internal temperatures (like most aluminum alloys).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurface Finish is how you\u0027d apply heat shielding to spaceplane parts without them having to create dedicated \u0022airplane only\u0022 parts for the game that would be ignored by most people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO this would greatly deepen the game by allowing the player to make many more design trade-offs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor instance, do you want to make your spaceplane with a Titanium internal skeleton so that you can save money on the heat shield system by only using TUFROC, or do you want to spend more money on the heat shield system by covering it in TPS Tile and saving weight by switching to an Aluminum Alloy internal structure (like the Shuttle did)?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you want to use Carbon Composite, Internally Braced, Common Bulkhead tanks with SOFI and Bare surface for the upper stage of your Hydrolox launch vehicle, or do you want to build a Centaur-like stage that uses Stainless Steel Balloon tanks with a Common Bulkhead and SOFI insulation with Bare surface\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are a lot of possibilities here, and that should mean that there are enough options to allow someone who knows what they\u0027re doing to pick the options that optimize the fuel tank to whatever task they have in mind for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for that \u0022A person that knows what they\u0027re doing\u0022 disclaimer, don\u0027t let that make you think the idea isn\u0027t bad, the game could easily have a little tool tip that pops up when you hover over any of the options in any of the categories that has a short text blurb that describes why this option is different from the other ones, as well as out-and-out saying what each option is best suited for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-14T23:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

This would be particularly great with custom decals. Want a spot of rust on a shiny chrome part?
