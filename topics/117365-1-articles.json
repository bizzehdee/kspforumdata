Eventually, I reached space and went to hiding on some forlorn little rocky moon and concealed my space truck in an abandoned mine. Suddenly I got the sense I had to run away, really fast and sent the truck spiralling down into vast caverns dodging various pieces of derelict machinery strewn about the cavern like the innards of some gargantuan beast. \n\nAt some point of time the space truck forgot the former part of its designation and started to drive on wheels, subjected to gravity and all. In a bout of fear, I sought to lose my pursuers by jumping across a deep chasm and land atop an assortment of [KIS cargo containers](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-2-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-1-5) on the other side.\n\nThis obviously did not work, the seemingly unbroken chain of SC-62 storage containers erupting into fissures like the San Andreas fault the moment the massive rig contacted its surface. But break the fall it did and as the rig, trailer, the whole shebang disintegrated in a pyrotechnic display of Michael Bay proportions, I came to amid a stack of brown shoe box sized parcels. Curiosity took the better of me as I opened one of them, and out oozed some sort of colorful slime - some silicate-based lifeform I presume, and I got the mental hint that they are the only surviving specimens of their species.\n\nAn exchange of emotional energy and mental imagery ensued, where I learned they are a race of sentient space sheep (!!!) seeking a new homeworld, to which I replied, as an image of Duna appeared: - \n\n***\u0022All these worlds are yours - except Kerbin. Attempt no landing there.\u0022***\n\nI was soon summoned to the land of the living - and sanity, by the incessant buzzing of my phone, where I started a conversation describing the above dream in enough detail that it\u0027s now permanently burned into working memory. I was also completely overwhelmed by emotions, sobbing like a desperate housewife and all because I saved an alien species ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI have no idea if I have ever tried to build a space trucking rig in my years of poking around KSP, but I shall do so soon ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T02:10:51Z","Content":"Wow that is quite the subconscious you have there.
