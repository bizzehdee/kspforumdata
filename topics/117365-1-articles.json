Eventually, I reached space and went to hiding on some forlorn little rocky moon and concealed my space truck in an abandoned mine. Suddenly I got the sense I had to run away, really fast and sent the truck spiralling down into vast caverns dodging various pieces of derelict machinery strewn about the cavern like the innards of some gargantuan beast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point of time the space truck forgot the former part of its designation and started to drive on wheels, subjected to gravity and all.

But break the fall it did and as the rig, trailer, the whole shebang disintegrated in a pyrotechnic display of Michael Bay proportions, I came to amid a stack of brown shoe box sized parcels. Curiosity took the better of me as I opened one of them, and out oozed some sort of colorful slime - some silicate-based lifeform I presume, and I got the mental hint that they are the only surviving specimens of their species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn exchange of emotional energy and mental imagery ensued, where I learned they are a race of sentient space sheep (!!!) seeking a new homeworld, to which I replied, as an image of Duna appeared: - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022All these worlds are yours - except Kerbin.
