It can be better to send a group of small, lightweight probes with only the small, lightweight experiments on them and drop those across several biomes, something that works particularly well for Minmus due to the low gravity and thus low delta-V requirements per lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry sending a scientist Kerbal on a free-return trip around the Mun and have them transmit all the data they can and collect the rest and store it in their pod to be returned later, this will maximise the science gained per mission. Free returns can take a bit of work to get right, but also cut down on the fuel you need to carry and so lighten the entire vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-25T13:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the first buildings I like to upgrade is the astronaut complex so that my Kerbals can go on EVA. Then on my first orbit, I will gather EVA reports over every biome. If I launch into an equatorial orbit, I can get seven. But if I use a polar orbit, I can get all 11.\u00A0 This is a good way to gather a lot of science early on. Follow that with a crewed Mun flyby or orbit with a pilot and scientist, and I can gather science in low and high space around the Mun and typically get EVA reports over a couple or more Mun biomes.
