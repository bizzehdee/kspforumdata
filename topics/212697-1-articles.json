Not gonna be great with high part counts, but it\u0027ll do basic gameplay well enough to tide you over until a future upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GTX 750 Ti is absolutely not okay. You will not enjoy your time playing with that, if it doesn\u0027t outright crash on startup. If you must upgrade anything, upgrade that. Aim for a video card with at least 6 GB video memory. That is technically still too little, but if it\u0027s all you can afford, you can make do by dropping the render resolution and not looking at the ground as much as possible. If you can, go for something with 8 GB VRAM. (Any video card with this amount of memory will also have sufficient raw performance, so don\u0027t worry about the exact model.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get a second 8 GB stick of system memory in there, that\u0027ll help too.
