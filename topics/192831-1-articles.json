Breaking Ground DLC and\u00A0improved Mk2 Landing Can were\u00A0reasons enough to revisit the game, so\u00A0I\u0027ve created a fresh career save with a bit grindy settings, got 2nd ship to orbit and everything was going OK...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the\u00A0surprises came. I\u0027m kinda sure it wasn\u0027t like that before, but not entirely.
