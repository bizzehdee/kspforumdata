Really simple stuff, very similar to auto-pilot system you would find in most general aviation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that still no mods currently present this actual implementation. ( and if there is any, please tell me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally there could be some more interface to alter trajectory, like set up a climb rate, roll rate, that stuff. And of course looking this to use with FAR aerodynamics, but can\u0027t why it shouldn\u0027t work with stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease share your thoughts on this. I\u0027ll try to implement this sort of auto-pilot with the existing scripting auto-pilot mods out there, but still don\u0027t know how to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, and sorry if text is a bit confusing, I\u0027m a bit light-headed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T19:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPilot Assistant\u003C/a\u003E might be close to what you are looking for.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T19:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPilot Assistant\u003C/a\u003E might be close to what you are looking for.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, pretty new stuff and exactly what I was thinking of, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
