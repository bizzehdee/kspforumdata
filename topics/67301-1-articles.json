I did an experiment in a previous thread (can\u0027t find it at the moment). It turns out that sometimes, even with perfect symmetry (4 engines in my case), some ships will rotate. Possibly due to some bug, but I don\u0027t know for sure what the problem is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a cylindrical rocket in the VAB and put 4x symmetric engines on it. Some engines, such as LVT-30s and 45s, caused rotation while other engines did not.
