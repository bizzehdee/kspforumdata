I\u0027m doing a career mode so I can\u0027t use other panels yet, and the cheapest ones don\u0027t seem to work at all even though the sun hits my panels from multiple angles. I right-click the panel and it says it\u0027s not generating anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a bunch of mods installed, mostly graphic/visual stuff. Anyone has any idea what might be going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T07:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm. Do you have Kopernicus installed? That usually causes problems like the one you described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T09:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on which version of the game you are running: some older versions of the game would install your OX-STATs just below the skin of your rocket. So you might try using the offset tool in the editor to move them out a little ways and see if that changes anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingDutchman_","CreatedById":184704,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T21:22:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried re-installing (with all my saves and files backed up) and the panels still didn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I tried getting rid of Kopernicus mod, and they seem to be working again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank both of you for helping me out!
