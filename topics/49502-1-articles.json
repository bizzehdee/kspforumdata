Check the action groups for the antenna. There is one for transmit there. I don\u0027t know about stopping it, but it auto resumes when it has enough power already. The only issue being that you might need some power to maneuver your space craft. If that is the case then just don\u0027t transmit until the maneuver is done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T20:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm, when I looked at one of the antennae the only available action group item was \u0022toggle\u0022. Clicking on the antenna itself provides a transmit button you can click on, but it doesn\u0027t appear in the VAB actions.
