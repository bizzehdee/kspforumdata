The problem with KSP is that parts don\u0027t flex, only joints. Not only do joints have to be overly flexible to compensate for the lack of flexing in the parts themselves, we also have a lot of them.

If a failure occurs it will happen near the weld or at some other location. So having joint flex occurring where a small and medium sized tank join should not be a thing in this game at all. I get why the devs made \u0022tanks\u0022 the way they did in KSP 1, but at this stage they should all be procedural, because as Kerbart stated, this is not how a vessel is constructed. Carbon steel, Stainless, Alloy sheets come in standard sizes with an upper and lower limit, and the number of weld seams are determined by the engineering needs of the project and the size of the sheets, not the size of the \u0022gas tank\u0022. I understand pressure vessel design and the design for rockets will use similar considerations, but not entirely since wind shear, drag, and many other considerations must be made. But a cylinder is a cylinder. Speaking of which, I agree with most here, noodley rockets are not realistic. If a real steel cylinder was subjected to the same flex seen in KSP 2 the compressed side would just crumple and subsequently the rocket would start to break apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as what would happen when a rocket is sideways in atmosphere I can\u0027t say because I have no experience there but clearly some have managed it, others have not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I have never had fun with a \u0022spinning rocket\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dvrabel","CreatedById":226165,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T17:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure the \u0022real rockets don\u0027t X.\u0022 argument really works in the context of KSP since considerable efforts goes into real rocket design to ensure they don\u0027t fail, whereas KSP allows you to cobble-together any old parts into something vaguely rocket-like.
