Apparently, and I\\\u0027ve tried this and it works, well enough for me to have done a direct descent from to the moon from Kerbin orbit, in a single burn out of Kerbal orbit until slowing for landing, is to time your TLI until the m\u00C3\u00BCn is just rising over the horizon while in an orbit of about 100,000 to 150,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could eyeball in the map when the m\u00C3\u00BCn will be opposite your craft fairly well, but the m\u00C3\u00BCn won\\\u0027t be there by the time you get there. Your hugely elliptical insertion orbit does not have nearly the same period as the m\u00C3\u00BCns circular one, so it won\\\u0027t be around when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, the horizon method means your ship will usually arrive in the prescribed location a bit before the moon will, but travelling far slower than the m\u00C3\u00BCn and close enough to enter the m\u00C3\u00BCns SOI and be pulled towards it, usually on either a collision course, or one that will swing just outside the far side of the m\u00C3\u00BCn and sling you back towards Kerbin. Either one can be made into a succesful orbit, if it\\\u0027s a collision course, I usually push the orbit a bit out until it turns into the \u0027sling to kerbin\u0027 orbit, wait for periapsis on the far side, and then burn retrograde to pull into a nice, low altitude orbit around M\u00C3\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThaineFurrows","CreatedById":15550,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-31T08:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m playing around with the awesome KSP Orbit Mechanic calculator and trying to work out how to apply it in the game.

In the absence of more precise in-game orbital tools, it\\\u0027s the best we can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick when using the calculator is to know what type of syzygy you\\\u0027re dealing with. Most users will be performing a low-to-high Hohmann transfer where the Mun is at opposition. My recommendation is to zoom out just far enough to be able to estimate when your spacecraft will move between Kerbin and the Mun such that all three are along a single line extending radially from Kerbin out to the Mun (and beyond). Different syzygy geometries will require a bit more understanding from the user, but are still very easy to estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI: this feature originally required the user to estimate angles like 83 deg. I received some great feedback from one of my beta testers that indicated syzygy events (e.g. conjunction or opposition) were much easier to estimate (precisely) without additional in-game tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy orbiting!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
