I recovered my ship and didn\u0027t see the boosters on the recovered parts list. So a few missions later, I notice the boosters are still sitting on the ground where they were.... any way to get them things back? was about to start putting landing struts on the things too lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matteeeo","CreatedById":89209,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T12:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use this mod, StageRecovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-25-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-1-%2810-7-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-0-25-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-1-%2810-7-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just have to add enough parachutes, than according to the landing speed of the debris and the distance from KSC you can recover a percentage of the funds, even if they are out of the physics range. You can even check in the VAB while building your spacecraft. It\u0027s very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T12:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022madhog6\u0022 data-cite=\u0022madhog6\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I notice the boosters are still sitting on the ground where they were.... any way to get them things back?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can recover landed parts and debris in the tracking station.
