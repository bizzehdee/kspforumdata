Sorry I should have done that first but it sounded too much like the broken ship thing. I had the almost same thing happen the other day. Not sure what triggered it. If the ship broke and then the first stage accelerated at like 6,000 G\u0027s or the ship broke because the first stage decided to accelerate at 6,000 G\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHasn\u0027t happened since though.
