Think about sending up a shuttle with something like the Hubble Space Telescope in the payload bay, and have that go on to discover star systems like Debdeb. Not just that, but also have the ability to service and upgrade it later down the line on orbit by conducting EVAs, like on STS-61 or STS-125. Obviously, that statement holds true for something like Hubble. If they player wants to do a mission like Kuiper or James Webb, that should also be an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can be a very cool way to conduct science experiments, and get points needed to upgrade the tech tree in KSP2. It can also give the player incentive to try a mission that they have not done before, and can be relatively easy-ish to pull off. I can imagine something like Hubble or the James Webb Space Telescope being instrumental for progression in a future patch when we get closer and closer to interstellar travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-17T22:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTelescopes were confirmed by Nate here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2202220984\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/198386-would-this-make-sense-hiding-systems-in-progression/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3888476\u0026amp;embedComment=3888476\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3888476\u0022 style=\u0022height:252px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s good news, though I don\u0027t think he specified \u0022space\u0022 telescopes, but I think their absence would be a sorely missed opportunity.
