Ignoring autostrut, which I\u0027m aware isn\u0027t in and fixes that problem, I do think that by default rockets should be far less wobbly. I\u0027m also aware it\u0027s a changeable value in the game files, but it should, again, be far higher on default, ideally having less wobble then ksp1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother input I have is that if autostrut is included, it should really be something that isn\u0027t embedded in some option somewhere (I only found out about it by the very end of me playing ksp1), and instead some option in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Alongside this, it could even be worthwhile to have it be turned on by default, and it being able to be toggled off if you want for whatever reason a floppier rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T07:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do wonder who actually *wants* wet noodle rockets? I guess it can be funny once or twice, but the popularity of autostrut and mods like KJR seems to suggest most people prefer a more rigid node setting. And ksp2 being new game is a good opportunity to set a new standard, instead of just redoing the \u201Cksp1 feel\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least it being a configurable value in a json means it\u2019s easy to tweak now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
