I am sure that there is some error in game or mods, but I can not reproduce these rare events reliably to investigate them. It happens maybe one time per hundred, almost only on trajectories from outer planets to inner planets. Typically I adjust periapsis well in the target\u0027s SOI immediately after I leave the SOI of the departure planet. Then I use MJ to get midcourse correction. I put alarm in KAC and go to manage other things. When I return after tens or hundreds of days, I notice that ship is on totally different trajectory. It takes hundreds of meters per second to get another encounter. My missions does not have it in normal case. Sometimes I fix that with Hyperedit, sometimes I roleplay some technical problem and accept failing of the mission. I use TAC LS too, so waiting for another encounter does not work. I suspect that it may be due to erroneous SOI transition shortly after leaving the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had once problematic three man Dres mission.

Experiment a bit with it, and you should be able to get an orbit with Eve at apohelion. With a small burn around Eve, taking advantage of the ever-popular oberth whatsit, you can set your perihelion close enough to Moho\u0027s orbit.
