I\u0027ve changed the version to 1.2.2 and weeded out a few mods that crash the game on startup, but I still can\u0027t get it to a usable state. The Real Solar System mod literally just isn\u0027t working (i.e. still the normal Kerbal universe) despite it loading on startup, Kerbal Construction Time crashes upon going to the space center, and the biggest issue is when I\u0027m in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E I can\u0027t switch part tabs despite clicking any/all of the buttons.

If anyone actually has a working install I\u0027d definitely appreciate knowing what you have loaded/if you can share your gamedata folder that would be great.

Now, for the advice-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you checked your Kopernicus version? Having the wrong version of a mod is usually bad, but in the case of Kopernicus it has to be recompiled for every single update or it won\u0027t work at all. If that\u0027s not the problem, do the following: Starting with a clean install, load one mod. Then try loading KSP. If KSP loads, add another mod. Repeat until KSP starts having problems. At this point, you\u0027ll have identified the problematic mod, and can start looking for the specific problem and finding a solution. Either that, or your install will magically work now that you\u0027ve decided to do everything slowly.
