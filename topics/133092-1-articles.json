I\u0027m still in Kerbal Science College.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... Fine, then. And now our host, the famous Linus Kerman!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus: Sure, I\u0027ll go with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Linus walks onstage*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus: Hello, everybody! Today, we will be discussing the two... I mean three... laws of motion, which were discovered by Newton Kerman nearly 185 days ago. Sadly, Newton Kerman is not available today due to an apple-related injury. So, let\u0027s jump right in:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst law: A thing will keep moving at the same speed in the same direction unless a force makes it not do that stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, why do we not just have rovers flying up off of hills, or slamming into mountains, or whatever? Because the ground and air slow them down, by not getting out of the way in time. Moving on,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond law: F=MA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rather enigmatic law was only recently explained as standing for \u0022Force = Mass x Acceleration\u0022, and not \u0022Fries=Mustard applesauce\u0022 which was a common and utterly bizzare guess. It means that more massive objects need more force to achieve the same acceleration. Now, on to the\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird law: When a thing is pushed, it pushes back the same amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply put, this law is why when you put on your socks on a slippery tile floor and throw a bowling ball (not saying I do this like, every other Thursday), you move as well. It\u0027s also why rockets work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it for today! Next time: Gravity!
