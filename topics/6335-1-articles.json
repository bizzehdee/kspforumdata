I think I went too far, ATM my rocket is orbiting around the sun.( and it is out of fuel, so yeah dead crew) The thing I tried to do was get an orbit around kerbin, any hints on that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-04T16:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPitch over sooner? You want to start turning towards horizontal ~10-30 km, depending on the rocket. Also, you\\\u0027ll want to shut down the engines ~2000-2300 m/s, depending on your altitude. (faster when lower). Check the map (m to toggle) to keep an eye on your projected orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
