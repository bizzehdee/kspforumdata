While the ascent was fine for the first three kilometers, as soon as I hit that altitude the engines would stop and the throttle would stick at zero. I tried this with and without MechJeb, and tested it with only stock game parts, where it worked just fine. What can I do to fix this without having to uninstall CactEye?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: This appears to be true of all modded parts, including MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T21:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MatthewJ00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T21:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, you use RemoteTech? on RT, a probe is limited to communicate to 3km, you need to take an antenne like Reflectron DP-10 to communicate in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t use RT, we need your mod list and perhaps your logs, you can read this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatthewJ00","CreatedById":139464,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T23:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, that fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
