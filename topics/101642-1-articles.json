This deluxe aircraft features not only a completely pressurized (and currently IVA-free) crew cabin, with a capacity of 16 members, plus a 4-crewed cockpit! **(Pilots sold separately)**\n\nBehind the pressurized crew cabin, there is a living space within a very large refurbished cargo bay! This living space consists of an upper and lower deck!\n\nThe upper deck contains a table and areas to lounge, along with an extendable deck (bay doors) and a pedway leading to the rear cupola module!\n\nThe lower deck connects via a stairwell, also leading to an ease-of-access landing can for ease of entry. The lower deck primarily consists of a home theater and a garage for an included rover to explore your environment! The garage includes a lower cargo bay door allowing the rover to exit the aircraft.\n\nNow I am sure you are wondering about the stability and agility of the aircraft both parked and in flight. The aircraft is highly maneuverable in the air, and very stable on the ground, thanks to a system of deplorable stabilizing legs and gears. And worry not about speed: the aircraft consists of 6 engines capable of hauling you and your family/friends to any destination your heart desires in a short period of time!\n\nA brand-new feature that we are proud to include is an interior cupola module, allowing one to enter and receive a breathtaking view of the landscape below, when the lower bay doors are open in flight! Similarly, there is a small lander can in the rear that offers an incredible view of the passing landscape.\n\n* * *\n\nWithout further adieu, here are some pictures of this revolutionary craft:\n\nSitting on the runway, the rear viewing window is seen. Also, a view of her in flight:\n\n![Z0A6T6Ml.png](http://i.imgur.com/Z0A6T6Ml.png)![RpQl1Rul.png](http://i.imgur.com/RpQl1Rul.png)\n\nShown below are interior views from the cupola module and the rear lander can:\n\n![whHlLdcl.png](http://i.imgur.com/whHlLdcl.png)![lTGDvCSl.png](http://i.imgur.com/lTGDvCSl.png)\n\nNow landed on the beach, shown is the upper deck:\n\n![bYd1GEWl.png](http://i.imgur.com/bYd1GEWl.png)![SFZrA3Ul.png](http://i.imgur.com/SFZrA3Ul.png)![rVJ1s8pl.png](http://i.imgur.com/rVJ1s8pl.png)\n\nShown below is the lower deck theater:\n\n![CBLATRZl.png](http://i.imgur.com/CBLATRZl.png)\n\nShown below is the garage and stability system.
