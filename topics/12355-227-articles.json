It has to do with the \u003Cstrong\u003Enames\u003C/strong\u003E of the ship and the lander. MechJeb doesn\u0027t like two ships having the same name, nor does it like having one ship have the same name as a piece of debris. It seems that MechJeb could not distinguish between my crew ship and my lander, or between my crew ship and one (or more) of the aeroshroud panels that get blown off to expose the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is this: When you build the ship that I\u0027m using, it launches as \u003Cstrong\u003Eone ship\u003C/strong\u003E under one name. When you separate the pieces, there is enough similarity between the \u0022lander\u0022, the \u0022ship\u0022, and \u0022debris\u0022 that MechJeb mistakes one for another. This is what seems to have happened with an earlier test, where the command pod \u0022exploded\u0022 in the background. Looking at the log, what it was described as doing was hitting the surface of Mun. I was at the time focused on the lander, going through the landing sequence. MechJeb saw the names of both ships as being the same, and so the command ship plunged along with the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change I tried on both of these successful missions was to rename the command ship immediately upon separation from the carrier stage, then switch over to the lander and rename it something totally different. When the command ship docks with the lander, both ships are recognized by the command ship name, but now the lander has its own identity after it separates from the command ship to go down to the surface. MechJeb liked the difference. and didn\u0027t summarily clobber the command ship, leaving it positioned comfortably in orbit.
