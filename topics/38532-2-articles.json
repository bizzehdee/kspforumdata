I might be wrong, but the way it works now is that it slowly increases the control surface angles until the movement in a given axis stops. This means that if you pitch up to say 20 degrees, your nose will start to pitch down, the asas will compensate, and you will stop pitching down at somewhere around 10 degrees. If you have lots of control surfaces, it reacts quicker, closer to the initial position. I haven\u0027t tried anything in space yet, but I would guess that since the wing surfaces are useless in space, for a craft that is not prefectly symmetrical (say a space plane) you will need some extra torque from the pods. Try putting some more SAS (yes the ordinary SAS) on the space plane.
