Other things are left to be done, ive seen mutible suggestions for a rockomax experiment and other to support long term missions or storage of experiments so i got this idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a Hitchhiker lab. The idea is to make us rove/fly around a planet but to come back to a base or lander to analye and store experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say we make it contain 3-5 surface samples with an possiblity to analyse the data and greatly reduce the penalety on Transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we just send the data from a surface sample we should not get more than 5-10% but if we do it from after the analysis we get around 60-80%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we just have to return the Kerbal home, if we make it resonably heavy so you dont just send one to every Biome. You could fly it Back but it should not make sense since we by then got other Storage options. Iam not a fan of Stations but i also could make Stations viable duo to the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we would have 3 Options: Return the Sample (we really need some kind of Storage/Transport for Samples), just send raw data, or send a Lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould not be hard to make and the only requirement would be enough Biomes to go to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T10:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would certainly make the Hitchhiker pod a lot more useful. Currently it\u0027s not much more than crew storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps at the same time it would be a good suggestion to actually start new, long term experiments inside the pod.
