My way to rise up is to pitch according to thrust. Below 15km, right click an engine and see if it is gaining thrust. If not, pitch down.If it is, continue to pitch up until the accelaration is nice and steady. Pitch down to 5 degrees at \u0022speed run\u0022 altitude.

My go-to flight manual in 1.05 is to leave the runway at 5\u00BAAoA, let it build height, then at 10,000m levelling to 5\u00BAAoA again by briefly switching to prograde autopilot, then doing \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E until the RAPIERs give out. That is ideal for low TWR SSTOs (TWR 0.5), and low TWR SSTOs are the ones that get the awesomest mass ratios. It may seem slow, but in the end the climb to orbit is still about 15 minutes, because when you go fast, you climb fast even if you go shallow. If you find that you are blowing up following this tip, then you have way too much TWR, but if you still want to go that route, just increase the second angle slightly, or don\u0027t level off at 10,000 at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to engines, look nowhere but RAPIERs. They may seem underpowered when you take off, but anything more than 0.45 TWR, and you can get to a ~1,300m/s airbreathing cutoff speed. And that is the key, they have the highest cutoff speed available, meaning they leave the smallest job to the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntakes are easy nowadays. Basically anything that keeps the engine lit will do. The best results are apparently with a single shock cone per RAPIER, tough, low drag and enough air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWings, whatever floats your boat, but he BigS line offers handy fuel tankage \u0022for free\u0022. Check their heat tolerances while you are at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd general design principles... well it depends on the mission. But some universal tips are to check the CoL/CoM with empty tanks, like it\u0027ll be when you land (you\u0027d be surprised how often that gets overlooked), and to limit yourself to a bit under 20mT per RAPIER for best payload fraction results. The fuel/payload ratio depends entirely on the design dV, but if we only count \u0022ground to LKO\u0022, payload fractions of around 30% are perfectly doable. The LF/LOX level is something best done by trial and error, noting fuel levels on orbit and adjusting accordingly... and that\u0027s pretty much it. The rest is experimentation, so have at it! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

The most obvious of these is the intercooler; it has good high speed performance, but also sucks enough air to keep a pair of jets lit on the runway. As a rule of thumb, a shock cone is good for three jets when fast, one when slow. An intercooler will do two jets, fast or slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is running a pair of Whiplashes on nothing but a single intercooler, and it\u0027ll keep the engines whirring happily up to the conventional jet\u00A0ceiling:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/fq87d/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a\u00A0FAR ship, so the flight profile shown may not work for stock (or for anything with sensible TWR in FAR; that \u0027un is rather overpowered), but the information re: intakes applies the same in stock or FAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see that your ship has multiple stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, as a definition kraken, it is not a SINGLE STAGE to Orbit craft, but more of a jet-assisted spaceplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease don\u0027t take offence :P.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhylumCnidaria","CreatedById":148609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T01:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that that\u0027s because he wants to trigger engines at different times without using action groups for some reason...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T07:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222325705\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450312326\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151904\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Optimist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, The Optimist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see that your ship has multiple stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, as a definition kraken, it is not a SINGLE STAGE to Orbit craft, but more of a jet-assisted spaceplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease don\u0027t take offence :P.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is not how SSTO is defined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA multi stage vehicle can be an SSTO as long as it only uses a single stage to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for SSTO, staging refers to whether or not stages are dropped using decouplers or similar.

Well, I use handy rules of thumb. The sweet spot on the rocket equation is at a mass ratio of ~2.73 (\u0022\u003Cem\u003Ee\u003C/em\u003E\u0022), so I play it safe and go for 3, but ignore tankage. That means about 3 times more fuel tank weight than payload, or 66% of the weight being fuel. That would get you more than ten times the Isp in m/s, very roughly. VERY roughly, I often play fast and loose with this \u0022rule\u0022. But it means than anything below half the takeoff weight in fuel is a no-go, because then I\u0027m way under 2km/s, unless I have a very good reason for that. Then you figure out how much liquid fuel you need to get \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E to rocket takeover conditions... I do that mostly by trial and error, though I have some other rules of thumb... but they are not even this \u0022precise\u0022, so I encourage you to look for your own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
