I thought I would introduce myself since there was a place for it. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a few months on and off and have recently become slightly addicted to campaign mode while taking a break from Dwarf Fortress. My biggest accomplishments so far are landing probes on both Eve and Duna. However, each of those is laying on it\u0027s side since I built the thing as a tower and didn\u0027t find a suitably flat place to drop it on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d appreciate some tips on designing unmanned probes. I have one now that shouldn\u0027t tip over (it will stay right side up if I drop it on the 30 degree slope on the side of the launch pad), but I have yet to put it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any other advice is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T18:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community kelmv \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe consider a probe design hat can land at any any angle?
