Most mission reports I\u0027ve read have focused on a particular expedition or save. The Pathfinder Files will focus on the development and implementation of a specific vessel type, Long Service Vessels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I\u0027ve only developed two versions of this vessel in two separate saves, both bearing the name Pathfinder, thus the name of this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve mentioned the first in another thread, but there are differences now. I\u0027ll now be using \u0022generation\u0022 to refer to how many saves have featured LSVs, and letters to refer to the iterations within a save. This is a marked departure from previous terms, which used generation to describe tech level and letters to denote an entirely new ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis first post will cover the launches, orbital assembly, and some operation within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, of the second generation, model B. The only mods in use at the moment are ReStock, ReStock Plus, and SCANsat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first launch conveyed the drive section, command center, and crew quarters. Like the first generation, a Mk1-3 command pod serves as bridge and probe control. A four-seater Hitchhiker pod has also been carried over, supplemented by two Mk1 crew cabins for a total of eight passenger seats serving as habitation. The two additional cabins have been mounted atop structural fuselages, with a service bay and a slanted nose cone atop them for aesthetics. One service bay features an OKTO probe core and an avionics hub, while the other is populated with batteries. Each cabin also has two jr docking ports, mounted radial top and bottom. On the bottom of each fuselage are a 1.25m reaction wheel and a Caravel engine from Restock Plus, a recent acquisition which has fast become a favorite for its balance between Isp and thrust strength. Behind the Hitchhiker is a central Rockomax tank with fuel ducts leading out to two outboard fuel tank stacks, each featuring a Poodle engine for the best Isp. There are more service bays with monoprop tanks, batteries, and one stack of 0.625 reaction wheels. There is also one midsize dock port at the aft, and a jr size on the nose of the bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few peculiarities to this arrangement. Under typical operation, the central tank is drained first, as you would expect. To my surprise, on refueling, the central tank also pulled from the outboard tanks, despite the fuel ducts and spaced decouplers, when using \u0022in.\u0022 I resorted to using \u0022out\u0022 on the tanks to be drained and decoupling them immediately, one by one. In the future I\u0027ll try refueling with only the central and delivery tanks selected. \u2206v calculation also behaved strangely, flickering between eight hundred some and three thousand. This was likely an odd interaction with MechJeb\u0027s \u0022differential throttle\u0022 function found under utilities. Shutting off the Caravel engines was an easy fix, giving the accurate reading of three thousand running on Poodles. The Caravels were great for the launch and may be useful, or even necessary, for other high-power situations or simply a shorter burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ln0dVco.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ln0dVco.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlamour shot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LnT8hj7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LnT8hj7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nService bays opened, angled towards sunlight, best shot to see details\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second launch covers everybody\u0027s craving, sweet glorious Science! There\u0027s a research lab, Science Jr, goo, thermometer, barometer, and, last but certainly not least, a SCANsat Multispectral Analyzer, which I just love. You can even find [classified data redacted]. The biome feature is neat too, although that function can also be filled by the lab\u0027s KerbNet access in case ya didn\u0027t know. There\u0027s also some more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and monoprop (forgot reaction wheels, whoops) and both ends feature a midsize dock, one of which is occupied by the drive section. There are also two radial docks in both mid and jr varieties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, these sections enable Pathfinder to meet specs within my tech level. Once I\u0027ve unlocked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E technology, a pair of engineers will join the crew with a refinery section and a mining drone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of drones, the third launch is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tug I\u0027ve dubbed Retriever, following a theme of dog breed names for kerman\u0027s best friend. It features both jr and mid ports and six extending Communotron 16s, providing extended control range and transmission of research when not being used as a tug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next launch will be a probe lander and two sample return packages. The probe will have all the experiments the lab section does, excluding the SCANsat and materials bay to save mass and enable a return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-09T12:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2020 12:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Vagrant203\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo, screenshots\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagrant203","CreatedById":202630,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T00:27:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been long enough that I\u0027m writing a new post as opposed to editing the beginning operations into the previous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tug drone mentioned in the previous post was not very effective in its first iteration.

This will be heavily relied upon for the C variant of this generation\u0027s Pathfinder. The class B will remain within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, while the C will be going interplanetary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso benefitting from nuclear propulsion is the Bloodhound science lander. So far, the Bloodhound has landed on Minmus, and returned to orbit, three times. With the extra margin of \u2206v, it was decided to feature the full complement of unlocked science useful for landers. The inbound trip and the first landing were enough to stock the lab with its data quota, and the other two had their data transferred to a sample return drone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaid sample return had managed to pass beyond transmission range at apoapsis after leaving Minmus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Some confusion regarding control points burned enough of the return\u0027s \u2206v that this had effectively stranded it for the moment. However, I sent a Mk1-3 pod with nuke engines to guide it home, manned by everyone\u0027s trusty pilots Jeb and Val. Mission Control got tired of the sibling squabbles early on, but they remained mission effective and brought home 723 points of Science! and some strays they picked up on the way back, and managed not to ruin the vacation of the three tourists they brought along for the ride, probably due in large part to being in a separate pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI typed this post on my phone whilst waiting for the last launch of the post to load.

The final stretch of research was made possible by data retrieved by a Mun lander, which bore a pilot, scientist, and a tourist. A 250-scale refinery has been delivered to the Pathfinder 2b in Minmus orbit, and will soon be followed by another small section dedicated to solar panels and thermal control systems, with a few high-capacity batteries for good measure, along with a drill lander with a probe core and seating for an engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis spoiler was supposed to be at the bottom, but I can\u0027t delete it or click and drag it on my phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to install Stockalike Station Parts Redux, without IVAs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModel 2c is already on the drawing board, retaining the functionality of 2b including the refinery.
