I got bored and i wanted to get to the parts i wanted. With contracts i feel as if there is something to do. experiments to run and challenges to meet. Heck half the time i find myself actually FORGETTING to run my science experiments cause I\u0027m so caught up in running the contract challenges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: i like contracts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T00:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like that contracts provide science as well.

I really have to think about what I send up because if it fails, it\u0027s a lot of funds down the drain and every mission has a budget now or else it\u0027s not gonna make any profit. Just had to carefully plan a ship to go rescue a stranded kerbal (without RCS no less) and managed to make it in one go without any testing, really satisfying\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T00:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played maybe 30 minutes of 0.24 and I\u0027m already thinking the career mode is better. Not easier, but not harder. I can bust out a couple contracts early on and unlock a few parts that I find mission critical, then cruise smoothly into having a lot more fun than should be allowed. Not having to waddle around KSC is nice. Not having to rocket-hop until I can get spaceplane parts, also nice. Test a few decouplers or rockets on the ground and get a little bit for it. Sling a rocket skybound and test something at altitude, or trying to break a record.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, I find myself liking career mode, and hating myself for trying it before the mods update and I can load it down with Firespitter and a few dozen others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I\u0027m glad for 64-bit mode. I will, of course, use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
