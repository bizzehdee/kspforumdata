The short of it is: I have a somewhat simple rocket using KW Rocketry, and using FAR as the aerodynamics model. Four stage lifter (12 x Globe V SRB, 4 x Titan XX liquid fuel, and 2 stages each of the Titan T1). this is all pushing a payload of 90-110 tons. At 90 tons, I can reliably get payloads into orbit. at 110 tons, one of two things happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The craft will pitch over (engines get ahead of themselves) at around 20-25km, speed 500-800 m/s. I have adjusted every combination of throttle and gravity turn angle, fin number and placement, as well as RCS thrusters (those high powered ones).

The last image shows just one of my attempts--placing fins further down get ripped off by the launch tower or SRBs, and raising the SRBs off the liquid tanks appears to lead to rapid spinning out. What\u0027s killing me is that the behavior is indicative of high drag, but my ship ought to be compatible with FAR (designed for low drag).... so what gives??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Spin out. Begins immediately after launch and quickly accelerates out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly experienced with the game, what\u0027s throwing me for a loop is fixing the problem \u0022legitimately\u0022--using the FAR mod for aerodynamics \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E maintaining correct orientation without, say, a nose-mounted RCS block.
