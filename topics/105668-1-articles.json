An image says more then a thousand words, so here\u0027s the result.\n\n![strange_part_placement.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16919187/Screenshots/KSP/strange_part_placement.png)\n\nMaybe I\u0027m missing a \u0027new\u0027 keyboard shortcut that remedies this, but otherwise I would expect the placed wheel in the foreground and its mirrored counterpart should both be pointing down. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nGreets,\n\nJan\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T14:43:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jananton**"},{"CreatedByName":"velusip","CreatedById":60676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:51:52Z","Content":"Did you try pressing \u0022R\u0022 to change the type of symmetry?"},{"CreatedByName":"cathasatail","CreatedById":65597,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:10:57Z","Content":"This happened to me too when I was moving the wings of an aircraft from the root of the wing, only just found it out."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:29:41Z","Content":"Yes, it looks like you have radial symmetry turned on. You want mirror symmetry, which you can toggle with R (as mentioned above). The editor will automatically switch modes if your mouse touches a part that is mirrored/radial, which can sometimes be a pain. Also, there are a few bugs with symmetry, especially if you build a single branch then try to replicate it with mirror symmetry.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:55:28Z","Content":"Well, I know of the \u0027R\u0027 key and I tried that too, but that didn\u0027t result in solving the problem. When pressing \u0027R\u0027 and after letting it go the mirrored item seems to position itself different, but it immediately snaps back to the position seen in the image regardless how often I press it. Also when already in mirror mode pressing the \u0027X\u0027 key again sometimes starts to count on, while I thought two was the max in the SPH. I presume this happens when radial symmetry is active?\n\nADDITIONAL:\n\nWell, this seems to have been a glitch of some sort, since today it all worked as expected. Why I had this strange mirroring effect in the first place is still a mystery, the only case I can think of is that one cannot switch between symmetry and radial placement while one already has an item selected..., but if that was what happened, I\u0027m not sure. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nGreets,\n\nJan\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T14:49:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jananton**\n  \nadditional info"}]}
