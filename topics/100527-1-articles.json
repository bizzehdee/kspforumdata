Three stages.

As Pecan has already mentioned, you may also want to take a look at some of the tutorials and other resources included in the Drawing Board, which is conveniently linked through my signature; I try to collect something for everyone and everything, so hopefully you\u0027ll find something that might be useful, whether right now or for future missions.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Necros the Necromancer","CreatedById":138566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:43:31Z","Content":"Thank you all :-)"}]}
