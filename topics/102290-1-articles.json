Thus, it is also one of the most diverse engines in the game, able to be used on anything from spaceplanes in the upper atmosphere to interplanetary motherships to low to medium gravity landers. This engine could take you anywhere you wanted to go in the game, but it would still require some creative designs to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s actually one of the most balanced engines in the game. it\u0027s actually slightly underpowered, if we assume that a balanced engine has about 64% of a real engine\u0027s thrust. After all, both real-life NERVAS and LV-Ns have 800 isp, and the LV-N has about 60% of the TWR of the NERVA (NERVAS had 7, the LVN has just over 4).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell as i expected you didn\u0027t understand my post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking of nerfing or make it powerful, simply to use a coherent fuel for nuclear propulsion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T05:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be fine with it being changed... I am also fine with it NOT being changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of KSP in that regards is that editing the .cfg file is so easy that if I feel something has no practical value in game, or is redundant and is never used, I can easily go in, modify the said engine, and test. I never touched the LV-N tho, mainly because every engine in KSP uses 2 resources or fuel. Unless the game is modified to handle a lone fuel-type, I cannot modify it to use only LF (or Kethane as I thought doing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did buff the ION-Engines to 5 thrust, long before the Devs \u0022buffed\u0022 it to 2, mainly because it was too boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tweaked the Rapier to combine the ramjet power/isp with the Poodle power to make it a used engine.
