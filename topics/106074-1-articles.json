Definitely helps if you watch your ascent profile. I\u0027d go into details but I need to get somewhere right now; if I have time I\u0027ll edit this post later with something quite a bit more useful to you.\n\nEDIT: Why not go about editing something at 2:30 in the morning, right?\n\nAlright - so the structure of the tech tree changed in 1.0 and the folks that maintain the wiki haven\u0027t gotten around to updating that data yet, I\u0027m going off of memory here and as I mentioned it\u0027s 2:30 AM where I\u0027m at and haven\u0027t had much sleep, so take this advice with a grain of salt.\n\nYou can build an orbit-capable craft pretty early on. I don\u0027t know if the old \u0022exploding SRB staging\u0022 trick still works or not; even if it does, with the new stock aero you want to chute for a stage TWR of about 1.2-1.3 to keep drag from building up. I personally built up some tech before reaching orbit, gaining access to stack decouplers, FL-T200 fuel tanks and the LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine. Most folks have observed that LKO takes about 3500-4000 m/s of delta-v now, depending on how much you muck it up on the ascent. Couldn\u0027t say how many SRBs that equates to; I know that with just a small chute, command pod and decoupler you need about 11 FL-T200 tanks to make orbit with a single LV-T45.\n\nThe launch profile now goes something like this:\n\n1) Right after launch, turn to 80 degrees elevation on course 090.\n\n2) At about 5,000 meters, begin a slow pitching maneuver downwards, maintaining course 090. Keep your heading within 10 degrees of prograde; ideally you\u0027re at 45 degrees somewhere around 15k.\n\n3) At that point, look at your time to apoapsis. When you get to 40 seconds to Ap, you can reduce your elevation to 20 degrees. At 50 seconds to Ap, reduce to 10 degrees; for a minute or more, fly along the horizon.\n\n4) Since you\u0027re going for a speed record, you just have to keep on burning; you don\u0027t actually have to go into orbit. Were you headed to orbit, you\u0027d stop your burn once your Ap was where you wanted it (the lower the better in this case since you won\u0027t have a lot of extra delta-V to blow), setup a maneuver node at Ap to raise the Pe and make the burn when the time comes. Once you\u0027re out of atmo, the game is the same ol\u0027 KSP.\n\nWell, hopefully that\u0027s helpful to you. Best of luck.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T07:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:28:13Z","Content":"To paraphrase as said above, the 2500m/s record is a symbiotic goal of the \u0022orbit kerbin!\u0022 record. a 70x70 orbit is just over 2100 m/s, but put a little more stank on it, and you\u0027ll easily get up to 2500. If you want to risk it, and dont want a wildly eliptical orbit, when you re-enter from, say a 120000m Ap, the upper layer of the atmo is still thin enough that it wont slow you down, and closer than 70k, so you\u0027ll get a couple more 10\u0027s of m/s before air resistance starts cutting you off."},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:44:14Z","Content":"You will get that speed when you do your first Mun flyby.

The navball will key over to orbital mode automagically after a certain altitude, and once your oV hits 2500m/s, my sV read only ~2050m/s. With a 4200dV craft restricted to T3 tech, with a single upgrade on Launchpad and nothing else, I can juuust barely make both orbit and this speed record, and the speed record is the more difficult of them to accomplish.\n\nI\u0027m not calling bug on this (I can\u0027t rule it out, either) but at a minimum, Squad might wanna make the contract description clearer on this one.\n\nUpdate: I\u0027ve established an equatorial orbit, Ap975km, Pe71km, at Pe sV=2505m/s oV=2730m/s. Still didn\u0027t trigger the award.
