I don\u0027t know if the old \u0022exploding SRB staging\u0022 trick still works or not; even if it does, with the new stock aero you want to chute for a stage TWR of about 1.2-1.3 to keep drag from building up. I personally built up some tech before reaching orbit, gaining access to stack decouplers, FL-T200 fuel tanks and the LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine. Most folks have observed that LKO takes about 3500-4000 m/s of delta-v now, depending on how much you muck it up on the ascent. Couldn\u0027t say how many SRBs that equates to; I know that with just a small chute, command pod and decoupler you need about 11 FL-T200 tanks to make orbit with a single LV-T45.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch profile now goes something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Right after launch, turn to 80 degrees elevation on course 090.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) At about 5,000 meters, begin a slow pitching maneuver downwards, maintaining course 090. Keep your heading within 10 degrees of prograde; ideally you\u0027re at 45 degrees somewhere around 15k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At that point, look at your time to apoapsis. When you get to 40 seconds to Ap, you can reduce your elevation to 20 degrees. At 50 seconds to Ap, reduce to 10 degrees; for a minute or more, fly along the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Since you\u0027re going for a speed record, you just have to keep on burning; you don\u0027t actually have to go into orbit. Were you headed to orbit, you\u0027d stop your burn once your Ap was where you wanted it (the lower the better in this case since you won\u0027t have a lot of extra delta-V to blow), setup a maneuver node at Ap to raise the Pe and make the burn when the time comes. Once you\u0027re out of atmo, the game is the same ol\u0027 KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, hopefully that\u0027s helpful to you.
