In particular SCANsat and RT2 added a feeling of progression and StageRecovery (along with RT2 again) are great for adding more engineering concerns and a level of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am wondering now is what next?

The only modifications to stock are that KSPI requires you to add radiators to long-term missions relying on solar power and modifies the seismometer, whereas NF halves the stock ion engine\u0027s thrust to keep it in line with its own balance and has an optional module switching stock nukes to using its own liquid hydrogen resource rather than stock LF (at least last time I checked). Now on to what they add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENF is pretty stockalike in its mechanics; the only really new things are the reactors, and those are relatively simple. It basically just expands on the ion engines a lot, with supporting power generation and storage. KSPI is more in depth, adding a much more complicated system of energy production, heat management, and energy usage, along with some complicated engine mechanics, warp drives, and a minor overhaul to the science system. I\u0027d personally go with KSPI, but only if you\u0027re willing to deal with it being really complicated.
