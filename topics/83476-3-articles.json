There was a 90,000 polygon test a while back it dealt with rather well. For something large I\u0027d push the boat out and go for the 48. I\u0027m still careful not to use polygons where they aren\u0027t needed, but the bad old days of really low poly models seem to be well behind us \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELove your work, would like to design a little rover body to fit in the bay.

Looking at the KW rocketry 5M fuel tanks, they use 32 sides. Should I go with 32, or bump up to 48?\u003Cp\u003EThe lander chassis was also based on a 24 sided cylinder. In hindsight, I probably should have doubled or tripled the sides for that one, since the curved sides only have 3 faces before the sharps (see picture in first post album).
