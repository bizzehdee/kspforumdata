It\u0027s a single launch, no refueling, chemical beast, with a price tag of 4.25 million and a launch mass of 12.15 kt, of which 9 kt are rocket fuel and 1.15 t is sepratron fuel, all contained in 724 parts.

I had 256 m/s left on Kerbin reentry.

With that part count (and recording on top) it takes 15 real life minutes just to get out of atmosphere on my laptop. More with a gravity turn. And the stages are long, gaps relatively narrow, and the sepratrons only barely adequate. What it all means, is that if I have any sort of noticeable angular momentum during staging, the stage ends up colliding into something. So I have to babysit it for at least the first 15 km, trying to squeeze in just the right amount of rotation between the stages and the lag.

A video or even a gif image would be fine for showing the Tylo lander jump (some websites let you make a gif from a short video, if you think that would be easier).  You don\u0027t need every single screenshot, but I would accept your submission if you took at least one shot of each lander by itself showing resources.\n\nLoading the rockets onto the pad would work.
