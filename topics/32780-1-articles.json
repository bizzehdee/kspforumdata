I think you if it is a kerbin SSTO, it is definetly a Laythe SSTO\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T14:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022norcalairman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022norcalairman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve not been to Laythe yet, it\u0027s coming though as I\u0027m competing in a grand tour race.

You can build a re-fueler pretty easy, I just put rover wheels on the front of my plane so I can lower the front gear, drive under my fuel station that has a truss w/ a docking port, and raise the gear to dock and refuel. With the wheels you can also use the jet as a rover without using fuel to move short distances. I am at work but I have 1 pic you can see below. I have tested everything on Kerbin but I have not put it on Laythe yet but it is all assembled in orbit and ready to go, just need some playtime so I can get it all to Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rGP3WCQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rGP3WCQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rGP3WCQ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/rGP3WCQ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T15:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny SSTO spaceplane that works on Kerbin will work better on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that you want TurboJets, and *ample* lifting surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for refueling... you can see my system in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/32383-Islands-of-Laythe-one-flag-at-a-time?p=423851\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post423851\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrotoro has another system if you want to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27552-Long-term-Laythe-Mission-%28pic-heavy%29-With-PART-8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edig through this\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
