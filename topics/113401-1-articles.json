The craft is a pod with a kerbal, solar panels, an antenna, and obviously a lab with two scientists. Data can be sent to the lab and research happens at a decent rate. Science gradually builds up as well, but when trying to transmit the science the antenna deploys and instantly says done without having sent anything. I\u0027m at a complete loss here. Any ideas for a fix or even just a work around?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m an idiot. I had .176 science built up not 176.
