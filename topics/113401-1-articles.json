The craft is a pod with a kerbal, solar panels, an antenna, and obviously a lab with two scientists. Data can be sent to the lab and research happens at a decent rate. Science gradually builds up as well, but when trying to transmit the science the antenna deploys and instantly says done without having sent anything. I\u0027m at a complete loss here. Any ideas for a fix or even just a work around?\n\nEDIT: I\u0027m an idiot. I had .176 science built up not 176. Nothing is broken except my save, but a new one fixed that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T19:45:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roxedboxer**\n  \nI\u0027m an idiot."}]}
