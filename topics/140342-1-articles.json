Even if it touches that limit for a mere microsecond - boom, the part is gone. This is your limit for \u003Cem\u003Einstantaneous\u003C/em\u003E heat load, AKA how high shock heating is allowed to spike in an instant. It also governs how \u003Cem\u003Eaggressive\u003C/em\u003E you can be during reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second factor is thermal mass. That\u0027s the value governing how much heat flux is required to raise a part\u0027s temperature by a given amount. Skin has very little thermal mass; only very little heat is required to raise its temperature a whole lot. However, skin is what is actually exposed to the shock heating, so how does it stay alive? Because a hot skin radiates and conducts heat away. Radiated heat is happily gone, but conducted heat goes into the part\u0027s internals. Those have a high thermal mass, and take a lot of heat to warm up. Therefore, your craft can \u0022soak\u0022 heat for a while. But the speed of heat conduction is dependant on the temperature difference between the skin and the internals. As your internals heat up, the rate of heat conducted away from the skin decreases, and as a result the skin grows hotter. This continues until one of two cases happen: either the internals will reach their temperature limit (which is usually lower than that of the skin) and cause the part to explode, or the lack of heat conduction causes the skin to reach its temperature limit and cause the part to explode. In other words, thermal mass is your limit for \u003Cem\u003Esustained\u003C/em\u003E heat load. It also governs how \u003Cem\u003Ecareful\u003C/em\u003E you can be during reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo explain the \u0022careful\u0022 vs. \u0022aggressive\u0022 part:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs atmospheric pressure increases, heating starts off at a fairly high value but scales up only slowly; meanwhile, drag starts really low, but scales up very quickly. Reading this should make it obvious to anyone: the deeper you can go into the atmosphere, the better, because you get lots of extra drag for only a little extra heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, keep in mind the limits for instantaneous heat load. Going deeper may only increase absolute heat at a sedate rate, but if you exceed the maximum you\u0027re allowed, it doesn\u0027t matter how sedately. Too much is too much. For any given speed, you can only go so deep without simply disintegrating in an instant. That is why having a higher \u003Cem\u003Einstantaneous\u003C/em\u003E heat load tolerance lets you be more \u003Cem\u003Eaggressive\u003C/em\u003E - it lets you go deeper right from the start, where you slow down faster. If you don\u0027t have the tolerance, you need to stay further up, where you don\u0027t slow down as quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis unfortunately presents another problem: because you don\u0027t slow down quickly, you spend a lot of time high up in the atmosphere. And remember, even in the faintest of atmospheres you\u0027re going to get a noticable heat load. Not as high as further down, but not much less, either. And when you keep hanging out there, your craft starts soaking heat. Minute after minute, internal temperature climbs higher, making the skin hotter, further impeding your ability to safely lose altitude, and gradually approaching the moment where your parts deplete their endurance. You may not disintegrate instantly, but you\u0027re slowly melting yourself to slag. That\u0027s why having a higher \u003Cem\u003Esustained\u003C/em\u003E heat load tolerance lets you be more \u003Cem\u003Ecareful\u003C/em\u003E - you don\u0027t have as much of a time limit pressuring you to slow down quickly or die, so you can stay further up for longer and take the scenic route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking these trains of thought to their logical conclusion, you invariably arrive at the question: what if I don\u0027t have the instantaneous tolerance to go deep enough to avoid running out of sustained tolerance? And the answer is: you are dead. Or rather, you have just discovered a reentry scenario that your craft cannot surive, no matter what. With capsules, you encounter these only very rarely, because they are generally fitted with ablative heatshields. Not only do those have extremely high temperature limits, but the ablation process itself consumes a lot of heat - and the hotter the heatshield is, the faster it ablates, and the more of the incoming reentry heating is simply removed from the equation. In the early days of 1.0, Jool was known as a spaceship killer because its atmosphere was misconfigured, causing heatshield skin temperatures to spike so fast that the shields would explode before they could even really start ablating... but nowadays this is fixed, and it\u0027s hard to kill a heatshield before it runs out of ablator. You usually need to be intentionally trying to die to pull it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut spaceplanes don\u0027t have the luxury of ablative shields that conveniently handwave away a large portion of the incoming shock heating and are blessed with incredible instantaneous tolerances. As such, with a spaceplane, it\u0027s actually fairly easy to find yourself in a situation that is simply impossible to survive. And even in those cases where you can survive, the corridor between \u0022too careful\u0022 and \u0022too agressive\u0022 is a lot narrower than for shielded capsules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you determine - through trying various different approaches - that you have such a situation at your hands, the only choice you really have is to avoid that situation.

Coming in too carefully will kill you just as surely as coming in too aggressively, because your plane soaks heat like a sponge and can only do this for a few minutes before melting from the inside out. In some cases, when you are going fairly fast, it\u0027s possible to encounter a scenario that is not survivable no matter what. It\u0027s recommended that spaceplanes reenter only from a fairly low orbit. Not too low, because as mentioned, being too careful can kill you, so don\u0027t try something silly like AP 70, PE 60. But definitely not from an apoapsis outside the \u0022low in space\u0022 situation (\u0026gt;250 km on Kerbin). Try AP 90, and ask some spaceplane experts for good periapsis altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you should employ any and all strategies you can find to maximize your drag, such as going in belly forward, fully perpendicular to the direction of travel (\u0022pancaking into the atmosphere\u0022) and doing consecutive S-turns deeper down. In a capsule, reentry is a \u0027hands off and lean back\u0027 affair. But your spaceplane is extremely aerodynamic by design, and you have to actively fight it to make it lose speed. So, fight!

Streetwind explained it much better than i could, but in my experience, it\u0027s often a good idea to come down relatively steep. it\u0027s dangerous to put your periaps at 20 km when you come in from a trip to mun or minmus or an interplanetary transfer, but the heat resistance of spaceplane parts is actually more than enough to survive a failry aggressive reentry from a stable kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nassuming your shuttle is somewhere in a relatively low orbit (something like 70 to 150 km), it\u0027s probably safe to do a retro burn that puts your periaps below ground level (but not too far below - you don\u0027t want to drop down vertically like a stone). this way, you don\u0027t spend much time in the upper atmosphere where you just soak up lots of heat for very little drag. while you\u0027re still in the upper atmosphere (40km or higher), you can probably keep a radial attitude without too much work. the critiical part of the spaceplane is the cockpit - and by \u0022pancaking\u0022 you make sure that the cockpit doesn\u0027t take all the heat. also, this means that you use the broad side of the wings as huge airbrakes. you still won\u0027t lose much speed so high up, but you won\u0027t heat up the cockpit and you will lose much more velocity than by going in nose first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce you get lower, you probably wont be able to keep the nose pointed in radial attitude - aero forces will more or less try to force it into a \u0022nose first\u0022 dive. you want to avoid that at all cost - in a nose dive, the cockpit takes all the heat and unfortunately, the cockpit has the worst heat resistance of all the parts. if you can\u0027t hold a radial attitude, start pitching the nose up and down. this way, the wings will still act as airbrakes at least for the few seconds before aerodynamics force you down/up again, and the cockpit will be out of the airstream for a bit and has a few seconds to transfer heat to adjacent parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto be honest, the easiest solution is probably to turn the spaceplane into a drone plane and get rid of the cockpit altogether. use a combination of adapter tanks (mk3 to 2.5 and then a 2.5 to 1.25 meters) and put a service bay and a shielded docking port in front (as the nose). put a probe core with some batteries in the service bay to control the plane. the shielded docking port is very heat resistant and if you somehow blow it up, the service bay below it is even more heat resistant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T15:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlenty of good answers above me, thought I\u0027d add my 0.02.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs said before, spaceplanes have a rather shallow reentry corridor because it\u0027s hard to fit aeroshields on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get my spaceplanes back to KSC :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI try to use spaceplane parts only or parts that have a good max heat (2000k is NOT enough)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBefore re-entry, I set myself on the lowest orbit possible (70x70km) either through orbital maneuvering or prior aerobraking maneuvers\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRule of thumb : anything with a PE \u0026lt; 30km gets back to Kerbin.

Note that there probably are better re-entry profiles, but this one usually works fine for me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn high atmo : the most painful part of the trip because you keep heating and don\u0027t brake that much. Plus your orbital speed is still increasing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I do is keeping a very high AoA, sometimes as high as 90\u00B0 (ie nose up) to generate some drag. I also activate everything on the plane that generates drag : opened cargo bay,\u00A0airbrakes, etc. Note that the airbrakes will overheat, but I\u0027ve re-entered so many planes with opened cargo bays...\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that the belly of the plane is exposed to the airflow and this is why I use heat resistant parts (mk2).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen the air gets denser (50km, 45 km when I feel lucky), I get back to a saner 45\u00B0 AoA.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe goal is to keep only the belly of the plane exposed to the airflow, while generating drag (lower your speed) and a bit of lift (reducing vertical speed and thus avoiding hitting the lower atmo too soon and too fast)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCritical altitude is 30 km : atmo density is going to climb fast under 30 km. This is bad if you are coming too hot (I\u0027m usually around 2000 m/s IIRC) because you\u0027ll get fried. But if you slowed down enough in high atmo, you\u0027ll be slowed quickly through high drag. Heat will go up as well, but since the atmosphere is getting thicker, convective cooling will start working again.

It\u0027s bad during ascent because of the drag, but during re-entry, it is protected from the airflow because of the 45\u00B0 AoA attitude and can be deployed/activated to suck the heat from critical parts (usually the nose cone) and will dissipate it in the atmosphere. Not very realistic, I know. I guess the next step would be putting the radiator inside a cargo bay : shielded during ascent, exposed by the open cargo bay during re-entry (especially now that the flush radiators panels can turned on and off).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helped!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T16:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually pitch my plane up\u00A0to roughly 70-90 degrees AoA in the upper atmosphere (until I\u0027m down to below 45km) and then vary my pitch depending on heating.
