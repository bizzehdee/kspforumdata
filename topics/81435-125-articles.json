When every battle is effectively one ship eliminated per turn, and the person with the most ships wins regardless of their crafts\u0027 quality, combat becomes dull and uninteresting, and no-one feels like participating anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack when armor and weapon tech were more balanced, there were constant battles between members of the club. Now? Nothing. It is clear something needs to be done to remedy this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heart of the issue is that our current system of conducting battles is abysmal at approximating real-time warfare. As that is out of the question until more stable multiplayer is introduced, we must make do with our comparatively clumsier turn-based method--but we could at least make it closer to how combat would actually work. I have come up with several solutions to this, with varying degrees of realism and stringency; I will present the one I think is best at promoting varied and interesting gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProposed Changes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Allow weapons to be fired from \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E outside render distance, say 3km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Limit maximal weapon discharge per turn of any number of missiles to \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E% of a ship\u0027s mass. \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E could be constant, or could vary by tonnage; I prefer the latter, with fighters and smaller vessels being able to fire more per unit mass than larger ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Make combat order from highest to lowest TWR, regardless of tonnage or allegiance. In other words, if one player possesses three ships capable of higher acceleration than anothers\u0027, \u003Cem\u003Eall three\u003C/em\u003E of them will get a turn before the other players\u0027 do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExplanations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: The reason for this change is fairly obvious--while retaining the requirement for physical proximity to a target, not having to bring both ships into render distance of one another greatly reduces lag and improves gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: This change will help bring weapons and armor back into balance, hopefully allowing ships to survive at least one attack by an enemy vessel. In terms of realism, this change makes sense because firing a full volley of missiles into an enemy ship requires time--time that the enemy ship would likely spend retaliating with weapons of its own. Because we cannot really accurately simulate this interaction in a turn-based setting, this compromise helps ship-to-ship battles be \u0022fairer\u0022 to the ship under attack. Varying mass percentages for different tonnages of ships helps keep fighter and smallcraft useful in combat, allowing them to be more efficient than larger ships on a per-turn basis but less efficient overall (they consume more fuel, require a dedicated carrier, are more vulnerable, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: This is the most significant change that I have proposed, and I do so primarily on the basis of realism, as our current by-tonnage, alternating-allegiance system makes no sense whatsoever. Why should my nuclear-powered cruiser follow another\u0027s ion fighter in turn order when the former is capable of three times the acceleration of the latter? Moreover, if all of my ships are more maneuverable than my opponents\u0027, why should they have to follow his? It is entirely illogical. Ordering solely on the basis of TWR makes vastly more sense, because logically the ships capable of greater acceleration will be able to reach their intended destinations far more quickly than those with lower thrust outputs, and this time-to-target determines who gets the first strike in combat. This change would give short-range but high-acceleration fighters a more realistic place in combat, and reduce the dominance of the slow, ion-powered craft that are now ubiquitous. In sum, it would make maneuverability an actually valuable trait, giving designers another quality to consider in their construction of ships, while vastly improving our approximation of real-time, real-life orbital combat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Three1415\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Three1415\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ereduce the dominance of the slow, ion-powered craft that are now ubiquitous\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd massively push the low range, high twr, engine with guns craft into dominance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35342-Repurposed-thread-for-storage-of-NBC-rules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBecause I can\u0027t update the rules here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efurthermore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFite me m8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone else got working ships yet?\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd massively push the low range, high twr, engine with guns craft into dominance.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35342-Repurposed-thread-for-storage-of-NBC-rules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBecause I can\u0027t update the rules here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efurthermore\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually just did refit the Drek and MACEYDEAN so they both have ion power, the drek now has some 5,000 m/s D/V and the macey gets 12,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut their TWR is abyssimal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always given my ships high dV and TWR.

The 2nd gen is 351 parts (255 hull), and 75t. The 3rd gen is 286 parts (190 hull) and is roughly 70t heavy. While the g2 has absurd armor (for its weight and part count, still worse then a drek head on), but the g3 still has enough armor to use, and is FAR better in every other regard, better TWR, better dV, and its not like the g2 doesnt have weakspots a good player can exploit. Both are armed with 6 Ibeam-Ms and 6 Tripedo-S missiles, lightweight weapons that dont really do all that much damage, weigh under 1.5t each, and well are more of a for fun weapon.

No weapons above 2ton mass allowed period, and no more then 5 tons of total ordinance may be fired in a turn (this is to keep those 1 shotting weapons out of here, and to keep people from just firing 20 rounds at enemy ships guaranteeing destruction through sheer volume of fire). Aside from this, im open to pretty much whatever else you guys want to battle. Keep in mind though that i ONLY have 80t ships, i dont have any behemoths and i also dont have any super tiny craft like fighters. I would be fine fighting stuff that is a bit smaller/larger then what i have, but in general id prefer not to have to deal with either a massive swarm of enemies or a super massive behemoth that i most likely wont be able to even hurt.
