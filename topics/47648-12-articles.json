I have a really simple rocket with a stayputnik and a small stretchy tank and an A4 engine. The tank is filled with the recommended proportions of Kerelox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen attached to the launch clamp, it ignites and burns. I usually let it burn for a few seconds and then release the clamp. About 1s after I release the clamp the engine turns off, the rocket gets to about 30 m. Why is this happening and what can I do to correct it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried looking for information earlier in the thread but to no avail. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Tried using thrust limiter on the engine but still shuts off the engine after maybe a second.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-22T07:00:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2014 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TimeforAction\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoneyFox","CreatedById":19237,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T09:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor larger things that\u0027s fine (I always automatically add ullage rockets...); I was thinking of, for example, the WAC Corporal, the Aerobee, and other sounding rockets of that ilk. (220kN for .75 seconds booster, then a pressure-fed RFNA/Aniline sustainer in the second stage.)\u003Cp\u003EWhich reminds me: does the ullage simulation take into account how full a tank is? When a tank is very full it should require much less work to ullage it (the tank is much more propellant by volume when there\u0027s more propellant in it...). This would also solve the above problem, I think: since the RFNA/Aniline tanks are full on separation/ignition, then even massive drag shouldn\u0027t disturb the tanks much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently it doesn\u0027t. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add that factor though (if not by using realistic way to simulate that). but i guess that will make it even harder, perhaps coefficient tweaking should be done before adding this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
