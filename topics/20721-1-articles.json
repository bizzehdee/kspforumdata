Because if a heavy part so much as touches another heavy part one of them will be destroyed. However it\u0027s sort of a catch 22 because my tanks in the middle (not the spent ones) are destroyed by the exhaust from the sepatrons (little boosters)I have to point the exhaust from the little boosters at my rocket, to thrust the spent stages away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry no pics yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has a clever solution to this, please post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thevegimobil","CreatedById":42804,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T21:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHold shift and the movement keys in the vab...
