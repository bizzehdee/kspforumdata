Here I go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen building in SPH sometimes parts automatically start using radial symmetry instead of mirroring. Even pressing after pressing R and changing to mirroring it returns to radial symmetry as soon as i touch the part that started acting weirdo.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIncreasing physics time acceleration causes extra stress on crafts. Using level 4 acceleration causes crafts to disintegrate almost every time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen flying in atmosphere there is a recurring glitching in a certain interval (something between 10 sec and 1 min). During this you can see a smoke trail flying away from your plane froward, and if you were using SAS the aircraft shakes once and changes course a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESAS overreacts. With large crafts this results in self induced oscillation. When using the advanced SAS option like point to retrograde and the others the SAS uses way too much force to point into the right direction, so it always overshoots. It can\u0027t even hold vectors cause it starts to oscillate around them. Additionally, when the desired vector is \u0022far\u0022 on the nav ball, the SAS doesn\u0027t turn directly to the vector, but first in some weird direction, then starts to move to the vector like it didn\u0027t know where to turn at the beginning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen a craft has a center of lift very close to the center of mass, it can make almost instant 180 degree turns even above 400m/s without stalling or damaging itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMedium and Large landing gears are not steerable (ok, this is not a real bug, but c\u0027mon....)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe BIG-S wing strake explodes from even small reentry heat. Actually all the new space shuttle parts are more vulnerable to heat than the older wing parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe small solar panels (1x6, 2x3)can\u0027t be retracted. This was working before 1.0. If this was intentional, then sorry.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T22:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Angezerus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Parts inherit the symmetry of their parent, this is by design, set them to single placement to reset symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Yep there\u0027s larger gaps in the physics steps, and there\u0027s a warning exactly because of this, 2x is the recommended maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Yeah it\u0027s known, strutting your craft sufficiently will help though, as will reducing engine gimbal, but SAS isn\u0027t magic and it will overshoot if it lacks enough control to stop your rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Real planes do this, and fighter jets are designed to do this, they rely on computer control for stability, just keep your CoL behind your CoM whenever possible. Stalling isn\u0027t really modelled in KSP, and the damage will depend on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) This was on purpose, strangely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) Er, shouldn\u0027t be that bad, you may need to delete your physics.cfg so KSP makes a new one, also come down lower and lift the nose to get as much drag as you can, the longer you are supersonic the hotter you\u0027ll get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(7) Yep, intentional, the devs wanted to differentiate them from the boxed panels in some way, they are cheap, light, and lack a closure mechanism now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
