If you want to practice, try for Minmus instead. The gravity is significantly lower, so you can take your time with it, and gain some practice before heading to Mun. Also, even with the extra fuel it takes to reach Minmus, it tends to consume far less to land, meaning it\u0027s easier to make it home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, what is your rocket design like? A good starter moon lander could be a basic pod, a mid sized fuel tank, and a terrier LV-909 engine. Throw some landing legs on the fuel tank, add some science stuff, some solar panels, and you\u0027re set. It\u0027s not a large payload, and should be able to get into Kerbin orbit fairly easily with a small asparagus lower stage of Reliants/Swivels and an even smaller upper stage of LV-909s to get you into orbit and at least partially on your way to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick to landing is being efficient about it. Coming in low helps quite a bit, as you spend less fuel fighting gravity, so set up a low orbit by going to navigation mode, and burning retrograde at your lowest points. Just have to be careful, as the Mun is a rocky place. Sometimes you can cut an orbit down to about 5-6k or lower, but I usually prefer 9k-10k to be on the safe side. Once you\u0027ve plotted where you want to land, head to navigation, and carefully burn retrograde (use shift/ctrl instead of full burn) on the far side of it until your shallowest point is around 2k over your intended target. Time warp to a spot nearby, set the auto to retrograde, and head again to navigation map. Hit full burn (Z), and watch your angle head to your target. Once you start getting below 100 m/s, the line should become more straight, and you should ease up on the throttle until you hit close to 0 m/s. Switch to regular view, and you\u0027ll notice you\u0027re flying pretty much vertically, and heading slowly straight down. Keep autopilot on retrograde, and let it build a little speed on the way down, though sticking below 150 m/s might be a wise idea. When you start noticing the shadow of your craft, it\u0027s time to hit the gas, and if you haven\u0027t already - the landing struts. Once below 20 m/s, cut throttle and use shift/ctrl keys to bring you slowly down to 1-4 m/s. Going over 0 m/s will cause your retrograde autopilot to disengage into stability assist, so reset that if you do so. After that, landing at \u0026lt;1m/s is quite easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fishslap","CreatedById":143204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T19:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour pilot will have an ability you can activate to keep your craft retrograde while you approach. That way you will be slowing down but also cancelling out any orbital, or sideways, movement. Most of my early crashes came because I was still moving horizontally when I got close, and then it\u0060s more or less totally impossible to land. You want to be going completely straight down for the last KM or two, so all you have to worry about is lowering the speed. If you rely on the retrograde ability of the pilot then you should remember to bring some batteries and solar cells because it uses a lot of electrical energy.
