You have the hardness set to hard for every single edge. Wings will split the UV by hardness lines. When your model is loaded into Unity and then KSP, any edge set to hard won\u0027t have that edge smoothed out. It\u0027ll look very blocky. Smoothing tells Unity to \u0027round\u0027 the edge. Wings is trying to preserve that hardness in the UV by making all those faces separate entities. Which is why your UV is scattered all over the place. Soft edges in Wings are black. Hard edges are orange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of what you want on your nozzle. All of the vertical edges around the nozzle, you\u0027ll want soft, so it smooths it out and makes it look more round. At the very bottom of your nozzle, you\u0027ll want those horizontal edges to be set to hard so that it looks crisp and sharp. Also, at the very top, you\u0027ll want the edge where it joins to another part to be hard.

Choose the red cube at the top to select your entire model again then right click and select Auto-Smooth. The way it works is, any edge that has an angle of greater than a specified degree, it\u0027ll make it smooth. Any edge with a sharper angle, it\u0027ll set it to hard. The default is 60 degrees. So, an edge that has an angle of say 45 degrees will be made smooth while any edge of 90 degrees will be made hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you right click with your entire model selected to bring up the menu, to the right word Auto-Smooth is a little white box.

But, I\u0027m sure you saw the poll results. People want nice looking parts as much as they want big parts. As I keep playing around with Wings and Unity, I keep learning things. I have concluded that Rembrandt was not a master with his first painting. He may have been better than most, but not a master. As you continue making parts and learning how to unwrap and texture them, you too will gain skill. While I\u0027m still very much a noob, I have gained enough skill that I can do things like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125063-1-0-4-Maritime-Pack-Beta-0-0-14-Lights-Sound-IVA?p=2082628\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2082628\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E now without a lot of effort. And even now I look at that part and go... eh.. it\u0027s ok. Not great, but ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s my advice. Take that engine, set it aside. Take some of the other ideas you have rattling around in your head and implement those. Try an animation. Try adding particle effects and emissive effects. Play around with specular lighting. Learn how to do lights. Get some of the basics of making your part more than just a static model. If you\u0027re brave, try an IVA. If you\u0027ve lost your mind, try a wheel... and then, come back to that engine. Take a critical look at it and then you decide if it\u0027s your best quality work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and here\u0027s one trick for working with Wings and Unity and getting your .cfg nodes right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Wings, you can do two things that will make life easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Select your entire model and I think it\u0027s under the tools menu / put on ground. It\u0027ll drop it to the x,y,z zero point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Select your entire model, right click and absolute commands/move Enter 0,0,0. That too will center your model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have it in a centered location you can then click any verticies anywhere on the model and it translates into the .cfg location. For example: If you center your model and then click on a vertices at the top, where it would join a fuel tank, you can look in the upper left corner of Wings and it\u0027ll give you the x,y,z coordinates for that vertices. For example, if it\u0027s Y coordinate is 2.5 then you know in your .cfg that the node connector needs be 2.5 on the Y axis in your .cfg (if you have the part oriented in Wings correctly). This is also handy for matching parts up. One of the things I did to get all the parts on my hulls to match up was to use the Wings merge ability. I was able to get the hull and bow loaded at the same time and was then able to absolute/move the vertices to match them all up, down to 6 decimal places.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T22:26:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[Good advice]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice, I understand that that\u0027s not a... beautiful model or texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood idea, I have some ideas for a shorter, 2.5 meter, less efficient, but more efficient ASL nuke for lifters, and I\u0027ll try more advanced modeling and texturing stuff.
