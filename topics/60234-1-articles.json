It comes with an Ares I launcher that complies with the clean space act. After the seperatrons fire and push the 2nd stage back, some leftover fuel may be used to re-enter it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also offer you the \u003Cstrong\u003EOrion\u003C/strong\u003E, with 4 times the dV of the lite version, while only being half fuelled. Fly it to a station to fill it up, and you will have a craft with about 2700m/s dV. It comes with a launcher resembeling the SLS. Because it was such a small craft, I didn\u0027t bother with the tapered portion of the craft, because the partcount would be trough the roof, and the launcher would be completely overdesigned. So I opted for the simpler version, with some notes: The fairings and LES can be jettisoned at all times by pressing 2, and it is advised to stage at about 15km. This will drop the boosters and if not already gone, drop the fairings. Makes for a pretty staging event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ares I and SLS launcher are capable of putting the craft in a 75km orbit, although part of the circularisation of the SLS-launcher will have to be done with the Orion itself, but there is dV to spare in that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have both craft strapped to my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66586-Prometheus-Family-%28Launch-vehicle-subassemblies%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrometheus launchers\u003C/a\u003E, for those interested in them.
