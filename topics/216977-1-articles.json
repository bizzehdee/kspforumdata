I wanted to land, lowered the gear, was to fast, raised the gear, approached again, lowered the gear, landed. Then I took off again, raised the gear, flew a round, lowered the gear and watched both wheel nacelles simultaneously drop from the plane. I ditched the plane in the water successfully, but decided that it was not usual that the gear fell off. I tried it again, and hoped the gear wouldn\u0027t fall off, and it didn\u0027t for two cycles as above, but then after the third it fell off again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gear was simply attached to the side in mirror mode and then turned by 90 degrees, as it is quite common to do for a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuess I will give it another shot in .3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-01T16:55:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2023 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by dr.phees\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T12:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this too.\u00A0 But also with \u0027Goliath\u0027 engines, so it\u0027s apparently not confined to undercarriage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T19:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, as long as the front does stay on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
