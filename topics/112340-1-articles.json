So I took my first Mun lander with a single-seat pod, added a probe core and radio antenna, and launched. Launch didn\u0027t go quite as efficiently as last time, and by the time I got to Mun orbit I knew I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to get home.

I dropped the rescue pod about a kilometre away and EVAd the kerbal in out of the cold.

That\u0027s nowhere near enough for Mun night even after shutting down all non-essential systems. I considered trying to launch retrograde and burn the last of my fuel in a suborbital hop, but would not have had enough to get back in to sunlight and successfully land again, so poor Barcus hunkered down for a cold night while an expensive and hastily-prepared rescue mission burned a very inefficient trajectory trying to get there in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u0027t get there in time, touching down nearby a couple of hours too late. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Sorry Barcus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chd","CreatedById":78680,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T04:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, I also play with revert turned off, because doing otherwise seems to make it pointless have respawn off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I actually strand someone in orbit around the sun, I make it a goal to eventually rescue them.

As a general rule its not a good idea to tip your craft over. I made to nacell arms that I use as radials that I put my landing gear at the end of, the craft is hard to tip. You can always rescue an abandoned pilot and bring them home. If you have McJeb put it on a capsule and send it up empty to fetch stranded players. I killed Bill in a mission to get skill up engineering, when he was respawned he had skilled up two levels, next time I kill him sooner, lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take the game too seriously, if on your first moon landing your pilot survives but your ship is lunar paper weight, meh, consider it good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T02:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn my current save, I\u0027ve killed half a dozen already.
