They are (almost) in the obvious positions IE phased around the Kerbin every 60 degrees or so. They\u0027ve moved a few times. Not over time, but on loading the game. I currently have 4 probes within 10 dgrees and 2 probes hugging each other on the other side of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Satellites such as Minmus and the Mun have moved, but this is less of a problem as I saturated the moon\u0027s with satellites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, I\u0027m unable to ensure coverage for where I want to go. Apart from changing the save file, can anyone help? To be honest I suspect this is a game problem, not hte mod. Maybe I should test a vanilla install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a vid of the first time it happened when I only had 3 probes.
