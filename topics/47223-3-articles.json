That\u0027s because it\u0027s based off of the PB-ION engine, not the RTG, which needs 15 Ec/s at full power. If 15 Ec/s is an average Hall Effect thruster(which it looks like), which are average of 1.5-2 kW, then my ratio is fine. If you say 1kW = 1 Ec makes sense based on the RTG, and something else for the lights, then... well, haha, yeah it\u0027s not very easy to reconcile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind changing the power ratings though.

The small model will require 100kW and produce 2kN of thrust at 8000 Isp, the larger 5kN at 3000 Isp (500 kW). Technically, the PIT can be geared between these two values by varying the pulse rate, so I\u0027m taking both ends of the spectrum for the two units. It can be used with a variety of fuels, I\u0027ll probably use argon so that I have at least 2 engines with each fuel type. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/PIT_065.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PIT_065.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/PIT_125.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PIT_125.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first go at a pulsed plasma thruster. It\u0027s actually 4 units driven by a set of 4 capacitors, and would be an electric RCS unit with about 1500 Isp and 25% the thrust of the stock unit. It would also be unique as the fuel is solid and contained inside the unit - no refuelling. Of course it would also require some Ec to run (0.7/s in theory). This is a problem because the stock ModuleRCS module doesn\u0027t allow multiple propellants. I\u0027ll find a way though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also playing around with adding argon and hydrogen as fuels for the engines. Here\u0027s some ideas for 2.5 m tanks (and a radial hydrogen). I\u0027m thinking that argon will be cylindrical, xenon will be capsule-shaped, and hydrogen will be spherical... for continuity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/argon_25.png\u0022 alt=\u0022argon_25.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/hydrogen_25.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hydrogen_25.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nertea.the3rdage.net/ksp/hydrogen_radial.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hydrogen_radial.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably need a bunch more tanks, argon and hydrogen in 1.25 and 0.65m sizes.

It would be a real shame to get rid of that awesome spherical side-mounted one just because it\u0027s not capsule shaped. Due to the properties of the RL shapes, putting Xenon in a sphere (and Argon in a capsule for example) offers no negative effects in terms of pressure distribution. If the tank types are clearly marked to indicate their type, I don\u0027t think people will have issue with fuels not being in the correct shape. Btw, what are the current thoughts on colours and marking?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
