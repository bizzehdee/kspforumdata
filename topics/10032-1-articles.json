But if it stays straight its actually pretty simple to fly. I basically just started with a simple launcher and lander design, and kept adding more boosters and tweaking it so it would work. My original intention was just to land the little rocket on top, but I was able to land with 2 extra stages. I don\\\u0027t know the exact numbers or how efficient this design is, its probably terrible, but you can easily reach kerbol escape velocity with it.\n\nHeres some more pics of the full rocket itself.
