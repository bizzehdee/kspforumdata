I know its possible (to a degree) with infernal robotics but the transition is so awkward that planes don\u0027t tend to survive a transition very well.\n\nAircraft use variable geometry wings to allow high performance at both supersonic and subsonic speeds by changing the wing shape. This works because a low aspect ratio swept wing aircraft has lower drag and therefore is better at high speeds and a high aspect ratio wing provides more lift reducing stall speed and improving efficiency but greatly increasing drag.\n\nNotable aircraft examples are the B1-b lancer and F-14 tomcat which transition their wing angles to improve range and allow shorter runway takeoff and landings but let them also fly at supersonic speeds.\n\nI have no modding or modeling experience. If I did I would make them myself. \n\nPlease."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:02:13Z","Content":"Someone actually tried it and made a custom wing using IR for it, but as far as I know, while it is flyable, it also have a host of problems.

If you want to see how to pass initial parameters to FAR then check either of the procedural wing mods; updating it during flight I don\u0027t know about, because I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s done it yet.\n\nThe problem with IR is basically weak joints and unsuitable models, I\u0027m fairly sure both could be solved with a custom wing glove model."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T05:46:19Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110061-Parts-Time-for-Variable-Sweep-Wings!-Powered-by-Infernal-Robotics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110061-Parts-Time-for-Variable-Sweep-Wings!-Powered-by-Infernal-Robotics)"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T06:20:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A simpler mod would just change the lift and drag components of the wing when you clicked the button to transition the wings as it played the animation.\n\u003E extended drag = .2\n\u003E \n\u003E swept drag = .125\n\u003E \n\u003E extended lift = 2\n\u003E \n\u003E swept lift = 1.25\n\u003E \n\u003E If someone would write the plugin for it I would be more than happy to model and animate the wings.\n\nThat\u0027s like a five minutes mod to code.
