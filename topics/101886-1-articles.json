I know its possible (to a degree) with infernal robotics but the transition is so awkward that planes don\u0027t tend to survive a transition very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft use variable geometry wings to allow high performance at both supersonic and subsonic speeds by changing the wing shape. This works because a low aspect ratio swept wing aircraft has lower drag and therefore is better at high speeds and a high aspect ratio wing provides more lift reducing stall speed and improving efficiency but greatly increasing drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotable aircraft examples are the B1-b lancer and F-14 tomcat which transition their wing angles to improve range and allow shorter runway takeoff and landings but let them also fly at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no modding or modeling experience. If I did I would make them myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T19:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone actually tried it and made a custom wing using IR for it, but as far as I know, while it is flyable, it also have a host of problems.
