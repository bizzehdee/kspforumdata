For the time being, I\u0027m kinda grateful. There have been some unbelievably choppy skittering moments in KSPs rather recent past releases. They\u0027ve made huge strides in playability (FPS, physics CPU / GPU load).

And if someone spent a large amount of time creating a work around, I\u0027d hate to see their work become redundant when in another six months SQUAD implements an entirely new and even more efficient way of handling multiple instances of physics events. Hypothetically speaking of course. It would be cool to enjoy something like that in the mean time.

To get these satellites working around the clock. Triggering scan mode when a particular craft is active is a good idea. I like that.

And if we did get multiple crafts rendered and all physics\u0027d up, would everyones computer handle it? I know many of us are enthusiasts and could handle quite a lot.

It takes about ten seconds to find your first deposit. (Yes, I have actually done test runs and timed this.) Even scanning on a highly inclined orbit, it doesn\u0027t take more than a minute to find a nice equatorial deposit on suitable terrain.
