Getting used to 1.0 but a few things seem a bit off and I dunno if it\u0027s just me missing something or what so I\u0027ll let you guys decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince .90 my game has suffered a huge FPS drop when I am looking at a reasonably complex ship or space station. I am talking about ships that I could use with no visible slowdown and now it\u0027s like I am running a pc from the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0 I couldn\u0027t fold away my solar panels on a shuttle I built this week. Could always retract them before but now after deployment the retract option simply isn\u0027t there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the new re-entry heat is more realistic but I couldn\u0027t land my shuttle without it exploding. There are no heatshields for the underside of the fuselage or wings so they just burn up. Am I missing something silly here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elastly I notice that throttling up with RCS turned on also burns up monopropellant. It never used to and I am not using the monoprop engines. Just the RCS blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I still love the game and I am not here complaining but I\u0027d love to figure these problems out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Ronnleuk, no ideas on the FPS issue, can you post your logs please, see the support stickies for info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unboxed solar panels are one shot now, to differentiate them from the more expensive model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry is possible but yeah it\u0027s harder, try airbrakes or drag chutes to help slow you down so you\u0027re not burning for as long, also a shallower approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS is a bit badly tuned so will keep firing the RCS, best used sparingly or turn RCS off and use other means to stabilize the craft until you\u0027re in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ronnieuk","CreatedById":141997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply. Your probably right about the re entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy monoprop is getting used while I fire the main engines. It\u0027s not the SAS trying to keep the ship stable it\u0027s as if the RCS blocks think that they are engines. Like if I push shift to throttle up it throttles up the rockets/jets and any rear facing RCS nozzles to push me forward. If I switch RCS off then it doesn\u0027t do it but with bigger ships I use RCS quite a bit because reaction wheels are sluggish. I used about 1000 RCS fuel without realising last night just by adjusting my orbit using my main rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, only the OMS \u0022Puff\u0022 engine is supposed to do that, not the RCS blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible the settings.cfg is corrupt or from .90, so needs to be deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ronnieuk","CreatedById":141997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably better to do a clean install.

I am averaging 15 FPS looking at a medium sized station built from around 6 of the big orange tanks and a core in Kerbin orbit at 160k I get about the same FPS in any location with any ship that is a little bigger than basic.
