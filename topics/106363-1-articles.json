Getting used to 1.0 but a few things seem a bit off and I dunno if it\u0027s just me missing something or what so I\u0027ll let you guys decide.\n\nSince .90 my game has suffered a huge FPS drop when I am looking at a reasonably complex ship or space station. I am talking about ships that I could use with no visible slowdown and now it\u0027s like I am running a pc from the past.\n\nIn 1.0 I couldn\u0027t fold away my solar panels on a shuttle I built this week. Could always retract them before but now after deployment the retract option simply isn\u0027t there.\n\nI know the new re-entry heat is more realistic but I couldn\u0027t land my shuttle without it exploding. There are no heatshields for the underside of the fuselage or wings so they just burn up. Am I missing something silly here?\n\nlastly I notice that throttling up with RCS turned on also burns up monopropellant. It never used to and I am not using the monoprop engines. Just the RCS blocks.\n\nAnyway I still love the game and I am not here complaining but I\u0027d love to figure these problems out."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:48:47Z","Content":"Hi Ronnleuk, no ideas on the FPS issue, can you post your logs please, see the support stickies for info.\n\nThe unboxed solar panels are one shot now, to differentiate them from the more expensive model.\n\nRe-entry is possible but yeah it\u0027s harder, try airbrakes or drag chutes to help slow you down so you\u0027re not burning for as long, also a shallower approach.\n\nSAS is a bit badly tuned so will keep firing the RCS, best used sparingly or turn RCS off and use other means to stabilize the craft until you\u0027re in space.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Ronnieuk","CreatedById":141997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:57:31Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply. Your probably right about the re entry. \n\nMy monoprop is getting used while I fire the main engines. It\u0027s not the SAS trying to keep the ship stable it\u0027s as if the RCS blocks think that they are engines. Like if I push shift to throttle up it throttles up the rockets/jets and any rear facing RCS nozzles to push me forward. If I switch RCS off then it doesn\u0027t do it but with bigger ships I use RCS quite a bit because reaction wheels are sluggish. I used about 1000 RCS fuel without realising last night just by adjusting my orbit using my main rocket engine."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:33:10Z","Content":"Hmm, only the OMS \u0022Puff\u0022 engine is supposed to do that, not the RCS blocks.\n\nIt\u0027s possible the settings.cfg is corrupt or from .90, so needs to be deleted."},{"CreatedByName":"Ronnieuk","CreatedById":141997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:22:21Z","Content":"Maybe\n\nProbably better to do a clean install.

I put mechjeb on too since I have the mechjeb part on my big ships which give me the fps slowdown and they wouldn\u0027t load without the mod installed. But Vanilla other than MJ. I am averaging 15 FPS looking at a medium sized station built from around 6 of the big orange tanks and a core in Kerbin orbit at 160k I get about the same FPS in any location with any ship that is a little bigger than basic. My game used to run so well I never saw any visible slowdown even on my biggest lifters with 700 parts but since .90 it\u0027s been like this. It\u0027s really spoiling the fun for me.
