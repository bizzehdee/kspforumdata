It\u0027s not a constant but it could be used in several areas that need lots of power. Not to mention batteries are multi purpose. So, once you have the energy resource the main problem may presumable start to be removed. And there may be stupidly simple ways to do it. Maybe some of the tech could be utilized for emergency or unusual circumstances. I was forgoing this, but if you could break down hydrogen, could you use it to make a battery on the ship? Even on small scale the production capacity could work for repairs in case of a catastrophic failure hypothetically. Or other edge circumstances. Having the ability to repair/make something high tech in a low tech environment could be useful. That is a very distinct issue for a boat. It can go from one to the other and for longer and with worse extremities than other transport methods. Except planes. And they have greater limitation. So, they are ideal for such tech emerging potentially. The only thing more extreme would be subs or a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://patents.google.com/patent/US7384619B2/en\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://patents.google.com/patent/US7384619B2/en\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main proposed method I\u0027m seeing is breaking the water down as much as possible before hitting it with the plasma. this is already done on a ship a lot. And there is lots of room in a ship to do this depending on scale or method. Especially if it\u0027s not in the cargo hold and for alternative reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, in the extremity, wouldn\u0027t a ship packed full of cargo or a cargo container packed full be easier to use the electrolyses method even as proposed. It would have minimal air/space to fill with gas. So, the more full the cargo the less of a problem it should be. And the smaller the equipment used. There are ways to minimize the cost. Say if you use one piece of equipment to run over each part instead of having expensive probes on each cargo container. Or as the items leave the cargo hold. Even if it\u0027s not needed for grain now it might be later or for more general cargo. if it goes out a conveyor and probed and cleaned as each package goes that could be useful for redundancy. Or if not later maybe cheaper than the port doing it. It also makes more ports available as you don\u0027t need a speciality port depending on circumstances. Especially if things were to get worse somehow. Or other circumstances make it useful. It\u0027s cheaper to pay one ships cargo crew than all other ports hypothetically. Maybe. Depends circumstantially.

The boat is spending a lot of energy to keep that speed, and if it pulls all of that energy out of drag or friction in any way, then it will immediately stop and not be able to keep going while it does that. You can absolutely take a small amount of energy from that motion using whatever system you\u0027d like, but that\u0027s definitely going to slow the boat down and the engines will have to compensate by burning a little more fuel.
