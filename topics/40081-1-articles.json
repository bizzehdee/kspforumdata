When it was discovered that the lights didn\u0027t actually work, they were removed, and it was repurposed as a training aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 450 units of LiquidFuel and two circular air intakes. These are shared between two Basic Jet Engines, which allow it to accelerate rather fast on the ground, though it won\u0027t be winning any altitude contests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Delta Wing, Swept Wing, and Tail Fin on each side allow it to not be a brick full of fuel, and for control, it has a Small Control Surface on each side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tail, mounted between the engines, has a Tail Fin with a Small Control Surface sticking straight up, and a landing wheel on the underside. Just below the air intakes, there are two wheels, mounted in a way that causes the aircraft to point slightly above the horizon when landed on a good runway. The nose has a single wheel, which serves as a shock absorber for when the plane tips on landing, which does happen in high-speed landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there is a single RTG, mounted along the middle fuel tank, to power the fridge in the cockpit. Studies have shown that pilots tend to be less careful when their ice cream melts mid-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur album here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/CxY1U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/CxY1U\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yok66eb15dzeex/Seeker%20Mk7.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3yok66eb15dzeex/Seeker%20Mk7.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take off:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Turn the engines on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Throttle up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Wait until you\u0027re going fast enough to lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Raise the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo land:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Please, tell me in excruciating detail exactly what you think is wrong with it so that I can make it better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
