You can get from low Minmus orbit to surface and back to orbit on one EVA pack. It\u0027s not even just a Scott Manley stunt, I\u0027ve done it myself. (Then again I fly with almost as much skill as Scott Manley.) You should be able to get to Gilly orbit and back to surface several times on one EVA pack."}]}
