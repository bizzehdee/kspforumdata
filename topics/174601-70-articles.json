Plus, over the last thirty years we have entered an age of hyper-legal liability.\u00A0 Industry and science depend on a trial and error existence. The judicial system, when it acts properly, can act as the restraint to keep untested or unsafe technology from being introduced in society on a large-scale. But that\u0027s when it works. When it doesn\u0027t work, it can stop the introduction of new technologies fairly quickly before any real meaningful data can be gained.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI compare green energy and the conversion to it as I would to general aviation at the turn of the last century. In its early days, aviation was a novelty and commercial aviation was still in its infancy in the early days. It was expensive to fly and only the wealthy could afford to do it. Plane crashes were common and on both sides of the Atlantic, the general public attitude was one of indifference because the common person thought the wealthy \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E the risks and were willing to take them. It wasn\u0027t until World War I that the potential of aviation was truly unleashed by France, Prussia, Great Britain, and later in the war, the United States.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the Great War, commercial aviation\u00A0 - and the use of aviation for mail - saw significant development. Much of its success was based off the failures and lessons learned from military aviation (this is often the case with technology and scientific discovery). Larger aircraft and aircraft designed for longer distances became commonplace and the price of commercial air travel decreased to where the middle-middle class and upper-middle class could afford air travel. Each accident, each plane crash, and each \u0022mishap\u0022 resulted in lawsuits as more \u0022common\u0022 people became impacted by faulty designs, inexperienced pilots, flight crews, and mechanics, and a lack of understanding of how aircraft perform in less-than-ideal weather. But the lawsuits did not destroy the commercial air industry - it actually \u003Cem\u003Eenhanced\u003C/em\u003E it to the extent to where aircraft designers and engineers began anticipating worst-case scenarios in newer designs. I could continue this but it would become a lecture in the development of commercial aviation\u0027s continued development, both during and after WWII. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWhat we see now is runaway litigation that does not enhance technological development but impedes it. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*****\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe consumer will have to be shown, much like today\u0027s commercial air consumer, that green energy cars, whether it is a hydrogen cell, an all-electric rechargeable car, or even a\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/149090-nasas-cold-fusion-tech-could-put-a-nuclear-reactor-in-every-home-car-and-plane\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E fusion-powered car\u003C/a\u003E, are safe, reliable, relatively hassle-free, and cost-effective. While the European consumer will most surely be easily swayed to convert to an electric or hybrid vehicle, Americans are more pessimistic for a variety of reasons to include frequent power outages during storms and other natural disasters, insufficient electrical generation on the west coast to meet consumer demands, and the vulnerability of the American power grid. Mandating (or demanding) that American consumer go out and buy a \u0022green car\u0022 will only lead to resistance and increased reluctance to buy an alternative fuel vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I do a lot of traveling each year. Four times a year, I go to various places as part of my \u0022side gig\u0022 and cannot fly because of my chronic hemiplegic migraines (airplane flights increase my risk of stroke and cause me a lot of pain). So, I drive myself. And often, where I am heading exceeds the operational range of rechargeable electric vehicles.\u00A0 I don\u0027t have 8 to 10 hours to wait for the car to get a full charge with the schedule I have to keep. A hybrid is preferred but because of their costs, I can\u0027t run out and buy one until the price comes down more to my price range. If I could find one of the \u003Cem\u003Efusion cars of the future\u003C/em\u003E that generated its own energy, YES, I\u0027d drive one of them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, each county has its own mass transit system but very few are as efficient as their European counterparts. In fact, where I live, to use mass transportation to go 6 miles (9.65 Km) from my house to where I work would take me four hours by bus (even being disabled, I can walk the six miles in about an hour and fifteen minutes) and would cost me $1.50 for each of the three bus changes (that would be about 1.27\u20AC for each bus). The buses are never on time and are often as late as twenty minutes. And yes, if one bus is late there is a good chance you\u0027ll miss the next bus and will have to wait for it to come back around. This violates the three rules of mass transportation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt must be easy to use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt must be cost efficient for the rider.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt must be dependable and on-time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not trying to be difficult about the transportation thing. But I think we also need to remember that when it comes to mass transit and alternative fueled vehicles, we are a long way to developing even decent working solutions for those who fall in the middle and lower classes. And we certainly can\u0027t say \u003Cem\u003Ethen you don\u0027t deserve to drive, use mass transit \u003C/em\u003Esince that may not be a viable option for people trying to get by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-17T01:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224020850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221629149994\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse mass transit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt still boggles my mind that there is no bus service at all to the industrial park where I work.

The price of crude is set by two things , OPEC (a cartel of oil producing nations) and demand. The last four years in the United States, we witnessed gasoline fuels drop to thirty year lows for a very good reason - demand was low and for the first time since the late 1960s, the United States was the world\u0027s leading energy exporting nation. The open and mostly free commodity market dictated the price of crude oil.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened after January is \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#16a085;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Epolitically related, so I cannot go into a lot of detail\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. I will summarize it by saying that the amount of federal lands available for oil exploration was greatly reduced, land leases and oil permits, including off-shore permits were cancelled. Pipeline projects were cancelled, too. This reversed the trend and now reduced the global supply of oil which had been made of Mexican, Canadian, United States, and OPEC member nations. With the U.S., the former leading producing nation now out of the equation, OPEC became the new leader in global crude oil production. And unlike the United States, they set the price at $50 per barrel almost immediately. And the price has steadily increased since then. Many of the OPEC nations use crude oil to shape the foreign policy of other nations - like it or not. And I cannot get any further in this part of the conversation \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#16a085;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebecause it becomes geopolitical\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, saying that oil companies are actively trying to keep the world dependent on fossil fuel technology is ignoring basic free market principles. Whether you like Elon Musk or not, he has done more for electric cars than any of the competitive car manufacturers. He has forced Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagon, and others to reassess how they see the electric car. Before Tesla, the car companies were treating electric cars as a fad market, much like they do with muscle cars. But now, they see the value and what the customer is willing to pay and are attempting to adjust to consumer buying trends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022big oil companies\u0022 are doing the same thing. BP Oil, Mobil-Exxon, Shell, and Citgo, as well as other oil companies, have had research divisions working on alternative fuels for the past 40 years. These energy companies understand that if they do not adapt to the changing consumer demands, they will not be viable as companies in the future. Corporations exist to make money; a corporation that cannot sell a product will not survive (Economic Darwinism). They are also looking into the use of other combustible liquids which can replace crude oil distillates and derived fuel formulas but can still give the same performance in internal combustion engines used today. This is wise foresight on the part of the oil corporations for one major reason - even if crude oil production was globally outlawed tomorrow, there\u0027s a large percentage of the world\u0027s population that would not be able to afford an electric vehicle and cannot rely on mass transit to get them to where they need to go. To say they should just do without for the sake of the planet is depraved indifference to the condition of the individual - something I cannot justify or ignore. My grandmother\u0027s brother, who remained in France after WWI, had a tattoo given to him during his time at Auschwitz which shows me why we must never forget the condition of the individual in favor of the demands of the masses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy sector, \u0022big oil\u0022 included are innovators as much as producers. The energy industry does change to meet consumer demands and expectations, much like the cell phone industry. Just as the cell phones we use today are a far cry from the early cell phones of the late 1980s, the way petroleum is distilled to produce gasoline has changed. And moving forward, it will be a combination of the auto industry AND the energy companies working together to transition the world from petroleum based fuels to more green variants, including electric, hybrid vehicles, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-19T12:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoogled \u0022anonymous\u0022 reversed: \u0022suomynona\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot a bunch of serious links like this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.names.org/n/suomynona/about\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.names.org/n/suomynona/about\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Col style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAccording to a user from Greece, the name Suomynona is of\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.names.org/lists/by-origin/egyptian/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022color:#114fa4;\u0022\u003EEgyptian origin\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eand means \u0022Suomynona was a name assigned to females in Egypt during the Hellenistic period.

Because, again, the purpose of business is continuing to make money. And if the tech changes, adapting to it is the way to go. Saying that the reason we don\u0027t run the world on renewables is some oil company conspiracy is tin foil hat level of nonsense. They are part of the reason why environmental regs aren\u0027t as up-to-date as they should be, and that puts us a little behind, but it\u0027s not the main chunk of the problem. The main chunk is that this kind of conversion costs\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot of money\u003C/em\u003E. And no business is going to invest into it without a promise of return. As the technologies mature and risks go down, investments go up. And this simply takes time. We are hitting the acceleration part of the S-curve, but we\u0027re still decades out from it taking full effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should be happening to speed it along is a lot more investment and pressure from governments, which might include taxing fossil fuel companies to finance said investments. And sure, businesses lobby against any such regulation, but that only works because the public is indifferent. The truth is, an average person doesn\u0027t give a rat\u0027s behind that they are being slowly boiled alive. And that ain\u0027t going to change. The only reason this isn\u0027t necessarily a doomsday scenario is because it is economically self-limiting. As more fossil fuels are extracted, the costs will go up. We didn\u0027t invent off-shore drilling and fracking out of boredom.\u00A0Impending environmental catastrophes will only make it more expensive. Renewable infrastructure will be cheaper in the long run and can even survive collapse of global trade, unlike the fossil fuel infrastructure. So eventually we\u0027ll be switching to renewables. It\u0027s just a question of whether it happens before environmental change leads to global economic collapse and subsequent loss of countless lives or as a consequence of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-28T12:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224025192\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630149476\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBusinesses are in business of making money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a reply to say I read what you wrote and understand and even agree with a lot of it. I personally see a bigger picture through many years of research into what is already available and an awareness of inventions and processes that have been bought up and disappeared by the fossil fuel companies so as to to not be competed against and then pull them back out at the vital time as if they invented them themselves when the need becomes undeniable. But I came to an agreement when this was first debated, not to continue debating, as this was not the place for it.
