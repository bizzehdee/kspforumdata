I\u0027m in version 1.0.2 with Mechjeb the only mod. I\u0027m using windows 8.1, with\u00A0lots of memory and graphics muscle. For some reason\u00A0when Autopilot is engaged or any Maneuver Node is executed, the vehicle will not warp to the node. Even though the aiming \u0027bar-V-dot\u0027 centers on the blue target icon.\u00A0Also, when it does eventually reach\u00A0a node, the vehicle simply passes the node without throttling up. And yes, every warp enabling\u00A0button is lit. Any thoughts? \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spilled Vial","CreatedById":153712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T16:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour MechJeb version must be compatible with your KSP version, or MechJeb will not work.
