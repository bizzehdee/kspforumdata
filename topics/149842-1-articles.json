Start by assuming Kerbin isn\u0027t there. What velocity do you need to be going at Kerbin\u0027s orbit, to reach Duna\u0027s orbit (pick Duna\u0027s periapsis, apoapsis or something in between, it shouldn\u0027t make much difference)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. You can calculate the difference between this velocity and Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity (which is about 9.3km/s). That gives you the velocity you need to be going, relative to Kerbin, at the edge of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Based on this velocity and the size of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, you can calculate the hyperbolic excess velocity. This may be in the link I gave. If not, try Wikipedia. I got it from one of the two!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Then, by reversing the calculation, based on the hyperbolic excess velocity from 3, you can determine the velocity at, say, a periapsis of 100km above Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Finally, find the difference between the velocity calculated in step 4 and the velocity you need to be going at in your circular 100km orbit of Kerbin. That gives you the magnitude of your ejection burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can perform a similar set of calculations at Duna\u0027s sphere of influence to find out how fast you would be going at periapsis, and thus how much delta-v you would need to go from a fly-by into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answers should be pretty close to those given by delta-v maps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the same steps for other bodies, but as eccentricities and inclinations get further from 0, you may not be able to assume ideal orbits.

I\u0027m typing this on a phone, so this\u0027ll be a bit brief (no formulae, sorry), but here\u0027s my calculation of Kerbin-Duna. Hopefully any differences will jump out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. An eccentric orbit around Kerbol (GM = 1.7233*10^18) with a periapsis (altitude) of 1.3338*10^10m and an apoapsis (altitude) of 2.0726*10^10m (Duna\u0027s semimajoraxis, less the radius of Kerbol) has a velocity at periapsis of 10228m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A circular orbit around Kerbol (GM = 1.7233*10^18) with a constant radius of 1.36*10^10m has a velocity of 9285m/s. The difference between the two velocities is 943m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Now switch to caring about Kerbin (GM = 3.5316*10^12). To be going 943m/s at the edge of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence (84159286m from centre of planet) gives a hyperbolic excess velocity of 897m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. To get a hyperbolic excess velocity of 897m/s, at an altitude of 100km (radius 700000m) you must be going about 3300m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. A circular orbit of Kerbin with an altitude of 100km has a velocity of 2246m/s. Therefore the ejection burn would be about 1050m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a middle of the road figure - you can get a lower value if you aim for Duna\u0027s periapsis.
