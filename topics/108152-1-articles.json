Anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I last played KSP, somewhere around the time before 0.90 hit, didn\u0027t play that version (no particular reason, just wasn\u0027t feeling KSP\u0027y). Had already planned to play a bit again, but couldn\u0027t get all my \u0022Wanna have\u0022-mods together, so I took even more time... Watched a little bit of EnterElysium\u0027s new KSP-series, started putting my mods together and while doing that, stumbled across the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EElcano Challenge\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich... well, hits the nail.

I experimented quite a lot with free-hanging/spinning dual-wheel suspensions (similar to some NASA rovers), but that didn\u0027t come to fruition. I also experimented with some IR-gimmicks, but in the end... McMun I is actually completely stock, if we ignore the fact I used Tweakscale for some parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe driver has a nice panorama cockpit, followed by the crew\u0027s cabin (I really hope that\u0027s large enough...). Behind that, wedged between to batteries, are two ore drills and a small ISRU. Then there is the Ore tank, some fuel cells and some actual LFO-tanks (just the small ones). And of course, another reaction wheel for those pesky jumps that are bound to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, forgot one mod.

It actually loves it so badly that the entire back-end disassembles itself if you just look at the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMcMun II was designed to be a little more... \u0022homey\u0022 with two Lander Cans instead of one Hitchhiker. It was also the first McMun to be armored (to protect against those nasty jumps)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMcMun III was just a larger version of McMun I, with two additional Ore-tanks at the front to act as counterweight... Didn\u0027t help, the McMun III also loved doing wheelies of doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMcMun IV never really saw the light of day because of a bug/missing feature in IR-Sequencer, or because I was too dumb to figure it out.

The Munar Circumnavigator Mark V, also nicknamed the \u0022Mun-ster Truck\u0022 (not my idea, honestly!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought, the biggest issue on Mun - or one of them - are all the small bumps in the terrain, once you pick up some speed. And what better to negate uneven terrain if not large wheels? After some fiddling around (there was actually a smaller version that used 1x1 plates), I ended up with this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uj60F4q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Uj60F4q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe length of the vehicle combined with KSP\u0027s wobble actually helps in this case. The chassis deforms a little, meaning usually all 4 wheels have contact with the ground. Two large SAS-wheels in the center house the batteries and help control the craft, both while steering and jumping. To smaller SAS-units at the back and at the front are added for ... actually more speed. This craft also likes wheelies, but a lot less than it\u0027s predecessors. 9 Ion drives at the back will hopefully help accelerate the craft past 20 m/s (the point where wheelies happen with this craft). That is yet untested, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the exception of IR-Rotatrons to make the wheels actually work as wheels, this craft is stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Mun-ster Truck\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1 Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 7.6m Height\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 11.5m Width\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 21.1m Length\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 197 Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 28.2 tons of pure awesomeness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: Do not drive on the KSC-runway, it will explode!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T16:18:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cy-one\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cy-one","CreatedById":74874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDay One, 50km: Leaving the crater.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed the Mun-ster Truck in one of the large, Kerbin-facing craters.
