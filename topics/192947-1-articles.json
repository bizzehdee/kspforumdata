Nerva has a stupid low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and specific power. The Timberwind NTRs were never demoed, and their values\u00A0were likely exaggerated to garner additional funding (not that that helped in the end). Minmag Orion testing\u00A0was inconclusive, used non-fissile materials, and may\u00A0be incompatible with maglevs from magnetic interference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf development and deployment time is ignored for \u0022Now\u0022, as long as the technology has been demonstrated, than dynamic orbital rings are the best. They can be made with current materials (no nanotubes, graphene, room temp superconductors, fusion or anything like that), only need power (which they could easily make on sight with solar), can take several megatons to orbit per day, kilotons per trip, and all for a few cents per kilo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this

In anycase, there are issues with large loads for current maglev systems (which is why they aren\u0027t used for freight) which would exclude their use in spaceflight for everything but smallsat launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor demonstrated, but not flight proven technologies;\u00A0a superheavy chemical rocket like the original ITS will still have the highest LEO and GTO capacity, a laser thermal rocket would have the highest payload fraction and cost per kilogram, an airbreathing\u00A0spaceplane TSTO would probably have the most throughput.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrion was never demoed with nuclear weapons, and was also deemed unfit as a first stage (sound reverberations from the first explosion would shred the craft). Nerva has a stupid low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and specific power. The Timberwind NTRs were never demoed, and their values\u00A0were likely exaggerated to garner additional funding (not that that helped in the end). Minmag Orion testing\u00A0was inconclusive, used non-fissile materials, and may\u00A0be incompatible with maglevs from magnetic interference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf development and deployment time is ignored for \u0022Now\u0022, as long as the technology has been demonstrated, than dynamic orbital rings are the best. They can be made with current materials (no nanotubes, graphene, room temp superconductors, fusion or anything like that), only need power (which they could easily make on sight with solar), can take several megatons to orbit per day, kilotons per trip, and all for a few cents per kilo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223767129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192947\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586201183\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best we could do now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith some development a lofted boosted fission Mini-Mag Orion is probably doable.

External pulsed propulsion like Orion, Minmag, or Epstine-like torchdrives are the only drives capable of lifting such a behemoth and waste a lot of energy, with 50-80% of the energy being wasted in cosine losses alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a 100 kt craft, 50% efficient engine, 8 minute continuous burn of 10 km/s\u00A0to orbit. 10^16 Joules of energy is needed (equivalent to 2.4 Mt of TNT or 100 hiroshima bombs), half of which is waste heat,\u00A0with a power of 1.33\u00A0PW (100 x primary global energy consumption). Regardless of whether or not such a vehicle launches directly from the surface or not, it will leave a nuclear fireball behind it and likely knock out all electronics on the hemisphere it launches from. It will also probably supercharge the van-allen belts, which isn\u0027t a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where Orbital rings excel over any rocket. An orbital ring can only lift a modest 1 kt (only a small freight train) at a time per each of the hundreds of cables connecting it to the ground. As an orbital ring is stationary relative to the surface, and lifting can be done by electric motors, much less energy is needed to get payload to space. A\u00A0100 kt payload send to 200 km over 100 trips would only need 10^14 joules , which is a lot less, but still a lot. The real kicker is that less than 5% of the energy would be waste heat, and instead of this energy being released in intentionally uncontained nuclear explosions over a matter a minutes, it would be as friction in the motors which could be dissipated as non-ionizing energy directionally\u00A0into space over several hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis only gets the vehicle into space, and not orbit though. This is where the orbital ring also excels. An orbital ring is well... a ring encompassing the entire planet, this makes it the perfect place to magnetically accelerate a craft in the natural vacuum of space up to orbital or even escape velocities, again with negligible amounts of waste heat that can be safely dissipated. You could even have a series of orbital rings at increasing heights, different inclinations and\u00A0eccentricities, or around other planets, to receive the craft and send it to its next destination. Orbital rings also have the added bonus of being incredibly good for intraplanetary (earth based) transportation, being able to between any two points on earth in an hour for the price of a train ticket, and unlike starship, could link directly to city centres or rural areas (no supersonic booms, or launch pads, only a train terminal)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real question is why launch from Earth at all. Even star trek builds their large ships in space, with only shuttles for surface-orbit transportation. In this case, the orbital ring is still superior. Take up the pieces individually (or from the moon) and construct in on the ring itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as interplanetary and\u00A0interstellar travel, beamed plasma propulsion (like Magbeam) or laser propulsion are the way to go. No on board propellant would be needed to achieve speeds between 10% and 50% of c, several times faster than what bussard fusion ramjets could do if proton-proton chain fusion wasn\u0027t a distant pipedream. This is more than fast enough to warrant hyper-responsive point defence systems to track,\u00A0ionize, and deflect\u00A0specks of dust hundreds of kilometers ahead of the craft in a matter of milliseconds to avoid becoming a relativistic scrap heap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main difference between laser and plasma propulsion is that plasma can provide greater acceleration for less energy, but would need a supply of particles to fling at craft and has a more limited range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the \u0022vast unknowns\u0022 of what-would-have-already-been-extensively-studied-by-orbital-mega-telescope-arrays-with-enough-resolution-to-identify-life-and-civilizations-decades-prior-to-any-vessels-arriving-there-space could be accessed, as both methods can be used to brake at distant stars. Beamed laser propulsion requires a light sail on the craft, which can slow the craft down for a stars light pressure. Beamed plasma propulsion requires a plasma sail, which can be used a magnetic brake to stop just about anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this can be achieved without any developments in material sciences,\u00A0fission, or fusion (apart from the sun), and without irradiating half the planet with every launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of yet theoretical developments like\u00A0gamma-ray lasing, magnetic monopole catalyzed nucleon decay, Q-ball based on demand free matter-antimatter conversion, Q-ball vacuum batteries, and subluminal alcubierre warp drives would be a major game changer. Even more so in the unlikely situation where the\u00A0universe is broken enough for superluminal travel to actually be possible, and the lack of causality that results from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding hard scifi propulsion systems, space infrastructure, and future developments, the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.orionsarm.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrion\u0027s Arm Universe Project\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAtomic Rockets\u003C/a\u003E, and\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIsaac Arthur youtube channel\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0are all\u00A0great places to look into this stuff more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-07T11:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI frankly don\u0027t see a reason to use the maglev.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do see lots of reasons not to though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Unless your track is nearly vertical, your gravity turn is going to be messed up, so it needs to go vertical at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. You can\u0027t turn the rocket sharply, both because rockets don\u0027t handle side loads especially well without substantial, heavy reinforcement\u00A0and because massive maglev trains with no jointed sections will derail, high-center, or crash into the rail in a severely upturned track. This means that in order to go from 500 mph horizontally to 500 mph vertically without over a G\u00A0of sideloading not caused by gravity, your track needs to be something like 5 kilometers tall and wide and 8 kilometers long. And remember, it acts like a giant lever for that side-loading, so you need huge reinforcement structures so it doesn\u0027t snap the track off below it. This reinforcement also adds additional wind forces which means you need even more of it to reinforce it against high winds, or this needs to be dug into the side of a mountain. Either way this won\u0027t be some spindly flimsy radio mast type structure but a gigantic high speed railway\u00A0bridge for rockets\u00A0through half the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Starting at 500 mph only saves you a small amount of Delta-V. Same with starting at 500 mph on the end of a giant space bridge. You still have 96% of your speed and 99% of your altitude left to go. That isn\u0027t totally irrelevant due to the Oberth effect, but it\u0027s not very relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. It is considerably more complex, slower, and larger than just building a giant cannon. 500 mph\u00A0takes virtually no effort for a hybrid combustion cannon or light gas gun to do, and even a pure compressed air gun can achieve that velocity if needed,\u00A0with the added bonus that the rocket and the cannon only take vertical forces from launch. Put the rocket on some kind of disposable or recoverable\u00A0piston or sabot, or possibly the pusher plate for a nuclear rocket, then accelerate straight upward. You can easily handle more G in this direction too, as much as the rocket would normally generate from launch, so accelerating upward at several G\u00A0might not be unreasonable. The force on the launch tower is also purely vertical, so no need to design it to withstand more sideloading than the wind will put on it. And in fact, it isn\u0027t even being compressed significantly by the rocket or gas but rather it is being pressurized, so your thousands of\u00A0tonnes monster of a projectile puts literally no vertical weight on barrel as it accelerates. All of the force is being channeled through the compressed gas down to the chamber of the cannon, which can use the ground as structural support, be underground, or even BE the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, yes, the cannon does need to deal with wind and it\u0027s own weight. If you want it to accelerate slowly and be kilometers high, there are three\u00A0approaches I can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Put radio mast\u00A0style cables on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Make it thick and rigid. But still not as thick as a bridge to space would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Put the tower inside something that doesn\u0027t respond to wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStructural considerations for giant vertical cannon:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow heavy\u00A0is 1 meter long\u00A0of barrel material? This will be proportional to the overpressure of the barrel multiplied by the area of the barrel. So, f.e. a barrel 20 meters wide inside (we\u0027re talking about a 20000 mm cannon!) with a peak overpressure of 5 atmospheres and an implied launch force of 16000 tonnes-force (157 MN) would be trying to put 5\u00A0MN against each linear meter of wall. We want to withstand much more than that to avoid popping the barrel. How about designing for 10\u00A0MN/meter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so what are the options for materials?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, we want high specific tensile strength, but this thing is also huge, probably will have no issue with its own weight even if it\u0027s quite tall, because wind and internal pressure so dominate the forces on it,\u00A0so we also want low cost per kg. So even though it might be tempting to build it out of millimeters thick of composites, which can reach yield strengths of 2000 MPa and are still less than 2000 kg/m^3, we also need to keep in mind that this comes at the cost of, well, cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 kg of high strength composites might be $30.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 kg of mild steel could be $0.30. Sure, it\u0027s 1/8th the strength and 4x the density, but it\u0027s also 100x cheaper. That makes it 3x cheaper as a pressure vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow alloy steels costing more like $0.50/kg can still easily have\u00A0500-1000 MPa of tensile strength. Although at a density of 7800 kg/m^3 their specific strength is less impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPine wood might also be tempting if you can align the grain since it does have a tensile strength of 60 MPa for a density of just 600 kg/m^3 and a cost of $0.60/kg. It would however be somewhat difficult I think to construct a pine barrel of this size that maintains its tensile properties. Even so, the specific strength to cost ratio is as good as steal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAluminium is slightly more expensive but by no means unreasonable at $1.20/kg or so, and has similar specific strength to pine or low alloy steel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome quick math says whichever of those you use, the barrel will be about 6 tonnes per meter. That means you need 30000 tonnes for a 5 kilometer barrel. That\u0027s about $20-50 million in raw material costs. I wanna emphasize the \u0022raw\u0022 part. I don\u0027t know what the cost to actually assemble the tube is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, keen readers will note that a tube made of metal 12 mm thick,\u00A020 meters across, and 5000 meters tall is not gonna stay up on its own. It will be subject to high winds and buckling forces. It should be perfectly able to avoid pure compressive failure though, as the 8000 cm^2 should more than withstand 300,000,000 N of its own weight by about double.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first improvement: we need strong, stiff\u00A0girders around the whole thing like a radio mast so it doesn\u0027t kink inward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond improvement: we need large cables like a radio mast to make it withstand high wind speeds and won\u0027t buckle or fall over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... is it worth doing... probably not. At least not in the form that needs to be kilometers tall and employ slow acceleration. It might be worth making a much shorter, narrower barrel for payloads that can take, say, 1000 G acceleration on launch, and reach much faster launch speeds overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Orion, using it in the atmosphere would work but... the problem is you need to be extremely far from anything sensitive to heat or shock. And then there\u0027s another problem. You can\u0027t use it in upper atmospheric to low orbit altitudes\u00A0because of Nuclear EMP and artificial radiation belts, so you need to get your apoapsis to something pretty crazy. Like, several thousand kilometers, to spread the gamma rays out enough not to hurt anything, and you need to do that within 40\u00A0km of the ground so you don\u0027t spread them out too far. Any detonations at all between 20 and like 1000 km could prove very destructive unless you\u0027re somehow preventing gamma rays from impacting the upper atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

having trouble seeing your reasoning for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Pusher plate vehicles do not have to use antimatter, and the classic Orion designs would release radioactive fallout of course. But the amount is manageable, indeed the total environmental damage per kg of payload may be less as similar amounts of \u0022fallout\u0022 are released to the environment by other industrial processes (such as oil extraction and refinement - which is necessary for kerosene) and no one bats an eye. It seems unlikely that the Earth can even be made uninhabitable even with a fairly decent NPP launch rate over long periods. Maybe, \u003Cstrong\u003Emaybe\u003C/strong\u003E, there will be a higher rate of cancer. But some models seem to suggest mild benefits for the population as a whole (hormesis models), and nonetheless we do far more damage to human lives with much less useful endeavors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Chemical rockets can not be made with a higher payload capacity than pusher-plate vehicles unless the pulse units are chemical explosives. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion has specific impulses around 10x chemical even in a rather crude design. With more advanced designs it can be 30x chemical if not higher. And since Orion vehicles were intended to use steel... no one in their right mind would build a chemical rocket out of steel. Except the Sea Dragon - a big dumb booster that deliberately sacrifices performance for simplicity and just uses shear size to overcome the performance losses. And its total mass would have been on the order of 18 thousand tonnes and only deliver around 500 tonnes to LEO. Compared to the 4000 ton Orion design which was 4000 tons and capable of putting 1600 tons into LEO assuming a rather crude Orion drive. Or 14.4 times more payload as a percentage of the vehicle mass. An Orion as big as Sea Dragon with the same isp as the 4000 ton Orion would deliver over 7000 tons to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPusher plate drives can be made to put reasonable stresses on the vehicle structure, the performance is so huge that you can afford the mass to reinforce the vehicle. That\u0027s the point. Instead of \u0022Every Gram Counts\u0022 it\u0027s \u0022Every Hundred Kilograms Count\u0022, maybe \u0022Every Tonne Counts\u0022. Higher specific impulse and high thrust is just that good - the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation is an exponential relationship. Double the specific impulse, and the mass ratio falls by the square root. This means if your vehicle needs a mass ratio of 16 to reach a desired Delta-V, then doubling the specific impulse reduces this to 4.
