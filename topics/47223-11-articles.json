But I\u0027d like to mention the one thing that severely cramps my style everytime I consider designing a station: the in-orbit assembly part.\u003Cp\u003EI dislike docking ports. Not because docking is tedious, but because docking just isn\u0027t a substitute for VAB assembly. Now, I know nothing about Unity, so I can\u0027t say if it would be possible, but my dream mode of orbital assembly would be the ability to dock parts together in a way that\u0027s identical to VAB assembly. A permanent addition to the part tree of that vessel, as if you had attached a subassembly in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports are great for when you need to dock and undock things repeatedly. But if you\u0027re building a station, in 99% of all cases you\u0027re never going to undock anything. You want it to stick together forever. If the above is even at all possible (and it might not be, who knows), I think that would be a real unique selling point for NF station parts compared to other station part packs out there.
