Idk if that can be fixed and i\u0027ll see if it happens again when i reload and get you pictures.\n\u003E UPDATE: So I reloaded and it just wobbled but didn\u0027t break, now I\u0027ve transferred around some resources and attached a couple more warehouses and now things seem to have balanced out enough to prevent breaking\n\nThanks for the update. Unfortunately the joint strength is set by KIS and I don\u0027t know how to change that. Glad you found a workaround though.\n\nMeanwhile, [get the latest here!](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.7.7)\n\n**0.7.7: The Last of the Mohicans - Top of The World**\n\nAnother bug fix, this release fixes a couple of issues with lights and mesh switching and animation that occurred when you reverted back to launch. It also fixes an issue where you\u0027d lose your Snacks when switching templates- if you have the Snacks mod installed. It also adds a new template to the Hacienda.\n\nTemplates\n\n- Added the Brew Works ISRU Refinery to the Hacienda. Like the stock ISRU part, the Brew Works converts Ore into LFO, LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, and MonoPropellant. It also can refine Xenon.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue in WBIAnimation and WBILight that would lose their settings when you reverted to launch.\n\n- Fixed an issue where, if you have Snacks! installed and you reconfigure your modules, the modules would lose their Snacks. Kerbals should be happier now.\n\nI\u0027m also happy to present another preview of the Buffalo Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV). There\u0027s more work to do, but it\u0027s progressing nicely:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
