I\u0027m trying to launch my first commsats into orbit because I have RT installed and need to do that before any unmanned missions will work at all. I built a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E simple satellite launcher. Just the OKTO core with 8 solar panels on it, four disk shaped batteries below the core, then a T400 fuel tank with more solar panels and a couple antennas, then the LV909 and stack separator, four more T400 fuel tanks, the Swivel engine, four AVT1 winglets, and two Hammer boosters with radial decouplers. I even put a Mk16 parachute on top of the probe core in case that helped aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JpbwN5Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JpbwN5Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoosters burn for 15 seconds and get the craft up to 5km or so, then I very gradually ease up the speed. No matter how gentle I am, even without doing any turning at all, the rocket disintegrates due to aero stress by about 45 seconds into launch. If the mod is going to tear apart probe launches like this, maybe the mod needs to allow fairings to be unlocked \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E sooner. Nobody really launches probes to space with exposed antennas an solar panels clinging to the sides, right? I\u0027m not even sure if that\u0027s the reason the rocket came apart.

Modular flight integrator doesn\u0027t actually change anything itself, it just lets other mods like FAR change or override the stock KSP aerodynamics model. Deadly re-entry could be blowing you up, the best way is to check the F3 event log and look for \u0027\u0026lt;part\u0026gt; exploded due to overheating\u0027. FAR\u0027s aerodynamic failures are also logged with something along the lines of \u0027\u0026lt;part\u0026gt; failed due to aerodynamic stresses\u0027. I think I read something about stock bug fixes doing weird stuff with other mods, so maybe uninstall those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for managing your mods, try KSP mod admin. You have to download the mods manually and Its a less sophisticated program than CKAN, but its method of installing the mods is identical to the manual install method- In other words it pastes the mod files to the appropriate location in the game directory. It\u0027s smart enough to work out that files in a folder named \u0027gamedata\u0027 should probably go in ksp\u0027s \u0027gamedata\u0027 folder, and if it can\u0027t work it out then it will highlight the mod and ask you what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Recon777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Recon777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my latest attempt, the rocket actually did survive past booster separation, but then fell apart at about 7200m in the usual way.

Obviously something is breaking, but I can\u0027t reproduce it, and without the log, I\u0027ve got nothing to work with. If it\u0027s CKAN screwing things up, then there\u0027s not a damn thing I can do; CKAN\u0027s install methods have always been a pain in the ass and the only consolation I\u0027ve gotten out of the situation is that I ended up being right about how it would make my workload heavier.
