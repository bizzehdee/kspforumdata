Everyone has said that KSP was limited to 3GB of memory (theoretically the limit for a 32 bit system after deducting system used memory) but I have maxed that according to my task manager and nothing has happened. Anyone know the reason for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T19:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E32 bit processes on Win 64 can actually use the full 4 gig of address space but some is still reserved for some things.
