Biggest problem I\u0027ve got right now (as per my signature\u0027s salad bar) is that I\u0027ve never been out towards Jool before. Now ordinarily, I\u0027d just play it conservative and build a transfer stage that has double the amount of delta-V that it would take to get out there according to the delta-V maps (~14,000 m/s), but the challenge in this case has a mass limit that I\u0027m adhering to, and the amount of payload mass I\u0027m calculating is quite a good deal lower than I\u0027d like it to be (just shy of fifty tonnes, but a I know I\u0027ll be hauling 35 tonnes of probe landers with me, that leaves precious little for the obligatory \u0022manned lander with as many Kerbals aboard as you can muster\u0022 requirement.

Since I can aerobrake inbound, does that become 4675 instead? The trip back is also really getting me; I\u0027ve read you can make it back to Kerbin with just 2800 or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How should I go about handling the transfer?

Total mass, 38.23 tons. If you refuel it, it can be reused and it doesn\u0027t require much fuel to do so. Since this lander was designed for Eve, you can get rid of half the craft as far as the lower aerospike engines go. That cuts down on the weight. If you don\u0027t stage the craft, it should still be capable of getting of of Laythe and Tylo with no problem. To do this with more kerbals, you could use a probe body on the top and add four seats to it.

Make a lightweight lander and instead of using lots of delta V, use Ion engines. The amount of Ion engines and Xenongas on the lander shown had enough fuel to Orbit Jool and Laythe and have about 1/4 gas remaining. If you bring Xenongas in a 3:1 ratio of Gas to Engines you\u0027ll have enough for a trip around all of the moons. If your craft is larger than the one in the second image above, double the engines and solar arrays.

I explained my thought process of how I would do it with a combination of those ship ideas and that\u0027s the inspiration I\u0027m using for my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s some \u0022help\u0022 for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. First build an extremely lightweight lander unit for your crew. Make sure it has enough power to to fly well on Kerban, if it achieves orbit than you\u0027re good to go. Vall has roughly the same gravity as Moho, so about double the gravity of Mun. If you test your lander on Mun and you can land, take off, get back to Kerban, with just the lander alone after you transfer it to the Mun, then that should be a good benchmark. You can build landers like this with the really small engines, and the 180 liquid fuel tanks and a command seat on top of the lightest probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you plan on doing apollo style with the lander, don\u0027t put any RCS on the lander to save on weight. Instead put only a 750 RCS tank on the main ship at maximum. Dock the main ship to the lander with the RCS. Or don\u0027t dock at all and space walk instead. You shouldn\u0027t take an extra lander back with you, it\u0027s just dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I used 3 nuclear engines total to get my craft from Kerban to Jool. One of the double long grey tanks and the other two were on the thin long tanks that were placed on the side. I then used the slack tank asparagus staging method that is in the lifter in the images above, to stage the slack tanks that were feeding the nuclear engines. The 3 engines were capable of pushing a 150 ton craft from Kerban to Jool with 5030 units of liquid fuel. One 1440 tank, one 720 tank, and 8 * 360 tanks. So there\u0027s an idea of fuel consumption for the engines I had and the total weight they were pushing. That\u0027s a one way trip fuel load, so you double that and add about 720 more and there\u0027s a round trip. 10,780 units of delta V to make a round trip to Vall and back to Kerban, with perfect orbits and landings, for a 150 ton, initial weight craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this is helpful to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T22:20:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T22:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1) How much delta-V does a trip to Vall and back really take? 1915 for the Jool intercept, 2630 to orbit Jool at 150km with inbound aerobraking possible, 1970 for the Vall intercept, then 790 for a 15k Vall orbit - that\u0027s what the delta-V map says - for 7,305 total.
