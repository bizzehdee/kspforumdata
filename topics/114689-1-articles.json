To fly around you\u0027ll have to manually fire the RCS controls nonstop. Can\u0027t just set it to thrust and do other stuff meanwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the lander is light enough to completely maneuvre with 1-2 Vernor engines then also having Vernor engines for RCS (I assume for docking?) means the TWR will be far too high to make it a feasible docking aid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions: Go with monoprop engines. Or go with a normal LFO \u002B monoprop. Or stick 1-2 Ants on there for normal flight (small nose cones make good attachment points; or use the radial ones if you have them unlocked yet). If you really want to dock in orbit but worry about the monoprop fuel weight etc. why not stick the Vernor engines on the transfer stage instead (will be heavy enough not to be overpowered by Vernors, won\u0027t have to take the fuel down to the surface)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Vernor using LF\u002BOx I\u0027m getting a far better delta-V than with monoprop engines - seriously, have you seen ISp of these? It\u0027s pathetic! Plus if I used Ant, the lander would need both monoprop and LF\u002BOx tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking, there\u0027s the precision mode (capslock). And just three days ago I did use Vernor-based RCS for orbital capture, plane alignment, rendezvous and docking to a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was quite a story actually. A typical Kerbal SNAFU - contract to build a Minmus station with a lab - a station I just needed. Except I didn\u0027t have access to any sensible solar panels, just the smallest. And not enough money to start an expedition that would earn me that much science. The contract for the lab would let me get enough money to get the science for the panels, except then the lab is already in Minmus orbit... well, a quick decision: deploy the lab now, with a few token single panels, develop gigantors and send them as a module for the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan went without a hitch until the actual delivery: the module consisted of a small fuel tank (used more as a structural element than a tank), with a docking port, four gigantors and a few Vernor engines. Oh, and a probe core plus a small battery. This attached by a decoupler to a transfer stage, a large tank and a good-ISp engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch didn\u0027t go as intended. The rocket refused to lean into gravity turn, I came out with a very high apoapsis and no horizontal speed to speak of. Most of transfer stage fuel went into getting the orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, entering Minmus SOI I noticed I won\u0027t have enough fuel to meet up with the station. A quick decision: dump the heavy transfer stage, transfer all the remaining fuel into the small tank and use RCS for the rest of the travel. Orbit\u002Bplane alignment (the station was in polar orbit), then rendez-vous, then the approach, then docking - It went... surprisingly smoothly. I docked with 10 units of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, the fact you need to hold a key down, instead of pushing Z to start the engine and X to stop it, for stuff like that is actually better. Lack of throttle doesn\u0027t hurt much - the two settings (standard and precision) are perfectly sufficient. If anything, I might be worried the engines are too strong for Minmus - seriously, on Kerbin I was able to hover my lander off the landing strip, tip it over, and then set it back upright!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
