One of my Landers \u002B Rover is having trouble with Rendezvous Autopilot. It screws up when doing its Hohmann Transfer. The burn thing above the Delta-V info that shows how far until the burn is complete, stays at 0.3m/s for... a long time. I waited for 5 minutes, and it never moves. All it\u0027s doing is screwing up my transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when I disengage and re-engage it, it circularizes the orbit with what I\u0027m trying to rendezvous with, ruining the rendezvous attempt and wasting fuel (if I wasn\u0027t using cheats). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome help would be nice.
