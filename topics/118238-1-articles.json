Here\u0027s my \u0022hooked\u0022 story...\n\nSo I have the demo, and I\u0027ve made it to Mun... but I didnt realize I actually needed to attach landing gear to use it, and my engine broke off on landing.\n\nNo worries... launch rescue mission... Finally made it back (with landing gear) and realized that command pods only hold one =( \n\nThought hey, let Barny just hang on to the ladder, and let\u0027s go back home! Well, that actually worked to about 3000m up when I realized he was gone. Sure enough, he was plummeting back to Mun. As I watched him go \u0022poof\u0022 into a cloud of dust I actually felt a tiny bit sad, and knew I need to buy this!\n\nGreat game!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T03:38:57Z","Content":"This a pretty typical new player experience. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Though actually, you don\u0027t absolutely need landing legs, if you are careful."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T15:15:02Z","Content":"Hahaha hang on to the ladder sort of rescues are best! \n\nYou can actually succeed in that if you have those little command chairs bolted to the outside of the craft. Or if you\u0027re devious, try to shut the kerbal inside a service bay (they do fit) and hope he doesn\u0027t glitch out. Or you can make a lander with a base that\u0027s fatter than the top, hopefully that gives the kerbal a place to stand while you rocket away."}]}
