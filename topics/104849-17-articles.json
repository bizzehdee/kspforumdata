If point A failed then how did point B fail in order to catapult the airlock?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T00:02:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T23:56:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Drama?

It would have to be the seam where the airlock attaches to the habs. A seam like that would be under constant stress.

I honestly dont know. There are a bevy of things that could have caused his potatoes to not grow or to fail. I think have the hab decompress in a way that might seem believable and \u0022sciencey\u0022 to the general public could have been Andy Weirs and Drew Goddards intention. You cant be OCD about a science fiction movie. I get it believe me. Once you I get on something I need to figure it out, but at some point you just need to let it go and enjoy it for what it is, a really good science fiction movie."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T11:46:52Z","Content":"Video interview with other supporting cast of the Martian:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rByLGwcYN4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Psy-AtTP3hw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nWell, not exactly an interview since it is mostly one person answering a single question...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T11:54:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T18:14:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As the airlock expands and contacts the seal which connects it to the HAB weakens.
