There was already an orange cycle looking like an orbit of Kerbal but no node to be seen. I suspect that it might be inside one of the planets. But anyway, I was wondering how you remove maneuver nodes if you can\u0060t find them to click on them? I couldn\u0060t find anything in the hotkeys list I\u0060ve been using. Has this happened to anyone else and is there some way to fix it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T02:38:27Z","Content":"Next to the nav ball, there should be a green bar that shows the progress of the node. Click on the X or checkmark next to it to destroy the maneuver node.\n\nOtherwise, try pressing TAB and shift-TAB to search for the nav node. It cycles through planets, maneuver nodes, and your ship."},{"CreatedByName":"Fishslap","CreatedById":143204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T06:56:56Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice!"}]}
