You learn really early that A,W,S,D,Q,E are used for flight control, SPACE for staging, M to switch to map and back, R for RCS, T for SAS and . and , for time warp control. Oh, and L SHIFT and L CTRL for throttle control and X for engine shut down. But I know there must be more, and whilst you learn a few new ones when you watch some of the video tutorials that are out there, there\u0027s a lot of tutorials to watch in the hope of learning all the keyboard functions. If there was a list somewhere, it could make things a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocSnuggles","CreatedById":61258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T10:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_Bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_Bindings\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T10:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent. thanks for that Doc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rylos","CreatedById":204921,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-27T22:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank\u00A0 you for the info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
