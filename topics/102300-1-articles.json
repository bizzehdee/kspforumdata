KSP is not GPU greedy. At all. Like not at all. KSP barely needs your GPU, a basic graphics card with 1GB of memory would do the job without any problem. KSP is limited by the CPU. While the game is multithreaded, the Unity API is not threadsafe. What this means is that you cannot split one task across multiple cores. And the culprit is physics. They\u0027re stuck being calculated by a single core, which is really suboptimal. And when you increase your part coutn, this is where the load increases. Not on the GPU.

I\u0027m sure your right about the CPU and thread thing however when I was testing for resource use and FPS over the last day or so I did notice when I told my large rocket to break up by releasing boosters the CPU usage immediately fired across all 4 cores. 1 was used then on staging all cores went crazy so that was interesting. Oh and despite your claim of GPU having no impact I observed a noticeable and recordable difference between SLI and non SLI configs in windows. I can only go off my own interpretation from Linux as I was having some weird behaviour from the FPS counter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I agree there are more modders than devs, that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying Devs fix the engine by changing across to U5 and let the myriad of modders fill in the content in the mean time. I am saying U5 should be priority. I understand there can be complications with the physics etc but the Rust is a physics game as well so it is possible and according to his report not that hard. I personally have no experience in it you are right so I can only go off what I can read, listening to those who are experienced and more than likely a lot smarter than me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your point about U4 engine being extremely hard to fix I\u0027m sure is also right however that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying move onto U5 because that is the fix. The developers have upgraded it specifically to include 64 bit as native among other things of lesser note.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I mentions the transition to U5 and certainly it wouldn\u0027t be the easiest way out. The easy way is to say .... it, leave it as it is and move on. Perhaps Squad will leave it, perhaps they will fix this issue. Only they know for certain. KSP is about the physics but U5 bring a more capable physics engine which I\u0027m sure will be a lot of work to transition but the rewards I would think are worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Your comment about modding. I\u0027m saying exactly what you are saying. Let the modders do the modding, add content etc. Let the developers fix the major issues that modders can\u0027t fix. We don\u0027t need more official content right now. We have a large and thriving modding community making amazing content and it costs the developers nothing to maintain or implement. This is the time for the developers to fix the engine problems before all the content that they plan to include is in place. If they add more content now and then decide to fix the memory issues by changing the engine its probably going to create more work fixing even more official content. At no point am I saying incorporate mods in officially at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. They should be fixing the memory issue because the engine developers have already fixed the issue by creating and releasing a new and relatively easily transferable engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying they should transition the engine in 2 hours like Rust did. Use the whole patch development cycle. How long has it been since 0.90 came out? Long enough to have U5 up and running that\u0027s how long. It is their game and they need to make money but if they are planning on making a transition at all it should be priority because everything else is covered by mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThat is a first hand account of changing a game from Unity 4 to 5.

I am merely echoing the comments from the Rust developers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods add so much though. Once you play with all this great content you just can\u0027t go back. I will probably remove one of the parts packs and just keep B9. Or perhaps just keep playing on Linux, since I devoted several days of my spare time to learning how to use it.

I\u0027m sure your right about the CPU and thread thing however when I was testing for resource use and FPS over the last day or so I did notice when I told my large rocket to break up by releasing boosters the CPU usage immediately fired across all 4 cores. 1 was used then on staging all cores went crazy so that was interesting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI told you, KSP \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E multithreaded. It *does* use all the cores. What I said is that it can\u0027t split on task across multiple cores, and that is the problem. And when I say can\u0027t, it literally can\u0027t. If you do as much as spawn a Texture in a thread with Unity, and then try to reference it in another thread, the game crashes. Unity 4 has zero threadsafe capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022uglyduckling81\u0022 data-cite=\u0022uglyduckling81\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not saying they should transition the engine in 2 hours like Rust did. Use the whole patch development cycle. How long has it been since 0.90 came out? Long enough to have U5 up and running that\u0027s how long. It is their game and they need to make money but if they are planning on making a transition at all it should be priority because everything else is covered by mods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 came out about a week and a half ago. They couldn\u0027t even if they wanted to. And no, since the time when 0.90 came out, even if Unity 5 had been out atthat exact moment, they\u0027d could be done just as they could not even have reached a stable halfway mark. Of course they\u0027re gonna try, maybe things will go better than expected. Coding is just a massive whatever fest. Sometimes things work and you have no clue why. But the opposite is true. Chances are transfering to Unity 5 could take half a year, and yield unstable results. And then even, as Harv mentioned, Unity 5 is not a promise of fixes. Transferring to Unity 5 is not necessarily going to fix the 64bit client. All in all, if you want to transfer to U5, completely fix the win64 client, and completely multithread KSP with the physics being correctly split across cores, I\u0027d expect it to take something around 6-12 months with the current team. And for an indie developper, it\u0027s not something you can afford.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T15:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad will look at Unity5 after 1.0, right now they cannot support a 64bit release using Unity4x and cannot fix issues that are caused by the Unity4x 64 bit builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really is nothing more that can be said, continually asking for it won\u0027t make it happen any faster either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
