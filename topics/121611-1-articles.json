Might not be as impressive the rest I\u0027ve seen, but I did enjoy the process (for the most part... now I know why LED\u0027s should be kept to a minimum. \u003Cstrong\u003ESo much wiring!\u003C/strong\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all took just under a month to plan, build and test this thing. I\u0027ve always wanted to atempt to build something like this, and after finding an keyboard just collecting dust I was curious as to whether I could give it a new life! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/eLPb4BL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eLPb4BL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eLPb4BL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the imgur album if you want to see some of the pictures of the process.

First thing I did was figure out which key presses worked together (before ripping it apart had a look at this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/content/projects/KeyboardGhostingDemo.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekeyboard ghosting tool\u003C/a\u003E). As I\u0027m not desigining for all the shortcuts I just decided which ones worked well together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the keyboards I had lying around didn\u0027t have the combination I was looking for, but luckily I\u0027ve somehow managed to horde quite a few over the years. After deciding on the keyboard I had to map out the connections and double check the combinations. There was also a backup plan too... have the connection wired only one way, with the LED on both (so mimic a momentary then throw the switch the oppisite way to \u0027mark\u0027 it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
