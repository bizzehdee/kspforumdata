There are ways to mitigate this though; Mods like Active Texture Management will compress and help manage textures and can enable you to run lots and lots of modes, I run the aggressive version on my 32 bit game, the KSP folder is just at 4GBs, it loads over 1900 MM patches at start up, aside from taking forever to load it runs fantastically on my 3 year old laptop and I\u0027m sure there are people running way more stuff than me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crim1","CreatedById":116163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T11:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(sigh) i cant get KSPI to work with 64 bit, fresh install, threw waves exp in, started 64 bit and crash as soon as I create a new game. keep getting this damn \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddonLoader: Instantiating addon \u0027InterstellarToolbar\u0027 from assembly \u0027InterstellarToolbar\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnloading 0 Unused Serialized files (Serialized files now loaded: 0 / Dirty serialized files: 0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnloading 0 unused Assets to reduce memory usage.

In the case of your problem it was a pretty well known issue and you did provide allot of information as to what the game was doing, however there are some key bits that you left out that can help if you encounter other problems in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of KSP are you running and what platform, .24 32bit windows, .23 64bit linux etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of the mode are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you hit alt f12 in game it will open up the debug window, here there is a debug tab that will give you a log, look for any text that isn\u0027t white and include that with your post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat other mods are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just a few things that can greatly help us help you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing since the OP says .23.5 the first thing you should do before you even install it is try and find out if it is supported on .24 or if someone has made a patch to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and happy moding!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T16:58:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Akira_R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T16:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ars Techne\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ars Techne\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m running into an Interesting set of errors. The game runs fine but most of KSPI pieces are buggy. First the science lab has enjoyed taking flights on its own without any propulsion (it literally just starts lifting off the launch pad). Second the UI, when brought up, has the listing of operational activities but has no output on the activities (say the reactor wont show how much energy its producing amount all the other activities having blank outputs. and Third, many parts disassemble from the structures I have put together on load.\u003Cp\u003ENow the science lab floating away was just a \u0022sit there\u0022 structure with some girders to balance everything. Upon loading it was fine but, when I extended the solar panels, it starts floating away, the girders on the bottom swinging around like wild tentacles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe displays are funky, like some part of the plug in didnt start. With no output values, I thought that it was cause I hadn\u0027t selected an operation but when I click on one nothing happens. no retro-fitting, no research, just nothing works. it doesnt effect all parts, nor all parts the same, and ill put a list at the bottom of unaffected, partially affected and affected parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disassembling always happens on load in onto the lauch pad or air strip. So two things happen. First upon load the parts will disconnect from each other. Second they then will fall into each others physical space (and the launchpad), occasionally exploding from physic updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaffected Parts (to observed):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.5m-3.5m reactors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartially affected:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.625m reactor (it doesnt disassemble but only the retro-fit button works, nothing else)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnaffected:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave transmitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave reciever\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking off the steam client version. is that the 64bit one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Steam version should have installed both the 32 and 64 bit versions and defaults to the 32 bit version. So it shouldn\u0027t be a 64 bit issue unless you added the extra commands in Steam to force it to launch in 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds more like you\u0027re not using the experimental version of the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to an issue I just noticed with the experimental version. Upgrading parts costs science not Kerbucks. So not only do I have to spend 1000 science to unlock the upgraded generators I then have to spend a few hundred more science per generator to upgrade them. I currently have 4 beamed power stations in orbit of Kerbin, each with 2 Sethlans 2 generators that need upgrades that will cost me a total of 1760 science (220 each) to do the upgrades. Plus the generators I have on other ships, which I didn\u0027t check on their total costs to upgrade yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even both figuring out how much I\u0027d need to upgrade all the radiators, primarily because I disabled waste heat in the .cfg file due to the ridiculously high number of radiators needed to get the generators working at more than 10% efficiency. Even with waste heat turned off the generators still only get up to 24% before the upgrade and 42% after the upgrade even though the descriptions list 30% and 60% for thermal power and 85% for direct conversion. I saw the same numbers before turning off waste heat no matter how many extra radiators I added after the numbers turns green (at green the generators were only around 9-10% efficiency at 100% power).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
