It would be a great way to power Laythe bases and keep batteries charged on aircraft in atmosphere.

If we have enough thermal energy from the nuclear reaction to provide appreciable thrust, then logically, shouldn\u0027t we be able to use it as a nuclear power plant when the heat isn\u0027t driving the spacecraft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam Air Turbines see use on real life aircraft to drive hydraulics and electrics. It\u0027s about time we had air intakes (either dedicated parts or tweakables on engine-breathing parts) that could generate electricity instead of ventilating engines. Electricity gain would vary based on angle of attack, atmospheric thickness, and airspeed, and function in any atmosphere, oxygen or no. Reversely, let\u0027s see ducted fans use electricity to move atmospheric air and provide thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, with the exception of the Nerv with its inverse alternator, let us disable alternators on engines that have them.
