You can see this happening sometimes when you load a craft you haven\u0027t had active in a long while - when the craft loads, the power bar first appears at the old value for a fraction of a second and then drops to the new value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T14:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, you are correct.
