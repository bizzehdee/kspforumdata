I burned for 3 minutes and 8 seconds to place my spacecraft into a hyperbolic trajectory with eccentricity 1.539 and periapsis of 158.1 km. My objective was to cross Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI at 1607 m/s, retrograde to Kerbin\\\u0027s orbit about Kerbol. My actual burn put me into a 13.533 million km by 7.070 million km orbit about Kerbol, which I easily trimmed into a 13.533 million km by 7.000 million km orbit. The only tricky part about planning all of this was that the angular position of the hyperbolic periapsis moves by 14 degrees during the burn, and this has to be accounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the return to Kerbin, I calculated the timing of the burn by ded-reckoning. I added up the orbital periods of the 2 transfers and the 7 orbits at 7 million km and then worked out what fraction of an additional orbit at 7 million km I\\\u0027d have to wait before starting my burn to return home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding the Kerbin year is easy.

It is \u0027easy\u0027 if you know Kerbol\\\u0027s mass and radius but what if you don\\\u0027t know either value? How would you know what they are? The orbital altitude shown in the game is the altitude above Kerbol\\\u0027s surface, not the distance to Kerbol\\\u0027s centre of mass. The distance to Kerbol\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s centre of mass is dependent on Kerbol\\\u0027s radius and Kerbol is big enough that its size matters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of your calculation above, you only know the Mun\\\u0027s orbital period because someone else has calculated Kerbin\\\u0027s mass for you before hand.
