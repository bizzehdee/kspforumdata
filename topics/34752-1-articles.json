A minus point due to this is that the ladder is not quite long enough to go all the way to the ground.

If you don\u0027t mind leaving debris behind, once the crew are all back in the command capsule, the lander can be jettisoned. If you decide to take it with you and haven\u0027t transferred the fuel over, make sure to deactivate the lander engines, or your ejection burn won\u0027t go as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/rov12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rov12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a sub-orbital trajectory has been set up for Kerbin, the lander, if you bought it back, can be jettisoned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/rov13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rov13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/rov14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rov14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here we all are, back safe and sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/rov15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rov15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file can be downloaded here. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y6drj4mc870ui7s/5QzqNA8k06/Munar%20Rover%20III.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMunar Rover craft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs already mentioned, two booster rockets end up as debris, the rover is left behind and the ladder is a bit short. Also, the lander has enough fuel to land and return to orbit to rendezvous with the command capsule, but it doesn\u0027t have an abundance of fuel. If you manage to get in to orbit but run short of making a rendezvous, the command capsule is equipped with RCS and can make the rendezvous if you switch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is reasonably stable but will tip over if abused. Up to 10m/s usually doesn\u0027t trouble it, and if you disable the steering on the rear wheels to make it less sensitive, 15m/s can be achieved if driven with care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoy it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T21:30:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks fun... but I can\u0027t load it.
