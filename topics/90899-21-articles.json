It appears to have something to do with a SOI change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I switch SOIs either by loading a ship in the space center or moving through it on another ship, then the bug occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything seems normal until I try to timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027ve started timewarp, the ship seems to freeze in space - nothing changes whether it be velocity or position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to uninstall Warp Drive to fix this, but the game crashed every time I switched to my ship travelling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom Kerbin to Mun with a SOI change in the future. Reinstalling it fixed this, but the bug still exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother case that just occurred - I was launching a ship, approaching my apoapsis, around 85k I started to timewarp, and the ship froze - but now the apoapsis continues to increase whilst the ship\u0027s velocity stays the same (as does its position)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again, looking forward to seeing more of your work in the future through 0.90 and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello RoverDude,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same here. I just now installing and restarting game with each and every mod I like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of two bugs: the first and more annoying one was this freeze. (I just researched the drive so I hadn\u0027t got the chance to actually try it out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo Logs indicating strange things though. (and YES, I downloaded this mod almost a week ago, and using KSP AVC.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that great search and destroy process I figured out the other slightly less annoying bug:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is maybe related to MKS vs Remotetech. with some parts: like the stock airplane wheel, the shielded dockingport or an antenna if I click an option their menu freeses not changing to the oposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get this error first related to the orbital constructor dock of MKS.
