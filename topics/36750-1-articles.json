The spaceplane in question didn\u0027t have enough fuel left to fly any substantial distance in Duna\u0027s Atmosphere, so the gliding was mostly neccessity. I did find one rather substantial problem while I was doing it: You can\u0027t steer worth crap until you get slowed down in the lower atmosphere. Lift wasn\u0027t really a problem (at least not on my doubled-wing design with almost no fuel left), but I\u0027d try to turn and just end up flying sideways. Once the speed bled off and I got low I could steer kinda okay, but still not spectacularly well. The fact I kept ending up on Plateaus that were several KM above datum didn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can tell it\u0027s actually one of the better ways to land on Duna at all, since Parachutes barely work and you need several metric tons worth of them (literally).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rexrex600","CreatedById":66634,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T04:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a wise man once said, \u0022I just use hardware assisted lithobraking!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T04:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always try to use glider descent, then followed by a detachment, big boom, parachute, then profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even made a whole fleet of aircraft to deploy rovers on Eve, then return to a spacestation in orbit (that was the plan at least) until I realized that air breathing engines only worked on Kerbin and Laythe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T22:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to use drogue chutes for duna.
