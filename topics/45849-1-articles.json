I couldn\u0027t get into it so just started a new game in sandbox mode just messing about for the mo but plan on building a moon base and maybe even one on Duna or Eve (which is better?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking of starting up a blog so I can document my progress! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got one problem though, the main charger lead for my laptop broke earlier this year to I use a multicharger thingy I got in Argos but it doesn\u0027t seem to charge the laptop quick enough when I run KSP as it turns itself off in the middle of gameplay! Any advice? Would I be best off upgrading my laptop (was gonna buy a new one soon anyway)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T20:57:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Career Mode\u0022 button is a placeholder - a promise that that there will BE a career mode when development has gone a great deal further.
