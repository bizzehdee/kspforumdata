I bought KSP over two and a half years ago from the KSP store. It always ran correctly, until now. I upgraded my computer to Windows 10, and now the video freezes upon loading. The game isn\u0027t even crashing... I can hear the intro song, but the window freezes on the loading screen. It is unresponsive except for being able to be closed. I don\u0027t know how to diagnose this problem.\n\nI uninstalled the previous installation including the saved game, all mods, and all files left over. I re-downloaded and reinstalled the game from scratch. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve changed render quality to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfastest.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 My game\u0027s resolution is 1600x900, but it happens in other resolutions too. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m launching the game from KSPLauncher.

That did not work.\n\nI installed those drivers, but it was hard. I first tried to install that driver via setup.exe. However, it returned the error message, \u0022The driver being installed is not validated for this computer.\u0022 Next, I tried using the Intel Driver Update Utility, but it still shows no available updates. Finally I forced the display driver to install via the device manager. (I used the \u0022have disk\u0022 option in the wizard and pointed it to the graphics subdirectory of the driver\u0027s folder.)\n\nI verified that that new drivers were indeed installed by comparing the driver date and version number with the original values. Then I rebooted my Surface Pro 2 and verified the new drivers were installed again. However, there was no change in KSP\u0027s behavior. I still get a stuck loading screen; although, I hear the intro music after the normal loading time. The new cursor (since KSP 1.0) also works. But nothing else shows up. :-(\n\nThank you for trying to help me out, anyway. I appreciate it. :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T03:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quantum Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Quantum Jim","CreatedById":73360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T04:27:30Z","Content":"I figured it out!
