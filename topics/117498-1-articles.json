I bought KSP over two and a half years ago from the KSP store. It always ran correctly, until now. I upgraded my computer to Windows 10, and now the video freezes upon loading. The game isn\u0027t even crashing... I can hear the intro song, but the window freezes on the loading screen. It is unresponsive except for being able to be closed. I don\u0027t know how to diagnose this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled the previous installation including the saved game, all mods, and all files left over.

That did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed those drivers, but it was hard. I first tried to install that driver via setup.exe. However, it returned the error message, \u0022The driver being installed is not validated for this computer.\u0022 Next, I tried using the Intel Driver Update Utility, but it still shows no available updates. Finally I forced the display driver to install via the device manager. (I used the \u0022have disk\u0022 option in the wizard and pointed it to the graphics subdirectory of the driver\u0027s folder.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI verified that that new drivers were indeed installed by comparing the driver date and version number with the original values. Then I rebooted my Surface Pro 2 and verified the new drivers were installed again. However, there was no change in KSP\u0027s behavior. I still get a stuck loading screen; although, I hear the intro music after the normal loading time. The new cursor (since KSP 1.0) also works.
