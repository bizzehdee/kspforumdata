Do you find your rockets are all payload and no booster?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the answer is yes then KScale2 is for you. This mod was designed with the concept of how little we can change but decrease the payload fraction for orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPayload fraction is how much of your rocket is payload, vs the fuel and engines to get it there. Real world rockets manage around 15% but in KSP it\u0027s much, much higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKScale2 doubles the radius of all planets and moons and double the semiMajor axis of orbits (the radius of the orbit) so that every is twice the size and twice the distance. This makes getting to orbit harder (but not twice as hard) and increases the fuel you need to get anywhere, but the game is still very playable with a purely stock rocket. Atmospheric heights are the same as stock and very little else has changed so the mod will work with most mods. I have included configuration files for Remote tech and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E so you get the best results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKScale2 is a very minimalist approach to rescaling, it makes small changes and offers a small difference / challenge to the stock game. If you\u0027re looking for a more comprehensive rescale mod there are other options such as 64K (6.4x scale of stock, very hard with a stock rocket) all the way up to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E (1-1 scale model of the real solar system, impossible with a stock rocket).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\u003Cem\u003EWhat has changed\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAll bodies twice the diameter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll orbits twice the semi-major axis\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSolar power curve adjusted to provide stock values at new distances\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnomalies and Easter eggs are buried under ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTexture and normal for Kerbin (medium res version)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the same as stock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPotato moons still potatoes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtmosphere height and density curve\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBody rotation rates\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe end result is a mod that works really well with otherwise stock KSP, even in career mode, but also plays nicely with mods installed.
