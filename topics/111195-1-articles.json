Then after we get to where we are moving I will be going off to basic for the United States Air Force. So I will be gone for a while. So to all I thank you for cheering me up whenever i was down, and giving me some really great ideas. With that i may be sporadically off and on with wi-fi on my ipod but I would not expect much. I wish you all good luck on any future adventures and endeavors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm The One\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeya mate, have a good time, and hope you do good in your Basic Training.
