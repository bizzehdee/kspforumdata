Lets start out with a brief changelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EApplied the 0.17 compatibility fixes developed by community members.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ethese cover the new way of handling coordinates in KSP, which was what caused the old version of RT to lag horribly. This version should not lag at all, and moreover, the handling of interplanetary relay paths has been much improved. This fix is wholly the work of Spacegh\u00C3\u02C6\u00C2\u00ABst et al.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Efixed an exploit that could give zero delay at interplanetary distances.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis exploit is as old as the idea of relay network plugins (going all the way back to the original from The_Duck).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Efixed the buggy throttle controls introduced in 0.17.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGone are the days where you spend ages getting up to full throttle, only to be stuck there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EIn a rare fit of mercy I changed the default crew requirement for RemoteCommand to 3.\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027d hoped that 0.17 would include a stock crew tank. And seeing as I don\u0027t want my plugin to require anything else, I chose to lower the requirement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I couldn\u0027t find a way of stabilizing the visual signal path. It seems to be a visual bug inherent in the conversion from local- to scaled space. I might someday try to find a way of doing all the graphical work exclusively in scaledSpace, eliminating the need for conversions. It seems like there are some delay issues, coupled with some floating point errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThanks and credits:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe to say, I would not be able to release this version without the phenomenal work of this community. It is a rare thing for so many people to step up and volunteer their time and work, and spontaneously do it in a coordinated fashion too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main thanks go out to the community at large, but I really should mention the following people:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ESpacegh\u00C3\u02C6\u00C2\u00ABst:\u003C/strong\u003E For refining and assembling the final community build.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ETomato:\u003C/strong\u003E For more or less starting the whole thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EBoJaN:\u003C/strong\u003E For finding a method of coordinate conversion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EMortaq:\u003C/strong\u003E For finding the exact same method, at the exact same time.
