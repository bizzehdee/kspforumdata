Some days you come home with a nice rug to roll around on, and bear steaks. What they don\u0027t tell you as a kid is that sometimes you get the rug and steaks, but you also get some nice scars to go with them. As a child you don\u0027t understand that you can win, but that\u0027s it\u0027s not always worth the price. Once you understand and accept that possibility you become a real grown up, and the world becomes a much more serious place. Not less fun, but once you realize what can go wrong, it\u0027s a lot scarier to go hunting \u0027bears\u0027.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Laurell K.
