Im currently developing a land and return home trip out to Jool. In this mission I actually want to do three things. I want to dive a small probe into Jool and I want to land another small probe on Vall. Then the heart of the mission is the manned landing on Laythe where a two man crew will explore with a rover then return back to orbit to dock with the return stage. But so far all I have built is the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to know is what is the most efficient way possible to hit the two moons? My priority is Laythe. But for when it comes to my Vall probe exactly when is the best time to unlatch the probe from the ship and have it course correct for a Vall intercept? Before I enter Jools SoI? after the areobrake? Moon to moon transfer? The Jool suicide probe is a no brainer, but this one may be tricky. Also.. roughly how large of a probe will this have to be in order to do the job? The Dv map seems to be hit or miss id like some personal experiences if at all possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T01:42:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 01:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T23:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, that\u0027s how I\u0027d do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you enter Jool\u0027s SOI, set your PE to aerobrake so that you end up with an orbit that goes just a bit further out than Laythe\u0027s After that, decouple the Jool impactor then Rasie the main ship\u0027s PE above Jool\u0027s atmosphere. Then switch to the impactor, time warp until it comes back around and into the atmosphere and watch it flam it\u0027s way down. Step one is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo back to the main ship and plan a Hohmann transfer to Vall, that shouldn\u0027t take you too much delta V once you enter Laythe\u0027s SOI, set your periapsis so that the gravity slingshot would send you just past Vall\u0027s orbit. Decouple the Vall probe then, and then lower your main ship\u0027s periapsis for your aerobrake. Do that and adjust the orbit, and by then the Vall probe should be zooming past Laythe and should be on it\u0027s way out of the SOI. Then, just plan another Hohmann transfer, and you know the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T01:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you just planned out my whole mission sir lol.
