If that\u0027s when your game is crashing, try the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit your settings.cfg file and look for the line that says TEXTURE_QUALITY. Change it to TEXTURE_QUALITY = 1 (or even try 2 or 3).

[since .25] I load the game and the loading screen pops up just fine, it\u0027s when I finish loading that the game freezes, it never reaches the start screen. Unfortunately when the game stops working it does not log a crash report so I don\u0027t know if I am able to provide any useful information. I went into my settings.cfg file and edited the TEXTURE_QUALITY line as Claw has been suggesting on multiple threads but no matter what number I put in there the result is the same- the game crashes. I\u0027m running a Windows Vista 32bit machine with 3 gigs of ram; I wonder if the issue could be related to any of the system specs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to all of you devs out there, I know every time there\u0027s a big update there are always a handful of bugs that follow them.

Also, you can try to reduce the resolution and set it to window mode to get it started. These things can help reduce the memory load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the settings.cfg, look for the RESOLUTION lines and the FULLSCREEN line. Put in a smaller resolution and set full screen to false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee if that helps, then you can tweak things around after that.
