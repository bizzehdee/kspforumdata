Probably some of the best days of my life. 15 students of my school and I arrived there last Friday, and we just returned today a few hours ago. Sure, it was a service trip and so we had to work and help the Navajos there, but that wasn\\\u0027t by any means bad, and the cultural aspect of the trip we experienced at where we stayed (Greeting the sun, meeting in a Hogan) as well as what we saw during work probably made it better. Wonderful way of life down there. We also were briefly in Red Valley in Arizona for a sun dance, that was also very nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the whole area truly deserves the moniker \u0027The Land of Enchantment\u0027. The mountains, Shiprock, Canyon de Chelly and Spider Rock, they\\\u0027re all beautiful. With regards to the last two, it was just surreal. Your mind just doesn\\\u0027t want to believe what you\\\u0027re seeing, you seem to lose all sense of depth when you stare down through the canyon and at Spider Rock. It\\\u0027s a feeling that you can\\\u0027t get from a picture for sure. The view is maybe just as amazing from the bottom as it is from the top. I remember walking through a tunnel near the bottom, and as a reached the exit, I just pretty much stood there in awe as the first thing I could see was as huge section of the canyon wall looming over a small farm (people still live down there!). When you reach the ruins of the white house though, that\\\u0027s when it just gets unreal. If you look up, you can see countless little pieces of dandelions peacefully floating above you as well as the walls of the canyon itself. It\\\u0027s almost too peaceful to be real. The trail itself is amazing as well, I stopped a countless number of times to just take in what I was seeing. The drive back from the Canyon to where we were staying also had some amazing views. We drove up a long, winding road up the reddish, tree covered mountains, ears popping every so often on our way there. When we were at the top, there was a break in the forest, and suddenly it was as if you could see forever. There was flat desert almost everywhere save for a few small natural landmarks, and of course Shiprock. There it was, almost all alone in the center of my view. It was just stunning. We also got a taste of the more awe-inspiring side of weather there, namely a dust storm. It seemed to be heading off somewhere else at first, but then the large cloud turned our way, and so did the wind. It must have been almost hurricane strength, and the dust just started flying everywhere, making it hard to see anything more than a few feet in front of you. But all that couldn\\\u0027t compare to the scene at night. There\\\u0027s little light pollution in New Mexico, and so the sky is awe-inspiring. Stars are everywhere, and for someone like me who only knows the most routine constellations, it made any sort of star-spotting impossible simply due to the vast number of them. I must have seen over a dozen shooting stars, as the darkness made it easy. And even more impressive than the stars and meteors was the Milky Way. When the dark set in each, the disc of our galaxy was not yet high enough to clearly make out, but in an hour or two, it could be seen as clear as day. I\\\u0027ve never seen the galactic disc with my own eyes before, and had always hoped to do so. I didn\\\u0027t see it the first night, as I fell asleep too early since it had been a long day of travel, but on the second, we had a meeting in the hogan with our host, and after I walked out, I noticed a section of the sky was brighter than the rest. Actually, two sections, as a black, misty line seemed to divide the bright spot. I thought it was just a few earthly clouds at first, but when I noticed how this could be seen in a uniform band all the way across the sky, I realized that these were not earthly clouds, but galactic clouds. It was unbelievable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll remember this trip for a long time. I not only got to see brilliant scenery, but experienced and enjoyed a whole new culture and became closer to those who also came with me on the trip. I think I want to go back the The Land of Enchantment one day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t have pictures of my own, unfortunately. I didn\\\u0027t bring any sort of technology with me. I may be able to find pictures that our chaperones took though, and might post those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
