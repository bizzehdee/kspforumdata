All consumables (batteries and fuel tanks) and engines are affected. I have to remove them all, re-add and then I can launch fine.\n\nEven using the FL-T100 fuel tank which is the first one you get causes this.\n\nUsing v1.0.2 in career mode in normal difficulty. Clean game started to make sure nothing from an old save was causing it.\n\nVery frustrating as having to make the smallest change means I must rebuild the ship from scratch.\n\nCheers \n\nEd"},{"CreatedByName":"pigsofa","CreatedById":144397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:56:11Z","Content":"Bumping as I am experiencing the exact same issue.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBumping as I have the exact same issue.
