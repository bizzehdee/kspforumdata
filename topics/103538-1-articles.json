Trust me, buying KSP is the best investment you\u0027ll ever make. KSP rekindled my dying interest in astronomy and rocketry and to this day since has kept that raging adoration going strong. I\u0027ve learned a lot, become a new person, and fallen in love with all you guys at the forum! Don\u0027t be scared of KSP, it\u0027s your friend! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
