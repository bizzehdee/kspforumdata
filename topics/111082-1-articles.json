I have plenty of intake air and yet one of my engines always gets stuck at 214.4kn of thrust. Weirdly, it had always been the left engine until the time I took these screenshots, then it was the right one. Anyone know whats going on here?\n\n![b0AZD5c.png](http://i.imgur.com/b0AZD5c.png)\n\n![0OQCXLn.png](http://i.imgur.com/0OQCXLn.png)\n\n![IG8PqLO.png](http://i.imgur.com/IG8PqLO.png)\n\n![JiX2bJb.png](http://i.imgur.com/JiX2bJb.png)\n\n![JiX2bJb.png](http://i.imgur.com/JiX2bJb.png)\n\n![SPuwvb8.png](http://i.imgur.com/SPuwvb8.png)\n\n![37qDKwX.png](http://i.imgur.com/37qDKwX.png)\n\n![fV45kRI.png](http://i.imgur.com/fV45kRI.png)\n\n![oFcHGa3.png](http://i.imgur.com/oFcHGa3.png)\n\n![Njka1HF.png](http://i.imgur.com/Njka1HF.png)\n\n![4abGSFV.png](http://i.imgur.com/4abGSFV.png)\n\n![LxAukMD.png](http://i.imgur.com/LxAukMD.png)\n\n![fhbdRkR.png](http://i.imgur.com/fhbdRkR.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T06:13:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rotorwashed**"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T02:06:42Z","Content":"Lazy coding is what\u0027s going on. The resource flow rules in the current game are still a mess, tho better than they\u0027ve been in the past. The general advice is *still* to place half of the intakes, then place one engine, and then the other half of the intakes, and the opposite engine. \n\nHave you tried that? It may be that your engines are consuming the air from the previous frame first, then the intakes are taking in air, which is what\u0027s being displayed, which could cause an apparent air shortage *despite* the meter staying full. Did you place the engines BEFORE placing the intakes? (Yes, it\u0027s absurd that the ORDER in which you placed the parts matters).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T02:10:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TestPilotTheta**"},{"CreatedByName":"rotorwashed","CreatedById":68960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T03:41:14Z","Content":"After fiddling around with what you suggested I got it to work!
