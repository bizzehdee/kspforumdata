After a couple of run-ins with cheap wheels, I\u0027d say go Logitech. They are in the middle of the price range, last time I checked, and they do not spike out after two weeks of use. Besides, Logitech was making mice and other stuff before it was cool : )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for pedals (same brand of course), try to stretch the budget and get metal ones. Plastic just doesn\u0027t work, unless you are good with repairs and are willing to do it every month or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2m/s : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sid","CreatedById":72855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T17:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a Logitech G25 wheel, shifter and pedals and it\u0027s lasted for over 5 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leonov","CreatedById":51498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T18:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe G25 and G27 from Logitech are about the only ones worth their price.

I can afford it, but I don\u0027t want to spend over $300 if it isn\u0027t worth it.
