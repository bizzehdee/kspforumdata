A GUI that shows progress loading RSS, on the main menu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Since it\u0027s done over multiple frames, garbage collection has time to run, which means much lower RAM spikes during loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does 3 mean? Example: Before, after loading RSS I would end up at 2.8GB total. If I added any more parts (or planet textures), despite the likelihood of *ending up* below the ~3.4GB cutoff, RSS loading would spike usage over that. Now, it only spikes up by about a hundred MB (more or less unavoidable, due to loading uncompressed 8192x4096 images) so you should be able to have about 500MB more parts or planet textures. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
