It isn\u0027t because KAS isn\u0027t USEFUL, but I just don\u0027t need it. I prefer making everything dock with each other, ground or space. To move fuel around I use both TAC Fuel Balancer and Goodspeed Auto Fuel mod. I make sure that my converters have one regular fuel tank attached directly to it, then set the attached fuel tank to auto-pump out at level 8. I use TAC Fuel Balancer to highlight the parts required for pumping out, as well as to manually transfer fuel from one location to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth TAC and Goodspeed are partless. There is a single configuration change that needs to be done with a particular config for Goodspeed to get Kethane to auto-pump around, but other than that, its automatic, persistent, and works great on my Kethane tug and fuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy fuel station does all the refining, the tug goes up and down with an 8000L tank of Kethane.

I have 3 orange tanks and two medium sized tanks on my station. The two medium tanks are attached to the two refineries. I\u0027ll call those two fuel tanks the refinery tanks. So what I did was setup the refinery tanks to auto-pump and set them for level 8. This pushes all fuel generated by the refineries out to lower level tanks, so they always remain empty. One orange tank is set to auto-pump and set for level 3 (The one at the rear), and the two remaining orange tanks are set for level 2 and to auto-pump. The tug has two fuel tanks as well, and they\u0027re set to level 0. When the tug isn\u0027t docked, the two level 2 orange tanks are topped off with whatever the refineries produce, then it starts to fill the single level 3 orange tank. When ANYTHING docks that I\u0027ve not mangled the pump levels on, the tanks are instantly filled up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Kethane, I have 12 of the 1.5m tanks (Or whatever size they are), split into two groups for the two refineries. To keep the mass towards the center of the station, I have the inner fuel Kethane fuel tanks set to level 1, and the outer tanks set for level 2. The tug has an 8000L tank and it is set to level 8. All the Kethane tanks are set to auto pump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even though the KAS solution works, its still manual labor. With Goodspeed and TAC, there\u0027s even less to do after the initial setup. That is assuming you get everything docked together. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T00:57:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 12:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pontiac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jpinard","CreatedById":89401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T03:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPontiac, thanks for that amazing description.
