But in my experience, it does not. I lose all ability to control the craft if i run out of electric charge, even if i have infinite fuel and RCS enabled, which is silly. Also, it happens regardless of whether craft is kerbal controlled or controlled via satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T19:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, I should have tested it.
