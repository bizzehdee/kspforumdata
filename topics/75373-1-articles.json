It\u0027s an upsize of the same part in PolecatEZ\u0027s original ReStock pack. This one is for mounting 4 Kerbodyne, 1 Rockomax and 4 LV engines to the bottom of my upsized ThunderMaximus tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is if four Kerbodyne engines are on the bottom of this, then four Kerbodyne inline decouplers are on the bottom of those and all put in the same stage they will not all trigger together. They go one at a time and things get messy and explody. Even worse is if more Kerbodyne tanks and engines are asparagus mounted to the sides of the tanks below the engines on the bottom of this adapter, they inherit the not going all together problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed a similar \u0022round robin\u0022 effect in August 2013 with a stock quad coupler (these jumbo ones are just upsized massively from it) and used it as a feature for staging my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51115-Ship-to-ship-kinetic-energy-transfer-test-report\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKETM\u003C/a\u003E kinetic kill vehicles. To get the desired sequential staging I had to adjust the individual staging of the KETM decouplers to match whatever the numbering scheme is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem now is I *do not want* any such effect. There should not be such an effect when all the decouplers in a stage below this part are all put in the same stage - but it is acting as if each decoupler is in its own separate stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm. Now that I think on it, I have had issues doing quad stack stages off the underside of this part in its stock form and in the Rockomax upsized version in original ReStock. Very explosive because only one decoupler triggers, the next stage\u0027s engines quickly destroy the other three decouplers and blow the lower tanks etc away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on no other rockets has this trickled down to other decouplers on stacks mounted to the sides of stacks directly below the quad coupler. That\u0027s only shown up with the heavy Kerbodyne parts and the stock quad coupler upsized to work with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a stock KSP bug that gets worse with larger and larger parts. Now how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Another thought is that it might have something to do with the additional five nodes on the bottom. I\u0027ll have to build a test rocket using the original quad coupler and see if it exhibits the same one at a time release of four decouplers in the same stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPART\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Ename = thunderBiQuatro-2\u003Cbr\u003Emodule = Part\u003Cbr\u003Eauthor = Squad, PolecatEZ, Galane\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E   model = Squad/Parts/Structural/adapterLargeSmallQuad/model\u003Cbr\u003E   position = 0, 0, 0\u003Cbr\u003E   scale = 3.25, 3.2, 3.25\u003Cbr\u003E   rotation = 0, 0, 0\u003Cbr\u003E// parent = anotherModelTransform\t\u0026lt;---------Not necessary unless Second or subsequent part.\u003Cbr\u003E// texture = model000 , Squad/Parts/Command/probeCoreOcto/model000\u003Cbr\u003E// texture = model001 , Squad/Parts/FuelTank/fuelTank2-2/model001\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Escale = 1.72\u003Cbr\u003ErescaleFactor = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- node definitions ---\u003Cbr\u003E// definition format is Position X, Position Y, Position Z, Up X, Up Y, Up Z\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom01 = 1.25, -1.4, 1.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom02 = 1.25, -1.4, -1.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom03 = -1.25, -1.4, 1.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom04 = -1.25, -1.4, -1.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom05 = 0, -1.4, 0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom11 = 0, -1.15, 2, 0.0, 1.0, 0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom12 = 0, -1.15, -2, 0.0, 1.0, 0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom13 = 2, -1.15, 0, 0.0, 1.0, 0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom14 = -2, -1.15, 0, 0.0, 1.0, 0, 2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EstackSymmetry = 3\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETechRequired = veryHeavyRocketry\u003Cbr\u003EentryCost = 8800\u003Cbr\u003Ecost = 26600\u003Cbr\u003Ecategory = Propulsion\u003Cbr\u003Esubcategory = 0\u003Cbr\u003Etitle = ThunderMaximus-Rocko 4x4 Adapter\u003Cbr\u003Emanufacturer = AeroKerbin Thunder Division\u003Cbr\u003Edescription = Ideally, designed for 4 Kerbodybe-sized engines and 4 smaller gimballing engines plus one Rockomax size engine in the middle in close quarters.
