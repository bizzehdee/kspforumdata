Sure you don\u0027t have add-ons intercepting Alt-F12: no KSP modder is that dumb to use that key combination, knowing how it is fundamental in KSP (and can\u0027t even be changed). I wrote you have another software running in the background that uses that same key combination, and intercepts it while you have KSP active. That other software has nothing to do with KSP. You have a nVidia GPU, so quite probable that background software is nVidia GeForce Experience, it is very \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149794-altf12-does-not-open-debug-menu/#comment-2906460\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ewell known\u003C/a\u003E to use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/745789/geforce-experience/geforce-experience-2-1-feedback-thread/post/4232861/#4232861\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlt-F12\u003C/a\u003E as default for the FPS overlay enable/disable in Shadowplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo surprise MSI afterburner doesn\u0027t register drops, nor you see peaks with the GFX.\u00A0 Same about CPU, no spikes.

Isn\u0027t your case. There is a slight increase of RAM used with a large craft off-rails, as all its parameters are loaded. But unless you keep switching crafts, nothing in RAM would be released and no RAM assigned to new values (not in stock KSP at least). That very intense GC activity shown in the graph means something running within KSP keeps requiring further memory in the heap (probably each single frame) while the heap used is already too high, therefore firing the GC mechanism in Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have many mods.

Foremost, provide a list of all the add-ons you have (with version). As you said to be having issues since KSP version 1.0, you probably have one add-on that dates back to that version causing this leak.\u00A0 A plugin coded for KSP 1.0 most probably is obsolete by now and could present issues anyway. Then, you should test yourself if the GC activity still goes the same running KSP without selected add-ons: when you find which ones are associated with KSP stuttering, report your findings (Note: a memory leak can be caused by a single faulty plugin, but also by unintended interaction of two or more competing ones: in that case you\u0027ll see the stuttering only happen when all plugins are active, though each single one by itself won\u0027t cause it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
