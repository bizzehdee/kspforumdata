Made a NERV powered space-craft that has left over Oxidizer from Launch from Kerbin? Set up a refining vessel and realize that you produced more Oxidizer than you need? Wish you had a way to get rid of this heavy Oxidizer to increase your Delta-V?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Oxidizer Flameanator is for you, my friend! Slap this part on your craft and never have to worry about carrying the weight of unusable/unwanted Oxidizer. This part burns Oxidizer quickly and inefficiently converting it to ElectricCharge. The Flameanator will continue to burn Oxidizer even when your vessel\u0027s batteries are fully charged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qttTRCBl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qttTRCBl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part used Stock assets, it doesn\u0027t add any extra textures or models to the game, so memory impact is very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give Squad full credit for model design for the part I use to make my mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Stuff Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/826/Oxidizer%20Flameanator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/826/Oxidizer%20Flameanator\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: GPLv3\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T04:09:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a moderator, but I think you need a license.
