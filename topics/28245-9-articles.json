Doing this caused the attachment nodes to be mis-scaled (exactly the same way that some old mods behaved when the game was updated to 0.20). I was able to correct this problem on new builds, but things that were built using v1.6 of the tanks have the nodes screwed up. I\u0027m going to do some research to see if there is a way to fix this before uploading the new version, and if not I\u0027ll set up a place to download the old version for people who want to stick with that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely don\u0027t want to break anyone\u0027s builds unnecessarily.
