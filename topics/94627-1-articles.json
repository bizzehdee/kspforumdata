I want the tank to be sticking off a little bit like in the pictures of the craft flying but as you can see in the first picture when I place the part radially it attaches in from the center of the tank and not at the end of the support legs. I need some help on how to do this. Do I have to rotate the part in blender or in unity? Does it matter how its orientated in blender/unity or do i need to do something to the config file? Or do I need to change the origin of the part in blender? I\u0027m not sure where to start so any help is much appreciated.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAlso If you would like to take a shot at making a texture for this just PM me and i\u0027ll give you the link.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T21:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the look of it, you attachment problem appears to be just a config issue (Specifically the \u0022node_attach=\u0022 line).
