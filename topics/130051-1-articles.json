I have two mods installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakScale, and ModuleAnimateEmissive. Something I have noticed is that when I am getting close to a ship (Kerbal or other ship) and I try to use SAS or RCS, the other ship starts to move as well, making docking or getting into a ship while in space impossible. (side note: even when I have a ship face normal/anti-normal\u00A0and then get to it, it\u0027s moved as well. Maybe it just does that if another ship moves at all?) Anyway, I also am running KSP independently of Steam, so I can update when I\u0027ve saved my games. Any ideas as to what is happening?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Fellow Rocket \u0022Engineer\u0022,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrashJay\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
