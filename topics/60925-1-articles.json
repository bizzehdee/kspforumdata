I had a delta-winged probe that took several minutes to go from 100 meters to 0. The problem with Eve (well, one of many problems with Eve) is that the atmosphere has the consistency of soup, and the default aerodynamics model means that even a tiny amount of lift will keep a plane aloft for ridiculous amounts of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I think your best bet is to stick a parachute on it so that it falls wheels-first, cut the engines, and go have a sandwich while it drifts down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T09:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help guys.
