But in the long run (timewarping, years pass) your sats will drift from their perfect postions along the ring.

No way around this afaik. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will have to do small manuvers every few years(or months depening on how well you positioned them and how \u0022fast/low\u0022 thier orbit is) to place sats which drifted out of position to their right spot in the ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen a few explanantions for why this happens... From floating point errors, to theories that orbit is claculated from the \u0022nose\u0022 of a ship instead of its center. Whatever the cause fact is perfect orbits are not possible and this is why it is a good idea to include some means of propulsion on satellites which form \u0022rings\u0022 on the same orbit.
