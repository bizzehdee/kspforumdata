Or, add a little icon next to the \u0022impact imminent\u0022 indicator on your trajectory on the map view, that shows whether you are headed for a splashdown or a landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else considered this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-17T20:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe simply need Scansat.
