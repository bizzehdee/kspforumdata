Yet barely any of these mountains have actually received a name. It is in this topic that I want to change that. I think we should try to put a name on every single peak currently present on Kerbin. I have already taken a bit of time and flew to the very tallest mountains of Kerbin, the 6000ers. As it currently stands I\u0027ve counted a total of 11 6000ers on Kerbin. Don\u0027t worry though, I\u0027ve only given one of them a\u00A0name, so there\u0027s plenty left for you guys. Below I shall put a list of mountains, ranging from high to low. If you want to name a peak, you have to submit: a screenshot of a flag on the peak, the height of the mountain, the name you\u0027ve chosen for it and eventually the coordinates. (I shall put mine in the comments as I don\u0027t want to clog up the main post) One can submit a name for a single 6000er and as many lower\u00A0mountains as you want.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three\u00A0tallest peaks shall be named by public vote, and as long as it\u0027s undecided a (?) will be behind their names. Propose names for these in the comments, the most frequent responses will\u00A0be used.\u00A0For now I have given them the name that gets my personal preference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe List:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
