Settlement 5-X mightn\u0027t like the fact that they have to give their titanium away in exchange for the bare basics, when they could get a better standard of living if they bartered it to Settlement 7-M. You are always going to get people who don\u0027t want to be part of the plan, for whom the greatest global efficiency isn\u0027t necessarily the best outcome. These people are going to want to go their own way eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like the current obsession with GDP growth. It doesn\u0027t matter a jot if the GDP increases 10%, if 99% of the population don\u0027t see the benefit of that increase in real terms. Your colonists aren\u0027t going to care about meeting their iridium quotas and making money for a shareholder back on earth, they will want to make life better for \u003Cem\u003Ethemselves\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe worst problem would probably be the people on a space colony having ties to Earth countries.
