This rocket changed my life. It inspired me to learn more about the challenging aspects of aerospace engineering, made me appreciate what all the aerospace companies out there are doing, and eventually, made me purchase my very own copy of KSP. I\u0027m not very good at the game, as I consider the in-game tutorials to be boring, and would rather figure it out using this forum or Scott Manley, but I like to look at this game as a life-changer. Thank you all for being this incredible community that supports me whenever I feel the need to \u0022nerd out\u0022 for a bit, and I hope to see more explosions of Jeb. Peace, Jack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-10T01:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWhen I started KSP there weren\u0027t any tutorials.

For me, it started with learning about space flights past, and it just clicked with me. Now all the sudden, im planning my career for areospacial engineering. Largely due to KSP!
