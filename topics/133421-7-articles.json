\u00A0Certainly nearly all US commercial pilots (especially the ones flying the big jets to and from Asia)\u00A0have experience in mid-air refueling. \u00A0Somehow I don\u0027t see the FAA allowing

rocket has to carry too much fuel for mach 5-\u0022mach\u0022 25), then you are very unlikely to fix the problem by increasing the Isp of the turbojet\u0027s performance \u0026lt;mach

have promise. \u00A0The idea is that while scramjets appear to work above mach 5 (and prototypes have proven so), they are lucky to provide as much thrust as they experience drag. \u00A0Assuming (the big if, and why KSP dashed my dreams) is that this number *must* be positive or the whole scheme collapses. \u00A0If it is positive, then adding additional thrust (from a liquid oxygen oxidized rocket) would increase efficiency, decrease the time it took to accelerate to maximum airspeed (presumably cutting the length of time it has to withstand brutal temperatures) and hopefully increase the fuel spent to accelerate (kind of like increasing TWR to decrease drag losses, only with drag losses* instead of gravity ones). \u00A0If the number is negative, then\u00A0you are better off setting your gravity turn to accelerate out of the atmosphere. \u00A0Also note that the Isp of such a jet-rocket would be miserable compared to the SABRE (and maybe 50-100% better than a hydrogen rocket). \u00A0The idea is to make it up by extending the speed you can use air at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* yes, I know going faster will increase drag losses. \u00A0But going faster is the
