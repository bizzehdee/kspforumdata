The flatter trajectory usually means you cover more distance in thick air, meaning you get slowed down more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you right click on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E in the editor, you can limit its thrust down to maybe 30% to give you a smoother, longer burn (or limit the amount of fuel so you don\u0027t fly as crazy high before you get controllable rocket parts). You can also right-click the parachute and change its deploy min pressure to ~0.2 or something, from the deadly 0.01 it is at (which means it will deploy at the top of your trajectory if that is a \u0022safe\u0022 time (usually is: slow, and there is air), and then burn up before it can slow the craft enough as it falls down. You can adjust parachutes in-flight, but not solid boosters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI always wondered why the hell Squad didn\u0027t at LEAST set 0.1 or 0.2 as the default min pressure for parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you can grab a little bit of science right on the ground without launching by putting thermometers etc. on the rocket, or taking a crew report.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-11T15:50:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2019 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Thygrrr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Bambury","CreatedById":200643,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-12T23:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223703484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573484380\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainThorn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/11/2019 at 2:59 PM, RainThorn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually Flea has same thrust in career and in tutorial, what makes the difference is the thinner atmosphere in career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.
