I\u0027ve been working on my own small collection of parts and I want to see how you\u0027ve balanced them out so I can easily slip new parts in balance-wise.\n\u003E \n\nMost of the mass/volume \u0027balance\u0027 of my parts is based on real-world stats with some basic scaling applied.  Either square or cubic scaling depending on where/what is being balanced.\n\nCost balance is based on \u0027stock equivalent functionality\u0027.  For whatever the part/craft does (e.g. one of the SC service modules), I build as close to an equivalent setup using stock parts and note the cost/mass.  Add on a bit of extra cost for \u0027integration\u0027, and then add/subtract more cost based on the mass of the part vs. the stock equivalent (if my part/setup has less mass than stock, it will cost more).\n\nIn general development news:\n\nThe new modular part code is... umm... well.. mostly working.  Far more than I would have thought at this point, but still has some problems to sort out.  Model-module animations also appear to work (deploy solar panels at least; others should work as well as they all use the same code).  But note the sideways solar panels, and lack of textures on stuff... (still lots of it WIP).\n\nBut it is positioning and scaling models correctly for the core bits, including dynamic scale-chaining of adapters (note the scaled nosecone on top of the 2-1 adapter; all in a single part...).  Still a bit of cleanup to do on the scaling/positioning of the layout-based module slots (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar), but even those bits are more working than not (the models are present, but not positioned/rotated properly); probably only a couple lines of code to fix it up next time I get a chance to work on things.\n\n![Nh32GkX.png](https://i.imgur.com/Nh32GkX.png)\n\nSo I would say that the plugin side of the \u0027rewrite\u0027 is mostly done, and shouldn\u0027t have any problem getting it all finished up prior to 1.4."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T19:19:06Z","Content":"Looks, euhm... promising?"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T19:34:26Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never been one to focus on aesthetics in KSP.

If the engine looks funky ingame (i.e. it\u0027s either floating off the mount or is absorbed in it), use engineYOffset to fix that. If needed, it tends to be the negative version of partTopY.\n- You\u0027ll find the engine\u0027s fairing will stay if you don\u0027t use the transformsToRemove to get rid of it (hint: the fairing transform name is almost always in the module ModuleJettison, in the block jettisonName)\n- For interstages, insert the below code into the engine patch. Then, simply add the SSTU Interstage module (see the base SSTU engines for the module itself), and it will intelligently place this interstage where it is needed.\n- Upper and lower stage mounts are really easy to understand. It simply enables dedicated upper or lower stage mounts to the engine clustering options.\n- Remember, get rid of ALL models, modules and resources in the engine. Simply readd the modules you want after that block. (it allows you to rebalance a part while you\u0027re at it if you want ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022))\n- Here\u0027s all the SSTU modules you really need to get functionality comparable to the pre-provided SSTU engines: SSTUModularEngineCluster (the whole engine clustering you\u0027re after), SSTUNodeFairing (Since you need to delete the engine fairing transform in SSTUModuleEngineCluster, this adds them back in SSTU style ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)), and SSTUSelectableNodes (toggleable interstage nodes.
