Don\u0027t have any more chemistry experiments available yet, but you need more chemistry points to unlock a new one? Send a chemist to run a planetary science experiment and get a chunk of the points back in chemistry instead.

There could be a monetary cost as well, with a higher commitment costing more funds but increasing the amount of science you get back in the other field.

My plan is not to mess with the overall number of points produced and required, just to divide them between disciplines, so an experiment that yields 30 science in stock might yield 18 planetary science, 6 chemistry science, 3 M\u0026amp;E science, and 3 physics science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all just an idea at this point of course, and all the fields and part/experiment associations are just examples.

Spitballing, here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get a broad contract from Kerlington to develop a new command pod. It has parts. The first is a manned, orbital flight in a Mk1 pod of some set duration. It might have another requirement for a certain reentry (XXXX-XYYY m/s at 69,000m alt). Another might be to lift 5 tons to LKO or something, then deorbit it and land safely with parachutes. These are \u0022SS\u0022 experiments, while the time in orbit is a MS experiment and the reentry is PS. You\u0027d be doing the science to get THAT item by contract. At some point you get it provisionally to test. Obviously this could be tuned to tech tree groupings, not single items. Perhaps you pick a node to work on, and it lists the required points needed from each discipline of science, then you design missions to accomplish those goals, contract or not. In this case, the specific node might have additional requirements that look sorta like contracts. Meaning that you need PS points, but out of the 10 you need, 5 must be gathered at an altitude from 30-60km for this node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout mapping, perhaps the map view of a world shows little data. the Mun would be decent from telescopic observation, but Dres? Maybe a flat picture with only rough altitude information.
