If you\u0027re unfortunate enough to have bought the game on Steam rather than direct from Squad and haven\u0027t done that yet, I strongly advise it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they hadn\u0027t changed the loading screens I wouldn\u0027t have known Steam had updated the game. You\u0027ll want to ALWAYS backup your save games before loading them into a new update (which I didn\u0027t think of this time). This way there\u0027s no chance the game could be stealth updated without me realizing it before I have a chance to backup my saves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elkar","CreatedById":57130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T10:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.6 m/s for docking is rather hot-approach. it should be more like 0.2-0.3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaedinator","CreatedById":27680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T10:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love 0.20, the new parts are great, i love the Skipper Engine.
