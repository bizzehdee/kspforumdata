parts?","CreatedByName":"JamesL86","CreatedById":127321,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T14:27:15Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"JamesL86","CreatedById":127321,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T14:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I had this idea.\u00A0 We KSP players love our bases, both orbital and planetary.\u00A0 Would it be possible to create a mod that, like the various fuelswitch mods out there, allow you to switch out an IVA on an existing part in the VAB?\u00A0 Lemme go into a bit more detail...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main base building parts that I generally think about are the Hitchhiker, the lab, and the cupola.\u00A0 There are other parts that could be used but these three are generally the ones I consider when thinking about a base.\u00A0 The issue I have that I am sure other players probably have as well is the orientation of the IVA within these parts.\u00A0 If for example, you use these parts on orbit then they are just fine because of micro-gravity etc.\u00A0 However, if you want to use these parts on a planet or moon then the only proper orientation (at least in my mind) is vertical, due to the IVAs within them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the crucial question is, are there any modders that would be interested in creating 3 custom alternate IVAs for these 3 parts using stock assets?\u00A0 Further, would it be possible/easier/harder to have an IVA switch in the part\u0027s right-click menu in the VAB or to just duplicate the parts with the alternate IVAs contains therein?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d give it a go myself but, I do not know the first thing about modding or 3d art or any of that technical stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T17:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood

horizontally oriented IVA.\u00A0 Likewise the cupola needs an IVA whereby the kerbal within is oriented 90 degrees out from the stock IVA position so that it could be used as say, a control tower or other dome-like construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know a lot of people just used these in different orientations anyway, but for some reason it really REALLY bugs me that the IVA is wrong when used in orientations other than the intended ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T18:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m the same

many mods in general such as Infernal Robotics.\u00A0 I think overall though, this is something that has been missing from the game for a good while now.\u00A0 I know that there are other mods that add different new parts that work well for this sort of thing.\u00A0 I\u0027m just looking at this from the angle of fixing the stock parts by giving more options as opposed to just adding new parts.\u00A0 Who knows?\u00A0 If we find enough people interested in this idea that a modder decides to take it on, it might even get put into stock.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022
