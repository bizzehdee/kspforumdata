Due to the low mass, each launched on the somewhat deprecated K-8.\u00A0 Each launch went off flawlessly, and the TLI burns went off without a hitch. the K-8 would place each probe on a free return trajectory, and the probe would correct into an inclined mun encounter. Munswooper one captured in it\u0027s orbit, but during the handover from the KSP team to the Sean\u0027s Cannery team, the engineers realized that they hadn\u0027t installed scientific equipment on. The anomaly team discussed and in the end it was decided it could be handed back to the KSP team and function as a relay, due to it\u0027s inclined elliptical orbit. Munswooper 2 experienced it\u0027s own issues, with the trajectory the K-8 placed it would mean that after it\u0027s correction, it would not have enough deltav to capture into an orbit. The anomaly team consulted multiple times to try and rework the trajectory, to no avail. In the end, it was decided to place the disabled satellite on an impact course, and try and use it like a munar impactor probe. Before it impacted, the probe transmitted it\u0027s final data, before crashing into The Mun\u0027s surface at a kilometer for second. Surprisingly, the Cannery team were satisfied with the solution, and the mission was deemed a partial success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaline 5 took off on a Molniya rocket carrying a Zalkier v1.1 Spacecraft. Jeb was in the front seat, with Bob riding shotgun. They had an important mission. To prove extra vehicular activity was possible, and to test multiple technologies relating to EVA in microgravity. After establishing a parking orbit of 86x80km, Jeb suited up, the spacecraft was depressurized, and Jeb stepped out onto the side of the spacecraft. He paused briefly before pushing off. Bob unlocked the monopropellant tanks and(against his better judgement) reoriented the spacecraft. Jeb also tested the \u0022B(asic) R(edundant) U(tility) H(ammock)\u0022, a small pack of thrusters one wears on the back, to maneuver around in deep space. Over a period of several days, Jeb and Bob performed multiple EVAs, thoroughly testing their Space suits. After 8 days, Jeb and Bob had a soft landing in the water(which ironically the Zalkier reentry module wasn\u0027t designed to land in). They broke several records, not only becoming the first kerbals to exit a spacecraft, but broke several spaceflight duration records. 8 days was by far the longest spaceflight to date, and while it doesn\u0027t seem like much, we must take baby steps if we wish to explore other heavenly bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pQIJTVc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pQIJTVc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunswooper 1 burning for orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GKhfedi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GKhfedi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunky Trajectories\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MpgBtqN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MpgBtqN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoonswooper 1 spacecraft seperation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TJMSjWT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TJMSjWT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunswooper 2 lifts off, and Modular Launch Pads Claw-not-opening issue continues.(yes, I have animated decouplers.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GizBoJt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GizBoJt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eZNwH5C.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/eZNwH5C.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunswooper 2\u0027s final moments\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022voP3SUV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/voP3SUV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229SDoZLN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9SDoZLN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fMDKY42.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fMDKY42.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob snapped this exellent photo of kerbin, which looks beautiful from up here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Sa4D3mn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Sa4D3mn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022TauYJGx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/TauYJGx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the reentry pod seperated from the propulsion and service module, there was a hairing moment when the pod impacted one of the solar panels, breaking it into pieces.

It made it to Minmus, left the science module and probe array in orbit, and landed on the surface. Refueling went smoothly, and while it was waiting a rescue party went out to bring back a a kerboknaut, Tim, stranded 46 km away. The larger rover with two seats was detached and sent out first, but a new problem was quickly discovered that the engines, attached to the aerodynamic nose cones,\u00A0didn\u0027t seem to work and thus the craft could only be powered by the monopropellant tanks. Additionally it was discovered that detaching and landing the craft, which is affixed upside-down when IP2 is landed, is quite difficult especially without breaking the critically important cooling arrays extended below.

When he regained consciousness after the crash he climbed out and stepped gingerly into the twilight, he appreciated the feeling of walking in low gravity, especially after sustaining more than\u00A0a couple of bruises. He looked up at the stars, and the dusty hills around him. In the distance, maybe to the south, there was a mountain.\u00A0The slope was imposing even from so far away. He never dreamed this tiny, far moon\u0027s surface would be so large and rugged, looking at it from Kerbin it always looked so small and\u00A0flat. Most of the photographs sent back from earlier missions were to the flats, expansive areas of no terrain, simple to land on. Come to think of it, he wondered if he had forgotten to switch his altitude indicator to terrain mode when he was coming in for the landing ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sat there for a week, or a day, it was hard to tell. Time moved so slowly, but he could see Kerbin Spinning on the horizon like a little blue and green marble. Somewhere, days\u00A0were\u00A0passing with their usual regularity. He picked up a pebble and tossed it, then watched it sail triumphantly away. Suddenly the silence was broken by a distant \u0027puff\u0027 coming from somewhere above the mountain. A moment later, another one, then another. Slowly the noises came closer, until he could make out the source of it: a tiny craft was hurtling towards the surface and attempting to slow down. Every puff would shake it wildly.\u00A0A second before it smashed\u00A0into a nearby slope\u00A0a loud force of air slowed it down, blowing up a large cloud of green dust,\u00A0then it plopped into the dirt and flipped over. He looked around. There was nothing around him, and as far as he knew nobody else on the planet. Out of other ideas, he walked over to the craft about 100 meters away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a single seat, a small donut fuel tank, a haphazard collection of\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and \u0027Ant\u0027 engines, a couple of lights, a cheap antenna, and some sort of guidance system. \u0022Hey\u0022 a voice crackled over a headset attached to the seat. \u0022Anyone there? Can you hear me? Tim?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTim picked up the mic, \u0022Mhm,\u0022 he reported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, get in. We\u0027re getting you out of here.\u0022 This seemed fairly reasonable, so Tim gently flipped the craft over and climbed into the seat. The voice was back, \u0022just sit there, you don\u0027t have to do anything. We\u0027re going to pilot this thing remotely. I\u0027m Val, by the way. Valentina, but call\u00A0me Val.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mmk\u0022 replied Tim.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft lurched violently upwards and into the the air.\u00A0As there was no air it really felt like Tim was immediately thrown off the surface and accelerating\u00A0into space. Which, technically, he was. The craft accelerated for fifteen seconds or so up and towards the mountain before the engines cut out. He drifted there, in the quiet, and for a moment could really take in all the beauty around him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a while Val came back on the radio. \u0022So this is kind of awkward,\u0022 there was a pause. \u0022You have some monopropellant in your suit, right? You might need to use that.\u0022 Tim\u00A0experienced a sudden rush of adrenaline and his eyeballs nearly bulged out of his head.\u00A0\u0022It looks like the rover is out of fuel. Your trajectory will take you pretty close to our ship, you are a couple of degrees west right now, but all you\u0027ll need to do is slow yourself down.

In the distance, there was a long ridge, and just beyond that he could start to make out one of the flats. He slowly climbed out of the seat and pushed the empty rover away. If he closed his eyes, he felt like he was just on a routine space walk. He turned on his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack and activated the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E option in his wrist console. He opened his eyes again, and in the distance maybe 10 km away saw what must be the rescue vehicle. It was coming closer, but so was the ground. He glanced at his groundspeed indicator. 136 m/s. He took a deep breath. No big deal, he thought, he was merely rushing towards the barren rocky surface of a moon 46 million meters away from home at nearly 500 kilometers per hour.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter twenty seconds of leaning heavily on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, his harness was digging badly into his legs and armpits, but the ground was moving at a much more reasonable 25 meters per second. After several\u00A0more long puffs he landed, his tanks a little less than a third full, a few hundred meters away from the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FTFOZEL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022101.00\u0022 height=\u0022806\u0022 width=\u0022798\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FTFOZEL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts hull was impressive, a Mk-3 body flanked by two Mk-2 cockpits. An engine cluster wrapped around two large drills that were spitting chunks of dirt and rock around the base of the ship. Looming above an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit whined, pumping ore up and fuel throughout the craft like a beating heart.\u00A0In the radio in his helmet, he heard Val again. \u0022Hey, you landed!

It\u00A0blasted off with Valentina, Bob, Bill, Jebediah, Tim, and some twenty other kerboknauts on board to rejoin its modules in orbit. Once back together, Valentina isolated herself in the viewing cuppola with her maps and mission paperwork. It was the only place on the crowded craft she felt like could get some privacy.\u00A0She studied the contracts she was supposed to fulfill, the positions of the various planets relative to Kerbin, the fuel each would require to reach, the probability of successfully reaching a spot she could refuel before running out of fuel; the parameters were beginning to feel overwhelming.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTim settled into the spacious passenger cabin. Roughly half the seats were empty, so he picked a window seat near the back with an empty row. He put his EVA suit in the overhead compartment and settled into the cozy seat. He was so happy to be going home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*ding* \u0022Hello, this is your pilot speaking\u0022 *ding*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe chatter in the cabin dropped immediately.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*ding* \u0022For our first destination we will be travelling to Duna.

Now it made sense, the grim resolve in the eyes of his fellow passengers. Out of ideas, he reached for the in-flight catalog and began to browse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KhEgfui.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002259.60\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 width=\u00221146\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KhEgfui.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterplanetary 2 drifted just outside of Minmus\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.

As he undocked the survey probe and fired up the engines, he realized the fuel tank was already nearly empty. Nobody had disabled the fuel crossfeed through the coupling, so the probe fuel tanks had been drained in the escape from Kerbin. When the main vessel\u00A0went to refuel on Minmus, it left the probes in space, so their tanks were never\u00A0filled up.

Zelgun and Fredbles looked out the cupola as as the mothership performed a retrograde burn into the mountains below. There was a wide bright pink area on the resource overlay on top of what looked like a range of hills. Surely, Val thought, that big area around the top would be flat enough to land on. Once they were below 1000 m it was clear this was not the case, but fuel was running low and they would need to stick the landing. After a couple of bounces\u00A0they came to a rest and were able to\u00A0stay upright. Bob mumbled something\u00A0about how they had plenty of fuel for a slow landing, yet they still nearly all died from coming down on terrain. Val was quiet after that.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ABl84aG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.97\u0022 height=\u0022620\u0022 width=\u0022827\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ABl84aG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew set about collecting science and refueling the tanks.\u00A0After two full Ike days they were ready to head back to orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they reconnected to the modules in orbit Val ordered the tanks in the main vessel be emptied into the probe array and science module, then led her crew\u00A0back to the surface to refuel a second time. It was safer to be topped up, she thought, than not. Also the crew was practicing. Each ascent and descent felt sharper, more on-point. Like performing drills at the academy, she thought. It was all about repetition,\u00A0attention to detail, and never being satisfied that that you are close enough. And they were going to need the practice sooner than any of them realized.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter two ascents and descents on Ike, Val made a heading for Duna. She popped out of Ike\u0027s orbit on the wrong side so there was a steep descent from high in Duna\u0027s orbit into the mid-atmosphere. Nothing in her flight manifest\u00A0mentioned that Duna had an atmosphere. She scribbled in the margins that it starts at 50k meters, so it is important to stay above that if you want to stay in orbit. Outside, a backup solar array was shorn off by whistling aerodynamic forces as the orbital velocity indicator topped 1000 m/s. Bob seemed displeased.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship made it out of the atmosphere intact, ten minutes later Val switched on\u00A0the nukes until the problem was corrected. Science module and probes secured in orbit, the crew descended into Duna\u0027s atmosphere again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ekzFhT5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.19\u0022 height=\u0022751\u0022 width=\u0022925\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ekzFhT5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tanks were heavy on liquid fuel and light on oxidizer, so the nukes stayed on pretty much the whole way down. Val switched on the poodles periodically and then the vectors as they reached 1000 m altitude. The crater she chose to land on, the Midland Sea, was deep and flat enough for an easy touchdown. In the distance, she saw the mouth of a canyon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob climbed out of the cockpit to begin\u00A0collecting samples.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as he closed the hatch, they heard a clear *Thud* *Crash* *Thump*. *Ouch!*\u00A0\u0022Plenty of gravity here,\u0022 called Bob on the radio. He planted a flag and collected some rocks from the ground near the ship. Returning to the hatch required leaning constantly on his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u0022We really could use a ladder next time\u0022 he remarked to anyone who was listening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRefueling the ship took a full day, but soon the crew was ready again to depart. On the ascent IP2 did a backflip in the atmosphere at around 6000 meters. Val flipped on the Vector engines to regain control when the nose was pointing roughly prograde again, and before long they were reunited with their companions in orbit. Most of their oxidizer they had just refilled was spent escaping Duna, though, so they were due for another pit stop at Ike before they could do anything else. Before that, Val decided to send an ion-drive probe back to Kerbin with the results of the thirty or so experiments they had collected. She radioed Bill to tell him to prepare the data and told Jeb to get the probe ready.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nData stored securely in the probe, Jeb fired the decoupler, which it was attached with instead of docking port to save weight. When decoupled, however, there was a collision with a probe below that triggered a large explosion,\u00A0destroying\u00A0one of the communications relays and tearing\u00A0off half of the solar panels on the ion probe. Jeb ran some diagnostics on it when the dust settled, and reported that with the missing panels the probe was lighter than before and still had enough electrical power to run the engine full-throttle. Sometimes, Jeb joked, an explosion is an upgrade.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis joviality didn\u0027t last long, though, when he realized the probe was missing an antenna. Was that lost in the explosion? Bill inspected the three remaining probes in the cluster. Nope, just bad design. Disappointed, they recovered the data in the probe and sent it out empty, just to see how far it might get with only the built-in 5k antenna. Surprisingly, it still had a very faint connection\u00A0by the time it left Duna\u0027s orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew\u00A0had a new instruction from Kerbin. Mission command decided Ike was an ideal spot to leave the science module for further research. Fredbles and Zelgun were excited, they liked Ike. Who doesn\u0027t like Ike? Pilots in the cabin of IP2 were asked if anyone wanted to stay behind with the scientists and command the station and make sure the scientists didn\u0027t get too distracted. Tamara volunteered, and since nobody else seemed to want to do it, that settled it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe research station included two landers each with a pair of external command seats. Fully fueled, they had about 1300 m/s of delta-V, plenty to descend from a 350 m/s orbit and return. With the fuel in the station available also, the kerboknauts left at Ike should have supplies for at least three or four trips to the surface to gather data before they will need to be resupplied.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LO8sN7e.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002286.93\u0022 height=\u0022951\u0022 width=\u00221094\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LO8sN7e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun rose over Ike\u0027s rocky horizon as Interplanetary 2 descended to the surface for a third and final time. Once they were full again, Val thought, all she needed to do was figure out where they are going next, and how to get there, and eventually, how they were going to get home. No need to worry about that now, though, she thought. Just take it one\u00A0planet at a time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Popestar","CreatedById":192906,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-14T21:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I didn\u0027t do a whole lot today.\u00A0 I upgraded the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the launchpad, so they are both at level 2 now.\u00A0 And I undertook another contract to ferry a few tourists into orbit; I needed the funds after the upgrades, so while boring it was ok.\u00A0 I was also able to get Valentina to level up, so she now has the Prograde and Retrograde buttons.\u00A0 Man, does that make it easy to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next thing is to now go over the tutorials both in-game and the ones here on the forum about getting to the Mun and back.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got a contract I can pick up for that, but unlike the last one I saw, this one actually requires you to land on the Mun.\u00A0 So I have to go through the tutorials a few times and see how to do this.\u00A0 I might even go sandbox once or twice to get the hang of it before I do this in career.\u00A0 I can easily enough limit myself to what I have in career; my big things are going to be flying backwards to land on the moon, as well as calculating trajectory and intercept positions and all.\u00A0 If I can get that done, I can then do this in career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
