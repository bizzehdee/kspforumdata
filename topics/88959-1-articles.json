It has science capacity and can house up to 36 Kerbals. It even has an Interplanetary Shuttle on one of it\u0027s docking ports. 6 large orange fuel tanks on the other end (not visible) for refueling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for the IKSS is (my dream at the moment) that when new solar systems are introduced this will act as a forward base for refuelling.

I have a special Anti-Matter mining station in an high orbit around Moho, maybe ill post a picture of that to!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
