Easiest way to recreate would be just stick some wings on the back of two orange tanks in the SPH.

That way, you can enter the atmosphere at higher drag, slow down to a little above your desired target velocity, go to low drag, and not lose much velocity coming through the remaining atmosphere.

If you create a craft that is streamlined one way but not another (like a plane, not so streamlined with the belly straight into the wind) you can simply use your attitude to regulate your drag. Be mindful of aerodynamic stability, stall angles, etc. though, those will affect what attitudes you can hold. If you have some geometry altering mod available (Infernal Robotics or TT MultiWheels contain such capability, and some parts packs like B9 have effective air brake parts) , you can set your ship geometry to high drag for the braking, staying mindful of what that will do to your center of drag - if it moves ahead of your center of mass, you are having a bad problem and will not be going (back) to space today (iow, your ship will flip out and kill everyone).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T21:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@nhnifong: \u003C/strong\u003ECurrently no, but I can set up a mediafire folder for that purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@cartographer: \u003C/strong\u003EThat is a known issue that I am looking into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@wased89: \u003C/strong\u003EThat is also a known issue, though I\u0027m not sure what the cause is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asmi","CreatedById":59068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T00:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello \u003Cstrong\u003Eferram\u003C/strong\u003E!

With the drag reduced to realistic levels for aerodynamic vehicles, that 1 km/s drops away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, none of these numbers have any dependency on the actual parts used (well, except for the drag loses); with FAR it will always take less dV to get to orbit than in stock, so long as stock has its crazy-large drag.
