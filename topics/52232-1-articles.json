To think of the order of magnitudes here, a sphere with 1sqm cross-sectional area at this velocity would be experiencing 18MN of force (10 Mainsails equivalent), and would require about 144GW to combat drag. Clearly anything we know of will vaporize at such energies, I\u0027m just interested in what happens outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T21:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m imagining a perpetual shooting star.
