This minimizes fuel consumption and waste heat production. The only time they will operate at 100% is when the power demand requires it. You will see this happen when you have a transceiver set to transmit or when you have electric engines at maximum power (and haven\u0027t reached their caps). Otherwise it throttles them back to only use what is needed. (Ex. 2.5 Fusion with thermal gen powering a Vista usually runs at about 86% if I remember correctly)\u003Cp\u003EThe generators can be tricky, they seem to always default to the mode I don\u0027t want them running in.

Thing is, I\u0027m not given the choice to swap mode in the VAB by right-clicking on the generators, although upon testing, I was able to do that in sandbox mode. I think I might not have the technology for swapping yet - I\u0027m still using Brayton Cycle Gas Turbines. That hasn\u0027t stopped them from going into charged electron mode (more often than not, actually), and my test rig of a 3.75m FR with one Turbine on top and one on the bottom plus a cryostat and some radiators will have the generator on top operate at \u002230.4%\u0022 and produce 4.43GW (max 5.54) and the one on the bottom operate at \u002285%\u0022 and producing 3.10 GW (max 3.10). This fits nicely with the generator producing 14.6GW of heat and 3.6GW of charged particles, and it is the behavior I\u0027m after. However, as soon as I start building the rig out to make my Uranus lander, both the generators start operating at \u002285%\u0022 and produce 1.55GW each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre they even supposed to be able to use charged particles when not upgraded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teepee2345","CreatedById":98846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T13:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy ISRU Refinery will not do anything execpt mine uranium and thorium. can someone plz tell me how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T13:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agost\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agost\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t have enough time to bring other kerbals there... can I edit the electric charge from persistent.sfs?
