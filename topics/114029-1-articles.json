Now it would be a problem if they were working backward, i.e changing the flight model to what it was pre 1.0. For better or worse they are making these changes based on what they believe will make it better, and im sure they dont make these decisions lightly, it is work they have to put in and time they take away working on other aspects of the game. So the best advice is to back up you games and if you really like some designs you have come up with, adapt them for the new game, gives something to do so that cant be bad, heck my entire KSP folder is over 20 gigs at this point. have been keeping them since .15 and all the mods still go back to my mir station that I made in like .17 when the docking mods first came out. ~shudders~ dear lord that is unstable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-edit- also I wouldnt expect U5 to break saves, they arent completely changing things like they did for 1.0, although they might have to, so i wouldnt be surprised, just dont expect it.
