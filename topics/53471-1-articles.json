I just assumed that it was at least internally consistent (eg an object with Mass: 4.0 was four times heavier than something with Mass: 1.0) but could not confidently plug these numbers into any equations.

The Gigantor solar array, the most powerful electrical source in the game, produces 18.0/sec (1,080/min). The weakest sources are the RTG and OX-STAT panels at 45/min (0.75/sec).
