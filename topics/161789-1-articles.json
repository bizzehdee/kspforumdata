There\u0027s precious little flat ground, and it\u0027s very difficult to tell from orbit how slopey your landing site will be. The good news is there\u0027s a half-dozen solutions, but none of them are magic bullets. Hopefully they\u0027ll give you a starting point for thoughts on new designs! Also, unless you have a play-style reason against, I\u0027d say don\u0027t be afraid to test your craft ideas in a sandbox mode with cheats to get a feel for things. Making the idea-design-test-result cycle quicker can make a surprisingly big impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENo-tip lander options\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Scout ahead. Send out comsats and rovers to scout out landing sites in advance. Finding flat-ish ground can really make all the difference\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Broaden the leg-base of your lander. Depending on the size of your craft, you can replace taller fuel tanks with a few more stout tanks attached radially near the bottom. You can then put legs on these to make a squat, stout craft which will stay upright even on the steep slopes. These tanks will typically need aerodynamic cones for launch, but you can place your legs directly on these cones, so it\u0027s generally not a big deal during construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Increase springs on legs. If you\u0027re on a slantly slope, a higher spring constant will keep your rocket more orthogonal to the surface, rather than sagging downhill and tipping off balance. They also make you sproing off the surface like a super ball when you\u0027re trying to land, but you can\u0027t win \u0027em all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Add tons of maneuvering. With enough reaction wheels (anywhere) or manuevering jets near your rocket top, you can just let your rocket lay flat to land and then sit up off the surface when you\u0027re ready to go. This works better on smaller, stouter craft, where the 1.25m reaction wheel really works lovely for its size, and the torque required isn\u0027t too vast. On larger craft, a couple jettisonable twitches near the top can serve a similar role.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Use airplane landing gear rather than legs. They naturally stick out, rather than almost straight down so it\u0027s much easier to get a broad base with them! Just make sure to account for the added weight, and pull them out of the tank like they want to be when you first place them. It looks a little silly, but it works nicely. Don\u0027t forget to apply the brakes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Go to Minmus instead. *cough* It\u0027s got lots of nice flat places for easy landing, and is generally a much nicer trip. It\u0027s harder to get into its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReentry from Mun options\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Multi-pass through the upper atmosphere ~35-45km. This will bleed off the speed slowly, and create less heating all at once. The downside, of course, is it\u0027ll bleed off the speed slowly. I tend to put my final pass in the 22-28km altitude ballpark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Lots of empty fuel tanks can help slow you down if your trajectory isn\u0027t too steep; this works well with the multi-pass. In this case, it\u0027s best to fly \u0027broad side of the barn\u0027 style to catch all the wind you can to slow down. For this, make sure to bring plenty of batteries, or have a way to recharge between passes (solar panels). Especially in this case, you can use body lift from your craft to control your trajectory. Making your craft a front-slash into the wind will make it lift up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Retro-boost before entering the atmosphere. By bleeding off a few hundred m/s, you can often make easy work of an otherwise tricky reentry, or save yourself a couple passes. It wastes deltaV of course! If you happen to have extra fuel in the tanks, I\u0027d say no harm done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Use heat shields. In this case, you wouldn\u0027t so-much need to use them for their ablator, but instead for their high thermal tolerance. By removing most of their ablator, you can reduce their impact on your deltaV budget. The downside of the heat shields is they\u0027re very slippy aerodynamically, so you won\u0027t get much upper-atmosphere slowing with them. This can actually turn into a downside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Put your kerbal in the service bay... There, I said it! Command chairs in service bays are so effective at reentry, that many consider them cheaty. I consider it funny! To be honest, it\u0027s probably best to avoid this for your first journey, but be aware that it exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Use fins as makeshift airbrakes. While this doesn\u0027t work with basic fins, structural D wings can be used as makeshift airbrakes from Mun return velocities. It\u0027s considerably more difficult than the other options, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. If you\u0027re in the lower atmosphere but lawn-darting down to Kerbin, you often have a better chance of survival out of the craft than in. Bail! This will always work over water, and works maybe half of the time over land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It\u0027s KSP, so there\u0027s of course other options for all these, too. Hopefully something sounds fun and useful for your case. Best of luck!
