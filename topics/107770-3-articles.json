This is going to be great!\n\nIn the series the idea is that they are peaceful explorers that have to stand their ground against the evil Hanlon Corperation. A bit like Star Trek is about exploring the universe and bettering humanity and how things sooner or later involve guns and big sticks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I rewatched it. It\u0027s amazing how much the series evolved as it went on. It\u0027s like he stumbled across the story and just ran with it. That season one ending is still oddly powerful.\n\nI completely agree. I think it\u0027s the fact that the story is let off the rails. The outcome is undecided, and that you\u0027ve got Macey going up against serious firepower. He pushed himself, and it paid off in spades. And it ties in well with the story. I always thought the whole sequence with Shelbus and the Isprit was very well done, and the way that the whole \u0027traitor\u0027 arc developed was excellent. It was never cheesy, or melodramatic, or pushed on the audiance; just something he mentioned and spoke about occasionally. And then it blows up all at once. It worked so well. \n\nOf course, the ultimate storytelling trick is that Macey went and vanished for a year and now we\u0027ve all got nostalgia ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T21:59:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Asmayus**"},{"CreatedByName":"ImperialistPigDog","CreatedById":60825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:51:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E guns and big sticks.\n\nMy favorite type of tools.\n\n![gPEw3uA.png](http://i.imgur.com/gPEw3uA.png)\n\nI guess now that Maceys back we should prepare our ships for submissions!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T22:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ImperialistPigDog**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:26:03Z","Content":"![4ntOLpDh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4ntOLpDh.jpg)\n\nSame."},{"CreatedByName":"ImperialistPigDog","CreatedById":60825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:28:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/4ntOLpDh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4ntOLpDh.jpg)\n\u003E Same.\n\nSleek looking ship my friend!
