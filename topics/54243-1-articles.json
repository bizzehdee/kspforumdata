As mentioned above, you can get around this with the totally overpowered reactors and such from the Interstellar mod, but that\u0027s just ridiculous. So I myself just use the power parts from Near Future itself. These make lots more juice than stock parts but WAY less than Interstellar. They\u0027re heavy enough to really limit the number of engines you can run with them, and this in turn still keeps ship size down. However, if you don\u0027t need a really huge ship, you can get quite a lot of use from these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, Bop and Pol have such low gravity that you can use ion-powered landers for them. And if your main Jool base is at Laythe and you need to move Kerbals out to use the ion landers at Pol and Bop, you can make an ion-powered crew shuttle. You need to keep the total mas down to no more than about 6 tons to have any sort of reasonable burn times (5-10 minutes for transfers between Joolean moons). If you add more engines to increase the thrust, the added weight of the reactors needed to power them more than offsets the extra thrust. Still, within these limitations, such ion-powered ships are quite useful for such applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7362/10896162845_9745045370_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210896162845_9745045370_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShuttle for 4 Kerbals in lawn chairs, 6-ton, 4x Near Future ion engines, 2x Near Future mid-size reactors.
