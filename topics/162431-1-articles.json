Maybe, It would be nice to build a probe, take screenshots and pretend It\u0027s a telescope\u00A0or Imitate gravity with a spinning disc orbiting Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I created this mission Idea. My suggestion is to just that! Create a vessel and do something interesting with it, maybe use some\u00A0existing in game science equipment, like the readings on the thermometer or double-C Seismic accelerometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COB Gaming","CreatedById":179224,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-28T12:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds fun!
