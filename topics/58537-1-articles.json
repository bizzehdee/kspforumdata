It also opens up the possibility of an addon updater -- either official or third-party. The \u0022Optional metadata\u0022 section is intended primarily for future third-party use -- e.g. perhaps in conjunction with one of said addon updaters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequiring the \u0022License\u0022 field helps maintain the current forum requirements of no downloads without a license.

Clicking on an addon shows the author/title/description/license/URL. Clicking the URL opens that website (probably Kerbal Space Port or a forum thread here) in the default browser. If the addon has a \u0027license.txt\u0027 file in the root, clicking on the license displays it. Addons that are out-of-date (wrong KSP version in manifest), are missing a license, or are missing a required dependency can all be denoted here. (If there\u0027s a minor bugfix update to KSP, it can still consider addons prior to the bugfix update as \u0022current\u0022). If two addons are both enabled and either lists the other as incompatible, this should also be indicated. Users should still be able to try to enable any addon that fails any of these requirements (\u0022So this part pack hasn\u0027t been updated in 6 months but still works fine and I want to use it\u0022). Addons lacking a manifest file entirely (e.g. any addon prior to this system being introduced) are also considered out-of-date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the \u0022Resume Saved\u0022 screen, have the option to view/adjust the list of addons that game is using. If any addons it uses are not available or out-of-date, warn the user before starting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen actually starting the game, load all enabled addons, etc., and such. This means that the normal loading time when starting KSP is mostly offloaded to when loading a game. Since addons are per-game, actions like quickload, revert, etc. shouldn\u0027t require a full loading phase and should take roughly the same amount of time as they do now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
