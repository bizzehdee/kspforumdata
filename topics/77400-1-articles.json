You want it a little behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using all stock parts, then you will want to remove the small gear bay when adjusting CoM/CoL/CoT because the editors lie about where the CoM is.

(Which makes it more unstable.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree engines will sometimes result in off center thrust for planes (depending on the configuration).

The three T45s have loads more thrust than you need for re-entry and landing, nowhere near enough fuel for even a reasonable flight to line-up and approach. At about 1/3rd throttle I found it just about manageable but the CoT is above the CoM, tending to push the nose down. This may explain why you found it ok with the CoL so far forward - it\u0027s actually in front of the CoM in the SPH (I moved it to check and try a few things), but I still had to move the wings back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooo - I repeat, \u0022the Mk3 stuff in particular is horrible to work with\u0022. Odd that you modded the fuselage to hold fuel AND oxidiser but the ratio should be 9:11, not 1:1, so the engines can\u0027t burn it all anyway. Consider what you want this vehicle to do, on its own. It\u0027s main requirement is to fly/glide from re-entry to line-up and land so design it first as an aircraft, in the SPH. Get used to making planes that are stable, controllable and LIGHT. Once you have a design you like start thinking about how you can get them into space - this is where most people find out that the shuttle design is very hard without mods. Instead try a spaceplane approach, if you like flight simulators, or a recoverable rocket - anything from parachute-only to powered-landing a la SpaceX grasshopper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T03:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kebra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kebra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is a shuttle im looking to build. \u0022First Contract\u0022 seems to be targetted heavily towards reusable \u0022space crafts\u0022.
