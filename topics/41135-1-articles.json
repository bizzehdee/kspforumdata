It simply incorporates a more realistic drag model. The shape of your rocket will factor in to the drag model with FAR. I\u0027ve yet to try it. I hear its a bit hit and miss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T13:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs fir that what Motokid said. It adds a more realistic lift/drag model to the atmospheres of the planets. Imho it is way more difficult to get aerodynamic Frames working there, but it feels quite more realistic compared to vanilla System. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, the bulkier your ship, the more it is affected by heavy drag influence. Asparagus designs still work fine, just dont use full throttle if not necessary, the key word is \u0022terminal Speed\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: the kraken eaten some of mah letters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
