There are two basic entries in the franchise, as well as a couple expansions for the first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first game was called Descent: Freespace- The Great War\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second game was simply called Descent: Freespace 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re quite undoubtedly the best spacefighter-sim arcade games EVER made, bar none. I highly recommend looking them up if you\u0027ve never heard of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I went and bought Freespace 2 on Good Old Games (I used to repeatedly borrow my library\u0027s copy of Descent: Freespace- The Great War, back when I was a kid- so I already had experience with the series). I\u0027m looking for team-mates for the multiplayer, which has both co-op and team head-to-head modes, using the latest Open Source Project version (3.7.x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love it if some people here would show some interest in getting the game (only $9.99, for one of the best games EVER made \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gog.com/game/freespace_2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.gog.com/game/freespace_2\u003C/a\u003E ) and playing some multiplayer with me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost your replies below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T23:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
