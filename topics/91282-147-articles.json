But the equation that Ars posted isn\u0027t Buck\u0027s equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see here that they use a the \u0022Magnus-Tetens formula\u0022 to get Psat, then they derive the rest of the equation from the ideal gas law and the physical characteristics of air and water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe equation you referenced is a replacement for step 3. It\u0027s a different equation to find Psat as a function of temperature. That\u0027s still only one step of linking RH to absolute humidity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTetens formula is another empirical formula, which is also just a result of fitting. Except, you can clearly see that they are using Buck\u0027s parameters, which might actually make the resulting equation they give not only empirical, but also incorrect. Though, it\u0027s probably within error bars, anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for formula to be anything but empirical, and for the constants within to have meaning, it has to be derived from first principles, with only numbers present being either fundamental constants or unit conversions. For example, the ideal gas constant is just Boltzman constant per mole. Both of these are just unit conversions, and basically relate temperature to kinetic energy of a mole of gas. In natural units, R = 1. That makes Ideal Gas Law an actual first principles equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take observational data, fit it to an arbitrary formula, and get the parameters that way, no matter how much derivation and manipulation you do afterwards, it\u0027s just an empirical formula. And the parameters in it are just as arbitrary as the initial fitting parameters were. There is no hidden meaning behind any of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmpirical formulas are useful. I don\u0027t mean to knock them. But when somebody asks what the numbers in the formula mean, the answer is nothing. They are just fitting parameters to make the observation data fit the equation.
