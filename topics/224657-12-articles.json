I\u0027m no software engineer but, referring to the thread title - is this sort of game actually not feasible given current- or next-gen hardware? Even with a bespoke engine, is the sort of calculation required to achieve what Simpson et al promised not actually possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain speaking as a layman, is there some inherent limitation to how the numbers are crunched (floating-point accuracy?) or the way that is implemented that means there is no way to accurately place two craft next to each other when they are further than (x) distance from an origin. Or, is the Rask / Rusk / spacecraft construction a variation on the three-body problem? Or, do we need to actually do what KSP2 proposed and constantly compute everything all the time everywhere, and that\u0027s a fundamentally unsolvable issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad bravely tried and approximated it, IG repeated all the same mistakes only worse. Is there another way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not about the hardware. There\u0027s a lot of games more complex than KSP/2 out there, even without being spaceflight simulators (please don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the hard part, it\u0027s not). This is just them choosing, probably by virtue of needing to GET GAME OUT FAST, the worst possible way to do things, in an engine known for not being good at using multiple cores of modern CPUs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding multiplayer itself, it\u0027s achievable with some caveats like the delegation of collision calculations. Say we\u0027re playing on a server and I launch a missile at you: for most of the interaction, your craft would probably be just a single rigid body to my machine, and me and the missile would be the same to you. At the moment of computing the impact, I need to stream the craft data to the server (or to you, depending on architecture), for proper physics calculation of the impact. This is how you avoid all clients having to do all the calculation work. There\u0027s a myriad of engineering/crafting games that work just fine regarding this, even to really big scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for coordinate accuracy, it\u0027s irrelevant. In the same way my PC calculates my own physics and not yours, your craft would be a protovessel on my side, condemned to a single point in the scaled-space planetarium (remember that for a single player, the universe revolves around them). Right now the only problem is coordinate resets at like 2500 meters which is the point where unity begins to drop precision, and so the scene is moved to recenter the rover in it, causing it to jolt a bit or even just to get flung away. Again, in multiplayer it\u0027d still be me doing my own calculations so you\u0027d see my rover bugging out but they wouldn\u0027t affect your rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRask \u0026amp; Rusk... yeah, no idea how they were gonna do that without either a half-baked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E abuse implementation, or actually making the jump to proper numeric integration. Orbits inside a binary system can get pretty complex and there\u0027s a ton of cases a simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E spaghetti wouldn\u0027t solve. I\u0027m really pretty sure this is why we never heard of those two past promotional material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we need to compute every part of every vessel at every point? Probably not. KSP1 worked believably enough except for solar panels not getting updated as the sun left them. Trust under warp could probably use some logic shortcuts if we can put up with fuel drain being not perfectly realistic for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the day we can speculate endlessly but if nobody is actually sitting down to solve those problems, there\u0027s no point collectively bashing our heads to think of solutions that won\u0027t be implemented anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T23:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388754\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715382959\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust under warp could probably use some logic shortcuts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan it?
