So a fully lit digit, i.e. an 8 ignoring any decimal points for now, 140mA.

Given i\u0027m currently powering by USB and that itself can only supply 500mA, the max current sourced from the \u002B5V pin is less than that nominal value since I assume the atmega and other components on the arduino also consume some current.
