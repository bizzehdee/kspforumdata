I used to do it with FAR, but now my parachutes all burn up from radiant heat before I can use them. I did an experiment with a simple MK1 command pod and Mk16 parachute and so long as you have the heat shield attached to the bottom, you can reenter without any problems. But if you want to reenter with some engines attached it does not work.\n\nYou can attach a heat shield to the top of the pod and reenter the other way around, but then it\u0027s not aerodynamic for the launch, so I guess you can put a cone on to of that.\n\nJust wondering what solutions you have found. I also wanted to bring my ship home with three Sci Jr\u0027s attached, but not sure I could do that with the heat. Also, seeing as you cannot control how boosters fall after release, not sure if a heat shield would help there.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:28:10Z","Content":"In 1.0.2 you don\u0027t need a heat shield.

Capsules are supposed to come down flat side first, not pointy side first. Top-mounted parachutes, or laterally-mounted chutes on the top of the capsule, will be occluded from the airstream by the pod. They could be burned off by heat conduction from the pod, if it gets hot enough, but I\u0027ve never seen that happen.\n\n(In most cases if you de-orbit an rocket, rather than just a capsule, the aerodynamic forces will try to get it to flip point-down. That might be okay if you\u0027ve got a top-mounted heat shield as you propose, but otherwise it\u0027s something to be avoided, because it puts the vulnerable top of the capsule and parachute pods in the airstream. Careful handling and careful SAS use are enough to keep some vehicles steady.)\n\nYou can definitely reenter from orbit without needing a heat shield, if you keep your orientation right. I haven\u0027t tried a hard reentry from a lunar return transfer, that might be too much for an unshielded pod. You may also have more need for a heat shield if, for instance, you\u0027ve got an instrument bay underneath your pod that you want to reach the ground uncooked."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:48:23Z","Content":"Engine \u003E tank \u003E service bay w/parachutes \u003E probe core \u003E heat shield?

I put the shield on anyway and it burns up more with a shallower re-entry (which makes some sense) but it generally isn\u0027t essential at this time. Just make sure, if you have a pilot of lvl1 and up, to have them point the craft retrograde or do it manually.\n\nI *have* had chutes burn up, but it was with a test flight that went straight up and fell back from an altitude of 600km, gaining a lot of speed in the process. I\u0027ve also had them burn up a couple of times when I couldn\u0027t maintain retrograde orientation and they got destroyed due to being right in the drag cone. Other than these, I\u0027ve noticed that even the science jr, with a heat tolerance of 1200 degrees, will still survive reentry. I\u0027m assuming this is because it gets rid of heat fast, as opposed to chutes and certain other parts, but that\u0027s just my assumption."},{"CreatedByName":"Vansky","CreatedById":143179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:09:52Z","Content":"During my test the capsule was fine, but I believe the radiant heat destroyed the shutes. They were not deployed. I even tried to deploy the top shute to see if that would help, but the shute would burn up before 0.2 (or whatever the default atmosphere limit) was reached. So from reading the patch notes etc. my assumption is that without a heat shield, the pod itself gets a lot hotter, transferring some of the thermal heat to the shutes. The temp on both the lateral as well as top mounted shutes goes above the limit.\n\nFor my simple test, I just just took the pod straight up to 80K, then back down with the flat bit pointing down as it should be in real life. With the heat shield the reentry is painless, without it the shutes burn up long before I can deploy them.\n\nI am wondering what the defaults are for the thermal settings. Mine might have gotten messed up somehow.\n\nMy settings are:\n\nRadiation Factor: 1.000\n\nConduction Factor: 10.000\n\nConvection Factor: 40.000\n\nGeneration Factor: 0.030\n\nAero Heating Production: 1.000\n\nI was also wondering if you could put your shutes in a service bay to protect them, but not sure you can mount or even deploy them."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:35:12Z","Content":"That would be an interesting thing to try.

I was developing a 5t launcher and for the payload I had a Mk 1 Pod, two Mk2 Radial parachutes, a service bay with some batteries, mecjeb etc, fuel, engine, RCS. Then on top of the pod I put a small separator, a heat shield, a larger separator and a nose cone. After getting to orbit, I got rid of the nose cone, freeing the heat shield. Then after braking burn, turned pro-grade. I watched the temp of the radial shutes and they never went above 500C. Only odd thing that happened is that when I deployed the shutes, one of them said it could not deploy while stowed. It was on the side of the pod, well away from the storage bay and at the same spot as the other shute. I opened the bay doors and then I could deploy. Seems like a bit of a bug, but shows that you can probably put a parachute in a storage bay, then open the doors when you want to deploy.\n\nSo my rocket was a bit more complicated, but still works. I actually enjoyed the challenge to get it right. Now I have to figure out how to bring a Mun lander back to Kerbin. Either that, or do an Apollo style setup with a lander, command pod combo. Would be fun to try. That and a space station with a mobile lab to process all the science brought back."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:26:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had the \u0022cannot deploy while stowed\u0022 weirdness happen to me as well and it was partially why Valentina died (you will be missed ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)).
