All of the stock windows work, just not any that were added by the mods. Has anyone else had an issue like this? Someone over in the Reddit forums suggested it was because I didn\u0027t have the font \u0027Arial\u0027 but I pulled up Word and I have the font so it should work in KSP, no? Any other suggestions?![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"}]}
