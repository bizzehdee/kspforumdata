Unless you want to lose about 30% of your RCS thrust, the quads have to be placed at the compass directions of the craft, which looks wrong if you\u0027re running a ladder down one of those directions, and if you use any parts that have hatches in line with the ladder (hitchhiker or lab modules, for example), this can lead to you accidentally placing a quad over a hatch, rendering the hatch unusable for egress from the module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T20:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that the circles on the front/rear of the pod are actually going to be hatches at some point - once this happens, the side hatch will probably get removed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T20:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that the circles on the front/rear of the pod are actually going to be hatches at some point - once this happens, the side hatch will probably get removed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if it will get removed, but might become less important yes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T21:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022S4qFBxkFFg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that the circles on the front/rear of the pod are actually going to be hatches at some point - once this happens, the side hatch will probably get removed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the hitchhiker module?
