If your course was true, you will be captured by the Mun\\\u0027s gravity - a green line intersecting the Mun means you are on a collision course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7b. Do not slow down until you are close to the Mun. If you slow down too early, you may end up mising the Mun and being set on a course to be flung into deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Once you are relatively close to the Mun (maybe about 20,000m) bring your ship to a halt. Face the rocket towards the retrograde (the yellow circle with a cross in it) and burn until your orbital speed is appoximately 150m/s. This is your first retrograde burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Once at 10,000m, perform a second retrograde burn. Bring speed down to 10m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10a. Once you are going slowly, it\\\u0027s time to elimate any horizontal movement. Aim the rocket at the retrograde, and begin performing a series of small retrograde burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10b. Each time the retrograde indicator moves from the centre of the navball, shut down engines and retarget it. The aim is to keep nudging the retrograde into the clear part of the navball (skyward).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10c. Keep checking your map. If you have done this right, the two blue lines should merge into one straight line between your rocket and the Mun\\\u0027s surface. This indicates you are falling directly towards the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Focus on keeping speed low (between 20m/s and 100m/s, depending on height), and on keeping the retrograde in the clear centre of the navball. Don\\\u0027t be afraid to perform more course corrections to keep your ship falling straight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12a. Below 500m, bring your speed down to less than 20m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12b. Below 100m, bring your speed down to less than 5m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12c. Below 50m, bring your speed down as low as you can. Ideally less than 1m/s at landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I haven\\\u0027t had any fully intact landings past this stage. But since refining my technique to the one used above, I have set the capsule down safely every time, even if the engines have snapped off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice (and a question to fellow players) past this stage, is to develop and test a landing system that can survive low velocity impacts with the Mun. I suspect that a low weight, wide based rocket is best for this (my current rocket still uses it\\\u0027s fairly hefty orbital and trans-orbital stage for landing, and the SAS landing cushion crumples under the weight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can imagine, the best way to return after a Mun landing would be to simply burn towards Kerbin when it is visible from the surface. Once you escape the Mun\\\u0027s gravity well, you should find yourself pulled back home. You may need to perform retrograde burns to bring your periapsis below 60,000m, and if your return rocket is too heavy, to slow down before landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that\\\u0027s help to some out there - I could definately have used the tips on cancelling horizontal movement above the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-08T23:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ET10, you\\\u0027re basically orbiting Kerbin slightly inside the orbit of the Mun, right?
