I enjoyed it enough to force my co-host on Geek Culture Happy Hour (podcast) to play it so we could give our thoughts on the game so far. We made a few converts out of our listeners and it seemed to be pretty well received.\n\nThe developers have done a great job but I have to give a huge thumbs up to the community of KSP. Who knew there would be a *science* to using *rockets*  when launching Kerbals into space but with the information here on the forums along with the friendliness of the community, makes the learning curve a little less steep.\n\nIf you want to listen to what we had to say about KSP, you can head over to \n\n[http://www.rawrcast.com/category/podcast/geekculturehh/](http://www.rawrcast.com/category/podcast/geekculturehh/)\n\nIts Episode 18-Full Metal Spaceship (We discussed Full Metal Jacket also, perfect combination ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T01:22:17Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nGlad to see KSP getting coverage.
