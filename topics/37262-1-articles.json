I\u0027ve been trying to recreate this on the Mun, but so far the rover has a tendency to lose control the first time it hits a bump going much more than 40 m/s. Does the Mun have any large ultraflat surfaces for rover racing like Minmus does?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T01:55:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Much more than 40m/s\u0022 you mean much more than 144km/h \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E Honestly, with the gravity on the Mun, it\u0027s normal to lose control at that speed. And no, considering the stock rover wheels have barely no (if not zero, I\u0027d need to check the cfg files) control at such speeds, I don\u0027T think you will find a place smooth enough for this kind of speed on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T01:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMun has a much more shallow hilly terrain than Minmus, you might try one of the two very large craters, (The \u0022Eyes of the Mun\u0022 sorta), they\u0027re the best place I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if your rover can go up to 40 m/s before it starts to lose control then you are doing very well indeed with that design!

You pretty much lose the ability to turn, but you can continue to accelerate at least. If you hit the slightest bump at those speeds, you\u0027ll go flying madly, which is why I\u0027m looking for flat Munar ground. What I\u0027m looking to do is less about turning and more about \u0022Munar land speed record\u0022, I didn\u0027t have high hopes, but I figured it was worth checking for the presence of some perfectly flat terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
