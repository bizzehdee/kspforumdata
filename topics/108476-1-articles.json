I didn\u0027t, but before i even found out who he was, i had already known about Cthulhu and his wonderful darkness. That\u0027s a testament, i think, to how successful he is now, and how utterly insignificant he was at the time of his death. A very, very interesting man indeed, HPL is the godfather of cosmic horror and undoubtedly go down in history as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is dedicated to the discussion of both him and his work, and our experiences with them. The first piece of his work i read was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_of_Erich_Zann\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E. A bit underwhelming, but kinda scary nonetheless. I especially like how he writes insane, arbitrary thoughts in a way that lets me actually comprehend it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
