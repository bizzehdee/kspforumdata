The game as you see it right now is just a short time before its full release, but still a beta. Not everything is tuned properly yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things that are not tuned properly are the administration strategies. The largest part of them is completely worthless, while a select few are game-breaking overpowered. There is not even a proper conversion ratio between the currencies - each strategy just randomly makes up some numbers. They\u0027re probably all just placeholders. Because of that, even though I know you want to play stock, I suggest adding one simple mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96230-0-90-Sane-Strategies-0-42-1-Dec-18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESane Strategies\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s just a simple set of config files that makes the administration strategies make sense. Each currency converts into one of the others at fixed rates that are shared across all strategies equally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile that\u0027s unlikely to fix your money problem, it\u0027ll at least ensure you\u0027re getting a fair deal no matter which strategy you like running with. Then it might even be worth to convert science into funds, too - after all, you\u0027re trying to upgrade the science facility, and until you do, accumulating more science is not going to get you anywhere. And there is a lot of science in this game. You can in fact complete the entire tech tree without going to any of the other planets, even if you never gain any science from contracts. There is absolutely no chance you can run out of science, so convert away!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo earn more money from contracts, el_coyoto has the basic tips down: try accepting contracts that go to the same places and complete them together. Try to improve your rocket construction, so that you can achieve the same missions with cheaper, smaller rockets. In my last playthrough, I made most of my cash with satellite launch missions using rockets that cost less than 3000 funds on the pad. And that\u0027s with satellites that actually had capabilities (I was using a mod that involves setting up commsats).
