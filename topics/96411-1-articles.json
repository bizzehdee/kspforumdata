I usually can\u0027t watch them, but it would be nice to know what they have been talking about there. On quite a few occasions I only found out about a few bits from the squad cast on the forums and I also missunderstod some discussions because I was missing an important piece of information :/ just guessing here, but I think that discussions would be more on-topic and productive if everyone had access to all the relevant bits\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T09:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the Kerbal Network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and yes, this would be wonderful)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T18:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve suggested this a couple of times, it\u0027s a very worthwhile idea imho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other podcasts available such as TB\u0027s co-optional podcast that livestream on twitch and then upload the podcast to youtube, so it is certainly doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T21:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamics discussion has been moved \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107082-Stock-Aero-News-from-the-Squadcast\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T22:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there. Thanks for the suggestion. This is something that\u0027s been brought up before, but we felt it to be a bit unnecessary at this time, because the archived versions on Twitch are generally readily available. This is something we will definitely keep consideration on, especially for all of KSP-TV\u0027s streamers, but for the time being, at least. if you\u0027d like to catch up on Squadcast, you can still find it on Twitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
