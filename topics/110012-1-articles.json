It was a fairly high orbit. Just for fun, I wanted to see what I could do with just EVA. So I piloted a ship so that it passed within 2km (thus \u0022waking up\u0022 the rescuee), but that\u0027s the only involvement that any craft had.\n\nHaving done that, the Kerbal was able to rescue herself from munar orbit with *no ship whatsoever.*\n\n1. She used EVA to accelerate to munar escape and get a Kerbin periapsis of ~45km.\n\n2. On entering atmosphere, she aerobraked as easy as a feather. No heating at all. Not even any Mach effects.\n\n3. She dropped into the ocean and survived impact. No special \u0022try to use EVA to slow the fall,\u0022 she just kerplunked in and was fine.\n\nThis seems completely ridiculous to me. Yeah, I know, it\u0027s a game, and though I like realism, I\u0027m fine with putting gameplay decisions above realism. But rescuing yourself from munar orbit without a ship? Seriously? It seems like poor gameplay-- what\u0027s the point of sending a ship up there if it\u0027s not actually needed? There was virtually no skill involved in any of this, other than being able to bring a craft within 2km of the rescuee (no need to match velocities).\n\nIMHO, they ought to do the following:\n\n- Nerf EVA dV. Lower it to, say, 100 m/s. That\u0027s still better than reality, but not so ludicrously overpowered.\n\n- Kerbals hitting atmosphere should heat up, and should have a very low heat tolerance. Re-entering without a ship should be deadly.\n\n- Falling at terminal velocity onto any surface (even water) should be, well, terminal.\n\nWhat do folks think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kystery","CreatedById":135332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T22:51:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E IMHO, they ought to do the following:\n\u003E - Nerf EVA dV.

Personally I use the VNG parachute mod to give them their own parachutes so bailing-out is a valid escape method in atmo, but it would be nice if they actually, you know, NEEDED the chutes. \n\nAs for the jetpack delta-v, I assume it was done that way to give Kerbals more freedom to jetpack around on low-gravity planets... having to actually walk several kilometers on the Mun for a survey contract would be unbelievably annoying (it\u0027s annoying enough on Kerbin!), so I guess I hope they don\u0027t change it. On the other hand I would be in favor of limited EVA fuel (say, you can only refuel from the pod two or three times rather than infinite times), to remove some of the exploity \u0022get-out-and-push\u0022 options for spacecraft rescue. \n\nAlthough orbital skydiving sounds fun. Must remember to try it before next update, on the off-chance they actually DO nerf Kerbal durability.\n\nPS.

You want to be careful about lowering their impact tolerances in case they get stuck in something and pop. I think letting them survive an orbital impact is a more preferable scenario then having them pop every time they accidentally clip a part. The first scenario can only really be caused by a conscious player action, whereas the second scenario can be caused by just having a part too close to the hatch. As for the reentry burn itself, if you have such a gentile reentry angle most parts will survive just fine, not just the kerbal. You set up a long cool aero-break, and making it more aggressive will make reentry in general more difficult. That is a hard line to balance. The only real solution is to make kerbals more dense, so they do not break as effectively, and carry more speed deeper into the atmo. Making kerbals more dense would also help with the EVA dv, since I believe their dv is calculated from their propellant reserve, mass and ISP. If you give them less MP you limit how long they can EVA, and since we have no real way to rescue a stranded kerbal (they cannot grab each other, or implement tethers) erroring on the side of too much is a gameplay decision to make up for that fact I think. \n\nSo yeah, while you could theoretically fix it in stock doing so would probably have a significant negative impact (i.e. more difficult, with greater impact from bugs) on gameplay in other areas. It is better to leave EVA self rescue as a player choice than to remove it and make people frustrated with the unintended side effects."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:55:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, you just ruined jetpacking in low gravity bodies, so no thanks.

Rovers are useful when you want to go further than you can with just the jet pack. On low gravity worlds, RCS vessels are a good option.
