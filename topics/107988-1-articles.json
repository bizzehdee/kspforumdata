If you\u0027re just doing the \u0027land on mun\u0027/\u0027land on minimus\u0027 contracts, it doesn\u0027t matter (so yes, you can use the refueling ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, even if it is for a station/base/sat contract, if both ships are launched after the contract is accepted it will still work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do a lander/refueler setup and have it work just fine for contracts. It\u0027s also a really good idea if you want to harvest a celestial body of all its potential science.
