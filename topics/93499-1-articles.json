As someone said above the real life space program started with the astronauts being able to do everything. In KSP you should be able to select the path of your Kerbals after they level up to 1 star. At level 0 all Kerbals should be able to have basic SAS functionality aka hold heading and it should stay throughout a Kerbal\u0027s life, also it would be good if a Kerbal had a direction into a specialization eg. Kerbal X at level 0 is better at engineering etc. that way you can decide whether you are going to make him a pilot or an engineer or a scientist if you have shortage of personnel, but should you decide to make a prone pilot an engineer he should have a buff at his traits. Ah, also make it possible to be able to fire(sack) a Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will also give the player a reason to rotate their crew at missions, earn experience, have a variety of options during a mission and not use just one kerbal for all missions. This what i mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now i am playing career mode and the only one that gets to fly my missions is Jeb especially now that he is level 1 and can hold attitudes. Bill and Bob are just sitting in KSC doing nothing until i manage to unlock maneuver nodes and get to the Mun (i am playing at hard mode). If i feel like rotating my crew it will be only with another pilot Kerbal i have hired but Bill and Bob (and any other scientist/engineer i hire in the future) will remain at KSC and only the pilots will fly missions in combination with a strategy to convert reputation into science the only ones i need are pilots. Also it would be nice for contracts to require a Kerbal\u0027s specialization at a mission eg. test part X with an engineer at location Y, go to the Mun with a pilot and a scientist, do science and get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally give extra jobs for the scientist/engineer after an upgrade. The scientist should be able to clean experiments at some point, heck make him be able to clean an experiment once or twice at EVA and have unlimited use with the combination of a lab. Be able to recognize a biome or something in the map view. For the engineer i like what Janos1986 wrote\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will also give the astronaut complex a new role for training your Kerbals and the player can have more fun with their Kerbals in their missions.
