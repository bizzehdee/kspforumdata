Like wise my objects existed to the other player in a different location then they currently are and he can\u0027t interact with them in my past because that would effect my present (cite Back to the Future).

But buildings... I mean, we got the space center remodeled completely between 0.21 and 0.22, and I couldn\u0027t be happier for it, it looks very good now. The insular airfield was redone too, and looks just as good as the KSC. And the only other buildings I can think of on Kerbin are the second space center and the temple in the desert (though that\u0027s more a monument than a building). But this post made me think, maybe we\u0027re getting new buildings for real...
