Some mod docking ports (e.g. in Near Future Construction and Pico Port) also have orientation constraints and will only let you dock if you\u0027re at a specific angle e.g. 90 degree increments, which makes orbital construction a lot easier as you don\u0027t have to dock everything at precisely the right angle. Stock docking ports now have the ability to rotate up to 15 degrees each, which can help with aligning things to build larger structures- or just to make everything neat and symmetrical; or to put it another way, perfectly balanced as all things should be. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fleventeen","CreatedById":220622,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-07T00:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is worth noting that while you cannot dock different sized ports in stock KSP, there is a mod which adds universal docking ports which do make this possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022113840\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8520726764\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194930-112x-kip-docking-ports-v10-2021-07-05/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maria Sirona","CreatedById":210882,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-08T17:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNO.
