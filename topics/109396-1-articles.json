I have been having awful Linux performance (stutters, as described, which get progressively worse the longer a ship is in-scene regardless of complexity, until it is ultimately unplayable). Mine IS a top-of-the-line system; 4790K, GTX970, 16GB, SSD. This happens in 64-bit and 32-bit, mods or no mods, but only in Linux. Windows performance is silky, silky smooth, until the inevitable memory-leak crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy resources monitor shows the same dip you\u0027re seeing whenever the stutters hits. It seems to have approximately the same frequency, 5-8s, gradually becoming more frequent until after half an hour or so of flight it\u0027s hitting every 1-2 seconds. Not sure if this is significant or not, but on my multi-core system the resource dip/stutter also results in the process switching cores (i.e., if it\u0027s on core 3 before the dip, it will come back up after the dip on core 5 or 7, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried a million different things and none have worked. Different drivers (Nouveau vs nVidia proprietary), every single power management setting imaginable, all sorts of OpenGL force-driver hacks (including GPU_yield, which makes no difference), low-latency Kernels, three different Linux flavors, five or six different X servers. The X servers make a small difference in frequency of stutter, and these dips do not occur under any X server variant when running off the iGPU, leading me to believe it\u0027s related to the Nvidia driver talking to the X server. Of course, no response from Squad or Nvidia to official help requests and bug reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I ever hear back I\u0027ll let you know. If you hear anything, please let me know!
