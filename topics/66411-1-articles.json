When you go to dock, there is a magnetic force that draws you in when you get close. If you used thrusters to keep from docking. Could you in fact pull a load from the docking force?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Clearly has no practical use. But I just wanted to know if it can be done anyways, since I lack the knowledge of how the game physics apply in this scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T19:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually you kind of can, I\u0027ve had a few craft where an upper lifter vehicle tries to pick up a rover, and if the ports don\u0027t connect you can drag it along with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not brilliant, and maybe if you have something in the way that is not on the node it\u0027ll prevent the connection so you can tow while turning, but you can\u0027t go too fast or the force is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T19:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETheoretically, yes, since the magnets do draw both ships together. Obviously the acceleration would be pretty minimal and it\u0027d be very hard to keep close enough without docking/touching.

The magnetic force is surprising strong, i could carry the satellite at full throttle with the tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen i timewarped, the satellite beguns to clip into the tug.

If you create a reliable pseudo-docking port, say one with a little cube strut stuck on it, you could use this to loosely connect objects in the field... Essentially a docking port that will automatically release if sufficient force separates the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I can think of would be vehicles that can be separated by being struck in particular ways with less force than would destroy the parts...

Undocked and tried to drive away. The rover was horribly designed for Minmus and I started noticing things. Primary among them was the fact that no matter what I did I couldn\u0027t seem to get out of the vicinity of the ship. It felt like trying to acheive escape velocity from LKO with an ion drive. My rover was in essence \u0022orbiting\u0022 the ship. Ultimately I decided it was the magnetic attraction between the docking ports overcoming the pathetically low amount of traction the rover had. Once I increased the \u0022orbit\u0022 to around 40 m, suddenly I was able to drive in a straight line. Took something like 10 laps around the ship though.
