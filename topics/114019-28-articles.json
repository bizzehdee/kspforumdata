So far I have been unsuccessful with a design.\n\nWell, yes and no. I dont think i\u0027d call my vessel small, but small seems to be the theme. As you probably already know smaller craft are easier to manuver, more aerodynamic, and cost less fuel to get to, and maintain speed. \n\nI feel like if theres too much wing the drag would kill speed and cost fuel. \n\nIm on the cusp of getting a circumnavigation in under an hour, and ive found it\u0027s reasonably economical to jump in and out of the air intake\u0027s usable range. like a fish jumping in and out of water. You lose a little speed but you get 3-5minute chunks of no fuel consumption -- havnt worked out of its just better to do it that way or maintain altitude where the engine is on the verge of flameout. \n\nWith a bigger craft i\u0027d imagine getting it to speed would take a good but of fuel, and the mass of it would make manuvering a pain. But maybe not, it would be cool to see a design for a big circumnavigator vessel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-31T20:22:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2015 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gahooligan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T21:23:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You should look for noname\u0027s entry.
