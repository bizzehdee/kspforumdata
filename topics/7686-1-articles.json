The big LFE weighs a lot when you consider a small rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 LFT = 2.5 mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.5 LFT \u002B stack decoupler \u002B small LFE = 2.55 mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no noticeable difference between this rocket and the 2 tank rocket through the first tank of fuel.
