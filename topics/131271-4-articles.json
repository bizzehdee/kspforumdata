WFIRST is either already up, or will be soon. Both are coordinating with LSST, resulting in impressive discoveries in terms of comets, KBOs, asteroids, exoplanets, supernova, population III stars, early galaxy formation, and many other things. Relatedly, Planet 9 has been found, and appears to be a super-earth kicked out during solar system formation. Exploration plans are being proposed. Also, exoplanet populations are much better categorized, finally giving us a statistically meaningful understanding of the frequency, orbits, and physical properties of planets down to the mass of Mars and orbits of 3\u002B years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEuclid is winding down primary operations, and has substantially improved our understanding of dark energy.

Other launch services have made similar gains, and the market has turned out to be quite elastic. Multiple years in the 2020s have seen \u0026gt;100 launches per year, and breaking that 140ish of 1965 looks plausible. The idea of various large universities and/or foundations operating science instruments on-orbit is quite plausible, and has been done several times in the small scale. (UV telescopes perhaps?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ISS is winding down operations, but this is not cause for worry due to there being other (small) stations up.

But that will soon be solved. Ideally with ice giant orbiter missions powered by nuclear reactors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuborbital tourism is now a thriving business (with some elements of an extreme sport), rather than a joke. Similarly, the GLXP ended up with the second place finisher launching only a few months after the first, and both achieved their goals. These have also helped to push the university/foundation science operations forwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Though as mentioned upthread, lots of stuff in this section could be recycled from a decade or 2 ago.
