Unfortunately that rocket was unable to return due to low fuel and no parachute; I hadn\u0027t really intended to bring Munnand Kerman home after Jeb stole the only rocket with the parachute and returned to a field a long way from KSC (he\u0027s still there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the trip went well enough; Gregsy landed on the Mun, Munnand moved \u0022Lander I\u0022 closer to the spot to make Gregsy think he\u0027d done a good job despite landing 16km away from the target. They set off home, returned to 100km Kerbin orbit, corrected the inclination and burned retrograde to land at KSP. They re-entered the atmosphere, slowed down enough to land at KSC (almost, 15km away in the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and then I just sat back and waited for the parachute to deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.5km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E800m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E700m - Yay!

The two command pods split apart at 70m/s when the parachute deployed, Gregsy floated down to the ground, Munnand started to accelerate again and I wondered why I had bothered to waste 15 minutes getting that guy back if all he was going to do was crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E700m isn\u0027t very far when travelling at 70m/s, but it allowed enough time to switch craft (]), throttle up to maximum and decelerate to 10m/s before hitting the ground - Intact \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGregsy landed a few seconds later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1N3oOqC.png\u0022 alt=\u00221N3oOqC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s that, a boring Mun-and-back mission that ended with a nice surprise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoral of the story: MOAR STRUTS (and probably boosters, because this is KSP) (or just slow down before the parachute opens).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matze1984","CreatedById":60686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T20:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJupp, never prise the day befor it ends.
