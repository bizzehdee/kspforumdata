The airbrakes currently have a glitch where action group assignments don\u0027t work, they are effectively permanently tied to the brake group. I activate the \u0027parking brake\u0027 to deploy them prior to entry. This, combined with a 10 to 20 degree angle of attack, is working well. (Nose of vessel is pointed 10 to 20 degrees above prograde marker)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might consider a steeper entry also. While your vessel is between 35 and 55 km, you generate a lot of heat, but not much drag, so you get hot but don\u0027t slow down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot saying this is ideal, but my descent starts with a burn about 90 degrees before KSC, so the orbit intersects (impacts?) KSC. Then I rotate to point prograde. At atmosphere entry, I deploy airbrakes if equipped, and try to hold pitch 10 to 20 degrees above the prograde marker. An unpowered plane will sometimes level off around 40km doing this, which you don\u0027t want- you\u0027re still generating a lot of heat but not much drag. If that happens, lower the nose a bit to keep the descent going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T19:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime for the obvious question.
