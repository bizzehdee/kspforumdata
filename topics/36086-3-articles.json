I realized that I could find mech jeb\u0027s optimal trajectory for this particular rocket if I ran a few hundred test flight and recorded the data and plotted using Excel and Maple. That said I also realized that in actuality even with hundreds of test flight I was only going to get close the the Ideal trajectories. since I am still keeping the number of variable to 3, more on those in a bit. In reality there of many variable not the least of which many are derivatives including da/dt and dm/dt respectively. Where a=acceleration, and m=mass thus dT/dt=change in acceleration with respect to time and dm/dt=change in mass with respect to time. There are also many other variable, including d(u)/dh=change in resistive force with respect to height, and once you throw in a more complex rocket with multiple stages,you really start feeling overwhelmed. I am absolutely certain that their is a overarching function that could be made that would calculate the exact ideal path no matter the rocket, I also know for a staged rocket it would have to involve the step function. More on that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. But frankly I am at a loss as to how to proceed further in finding an idea function. (if it could be found mechjeb could be made to launch along a path Ideal for any rocket instead of some meen best path.)\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, the three variable I am allowing to change are curve % Curve end altitude and curve start altitude.( it should be noted that da/dt and dm/dt also change but at the same rate i.e. max rate this rocket allows) I will hopefully find an optimal curve by the end of the week (no sooner I fear) and it will only be good for this rocket. But since I find this fun I hope I won\u0027t tire of it before I am done with my tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually tempted to code this up to find a theoretical upper bound and see what the actual optimal profile looks like, in terms of pitch and thrust vs time. I had started on some similar code to find optimal landing profiles, was originally starting with airless bodies and single-stage vehicles for simplicity. Adding atmospheric drag and altitude-varying Isp (and flipping the initial and final conditions to do ascent instead of landing) shouldn\u0027t be too much more complex, given how much we know about KSP\u0027s atmosphere model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nonlinear dynamics involved mean there likely is not a simple closed-form expression that represents the optimal profile. But if we discretize over time and solve numerically for the inputs at each point over a given time horizon, there are good algorithms for at least getting locally optimal solutions. Multi-start or other heuristics could give us some indication of how susceptible this problem is to local optima.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T10:02:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 10:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T15:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my shot at this.

I started the gravity turn at 6000m, I believe. (it might have been 5000m, I did so many I forgot!) The degrees of pitch at a certain altitude went as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6000 m = start (80 deg)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9000 m = 70 deg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12,000 = 60\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15,000 = 50\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20,000 = 40\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25k = 30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30k = 20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E35k = 10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40k = 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E45k = 0 (i.e. \u0022Bring me that horizon\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said in my previous post, I tried not to touch the controls at all. If you put your nose on the outer ring of the velocity vector you tend to arc over like this naturally. I had to hold in a few spots and push it over in a few others, but for the most part once I started the turn it went happily where I wanted it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set MJ to limit accel to terminal velocity and 22.5, so you hit 22.5 m/s^2 accel just before you begin the gravity turn, which prevents MJ from messing up your horizontal terminal velocity. Once I was done with the gravity turn, I changed the max accel to 12.5 (highlight the 2, hit 1). I stayed on the horizon line until the apoapsis reached 74 (which I actually missed, was busy looking at the fuel remaining!). At this point you\u0027re probably around 50k-52k, so you\u0027ve got a minute of upper atmosphere coasting to do. Since I overshot, I didn\u0027t need to pulse to ensure the apoapsis stayed high enough. I let MechJeb do the circularization burn to only 74.1 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t have any vids or anything, so I hope the description makes sense!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T00:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat all makes sense to me.
