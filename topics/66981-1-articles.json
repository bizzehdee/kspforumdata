I mean theoretically I understand the principle behind it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Wait for correct phase angle (minus 8 hours head start, since that\u0027s how long it takes to reach Kerbin PE from the Mun) from Kerbin to target planet, just like transfer from LKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wait for the Mun to be 180 degree out of phase with the normal ejection angle. That way the Kerbin PE will be actually at the correct spot to eject to Kerbol orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Eject out of Mun orbit to Kerbin at the correct ejection angle so that Kerbin orbit AP will be at around Mun orbit and PE is at the correct point for Kerbin ejection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically one will have to line up three points on three separate orbits (Mun orbit, Kerbin orbit, Kerbol orbit) correctly so that by using two burns, you shift between the three orbits and get to the target planet. I can get my head around it but it feels like it will be difficult in practice. I mean the Mun orbits Kerbin once per month (munth?), so instead of one correct ejection window per 45 minutes or so in low Kerbin orbit, you get one correct ejection window per month. So unless you\u0027re very lucky you\u0027re going to be off a little bit either with planetary phase angle or ejection angle, plus whatever error you\u0027re already carrying with your when you eject from Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jart","CreatedById":101732,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T02:13:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding the perfect rocket.
