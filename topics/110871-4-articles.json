As i fooled around with the nuclear option, i found that the CoM likes to drift backwards as fuel is spent partly due to the nuke\u0027s mass. The solution was to place it as far forward as possible. This then makes it a little bit difficult to place wings in a way that makes the craft controlable. Several frustrating issues with takeoff and bad manners in general followed. Eventually the plane morphed into a neat design that handles heat well, has decent Dv, and flies ok but nor great. I think the tail is too large and the craft doesn\u0027t really do anything except carry two kerbals into orbit, but it\u0027s a decent baseline.

Assuming no other issues, either high temps due to friction, or turbojets getting out of their comfort zone too soon will be the limiting factor.

Is there a reason for that? Just a matter of KSP taste... since it may not be advanced enough know the difference?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E(I know real world... top wing inlets are used for stealth reasons... but for airflow underwing are superior... underwing is higher pressure due to bernoullii effect.. and when at positive AoA the fuselage or wing helps funnel more air towards the scoop). I\u0027m guessing KSP\u0027\u0027s aerodynamic model isn\u0027t that advanced for this? I can think of other airflow things it probably ignores as well (the wingtip vortex and how it can be used to enhance lift for example, or increase/decrease drag).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnother question... I see a lot of people using the \u0022Ram Air\u0022 inlet.. and not the shock cone. The shock cone just doesn\u0027t work as well with ramjets? by the time it\u0027s in it\u0027s prime the ramjet is falling off so it\u0027s made for rapiers? I chose the ram air... because the sucker never really gets to shock cone speeds before the ramjet shuts off... (the ramjet flames out about 700-800 m/s IIRC).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T05:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falconer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had ramjets flame out at \u0026gt;1400 m/s though not on the more succesful designs. Going that fast usually means a flat, depressed trajectory which comes with a huge price in heat and possibly drag loss. Though as long as you\u0027re fighting drag with an efficient engine, you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for ramjet vs shock, i saw a post about it recently and i\u0027m not convinced either is a clear cut winner. They both seem to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing lift vs wing drag? yeah drag is no friend of yours, but not having lift forces the plane to fly with a higher Angle of Attack. This moves the thrust vector off prograde which robs you a lot. If you need a certain amount of life to acomplish the goal, then pay the price in drag. As long as it\u0027s worth it... it\u0027s worth it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Besides, wings are about the least draggy parts in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is also going to come in handy when diving to puch through the sound barrier. Not having enough tends to drop the plane too steeply or it once again suffers from thrusting off prograde by a few degrees. That is a crucial period of the ascent and i\u0027d want it to go as smoothly and as quickly as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere comes a point when pushing too much weight on a single turbojet becomes an excercise in frustration and possibly efficiency as well. Certainly when using the Mk2 fuselage where both the single and twin fuel adapters are similar so the only price is the mass of the extra jet. As well as it\u0027s uselessnes in space, but if you just want to lift stuff into orbit a twin TJ \u002B n Nukes build is probably the optimal way to go. There will be no problems going transonic for starters, and if damn near 50t can reach orbit on a single one, then an interplanetary SSTO will work wonders with two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, a tremendous achievement there.
