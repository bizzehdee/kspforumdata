I got [Nerd sniped!](https://xkcd.com/356/)\n\nI did get a plane out of it though, at a small-ish cost in sanity. As i fooled around with the nuclear option, i found that the CoM likes to drift backwards as fuel is spent partly due to the nuke\u0027s mass. The solution was to place it as far forward as possible. This then makes it a little bit difficult to place wings in a way that makes the craft controlable. Several frustrating issues with takeoff and bad manners in general followed. Eventually the plane morphed into a neat design that handles heat well, has decent Dv, and flies ok but nor great. I think the tail is too large and the craft doesn\u0027t really do anything except carry two kerbals into orbit, but it\u0027s a decent baseline. That\u0027s what i\u0027ll keep telling myself at least.\n\nI did forget fuel lines and didn\u0027t carry batteries or solar panels (which shows how much faith i had in it at the time).

The jet does all the work, and you don\u0027t have to touch the controls at all. Also no losses due to pulling up at high speed. The buildup in airspeed automatically takes you from level-ish flight to a sub orbital trajectory. [edit] And more often then not melts something, but in those cases it\u0027s better to pick a slightly higher angle of attack. Assuming no other issues, either high temps due to friction, or turbojets getting out of their comfort zone too soon will be the limiting factor.

Lift/drag can sometimes completely negate re-entry effects (which is a bit unrealistic but KSP isn\u0027t perfect) to the point where a plane must dive down to avoid a high altitude stall. Such a design would have no need for airbrakes.\n\nOTOH some of my planes had great difficulty keeping the nose high enough and could not \u0022bleed off\u0022 airspeed before descening into the thicker part of the athmosphere. At that point it\u0027s virtually impossible to avoid high friction heat so either the wing profile needs to change (which i\u0027m sure we\u0027d all hate to alter) or airbrakes should be added. Airbrakes placed on the top of the airframe also tend to pivot the plane nose up for extra drag.\n\nBut yeah, long story short, depending on wing design, drag and CoM/CoL you might not need an additional airbrake.

It did heat up a lot. Then i switched the tanks around and sandwhiched it, suddenly the intake could take a lot more heat. Same old story as it always has been, a tank can eat up a lot of heat and thus keep the intake cooler.\n\nWith the shock cone, it weighs more and my tests didnt show any real difference. I don\u0027t know why they changed it. Ram Intake can take more heat, weighs less and has more air than a shock cone. The special drag cube of the shock cone MAY benefit you when building bigger craft but i guess the heat-issue will far outweigh that.\n\nAnother trick, to save energy. When coasting, a lot of minimalistic designs run out of energy and you have to use batteries. You can simple disable the energy on the command unit and when you have to make a maneuver, turn it back on. With long spaceflights (in career before solar) it works with mun stuff if you have no batteries.\n\n**Update, more testing**\n\nThe remote control unit seems to really be wider than 1.25m, it is visually.

Were able to loft 58.8 tons of payload on a 178.9 launch weight to 80k LKO (32.9% payload fraction) while burning through two 7200 tanks worth of gas (plus only a little extra liquid fuel for the ramjets). The only staging was spooling up the ramjets before engaging the liquid fuel rocket for takeoff (turn the TWR positive long enough to get to roughly mach1 as quickly as possible).... then toggling the rhino off again between 4k and 15k altutide while the ramjets did the work).

Also putting my ballistic impact in roughly the mountains outside KSP before going prograde to keep speed and regain lift to float back into the plains...\n\nEdit: hmm how do people post the imgur album...

(tried 2 nukes not enough thrust... added more engines underneath what was initially a high wing... sucker would pitch up uncontrollably..... added two more engines on top of the high wing (6 nukes)... with after tweaking down nuke thrust to balance the thrust vector once the low ramjet flamed out... it just ran out of gas... So switched to midwing with 4 engines balanced symmetrically around the ramjet in the center... also added two more delta wings in the far back for 1200 more gas and more lift and to push the CoL back even farther.\n\nProblem now is the COM is very stable in pitch/roll... but on reentry on yaw it\u0027s unstable if the nose gets too far left or right when it\u0027s dry on reentry after most of the speed is bled off. ... so it\u0027s prone to a flat spin after reentry... so the tail stabilizers need to move back farther... or add another pair there and risk the drag. I put all the remaining fuel in the forward tank... and second time I did it I had a lot more fuel leftover due to better piloting (about 280 units instead of 160). In fact, I marked the frontmost two tanks as \u0027do not use\u0027 which helped a lot with dynamics only unlocking them one by one as the tanks drained out and it was clear I\u0027d need some gas for the final push to orbit, meanwhile the fuel drained from the rearmost wings into middle and then forward wing... and from the forward wing into the front fuselage tank. ramjet pulled equally from all tanks just like normal except the reserved ones, but when you turn on the rockets the fuel flow helped a lot with keeping the CoM where it needed to be.\n\nOther than that... wondering if elminating the fuselage entirely or using the Mk2\u0027s fuel fuselage would work better... (Mk2 is lifting body... so more lift, I aavoided it because all the Mk2 adapters have oxidizer and aren\u0027t great fuel tanks). But then we got the whole lift == drag problem. It doesn\u0027t matter how much wing you have all the wing does is turn forward speed into vertical lift which is felt as drag... which all needs overcome by a single ramjet still.\n\nAttaching nukes to precooler inlet/fuel tanks... seemed to help with the heat dissipation (also they\u0027re bolted to the large wing... not the fuselage as the next heat sink in line).\n\nAnother question:... I put my ramjet inlets on the bottom two nacelles...\n\nYet most designs I see on here...have them on the top of the wing? Is there a reason for that? Just a matter of KSP taste... since it may not be advanced enough know the difference?\n\n(I know real world... top wing inlets are used for stealth reasons... but for airflow underwing are superior... underwing is higher pressure due to bernoullii effect.. and when at positive AoA the fuselage or wing helps funnel more air towards the scoop). I\u0027m guessing KSP\u0027\u0027s aerodynamic model isn\u0027t that advanced for this? I can think of other airflow things it probably ignores as well (the wingtip vortex and how it can be used to enhance lift for example, or increase/decrease drag).\n\nAnother question... I see a lot of people using the \u0022Ram Air\u0022 inlet.. and not the shock cone. The shock cone just doesn\u0027t work as well with ramjets? by the time it\u0027s in it\u0027s prime the ramjet is falling off so it\u0027s made for rapiers? I chose the ram air... because the sucker never really gets to shock cone speeds before the ramjet shuts off... (the ramjet flames out about 700-800 m/s IIRC).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T05:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falconer**"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:59:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had ramjets flame out at \u003E1400 m/s though not on the more succesful designs. Going that fast usually means a flat, depressed trajectory which comes with a huge price in heat and possibly drag loss. Though as long as you\u0027re fighting drag with an efficient engine, you should be fine.\n\nAs for ramjet vs shock, i saw a post about it recently and i\u0027m not convinced either is a clear cut winner. They both seem to work fine.\n\nWing lift vs wing drag? yeah drag is no friend of yours, but not having lift forces the plane to fly with a higher Angle of Attack. This moves the thrust vector off prograde which robs you a lot. If you need a certain amount of life to acomplish the goal, then pay the price in drag. As long as it\u0027s worth it... it\u0027s worth it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Besides, wings are about the least draggy parts in the game.\n\nLift is also going to come in handy when diving to puch through the sound barrier. Not having enough tends to drop the plane too steeply or it once again suffers from thrusting off prograde by a few degrees. That is a crucial period of the ascent and i\u0027d want it to go as smoothly and as quickly as possible.\n\n[edit]\n\nThere comes a point when pushing too much weight on a single turbojet becomes an excercise in frustration and possibly efficiency as well. Certainly when using the Mk2 fuselage where both the single and twin fuel adapters are similar so the only price is the mass of the extra jet. As well as it\u0027s uselessnes in space, but if you just want to lift stuff into orbit a twin TJ \u002B n Nukes build is probably the optimal way to go. There will be no problems going transonic for starters, and if damn near 50t can reach orbit on a single one, then an interplanetary SSTO will work wonders with two.\n\nStill, a tremendous achievement there. Well done on pushing the limits!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T10:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 10:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**"},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T12:21:16Z","Content":"As i wrote some posts up,\n\n- Ram Intake ~72 [0.47]\n\n- Shock Cone ~48 [0.20]\n\nSo at mach 3 the shock has 2/3 of the drag, but weighs double (matters only on really light weight planes).
