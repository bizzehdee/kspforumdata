Also, I don\u0027t watch videos just because they are by some specific youtuber. I would also not waste time during the day watching a video, but they can be a nice substitution for actually playing (e.g. when I decide that I have wasted enough time in front of the PC and it\u0027s time to get to bed and waste another few hours - also known as just 5 more minutes - with my phone).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T20:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA bright, bubbly personality.

Okay now let me show the the thing I was going to show...\u0022. A live stream doesn\u0027t allow for that sort of editing out the busywork.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I think being less organized and concise should be a bit more tolerated on a live stream. The point of a live stream is that you\u0027re watching a person *as* they go through the steps, failures and missteps and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteven Mading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t disagree with any of this, but I don\u0027t watch live streams for that reason. I\u0027m mainly watching for educational purposes, so while sloppiness and mistakes are expected... I\u0027m still a lot more likely to turn it off and watch something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T11:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow I see it is that a Youtube video is like a TV program. It\u0027s quite planned out, it might be scripted, it\u0027s edited and polished, and you sit and watch it. You can leave a comment if you like but that\u0027s as far as communication goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stream is more like a radio talk show. There\u0027s an general topic of discussion but it\u0027s all live and the details aren\u0027t planned or scripted. The audience is coming in with questions and comments and the presenter(s) is responding to them. The viewer and chat interaction is a big part of watching streams for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
