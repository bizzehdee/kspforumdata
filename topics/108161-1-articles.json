This thread is no longer needed, and the mod is no longer maintained.**\n\n![6sTgj0d.png](http://i.imgur.com/6sTgj0d.png)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDT85 made a fantastic contract pack for SCANSat, but it hasn\u0027t been updated for a long time, and doesn\u0027t take advantage of the newer features of Contract Configurator.\n\nSo I wrote a new pack specifically for 1.0.2 and using the newest version of Contract Configurator.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The original pack by DT85 used 11 missions to accomplish it\u0027s goals. I use 4 (one for each type of scan) I\u0027ve also done away with all of the \u0022reach a specific orbit and scan for x amount of time\u0022. \n\u003E \n\u003E Quite simply, once you\u0027ve orbited a world, the contract will generate. Then you just scan using the relevant scanner, however you see fit. However, this freedom comes at a price. The contract will only complete if you scan 95% of the surface. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Depends on Contract Configurator (minimum of 1.1.0) available here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)\n\u003E \n\u003E Obviously you need ScanSat available here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) )\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Licensing**\n\nLicensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nContract Configurator licensed under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nSCANSat licensed under [BSDv2](https://github.com/S-C-A-N/SCANsat/blob/release/SCANsat/LICENSE.txt)\n\nThis pack includes MiniAVC which if you allow it, will contact my github repository to check for updates periodically.
