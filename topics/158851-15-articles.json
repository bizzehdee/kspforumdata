I recently discovered this mod, and while it\u0027s a really neat idea, it isn\u0027t working anything like I would expect. I\u0027m having the exact same issues. Sometimes a satellite with a dedicated antenna will relay through the comm network satellites (with relay antennae). Sometimes not so much. Built-in antennae never seem to relay through comsats at all. This is definitely *not* the same behavior as stock, as in stock, even a built-in antenna in a pod or probe core will relay through any relay antenna in range just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the first post and the tutorial seem to imply that you can set a single antenna to multiple channels to form a relay link. I don\u0027t see any way to do that either. In fact, it\u0027s exceedingly difficult to do anything but set all antennae to the same channel on a given craft, from the Tracking Station. I end up having to switch to each ship one at a time and use the right-click menu for each antenna individually... and even then it doesn\u0027t end up working much of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do also have Kerbalism installed... could that be changing how the communication system logic is working somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadriss","CreatedById":133190,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T16:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust for clarity - I do not use Kerbalism, nor am I relying on built-in antennae in the pod/probe core.

In the real world the ISS communicates with TDRS (Tracking Data Relay Satellites) over the EHF Ku band using two different antennas, a transmitter and receiver, and the satellite does the same, using one dedicated antenna to receive and one dedicated antenna to transmit. Though all of my antennas are communication antennas, I have my network setup in a way where each antenna is either a TX or RX, with the exception of the high gain antenna, which I have actually changed to be a direct antenna.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, let\u0027s say we are setting up a 5-Satellite communication satellite network in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. The satellite needs to be able to communicate to the ground over high bandwidth and low bandwidth, communicate with other spacecraft over high bandwidth and low bandwidth, and with other satellites in the network to provide relay services in low and high bandwidth. We need two antennas for each of these purposes, with the exception of low bandwidth (in real life we would refer to this as S band) connections to ground, which I just use the high-gain antenna for.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn total we need 11\u00A0antennas. One for low bandwidth TX and RX to the ground from the satellite. Two for TX and RX high bandwidth to the ground. Two for low bandwidth TX and RX to other space craft. Two for high bandwidth TX and RX to other space craft. Two for low bandwidth TX and RX between satellites in the network. Two for high bandwidth TX and RX between satellites in the network.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll TX and RX capabilities to the ground use per-vehicle frequencies, so we can control which\u00A0DSN stations ingest and transmit data to the network. So the low-bandwidth antenna and both high-bandwidth antennas would have their own CommNet frequency unique to their satellite. The other eight antennas would use different but non-unique frequencies.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe result of all this is a satisfyingly realistic communication system. My two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E space stations are entirely dependent on my satellite network for communication. And like in the real world, there are hostile nations on Kerbin, so only a handful of DSN stations are allowed to communicate with the Satellite network. My two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E stations also have high bandwidth and low bandwidth TX and RX capabilities, and automatically communicates with the closest satellite.
