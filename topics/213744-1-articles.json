When I try to save, nothing happens. I went to check the logs and it seems to crash the load/save manager because an object is unserialisable. Then I can not save anymore as the manager stays in a \u0022busy\u0022 state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am still investigating on my end as my game state only gets corrupt once I split my vessel.
