First you need the material. Different uses require different material depending on their mechanical and thermal constraints. Some can be made of plastic, others have to be made of metal. You need seals, springs, filters, all sorts of fluids, solvants and lubricants. Some of them can probably be made locally, but each different item will need its own complex manufacturing process with its own dependencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the stuff we have is made of a many number of different compounds and alloys and materials and not all of it can be 3D-printed. Look at the stuff around you and think of everything that went into their production, including the consumables needed to run and maintain the equipment that made those things. Something as simple as an electric motor is made of all sorts of different metal alloys. Making electronics from ISRU would be extremely complicated. You need to make every component with a variety of different processes and manufacturing techniques and rare materials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3D printing as a way to produce some select spare parts is a great way to save weight on a mission, but it\u0027s still limited to small monolithic parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T07:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EALM would be difficult in zero-g, but definitely worth investigating. You need to use a lot of things that would be troublesome without gravity, such as powdered metals. Obviously you don\u0027t want a powdered conductor loose in your environment. However the ability to manufacture non-critical parts out of ali or steel would be very useful. Even one of the nasty plastic extruders could be handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople do seem to forget that you can only make a subset of parts using ALM.
