The capacities in Procedural Parts are based on the actual dimensions of the tanks, and assume 1 atmosphere of pressure. However most rockets make use of *pressurized* fuel tanks, which can hold significantly *more* fuel mass for their volume (what would equate to a greater volume at lower pressures). Since pressurization isn\u0027t implemented correctly in the Procedural Parts RealFuels tanks (i.e. a \u0022pressurized\u0022 Service Module tank holds *exactly* the same number of units of fuel as an \u0022unpressurized\u0022 Balloon Tank- when Service Modules can be found pressurized to 20 atmospheres or more in real life), having 100% utilization isn\u0027t that unrealistic. Even the least-pressurized fuel tanks in real life (such as the Balloon Tanks in the Centaur or early Atlas rockets- which can\u0027t withstand high internal pressures due to their extremely thin-skinned design, or the Space Shuttle External Tank- which operated at a pressure of \u0022only\u0022 1.5 atmospheres) make up for it by having very high utilization percentages (96% for some of the Balloon Tanks used on Atlas, if I remember correctly), which aren\u0027t all that far from 100% really...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T11:07:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jstnj","CreatedById":109006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T23:30:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERunning the .90 hotfix posted above and running to a non-game breaking bug that I ran into before .90 too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to right click tanks and engines after loading craft in the VAB/SPH nothing happens unless I alter and revert the craft (control-z) before hand.
