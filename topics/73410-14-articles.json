OpenOffice does not let me add newline characters within a cell, which is rather important to managing this particular file. And, there may have been a glitch introduced when I switched the resources to RF v8. Which is why I\u0027m rewriting the XLS as a webapp. Easier for me to manage (since I\u0027m a web developer by day), and much easier for folks to view configs and/or roll their own configs. Hopefully this will be done by the new year, but I\u0027m not making promises. It\u0027s already turned into a larger project than I anticipated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, OpenOffice (or LibreOffice, whichever it\u0027s called for you) should be able to handle any additions to the spreadsheet.
