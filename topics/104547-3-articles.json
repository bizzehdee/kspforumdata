It\u0027s also not possible to activate a sequence and change to another craft without stopping the sequence. An action group would solve this problem. I also found a bug, if you destroy the IR parts on a craft, the sequencer deletes the commands from its list. You have to revert your flight to get it back or else you have to redo everything.\n\nAnd I also would like to see an option to edit existing commands instead of deleting and adding a new one.
