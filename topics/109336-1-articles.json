Note that the normal/anti normal will shift your trajectory up or down but to get the correct eve insertion at a specific orbital inclination, if that\u0027s what you want, you shall, probably have to burn a little radial or anti-radial resulting, in practical terms, in an advance or falling back of your trajectory relatively to eve\u0027s path, resulting in larger or smaller inclination angle. So, to try to answer your first question: to get an insertion with elliptical orbit and a certain inclination, even polar, you have to burn normal or anti normal close to kerbin and radial or anti-radial enroute, not too far, because it will be less controllable, and not too close, because you will need lots of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond question i think it is possible to do that with a single burn, never tried that one; what happens, sometimes, is that the traveled distance is so big that the slightest speed variation in the first burn might get you off the SOI of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas a bottom line, for long flights, i never do it in a single burn, always do a middle burn for optimal insertion point, but then again, those enroute burns, if at an adequate distance, are so tiny that, many times, can be performed with a gentle blow of the RCS thusters and, therefore, are no factor to fuel consumption, I approached Duna, this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T11:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ayreos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ayreos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUsing the Kerbin DeltaV map from the wiki i noticed the \u0022Eve Elliptical Orbit\u0022 requirement is listed at 80 m/s.

It\u0027s been a while, but for going interplanetary, I normally aim to get an encounter of any sort when setting up my initial transfer burn and then - as you say - doing a mid-course correction. Exact timing isn\u0027t critical if I remember rightly and sometimes I found it useful to actually do a slightly larger correction burn later in the journey rather than fiddle around trying to do .1 m/s adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very useful trick (if you\u0027re not already using it) is to use Focus View on your destination when setting up your course correction.

My mistake was trying to use the mission planner while focusing on the destination body. The shaky planner made it impossible to see any changes in the entry orbit. I just had to scratch the planner and actually modify my orbit in real time, while focusing on the destination. At first try i got a 60Km aerobrake on Eve, which got me into a 3.6Mm to 59Km Eve orbit for peanuts, coming very close to the 80 m/s estimate on the chart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again to all who answered!
