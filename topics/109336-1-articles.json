Does it require multiple burns during the transit? I don\u0027t seem to be able to achieve something like that with a single ejection burn. I\u0027d love to be able to perform interplanetary transfers regardless of optimal windows at times, even if they require considerably more fuel.

Note that the normal/anti normal will shift your trajectory up or down but to get the correct eve insertion at a specific orbital inclination, if that\u0027s what you want, you shall, probably have to burn a little radial or anti-radial resulting, in practical terms, in an advance or falling back of your trajectory relatively to eve\u0027s path, resulting in larger or smaller inclination angle. So, to try to answer your first question: to get an insertion with elliptical orbit and a certain inclination, even polar, you have to burn normal or anti normal close to kerbin and radial or anti-radial enroute, not too far, because it will be less controllable, and not too close, because you will need lots of dV.\n\nsecond question i think it is possible to do that with a single burn, never tried that one; what happens, sometimes, is that the traveled distance is so big that the slightest speed variation in the first burn might get you off the SOI of the target.\n\nas a bottom line, for long flights, i never do it in a single burn, always do a middle burn for optimal insertion point, but then again, those enroute burns, if at an adequate distance, are so tiny that, many times, can be performed with a gentle blow of the RCS thusters and, therefore, are no factor to fuel consumption, I approached Duna, this way."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T11:27:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Using the Kerbin DeltaV map from the wiki i noticed the \u0022Eve Elliptical Orbit\u0022 requirement is listed at 80 m/s.

Note the apses for that elliptical orbit - 107km by 85,000 km! To get into a 107km circular orbit requires another 1300 m/s of delta-V which would be more like the amount you\u0027re seeing.\n\nFor interplanetary missions in general, I find [Alexmoon\u0027s](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) calculator to be invaluable, since it gives you the transfer windows in days, rather than asking you to muck about with phase angles. It\u0027s been a while, but for going interplanetary, I normally aim to get an encounter of any sort when setting up my initial transfer burn and then - as you say - doing a mid-course correction. Exact timing isn\u0027t critical if I remember rightly and sometimes I found it useful to actually do a slightly larger correction burn later in the journey rather than fiddle around trying to do .1 m/s adjustments.\n\nA very useful trick (if you\u0027re not already using it) is to use Focus View on your destination when setting up your course correction. Makes it much easier to fine tune the approach when you can see your orbit relative to your target. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T11:29:54Z","Content":"I think I can answer the first one.

I need thousands of m/s to get a capture and stop the escape from occurring. So i burn most of the fuel intended for getting in low orbit, plus the fuel intended for the return journey during this process. From other answers i can deduce i should focus on performing a proper correction burn.

I didn\u0027t think you could do that. I tried dozens of times and never got such a close pass... It also explains why there is an \u0022aerobraking possible\u0022 sign at the 80 m/s figure as well. I just have to enter the EVE SOI on a trajectory that skims its atmosphere.... exciting!\n\nEDIT: I got it. My mistake was trying to use the mission planner while focusing on the destination body. The shaky planner made it impossible to see any changes in the entry orbit. I just had to scratch the planner and actually modify my orbit in real time, while focusing on the destination. At first try i got a 60Km aerobrake on Eve, which got me into a 3.6Mm to 59Km Eve orbit for peanuts, coming very close to the 80 m/s estimate on the chart. \n\nThanks again to all who answered! KSP is suddenly as exciting as the first day i played it!\n\nCelebratory picture: [http://oi58.tinypic.com/51apsi.jpg](http://oi58.tinypic.com/51apsi.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T14:04:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ayreos**\n  \nQuestion 1 fully resolved"}]}
