You go and grab some 2.5 meter LFO tank and empty it of fuel, right?\n\nWell, what if you could also adjust the amount of TANKAGE inside a fuel tank? A Rockomax Jumbo-64 holds a total of 6400 units of fuel (2880 Liquid, 3520 Oxidizer). If you wanted to make it a structural element, you would have a second slider that reads: \u0022LFO Tank Size\u0022, followed by the maximum amount of units. Lowering this slider increases the maximum range of the second slider for Oxidizer, and the other way around.\n\nBringing a slider down decreases the mass of the tank, because there is less tankage inside of it to hold fuel, and thus it has less mass.\n\nBringing both sliders down makes it into its lightest form.\n\nThis would both give a wider variety of structural pieces to the user, and allow for user-defined ratios on tanks, especially useful for SSTO construction."}]}
