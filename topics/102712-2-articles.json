New version of pre-release would be up soon for you to test. What TweakScale issue are you having? Have you tried making a clean install of IR?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the very long-standing issue IR has with tweakscale - you can easily reproduce it, too. IR parts can be scaled down without any problems (that I\u0027ve seen, anyway!), but they can\u0027t be scaled up past a certain point (something like 1.999x size, but it doesn\u0027t seem absolutely consistent). To reproduce, just go to a clean copy of KSP with only TS and the new IR release, then try to scale up a hinge to 4x size. Go into flight mode, attempt to move it, you\u0027ll see what I mean. It doesn\u0027t produce exceptions, I don\u0027t think, it simply doesn\u0027t function like it should. Sometimes, you can see slight movement in the parts (or really bizarre, off-axis, wrong-direction movement, specifically with extending parts - I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere else, someone mentioned (speculated? I don\u0027t know) that it might have to do with changing node sizes on an IR part via tweakscale. If that\u0027s true, it would be a TS-specific issue, since it is very possible to re-scale IR parts manually via config editing and give them gigantic stack nodes with no problem. Maybe it\u0027s the attach node? Just guessing wildly. When rescaled via config editing, IR parts \u003Cem\u003Edo \u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9work at much larger than normal sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - if I could make one request, it would be to remove TweakScale from the part configs themselves and apply ALL TweakScale stuff via MM config.

What that module does is that it lets you switch between different part versions (that reuse same texture) in editor via right-click.

If not, as is the case for the Rework parts, you\u0027ll end up with the mesh changing but the attachment nodes remaining the same. Also, FSmeshSwitch would need to be modified to allow for multiple named meshes to be switched to make it work with IR parts.

Also it doesn\u0027t help that most players create very weak contraptions to lift very heavy objects, which would just not work at all if done in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T15:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI, just did a quick test of the stock IR provide here (i.e. not using the model rework package): the Rotatrons don\u0027t seem to be adhering to the limits set.
