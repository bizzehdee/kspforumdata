Nobody on this forum is ever going to buy a console port of KSP*. We are PC gamers; that we are even here is proof of this. To divert resources from development and marketing in their target market would be (at best) silly and contentious. Why contentious? Because every scrap of text they post here will be analysed and creatively misunderstood and will create friction and bad feeling all round. They wouldn\u0027t dare to report anything or answer any questions without spending hours second-guessing how the critics and haters will interpret it. It would do nothing for their sales into the console market, would waste time, and would potentially create bad publicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the very best approach they can have on these forums is the one they have adopted: a dignified silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* OK, that\u0027s not quite true! Some people buy multiple versions of KSP as a way to demonstrate loyalty. I bought a second copy on Steam, partly out of loyalty, partly out of utility: I get to keep my KSP Store account and can download from there if need be. Nevertheless, most people will only buy one copy, and not many multi-copy-fans will have a console they can use to buy console versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
