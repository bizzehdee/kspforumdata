Don\u0027t think KSP2 did anything with it, when I submitted them the result back in the days... haha. Anyway, I tried again recently, in the forum, after the EA Launch. Might still be useful, and haven\u0027t seen other survey like this, it really had some cool ideas prior the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- And other things I don\u0027t think about !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the \u0022conclusion\u0022 : i\u0027m really pessimistic and have been very salty regarding the KSP2 launch. I mean, by all i\u0027ve made so far \u0022for\u0022 and thanks to KSP, I\u0027m maybe the post passionate and invested french guys. It really means something big for who I am today. And despite this, I\u0027m so sad of how KSP2 turned out. I don\u0027t feel like I want to open steam and launch it. I don\u0027t want to promote it, etc. How crazy is that, after all that time enjoying KSP1 and waiting for KSP2 ? I mean, i\u0027m tipically the guys commited to the cause, that can only love a new KSP. And yet... nah. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever get the KSP2 that should last for another decade, technically up to date, with all the promises that were made, and that make me sad. Anyway, time will speak, finger crossed !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit : I must add that I\u0027ve never really be able to communicate with KSP1 and KSP2 teams. Like... Really not. I\u0027ve not been asking for anything, of course, as they don\u0027t owe me at all, but some help to promote the biggest activities and events, that are premiere for KSP, that help selling it, promote the educational potential, etc, nah, nothing. It really adds to the \u0022meh\u0022 feeling about the communication, which barely only look at Reddit, pick a random image and post it, or publish an homemade low effort screenshot or challenge idea with no involvement at all. Not happy of this part of my KSP route, unfortunately, we could have done much more with just a little acknowledgment.

I believe the world would miss something special if we wouldn\u0027t have had KSP1 and I sincerely hope KSP2 will one day reach the same status.
