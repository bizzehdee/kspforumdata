They\u0027re assigned to an individual. A husband and wife would often have elements of both of their blazons combined, and each of their children would have one with a small change.\n\nThis originated back when nobles fought battles as a bunch of individuals, each with retainers, men at arms etc to support and fight alongside them. Each adopted a unique pattern to paint on his shield so allies and enemies could tell at a distance who they wanted to go hit with sharp and pointy things, and who they weren\u0027t supposed to go and smack - at least not in the current fight.\n\nWhat started a major change in the organization of armies was the [battle of Agincourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt). The French were still \u0022organized\u0022 along the old gaggle of nobles system. The English hit upon the revolutionary concept of organizing their entire force as a unit to fight together. The terrain, weather and other factors helped the English, but the main factor in their victory was the organization that enabled them to fire massive, synchronized volleys of arrows to plunge down upon the French, slaughtering their horses and anyone in the fight without good armor. While the French knights struggled with the gooey mud clinging to their armor, they got to watch as thousands died around them. The English side lost barely over 100 men, the French up to 10,000. The English brought *a lot* of arrows.\n\nAs for those sites selling fancy printouts of \u0022family\u0022 coats of arms, there\u0027s two software packages out there which most of them use. One makes somewhat nicer looking designs. What they\u0027ve done is traced back variations of a large number of surnames, some of which have had their spelling altered many times as people moved around the world, and if some ancestor way back had a genuine blazon, the software authors have applied that to all variations of that surname.\n\nThere is an actual College of Heraldry and College of Arms to which one can apply for your own design. Some possible distant ancestor of mine had a very simple blazon, two Sable chevrons on an Argent field. Were I to see about getting my own blazon, I\u0027d take that and add three Sable Mullets (stars), Fess wise across the top.\n\nHmmm, I should do that on my Heraldic KSP flag which has the shield with two chevrons, beside a Cockatrice."}]}
