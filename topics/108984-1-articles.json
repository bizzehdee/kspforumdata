The only KSPI derivative that seems to be updated anymore is KSP Interstellar - Extended. I played KSPI because it seemed like a nice end-game thing that helped fill out some of the later game stages. However, looking at the installation for KSPI-E, I\u0027m thinking its a good time to revisit which of these two late game mods I would like to install. So what do people like to use and why? Do people prefer one or the other or both? Does that even work well(using both together)? How stable are they? Is KSPI-E\u0027s installation as bad as it seems? How well do they fill out the tech tree/late game? Any other end game type mods out there I should consider? (Besides OKS/MKS which I already have). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote I have uploaded \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-WIP-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-Extended\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPI Extended\u003C/a\u003E which includes support for Near Future Tech\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T09:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
