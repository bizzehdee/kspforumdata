I had an idea. I have sketched a model up if anyone wants to see but I had an idea for a new method of propulsion. It sounds... theoretically possible. Ive done a bit of research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep one, super heat a inert gas like argon to a plasma state. Then, accelerate and ionize the plasma, then pass it through several yards of magnetically charged poles, accelerating the now negatively charged plasma. Next add a new medium, like liquid fuel, kethane, or a very reactive alkaline metal or earth metal like lithium. WITHOUT IT REACTING? Foof? ... Then condense the super heated hybrid plasma/fuel mix and compress it by using extreme heat from a reactor. Once it reaches a high temperature, introduce a nuclear fuel like UT36... Or nuclear fuel pellets. Next propel this mixture at a very high rate through another method of super heating. Maybe lasers? kind of like the engine we have, but using magnetically charged particles and ions to achieve higher specific impulse and higher impulse velocity. Meaning slightly more thrust. However this would be an extremely heavy engine... and it would require several sources of fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO. Pros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery high specific impulse and reliability good thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery efficient and can use MANY different fuel combinations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of its fuels are found within many planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the reactors that would need to be built into this to even be able to sustain its power needs, it would be very heavy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you need magnets or some kind of polarized screen to accelerate any kind of ion... I\u0027m not quite sure if plasma can be ionized because it\u0027s already in a unique state... Maybe you could ionize it before hand and then super heat it, and in the end neutralize the ion after it is charged and combined with your second fuel type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you need an inert gas, a noble gas... A reactive earth or alkali metal... and nuclear fuel... it would be hard to use all of these all at once. you might also need extra generators... thus adding MORE weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to store these... so... Weight weight weight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would work because when an ion is charged and run through an electrical field, it accelerates. This is how a general Ion drive works. HOWEVER, if you super heat an ionized gas, then polarize it, it acts...differently. Although an inert gas is perfect because it has a full shell of electrons, when it is ionized, the electrons act differently. it can now have negative charge because it can GAIN another electron. Since it has this extra electron, it is now more likely that another element, either a halogen, which is ONE electron short of a perfect shell, or an alkaline earth metal, which has very few valence electrons, could bond with this and/or react with it. this new combination cannot react however, because it isn\u0027t chemically possible to force the atomic level of electrons into another level........ It just isn\u0027t possible through an electrical field. SO. This means that you must then bring in fusion. Which... right now isn\u0027t possible. BUUUT. who knows maybe in a couple decades right? --- anyways. You bring in fusion. Maybe obtainable by very focused lasers. Once this happens... well. I\u0027m unsure. I havent done much research beyond this point. ... But if anyone cares to comment let me know. JUST A CRAZY OUT OF THIS WORLD KIND OF IDEA BUT. Hey, it\u0027s worth mentioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif any of my chemistry is wrong let me know. it probably is.

I sent a 3.75m tank from KW rocketry with 16 science labs attached using the radial connector parts to Moho. Filled them with smart Kerbals. Being within the max science orbit, it is reasonable to say they generate at least 2.5 science per day per lab. With this set up, it only takes 525 days to generate 21,000 science. That\u0027s a really small time frame when you consider how long it takes to send a mission out to Jool for a moon tour or science heavy Eeloo mission. I had my lab station set up at Moho, then decided to send a probe out to Jool to suck the science out of all the moons\u0027 orbits. By the time my probe got to Jool, I only needed a few thousand science to wrap up the entire tech tree. It was exciting for all of the 5 seconds it took to spend the science. lol I didn\u0027t realize that I had pretty much negated the need to gain any science in the next 17 months until I actually already got the labs to Moho as I couldn\u0027t really gain enough science anywhere close enough to matter. I would have sent fewer labs and will next save game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFractal, perhaps you can consider diminishing returns on the science labs so that one can\u0027t simply get a ton of labs out to Moho and then wait 1.5 years and clear the tech tree. I would think even 50-75% reduction would work and not be too harsh. Using random numbers, in orbit around Moho, the first lab would give 3 science per day. The second would give 1.5 science per day. The third, .75. And so on. This would prevent the situation I described above and encourage people to spread out their labs instead of stacking a whole bunch at Moho or Eeloo.

In your case, you might consider using a thermal rocket on that ship instead of a plasma thruster and see if that will give you more usable TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just realized I am simply lacking the tech right now to make this happen.

I sent a 3.75m tank from KW rocketry with 16 science labs attached using the radial connector parts to Moho. Filled them with smart Kerbals. Being within the max science orbit, it is reasonable to say they generate at least 2.5 science per day per lab. With this set up, it only takes 525 days to generate 21,000 science. That\u0027s a really small time frame when you consider how long it takes to send a mission out to Jool for a moon tour or science heavy Eeloo mission. I had my lab station set up at Moho, then decided to send a probe out to Jool to suck the science out of all the moons\u0027 orbits. By the time my probe got to Jool, I only needed a few thousand science to wrap up the entire tech tree. It was exciting for all of the 5 seconds it took to spend the science. lol I didn\u0027t realize that I had pretty much negated the need to gain any science in the next 17 months until I actually already got the labs to Moho as I couldn\u0027t really gain enough science anywhere close enough to matter. I would have sent fewer labs and will next save game.\u003Cp\u003EFractal, perhaps you can consider diminishing returns on the science labs so that one can\u0027t simply get a ton of labs out to Moho and then wait 1.5 years and clear the tech tree. I would think even 50-75% reduction would work and not be too harsh. Using random numbers, in orbit around Moho, the first lab would give 3 science per day. The second would give 1.5 science per day. The third, .75. And so on. This would prevent the situation I described above and encourage people to spread out their labs instead of stacking a whole bunch at Moho or Eeloo. Maybe let upgraded computer cores not have diminishing returns (or reduced) since they require such a hefty investment to allow generation of science in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you post a screenshot of the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I just unlocked the Fusion Power Engines, but I severely lack power to consistently run them, I know it may be redundant but how do I go about making my generators put out more energy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T10:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pantheis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pantheis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould the 2.5m fully upgraded plasma thruster being powered by a fully upgraded 2.5m antimatter reactor and generator be eating my antimatter by multiple units per second?

Another alternative is just to persist the science rate keyed off of the craft id.
