It\u0027s possibly the center piece of the game, with it\u0027s lego style building style where you can mix and match into an infinite number of possibilities. It\u0027s literally endless. However in the last month or so, I\u0027ve taken stock of how there are a few aspects of designing rocketry that is absent from KSP unlike in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m not referring to the hard skill of figuring out what angle a certain structural element needs to be in order to resist the aerodynamic effects or anything, I\u0027m referring to simply the difficulties like working within a narrow margin (such as a weight, or size limitation put on by a booster), or whether the astronaut is standing up for that lunar/munar landing or sitting down, or more importantly to me, working with a group of people to make something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP as it is, you develop your rockets and spacecraft independently without any outside influences. Occasionally you may pass a craft file around and have people work on it, but still theres a lack of drawn out development. Real aerospace engineers spitball possibly hundreds and hundreds of different concepts and ideas before even one gets anywhere. Then when one does, they work together to make into something that may one day see the light of day for real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineers form a tight bond as they spend hundreds of sleepless hours with these people, people they share the same dream and hopes with. The hopes to see their work finally turned real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my thoughts, I have to turn to the HBO miniseries \u003Cem\u003EFrom The Earth to The Moon\u003C/em\u003E episode \u003Cem\u003ESpider\u003C/em\u003E. The episode follows the development of the Apollo Lunar Module, beginning with the Grumman company getting the contract\u00A0for designing it. The episode shows how it was slowly developed, the various forms it had and how it initially was an ugly failure of a spacecraft. One of the best scenes to explain what I mean, is the scene where some engineers have to show to their boss why the lunar pilot\u0027s should be standing up as opposed to sitting down, seen here-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLQeqMaHVYs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy choosing to have the astronauts standing up, they\u0027d be closer to the window providing a better view which would in trade allow for smaller and more importantly lighter windows. Not to mention the fact that seats are unneeded as the astronaut\u0027s knees would be fantastic shock absorbers with the 1/6th lunar gravity which would also save weight of the chairs. All of these decisions and collaborations helped shape the Lunar Module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other aspect that we don\u0027t get from our work in KSP is a true love for our work, and our designs. As the character who was the boss of the design for the Lunar Module said at the end when LM-3 was being packaged for Apollo 9\u00A0(first manned flight of the LM), he said \u0022He felt like a father watching his kid preparing to head for college\u0022. Their work wasn\u0027t just a design or concept to them, it was their hopes and dreams put into this one machine. They of course knew this as again the supervisor said \u0022We all knew that it was just a bunch of bolts and wires but it had the soul of those who built her- first dreamed of her-\u0022. Which is one thing most of our creations will never have, which is that soul of those who have spend days, weeks or months pouring over this idea endlessly. It\u0027s not that we can\u0027t in KSP, it\u0027s that our efforts can never amount to those who make something into reality. Seeing it from paper to a physical form is something unbelievable. Now you can have your KSP creations made into reality thanks to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153166-eucl3d/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153166\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/153166-eucl3d/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Eucl3D\u003C/a\u003E, but they will never be real in that they will work, fly and do amazing things for other people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe element of collaboration and cooperation is an aspect that KSP sadly lacks, however I feel that may not always be true. For brief periods we can see some great engineers outwit problems across other\u0027s games and work together to form some fantastic things. So maybe KSP doesn\u0027t have that singular focused collaboration aspect, but the cooperative spirit is strong. Not to mention that maybe we can have this collaborative spirit if we wanted it. We just need a project big enough \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I guess at the end of it all, KSP might just be the centerpiece to all of our engineering ideas. Maybe we do have that engineering bond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, if you haven\u0027t seen the HBO miniseries \u003Cem\u003EFrom the Earth to the Moon\u003C/em\u003E, your missing out on one of the best docudramas ever. It\u0027s directed and produced by Tom Hanks and stars many famous actors at the time. Not to mention the lunar module seen in the series is a real unused lunar module! Specifically, LM-13, the one they planned to use for Apollo 18 before the missions were cancelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatch the series, it\u0027s amazingly done and does fantastic at representing NASA from pre-Mercury to the last few Apollo missions. Every episode is filled with new style and content. Every episode is different and very unique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027m going to say about it, \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0just go watch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T09:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for pointing me at that, it looks like I\u0027ll enjoy that....\u00A0Just ordered it from amazon.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T13:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222691469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144574\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469525491\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130621\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pandaman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, pandaman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for pointing me at that, it looks like I\u0027ll enjoy that....\u00A0Just ordered it from amazon.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll love it!
