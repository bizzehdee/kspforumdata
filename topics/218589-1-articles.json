For instance, there has been argument about the way in which colonies should share resources. Since this is the development suggestion/discussion page, I would like to highlight some places where KSP 1 mods have kind of \u201Cfigured it out\u201D to some extent:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Basic life support (less punishing than Kerbalism)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Colony Supply Management\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Supply route automation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Interstellar capable engines\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Other solar systems\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Rocket wobble (many parts mods have very large/long or procedural parts to reduce joint connections and minimize wobble)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Much, much more\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some cases, I think mods can be almost literally copied, and with minimal streamline and improved performance, it is basically perfect. In other cases, there are lessons to be learned- for instance the variety of extra large parts indicates that players in fact DO NOT like wobble or view it as integral to the late game experience at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m sure the devs are looking to mods for inspiration (and staff!) but it seems like a lot of people posting here forget that we already have blueprints for successful gameplay in a lot of key areas, and as a result they argue unnecessarily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I off-base or redundant?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barrackar","CreatedById":197197,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-06T04:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure what you mean by listing these mods.

Basic mechanics working in the background are fundamentally different even if they result in similar on-screen elements.\u00A0 Also, usually my experience with KSP1 mods is they are often in need of optimization and generally computationally taxing. This is alright for a mod where a person can choose to not use the mod but the base-game needs a higher level of optimization than found in most mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VlonaldKerman","CreatedById":225683,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-06T15:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224309251\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218589\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691297896\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197197\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barrackar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Barrackar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure what you mean by listing these mods.

I meant \u201Ccopy\u201D in the sense of, take note of the mechanic, and program a new system that takes heavy inspiration from the ground up, which, to your point, would allow for better optimization. In fact, for me personally, optimization is the whole point of buying a new game. If I wanted features that were buggy and laggy, I would stick with my huge KSP 1 mod pack. So I think we are in agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
