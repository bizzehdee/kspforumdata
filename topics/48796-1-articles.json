I upped the resolution to play at full screen but other than that I left everything as-is. I can play KSP and it plays fine. I can record it, and while recording it also plays fine. The recordings look fine (a bit of a frame rate drop but not too bad) and everything\u0027s great... for about 10 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay is not affected. I don\u0027t know anything is wrong. My recording software (Bandicam) doesn\u0027t complain or show lowered frame rates or anything. However, when I come later and look at the recorded video, after the first 10 minutes or so it starts getting choppy and after 20 minutes it\u0027s a slideshow. Audio is not affected by this but the video is essentially annoying to watch after 10 minutes and unwachable after 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have recorded multi-hour sessions of other games (FTL, Minecraft, and recently Cities XL) with Bandicam and have never had a problem. KSP though is just dogging it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else had a problem like this and have you solved it? I hate to turn down settings but I will if it means I can keep recording. I may even do a self-imposed 10 minute limit and just stop and start the recording each time, though I could see forgetting to do that. But ideally if someone has had this problem and found a fix, that would obviously be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thrashing mad","CreatedById":61251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo problems with FRAPS here, even though I\u0027m using an ancient computer to play and record.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would also suggest FRAPS. 0 issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the final recording is just choppy during playback, but has no effect during gameplay? Try opening the video in another media viewer, or open it up in a video editor and see if it plays there. Also, in the one you\u0027re currently using, try pausing it during playback for a few seconds, and then play it again and see if it stops. I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re using something like VLC. Try Media Player Classic or something else and see if it changes in behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like this isn\u0027t an issue with KSP but with encoding or something to do with the media player. Try what I\u0027ve suggested, or using different settings with Bandicam, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T03:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just weird that I can record anything for hours, but KSP won\u0027t record for 10 minutes. It\u0027s assuredly the file I\u0027ve opened it in Windows Media, VLC, and my video editing software. I\u0027ve tried a few settings to just record differently in Bandicam to no avail as well. It always just gets progressively worse. It\u0027s like there\u0027s a memory leak or something. If I just stop the recording and start a new one, though, it\u0027s fine. This really does tell me the problem is with Bandicam and not with KSP, but it\u0027s got to be related in some way to KSP as it only occurs while I\u0027m recording KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions. I\u0027ve tried a few of them already but will try the others, and then maybe just jump in and get Fraps. I wish there was a trial version that recorded more than 1 minute though so I could see for sure that it will work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T05:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter fiddling for an hour I decided to plop down the $37 for Fraps. I\u0027m not the only one to have this problem with Bandicam as evidenced by their support forum, and in all cases the programmer suggested they turn down their settings. If I turned down my settings any further it\u0027d look like RealPlayer from 1997.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFraps recorded with perfect framerates all the way through.
