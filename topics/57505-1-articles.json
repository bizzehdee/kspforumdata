(I play with RemoteTech 2) And I had them spaced out roughly equally around their orbits at 120 degrees apart, at VERY precise circular orbits at 2868.75 Km. And just now I was doing a launch of an unmanned drive stage for an interplanetary mission to dock with a lander already in orbit, and all of a sudden I lost control completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I looked at the map view KSP seems to have clustered my satellites together on one side of Kerbin without me touching them at all. And the stupid thing is my vastly over-engineered communication satellites have tons of dV left, but they are all on the wrong side of Kerbin from KSC so I can\u0027t even control them to adjust their positions in game! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now my question is, can I edit my persistence file to change where along their orbit each satellite it to get them back to where I left them?

Also note that while your satellites may be on a circular orbit by game standards, they are not \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E circular.
