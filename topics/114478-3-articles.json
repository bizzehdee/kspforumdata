But what many of us are complaining about is the fact that there are annoying bugs that have been present for several releases that still have not been fixed, and the fact that new bugs have been introduced because of rushing releases and an apparent lack of general quality assurance/testing. The temperature gauge memory leak, the trailing launch clamps post-launch, the save-breaking heat shields of 1.0.3, and the NullRef log spam with the parachutes in 1.0.4 are all examples issues that should have been easily detected if they had tested the game properly before their respective releases. When I was last working as a web applications developer, my boss would have fired me if I had consistent bug-ridden code like KSP does; now granted I was writing web services for multi-million dollar e-commerce sites in which my code handled pricing and payment transactions, so a screw up by me could have cost that company a lot of money, so I had that type of pressure to test my stuff thoroughly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T04:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople like to get up on the soapbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre 1.0 announcements, a load of people made a big deal about aero.

It doesn\u0027t affect me at all because I backed up 1.0.2, and I play FAR and NF HC anyway. But some have argued in this thread that it might confuse new people, and I can see that point of view. Changing the fundamental basis for the first 5 minutes of a new player\u0027s game shouldn\u0027t be done casually or frequently. We\u0027re not all complaining because we\u0027re bitter, old, nasty, \u0022entitled,\u0022 elitists, or whatever the slur of the day might be. Some of us are sincerely trying to look at the broader picture, and how all this affects KSP in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course there\u0027s always the issue of mods, which have to be recompiled (at least) or reconsidered practically from scratch (at worst). Career saves are also an issue for some, though I used career as a tutorial because sandbox overwhelmed me - regardless, that\u0027s a point of view that, though it\u0027s not necessarily mine, isn\u0027t invalid. Even non-career saves can be effectively broken, hundreds of hours of play thrown out the window, if someone has a ship or station in orbit that he\u0027s worked hard on, that\u0027s suddenly rendered useless because the laws of the universe have suddenly changed. Not everyone knows he should copy his Steam install elsewhere, just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETossing out these simultaneously huge and partial, casual, bug-ridden updates sends a very clear message to at least some players: \u0022The time you invested in our product means \u003Cem\u003Enothing \u003C/em\u003Eto us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all for fixes.
