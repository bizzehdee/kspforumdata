So then I had fun with the sandbox mode. Of course, once I figured out I was doing something wrong when I launched a Kerbal into helocentric orbit when trying to get into orbit (its a quick change from suborbital to getting high on the orbits, and I had too much Dv on full burn), and so did a crash course in orbital machanics and found out I was doing it all wrong and had overbuilt rockets. Now I am decent at getting stuff into Low (Kerbal?) Orbit. And had fun building a few rockets including one heavy lifter that put the stock station core in a nice 90 degree circular orbit will fuel to spare at about 190k meters. even did a flyby of Mun with a unmanned probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I had failures, a couple failed unmanned orbital burns, a near (\u0026lt;10 k) collision of a probe with my station, launching a Kerbal into solar orbit, and I didn\u0027t line up ladders right on one thing I made and Bob went flying into space without a handhold. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think tonight I will be starting a new save as now I have a concept of what the heck I am doing. Trying to not doing too much wiki and learn from mistakes, but I might need to ask on how to get more science in non-sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
