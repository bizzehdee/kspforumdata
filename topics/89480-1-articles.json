YMMV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m not using Better Atmospheres after having some issues with it in .24, and I don\u0027t think it has been updated since v5 for 0.23.5, maybe it still works though?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- DebRefund: never tried, no idea. I use Kerbal Construction Time (awesome, makes the game feel much more strategic) and it includes a stage recovery thing that works quite well and is also compatible with RealChutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will definitely want ActiveTextureManagement, I personally like to add GreenSkull\u0027s configs in the \u0022GFX optimized\u0022 variant (google \u0022greenskull atm 1.1\u0022 to find them I think, if they can be found anywhere more obvious or if something newer exists, I hope someone can point to that). You may also want to use the \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 option which can drop memory use dramatically (my game is ~3.2 GB on startup with directX, 1.9GB with OpenGL); there may be an impact in performance depending on your GPU/drivers, though I understand it\u0027s ok for most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for RemoteTech, I\u0027ve used it on and off, but I think I actually very much like the challenge of designing and deploying efficient relay networks (even though I was apparently doing it wrong until recently, didn\u0027t know about aiming dishes at planets/moons); it\u0027s a bit of a game within the game though so you may feel it distracts from the main stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I\u0027d recommend a few more \u0022utility\u0022 type mods: PreciseNode, NavHud (awesome, that), maybe Action Groups Extended, EditorExtensions and SelectRoot. For flavor, I enjoy Final Frontier and Fine Print gives me lots of variety in contracts. Finally, I use MechJeb (solely for readouts, no automation) rather than KER as I\u0027ve found the latter to be occasionally very wrong in delta-v calculations (especially with exotic staging and/or multiple payloads).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that was a bit of a rant but I hope it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*) Well, I thought on this and while FAR is not a complete game changer for rockets and TACLS is mostly just an extra thing to put on board, DRE can really be a killer, so it really will be harder than stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso regarding the RealChutes issues, there is that bug that staging does not deploy chutes and you need an action group.
