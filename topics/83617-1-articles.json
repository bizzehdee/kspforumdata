You can go past that mark, but you do risk a flame out/flat spin, and in general the higher your throttle setting is at that point, the less time you\u0027ll have to respond before a flame out occurs. Here\u0027s what you can do - pull down to about 2/3 throttle and keep going. If your plane starts yawing to one side without you giving any input, kick it down another notch or two and put yourself back on your original heading. Rinse and repeat. I\u0027ve been able to use Turbojets with as little as 0.01 units of air per engine before keeping this method going.
