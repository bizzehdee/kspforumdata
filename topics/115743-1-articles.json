So far in the [Solar Limbo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124522-Solar-Limbo-How-Low-can-you-Go) challenge, only 4 people have gotten below 1Mm and lived. The current record is held by [LordCorwin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124522-Solar-Limbo-How-Low-can-you-Go?p=2017854\u0026viewfull=1#post2017854) at 589km and change.\n\nShips only survive that low if they have radiators (and lots of them), so just a pod by itself will explode once physics loads as you approach it.\n\nBut assuming it doesn\u0027t, EVA Kerbals explode above 1Mm so the only chance you have here is to grab it with the Klaw. And the Klawship has to have enough dV to circularize below 1Mm from Kerbol, then get back to Kerbin, then slow down at Kerbin enough on thrust and maybe a Mun gravity assist that it can survive aerobraking at Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:24:04Z","Content":"Why not Low Sun retrograde orbit even?

I was lucky enough to be able to unlock the Nuke Engine for this, but it still ended up being a ship that runs at under 10 FPS at all times. The Launch of the Tug that had 10k of the 15k delta V needed, launched at 3 FPS from Kerbin. I still need to do the circularization burn and rendezvous, but I am pretty confident I\u0027ll make it back with Scott and land him safely.\n\nHere is a picture of the Tug and the main rescue ship in Kerbin Orbit:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![48c676bccc.jpg](http://puu.sh/iXLuR/48c676bccc.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n(Don\u0027t pay attention to KER dV readouts.
