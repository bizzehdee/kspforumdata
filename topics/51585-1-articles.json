In 0.21 I could have Nova Punch, B9, Kosmos, etc, all running alongside each other, but similar packs for this version are incredibly buggy. Certain mod configs crash my game at the end of loading, while others seem to load fine, and then crash while doing random actions mid game. Are there any tricks to running more mods alongside each other? Or is this just the case of the a normal issue, that I\u0027ve just luckily avoided before?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T19:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith each update Squad makes, the more \u0027stock\u0027 content they add, the more the base game is gonna eat up resources. 0.21 used less memory than 0.22 does, so if your list of mods was close to ram limit in 0.21 then very possible same ones are putting ya over limit in 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultimatevirus","CreatedById":79767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T21:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edidn\u0027t they also make some changes on the source code as well (in the end it all ads up) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aslimchicken","CreatedById":81822,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T14:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new B9 pack is giving me serious problems.

Using only B9, half-res worked. At first, though, you\u0027ll need to drop the texture quality without any mods installed, otherwise it\u0027ll usually crash during the first loading screen or right after it finishes while loading to the main menu. I\u0027ve got LLL, B9, Firespitter, Boats R3, MechJeb, Lazor, and Lazor sunbeam working after dropping the quality to quarter resolution and installing the reduced B9 textures that come with the latest release. Unfortunately, that seems to be the absolute maximum amount. I know LLL is pretty huge, so that may be a part of the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
