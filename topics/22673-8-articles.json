Could you add in support for contracts, e.g. have the plugin randomly create contracts that involve the deployment of a GNSS network? For instance, it could be \u0022establish a twelve-satellite GNSS transmitter network orbiting the Mun at 90deg orbital inclination at a 200x100km orbit\u0022 - the randomly-selected variables would be the number of satellites, the body around which the constellation should orbit, the orbital inclination and the periapse and apoapse of the constellation orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(obviously the body around which the constellation should orbit should be based on currently-researched technology, if possible.
