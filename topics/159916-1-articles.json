KSP is all about exploration and building and flying, where YOU make the rules! Career was just an addon to it.

It gives more space and flexability in expirementing and eventually refining techniques! You complain of lack of goals but KSP has had no goals for years!

And it was simultaneously clear that the Kerbol system was finite and it would be a sad day when there were no more planets and moons to conquer. So I decided: I would pick up every contract I was capable of but had never done before. Whether it was a new type of contract, or an old type in a new location, that\u0027s how I would define the progression of my space agency. And for each new contract I wouldn\u0027t just do the\u00A0bare minimum, but I would plan it, design it, and execute it in a way my Kerbals would be proud of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA base on Minmus with 5000 units of ore?

It\u0027s going to be a full base, with living, power, mining modules; the capability to dock with surface-to-orbit shuttles; some rovers for exploring. Why? Because that\u0027s how I imagine the space agency would progress.

When making career mode, the obvious thing to do with part progression\u00A0was to have an unlocking system for all the parts in existance, while starting with bins full of dynamite. I think something that would work\u00A0much better would be to,\u00A0at the start give you a wide range of 2 or 3 parts of\u00A0each type of part available, and through using them either significantly upgrade or unlock newer parts of the same type. For example, as opposed to unlocking the standard landing legs by recording your\u00A0\u0022observations about the situation\u0022 during orbital ascent looking out the window, you would instead upgrade or unlock the,\u00A0by touching down with a cruder version\u00A0on 2 bodies with significantly different gravity. (I.E. The Mun and Minmus) that way you still have to manage your space program and build it from the ground up, while having some freedom to do your own thing in the first part of the save, while not just giving you everything in sandbox. Another thing that needs to be redone to keep the game semi-believable would be reworked contracts. Why the hell would a company want to test a decoupler on a suborbital Eeloo trajectory? A much more realistic and vaguely sensible contract would be to do something like \u0022put a comunication satellite in a orbit giving it a signal to the\u00A0western continent,\u0022 or when the game progresses something like \u0022move 5000 units of ore from our Ike mining station to our Duna base.\u0022 A\u00A0lot more civilian company\u0027s would have to be added, but that wouldn\u0027t be to hard.
