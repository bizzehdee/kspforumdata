Well, it\u0027s going to revolutionise RTS gameplay. Instead of a traditional rectangular map, the developers are aiming to achieve a full solar system with round planets, which as many as 40 or more players fighting in one game, on seperate planets and asteroids. It is set in a science-ficiton future where technology has become the best of it\u0027s kind, after humans have been wiped out and an interplanetary war started by humans is still being carried out by replicating robots that fight endlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGame Information\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forums.uberent.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=61\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe official Planetary Annihilation forum\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/08/15/planetary-annihilation-interview/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPC Gamer Interview\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forums.uberent.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=61\u0026amp;t=34022\u0026amp;sid=126ae08a1559d6e24947d20835d28ad4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EForum Thread of official announced features\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout it:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re not shooting for realism; we\u0027re shooting for awesome\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game isn\u0027t meant to be a super realistic game. At quoted above, they are focusing a lot more on the gameplay than the realism side of things. Despite this, many parts of the game are still physics based; you can alter planetary orbits, you can fire using large artillery cannons from celestial object to celestial object! When travelling around, you don\u0027t use warp drives; you use good old rocket engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game world isn\u0027t a bunch of preset planets. When relocating to a new planet all the gameplay still happens around you. Time doesn\u0027t freeze with multiple different static play areas; instead, the game world is fully simulated and you have full control over gameplay, everywhere. Each planet can interact with another, to the extent of CRASHING ASTEROIDS INTO PLANETS. Yes, you hear me correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOfficial Trailer:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhEYvOYceNs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModding is an extremely high priority for the game developers. They plan to allow you to install mods directly when joining a server instead of needing to hunt them down, and a full scripting system is planned. Each game planet is fully procedural and this means that every time you play, you can either have a randomly generated map, a built in preset map, or even load in planets you made with an in-game editor and map your own solar system. The editor isn\u0027t in any way limited; you\u0027d be able to make unlimited sized planets as far as the game could handle without crashing, and even then if you are feeling cocky you will be able to override it with a simple console command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe developers aren\u0027t skimping on multiplayer, either. They are making sure to support Windows, Mac and Linux, and LAN multiplayer will be fully supported. They are trying to make the possibilities endless; in the finished game, you\u0027ll even be able to \u0022share\u0022 a faction with another player to allow both big set up multiplayer tounraments where several players on the same faction could all individually micro-manage a few planets while sharing the same resource pools and units, or you could have dozens of seperate factions, all playing in the same world, at the same time, fully interacting with each other. It\u0027s completely versatile: one minute you could be playing a small game with only one planet and a very small amount of players, traditional RTS style, and the next you could be trekking across entire solar systems, fighting off thousands of units from dozens of factions on hundreds of planets and moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith such great multiplayer possibilities, you\u0027ll want to remember these epic battles. That\u0027s why a full gameplay recorder is being implemented, which will record every step of the game, and you will be able to play it back later. None of these static recordings either! You\u0027ll be able to change camera position and angles, change what faction\u0027s line of site you are viewing and view their resources at any time, and watch a fully dynamic recording afterwards which means that casual players can enjopy rewatching their best battles while both groups could view it to carefully refine what they had done wrong, and hone up their skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETotalHalibut\u0027s Developer Interview:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqDSh34VoPY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember to try and pledge high!
