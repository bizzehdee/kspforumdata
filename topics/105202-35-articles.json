It is not lossless of course but it can extend your supplies without needing any MKS parts.\n\u003E I can say as a long time TAC user that in practice I have found little gameplay difference switching to USI-LS. Whether my \u0022food\u0022 containers have 1 item or 3 has not changed the overall gameplay.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E thank you for the quick reply. I\u0027m going to switch right now, the ability to be a little lazy while still needing to dedicate weight to life support was what I wanted. And it\u0027ll mesh better with mks.\n\nI played with TAC for some time too, and I can agree that the simpleness of a single resource trumps the micromanagement of three, even if they\u0027re as obvious as air, food and water."},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T21:53:50Z","Content":"The parts for this mod do not seem to be assigned to the Life Support category that Kolonization adds in the VAB.
