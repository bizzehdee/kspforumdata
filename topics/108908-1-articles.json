I was just curious from reading a couple of mission reports and thinking back on the good ol\u0027 days of pre-1.0 when things were simpler and we had plenty of experiences learning how to play this fantastic game we have here. So I got to thinking: What were everybody\u0027s most important experiences like? How are their stories different than mine?\n\nTo be sure, there are many, many important milestones that KSP players blow through. Making a successful airplane, getting your first orbit, docking for the first time. I\u0027ve decided, though, to talk about Munar landings first because that is one of the biggest thrills for a newbie rocket engineer, I would think!\n\nSo go on, share your stories! I want to know how your first landing went down! Crash and burn or stylish touchdown?\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nMy first ever Munar landing went much better than I expected. Being the space nerd that I was almost two years ago (and don\u0027t you think for a second that I\u0027ve changed since then!), I named my first designated Munar lander the Armstrong Munar Lander, an unmanned probe (gotta do it safely). By this point orbital mechanics were easy enough to understand for me, and once I figured out how SOIs work and roughly how to do it I decided to go for it.\n\nBig overbuilt rocket ahoy, and I went to the Mun. I don\u0027t recall whether or not I\u0027d sent flybys or impactors before, but I think the beauty of the place still captured my imagination. I eventually picked a flat-ish landing site and burned to slow myself.\n\nBoy, what a rush that burn was... I was scared out of my wits that I\u0027d run out of fuel on the way down, and indeed I think I came close. My lander consisted of the medium landing gear, two unfoldable 2x3 solar panels, a Stayputnik core (back in the days when it had SAS control) and two extendable communotrons. \n\nAfter minutes of terror and burning, I finally got my speed down to a safe-is level and touched down. Then it was a frenzy of making sure the accursed thing was stable before I clapped my hands and grinned from the achievement. That was one of the best days of my KSP experience!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, the landing was bittersweet. After I had landed I had forgotten to take pictures, but the place I had landed in prevented me from taking good ones. I forgot whether or not it was before or after my second Munar landing (appropriately with the Aldrin Munar Lander), but I needed to move my probe into the light to get a good angle.\n\u003E \n\u003E Long story short, I over-corrected and smashed my beautiful lander into the Mun, destroying it in true Kerbal fashion."},{"CreatedByName":"longcat","CreatedById":61249,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:36:23Z","Content":"I landed, realized I forgot to add a ladder, and decided to take off.

During my first Munlanding i landed directly on the Moon without orbiting it first, too dangerous with the lack of information back then. Looking up the proper orbital speed at certain heights in a chart was definitely interesting, and somewhat blindly flying at the Mun (The old \u0027When the Mun rises over the horizon, speed up until speed x\u0027 technique) did add to the \u0027seat of your pants\u0027 feeling and at times i kinda miss it.\n\nUnfortunately i have no pictures of that era anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:03:16Z","Content":"My was in overegineered rocket. \n\nGot all the nose cones, decouplers, proper chute, etc. etc. as a real rocket should have, while in fact it was by far more optimal to dump all that dead weight and launch simple pancake, stage it, land, and reenter in a big rocket instead of stripping it down to the capsule with a single chute.\n\nAnyway.... I ended up quickly crashing in my first two attempts, but 3rd one worked... it was all nice and great until I realized that after climbing to the orbit I had very little fuel left (mind you - overengineering - so my lander got far more fuel than a display was suggesting, I just had plenty of empty tanks)... so with that in mind I designed quite nice return trajectory with gravity assist and pushed my rocked down to the last drop of fuel... just to realize that my trajectory was going directly in a dead center of the planet... wow, I was totally disappointed... all that effort went for nothing, my poor Kerbal was going to burn in the atmosphere... oh well... I accelerated time to 70km, decoupled my all the tanks end engine to the side, and decided to accompany my brave astronaut through his last moments of life... imagine my surprise to find out that there is no reentry heat in the game, so nothing happened - I went through the atmosphere and made a perfect, clear splashdown.\n\nWell... that was the moment when bubble burst and I stopped thinking that KSP got some advanced physics simulation."},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:03:44Z","Content":"Single stage to the mun with warp and nuclear engines from some parts packs.
