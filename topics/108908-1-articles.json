I was just curious from reading a couple of mission reports and thinking back on the good ol\u0027 days of pre-1.0 when things were simpler and we had plenty of experiences learning how to play this fantastic game we have here. So I got to thinking: What were everybody\u0027s most important experiences like? How are their stories different than mine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be sure, there are many, many important milestones that KSP players blow through. Making a successful airplane, getting your first orbit, docking for the first time. I\u0027ve decided, though, to talk about Munar landings first because that is one of the biggest thrills for a newbie rocket engineer, I would think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go on, share your stories!

Being the space nerd that I was almost two years ago (and don\u0027t you think for a second that I\u0027ve changed since then!), I named my first designated Munar lander the Armstrong Munar Lander, an unmanned probe (gotta do it safely). By this point orbital mechanics were easy enough to understand for me, and once I figured out how SOIs work and roughly how to do it I decided to go for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig overbuilt rocket ahoy, and I went to the Mun. I don\u0027t recall whether or not I\u0027d sent flybys or impactors before, but I think the beauty of the place still captured my imagination. I eventually picked a flat-ish landing site and burned to slow myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoy, what a rush that burn was... I was scared out of my wits that I\u0027d run out of fuel on the way down, and indeed I think I came close. My lander consisted of the medium landing gear, two unfoldable 2x3 solar panels, a Stayputnik core (back in the days when it had SAS control) and two extendable communotrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter minutes of terror and burning, I finally got my speed down to a safe-is level and touched down. Then it was a frenzy of making sure the accursed thing was stable before I clapped my hands and grinned from the achievement.

After I had landed I had forgotten to take pictures, but the place I had landed in prevented me from taking good ones.
