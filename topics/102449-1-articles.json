But inevitable the contracts get boring. Or at least too time intensive (building a station around eve for example). also having build a Station i dont want to build one again. So im looking for another way to make cash. My Idea is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm using Karbonite to refuel my Spacecrafts. WOuldnt it be possible to imagine KArbonite is a very valuable resource even if available on nearly every planet? I would like to increase the Price of the Karbonite itself, so that the challange would be to mine the resource and fly it back to KSC to get the money with the return value of the Resource. Only thing is: I have no clue where i can change the price of the resource itself in the PArt configs. Can you guys help me out? Where do i change the Resourceprice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreez\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats what, I do hehe and you needed to look in the CommunityResourcePack folder and then open CommonResources.cfg and in the list you will found \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ERESOURCE_DEFINITION\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = Karbonite\u003Cbr\u003E\tdensity = 0.0125\u003Cbr\u003E\t[COLOR=\u0022#FF0000\u0022]unitCost = 100.6[/COLOR]      // And , I have it set at 100.6 you can change it to what ever.\u003Cbr\u003E\tflowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW \u003Cbr\u003E\ttransfer = PUMP\u003Cbr\u003E\tisTweakable = true\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT- If you want a MM Patch maybe something like \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@RESOURCE_DEFINITION[Karbonite]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@name = Karbonite\u003Cbr\u003E\t%unitCost = 100.6 \u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T14:05:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get the Karbonite Plus mod too, which extend karbonite and add \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EKarborundum, which is extremely expensive, but also extremely efficient fuel.
