Gone from the confines of early access and having reached two major milestones since, it\u0027s\u00A0discovering the\u00A0\u0027real world\u0027 of PC and now console gaming. That world is not a pleasant one, and the \u0027new kid\u0027 is attracting unwanted attention. Reminds me of Grade 4 back home. And Grade 8, and Grade 10. And a few other milestones I\u0027d rather forget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tone\u00A0was quite different here, because in early access there were very low expectations. Even I, who would gladly lash out at an established developer for not following best current practices on Windows, am holding back something fierce. I genuinely love the premise of KSP, and only the Steam edition makes installing it somewhat sane because Valve is taking care of the workarounds needed to run this game somewhat safely. So I just sit back, and if anyone asks for my professional IT opinion I suggest they get a Steam account and purchase KSP from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat tone is changing with KSP\u0027s popularity expanding. We\u0027re attracting the console generation here, and they are used to the quality (ahem) of Call of Duty, Halo, Gears of War, Fallout, and so on with very large amounts of development time behind them. With more YouTube exposure we\u0027re also attracting the wretched hive of scum and villainy that is the YouTube Comments Section. And our teenage space sim franchise is learning the hard way that the real world sucks and groups of real people\u00A0can and will be evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow our community and developers respond to this will define it for good. It\u0027s time to live\u00A0away from home and make the hard decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T20:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222826329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477594244\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250907\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(...) so what leaps out at you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Two sets of goodbyes, i think on the whole the community has come to terms with the whole business, and it\u0027s time to put something a little more positive in the devblogs if only to brighten the mood of the first page most people see.
