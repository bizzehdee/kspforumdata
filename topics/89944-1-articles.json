As a new player, I had a lot of fun going to the Mun/Minimus since the available tools/information made the algorithm to get there simple: get into orbit, place a maneuver node randomly on your orbit, drag apoapsis to intersect the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit, and then adjust the location of the node until you get a good encounter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, going interplanetary is more complicated, and either requires knowledge of phase-angles/calculations of launch windows (or plugins to provide/calculate this information), or requires trial and error setting up maneuver nodes, time warping (preferably in high orbit so you can use 100,000x), and repeating. For me, manually calculating launch windows is out of the question (requiring that would be liked requiring players to calculate CoT, CoL, or CoM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACit is just out of the question). So, either the stock game must give the players the tools necessary to calculate launch windows, or an algorithm must exist that makes it possible without iteration/trial and error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I think I found an easy algorithm that makes getting to any planet (almost) as easy as getting to the Mun or Minimus: first get into orbit, then, set up a maneuver node (if you are going closer to the Kerbol, then place on dayside; otherwise, place on night side) drag out your apoapsis until you just leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and execute maneuver. You are now orbiting Kerbol in a very similar orbit to that of Kerbin (with a slight eccentricity). This situation is analogous to being in orbit around Kerbin and trying to get to the Mun/Minimus, and the same algorithm can be used from here on i.e. place a maneuver node somewhere on your orbit, drag your apoapsis until it intersects the planet of interest, and then move the maneuver node around the orbit until you get an encounter. Thus, getting to any planet is just like getting to the Mun/Minimus, albeit with one extra step\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACfirst escaping Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware, however, that there is one disadvantage to this method\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthat is it less efficient than a transfer at optimum transfer window, since some deltaV is wasted in creating the eccentric orbit around Kerbol and additional losses from lack of fully using Oberth effect. However, the loss in efficiency/deltaV becomes less significant for planets farther from Kerbin since the amount of deltaV wasted creating the eccentricity is negligible compared to the transfer burn. In addition, the wasted deltaV also scales with offset from ideal launch window (thus, if phase angle is known to be approximately correct, this algorithm could be used anyway with minimum wated deltaV). Regardless, I think for new/lazy players, this algorithm is good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?
