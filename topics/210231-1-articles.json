Expect the game to cost @ $60USD when it does release. So if you buy during the early access period you typically don\u0027t have the pay the difference on full release. Or at least, I have never seen another company do something like that. You only buy the product once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the full release date we won\u0027t know for quite some time and I expect that the developers will keep that sort of timeline information very close to their chest. Roadmaps are fine but having concrete, or even suggested dates, gives an expectation that may not be met due to development difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-23T22:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be nice to have a discounted price for people who already have KSP1, to further incentivise purchases.

All we know is there will be phases of the early access and I would guess we will learn more about timing for the phases once early access is closer to release. I\u0027m guessing this time table will be adjustable depending on community input and how much we collectively find the game needing improvement through each stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, don\u0027t look for set time tables as they\u0027re effectively meaningless anyways (see: delays). As of now we finally have a release date to get our hands on the game and we will see it improve first in its most core functions and get to anticipate every new addition and see those improve as well. Kind of like buying a really bare bones game with the rapid releases of free DLCs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
