Right now, if I want to attach wings or side-mounted design elements to a starship I have to either use round docking ports side by side (and hope that they lock into place correctly the first time) or I have to eyeball the orientation when using only one port, to make things look good. The wedge-shape would help make sure that the docking port would not only line up along the x-axis but also the shorter y-axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T19:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds to me like you could benefit from the docking washers in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/infernal-robotics-v0-6a-parts-pack-1-magic-smoke-industries-ksp-v0-21-1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.
