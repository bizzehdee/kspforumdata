Just remember, no matter what some people say and some shows on the media portray, there are not that many girls who would just lead you on for no reason and reject you out of malice. There is nothing to gain from it but hatred, and aside from pathologically manipulative people who gain pleasure from feeling in control of other\u0027s emotion, normal people doesn\u0027t want that.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you could be going too fast, because well, even if she likes you, she would be taken aback if suddenly you ask her out when she didn\u0027t think you would. You could have misinterpreting the signals, since we all know how cloudy our judgement are when it comes to love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is better to just go on with your life normally. Let her know you like her, but don\u0027t push it and be a friend. Perhaps she will have more time to think about it, and might have something more definitive to say the next time. Just don\u0027t take it too hard either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*hugs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If you don\u0027t feel like trying anymore, then put some distance, distract yourself. Shoot some kerbals to space. The more you think about it, the more you are training your brain to memorize it, forming neurological pathways and reinforce that memory. So just go do something else and let it be overwritten by new memory. It gets easier with time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips.

She just needed a friend to hang out with after the break up, and she had fun with you. She did not think you as more than a friend, but she noticed you seem to like her after the first time, and that question was for confirmation so she know for sure if you are just hanging out as a friend, or if you are still pinning on her and probably find a way to let you down a bit easier so she can still keep a friend, but then you asked her out again, and well, things happened. Probably was very awkward for her too. So she say something about getting back to the other guy to ease the awkwardness a bit, like saying \u0022it is not like I turn you down personally, I just still have feeling with the other guy, don\u0027t take it too hard.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The worst case scenario was that you were just being used as a rebound, though she could have gone much further if that is the case. She could actually still be thinking of the other guy when she talk with you and her signal was not meant for you. One of the possible thought process she might have goes like this: \u0022Sometimes I feel kind of lonely being single..(cause I miss him, I hope we can get back soon. But oh gosh if I say that it would sound like I am desperate for attention on my break up like some kind of drama queen, and like, why am I even thinking about him now ? We broke up! I should be angry about this, he should apologize to me ins- oh wait my friend is saying something, better not leave him there) So yeah, I appreciate your companion.\u0022 Part in bracket is inner thoughts . (disclaimer: probably not everyone think the same was as I portray or say the same thing, but I hope that provide some perspective of what *might* have happened) See how easily misunderstood it is, especially when coupled with your heart struck state of mind?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you took those misunderstood signals and sending back signals that you still like her. She picked that up, and well, she realized she should do something to clear that and ask if you still like her as a confirmation, instead of being an idiot saying things in the case you didn\u0027t even like her. And things happened. Relationship sure is a pain huh? =/ Not easy for either side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be real nice if you can stay as friends, but in the case that you can\u0027t, then keep distance, but tell her why, or she might thought you are actually mad at her, and she being apologetic about things can be misinterpreted by you again and the vicious cycle continues. Keep lines of communication clear. It helps things like this a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
