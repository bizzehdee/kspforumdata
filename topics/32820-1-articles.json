You also need a long near vertical nuclear burn after you kill your air intakes and air-fed engines (it may seam like your going to loose your apariapsis but at the last minute you\u0027ll start gaining again, usually around 40km). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW most of my craft are kinda unflyable without the use of mechjeb as the ASAS sometimes does not provide enough torque alone - so when your climbing you will want to set mechjeb (I highly recommend it). I have played with using multiple avoinics packages/sas modules to help my ASAS maintain control, it seams to help a bit adding extras when you can\u0027t seam to get a larger craft under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always start by building a nice diamond shape of wings around my aircraft, add wings until the thing starts to seam somewhat neutrally buoyant by the end of the runway, then add a small amount of \u0022bite\u0022 to your wings by tweaking their attitude a bit (to slightly curve your wings use shift key \u002B W, A, S, or D key) if the thing flys down the runway like a floppy fish and spirals out of control, try adding some down force to the front of it by curving your frontmost wings/control surfaces down. Also how level your craft is when sitting on its landing gear effects this alot, if the nose points up on its landing gear then the thing will have more of a tendency to lift early which can be good or can spin you out of control on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to make your craft look like this as much as possible (include your wings into this shape)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;---X-O----------\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFront of your aircraft = \u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of mass = X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of lift = O\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdge of aircraft\u0027s rear most wing = \\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find going full nuclear beyond the scope of what your trying to accomplish here, I still recommend going at-least half nuclear and using something like aerospikes. Use the aerospikes only in pulses when you need the thrust, the rest of the time burn the nuclear engines for longer efficient burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines will make the difference between a half tank of fuel left in orbit, and almost no fuel left in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just checked the gravity of Duna, I think you would be able to take off from there as your TWR is going to be atleast .5 and Duna has less than half Kerbins gravity. (Not to mention your TWR will be alot higher because you just used enough fuel to get to Duna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing - the larger your craft is, the harder it will be to land it. Landing is really not my thing and its not something I make plans on doing, I\u0027d perfer to send an SSTO with a lander module as payload into orbit around my target planet, drop the lander payload, visit the planet, return the SSTO, fly back and stay in orbit docked in a station somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll land my smaller SSTO\u0027s that weigh like 10-30 tons but anything bigger than that has been tricky for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Another note, I\u0027ve been working with my new SSTO all night and I discovered that a TWR of .5 is where your nuclear engines will come close to overheating, my SSTO is at .54 TWR and it comes to about 85% overheat, just some good FYI\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-15T14:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2013 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Killenger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gamer217","CreatedById":65835,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T18:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so I have tried building it to little success.
