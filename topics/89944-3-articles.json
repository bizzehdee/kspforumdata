As mentioned, the Oberth effect favors burns at high speed. One way to think about it: if you escape Kerbin very quickly, Kerbin\u0027s gravity has less time to claw away and try to eliminate your escape velocity. If you just barely escape LKO into the same orbit as Kerbin, the amount of orbital velocity lost to Kerbin gravity is at a maximum. If you burn straight from LKO to, say, Jool, you will be escaping much quicker, so you will lose less velocity during Kerbin escape. Both ways of going to Jool will have the same velocity exiting Kerbin orbit, but the two-burn strategy loses some because you dawdled in Kerbin\u0027s SOI and lost more velocity to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why Oberth favors transfers direct from LKO* in delta-V terms: you lose some velocity escaping Kerbin, and the faster you escape Kerbin, the less velocity you lose to gravity.

The goof: I am pretty sure Oberth doesn\u0027t have much to do with the chemical energy of the rocket: conservation of energy is maintained because your fuel is losing kinetic energy equal to the energy your rocket is gaining. I have no idea where the chemical energy is going (probably heat, for the most part), but it is patently ridiculous to conclude that you are getting \u0022more out of your chemical energy\u0022, because as you increase velocity, you will swiftly reach the point where kinetic energy per kilogram of propellant burned exceeds that kilogram\u0027s chemical energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the little bit that energy should be conserved no matter what reference frame you\u0027re in.

It might burn more fuel overall in some cases*, but I am pretty sure it\u0027ll let you get away with smaller fuel tanks on your vehicle, because the amount of dV spent going from a circular high orbit to an elliptical high orbit should be less than the amount of velocity you can add to the slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*For example, if your target is \u0022just barely escape Kerbin\u0022, you\u0027re burning almost enough fuel to escape Kerbin, refuelling, burning a bit more to set up the slingshot, and then burning a substantial fraction of the fuel necessary to escape Kerbin: this is in addition to the fuel it took to set up the fuel depot in the first place. More overall fuel expenditure, though neither maneuver (getting to the fuel depot, or setting up the slingshot plus slingshot) uses as much fuel as a direct burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T14:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamuchi","CreatedById":110857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T14:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt really is the same thing and/or its really about both... when calculating velocity infinitely far from the planet, you always subtract \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe escape kinetic energy\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003Cp\u003EV_final = sqrt(V_total^2 - V_escape^2) = sqrt((V_escape\u002BdV)^2-V_escape^2) = sqrt(2*V_escape*dV \u002B dV^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV_final/dV = sqrt(1\u002B 2*V_escape/dV)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Enon-linear relationship between deltaV and energy\u003C/strong\u003E is what makes V_final larger than just deltaV i.e. V_final/dV \u0026gt; 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, either they are two ways of looking at the same thing, or, it really is about both...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that the equationfor *moar boosters*? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T14:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be interesting if the Kerbin Orbit path was highlighted different colours for the launch windows to different planets.
