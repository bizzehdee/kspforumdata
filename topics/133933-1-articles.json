Lots of people have been anxiously waiting for this mod. It\u0027s finally at a point where it\u0027s playable, and all the necessary features are working.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a manned rover, based off of the design in The Martian! Now you can re-create your own missions to Duna, or drive across the planet. It features several parts: Command Pod with lights and KIS storage, Battery with attached solar panels, \u0022flatbed\u0022 main frame with KIS storage, and \u0022trailer\u0022 optional frame. The included craft file is already put together for you, but if you do it yourself - the trailer attaches kind of funny to the back of the flatbed. It must be rotated right and I use the offset tool in the VAB to fine-tune it. The wheels will flip you if you brake hard, and I suggest setting the brake force to 100 on the front wheels, which I\u0027ve already done on the example craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Nrofj3O.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nrofj3O.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome things to note:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe crew capacity is only ONE right now, it will be bumped up to THREE at a later time, when I\u0027ve started working on the IVA.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is NO IVA yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are NO WHEELS yet.

No matter how you try, you can\u0027t get it flush with the Flatbed in front of it. I think this could be solved if you made the hitching post underneath flat instead of angled, because as it is now, you can\u0027t attach to it (unless you want to use the angling tools) without it coming out skewed. You can compensate by dropping down the wheels so everything at least has an even contact surface, but it still isn\u0027t flush on top. I was also disappointed that you hadn\u0027t magically discovered how to create a working ball and socket joint, but I suppose KSP is still KSP at the end of the day (Infernal Robotics maybe?).

You could add a \u0022:NEEDS[KIS]\u0022 to the relevant module, and I think that would work, but it might not be a bad idea to make a separate MM config that adds KIS to the parts, that way people without it can use the rover without having to perform config surgery. Not a 100% sure on this one, but I figure I\u0027d mention it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KIS: Inventory Size (volume) of 4000 in the cabin seems a bit generous (2000 also does as well, but that\u0027s a trailer).

Braking too sharply was bad, which you never are supposed to do anyway (she titled forward).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot to check my COM before hand, but here\u0027s a screenshot of it after the fact. It seems a bit high, but I\u0027m not entirely sure what it should look like.

You could also add it as an optional MM config if you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E wanted to distance yourself from it, heh. Options options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: the lights.
