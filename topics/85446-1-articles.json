You have a ship with a certain initial mass (which will change as you burn fuel), a rocket with a certain maximum thrust level (i.e. the amount of force it can provide for braking) and the gravitational force of the body you\u0027re landing on (which changes with altitude). The easiest case scenario would assume gravity and your ship\u0027s mass are constant; then it\u0027d just be a force-balance and kinematic equation problem using Newton\u0027s second law (F=ma) to determine the rate of deceleration (engine thrust minus gravitational pull). Because the mass of your ship and gravity are not constant, you also need to know the rate at which your craft is losing mass and the rate at which gravity is increasing.

In that case a suicide burn (burning at the last second at full thrust so that your velocity reaches zero exactly as your position reaches zero) is always the most efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, let\u0027s say you start out stationary 1 km up from a body that has a gravitational acceleration of 1 m/s^2. If you don\u0027t do anything, it would take you 44.7 seconds to hit the surface, and you would be moving at 44.7 m/s when you hit it. Let\u0027s say your spacecraft can accelerate at 4 m/s^2 at full throttle. Then while it is burning, its effective acceleration with respect to the ground is 3 m/s^2 upwards (since the acceleration due to gravity is 1 m/s^2). So starting at 250 m up, when its velocity is 38.7 m/s, it would burn full throttle for 12.9 seconds, ending up on the ground at 0 m/s speed. The total delta-v used by the engines is 12.9 s * 4 m/s^2 = 51.6 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s say we use the same spacecraft but instead of burning at full throttle we burn at half throttle, or 2 m/s^2. Then while it is burning, its effective acceleration with respect to the ground is 1 m/s^2 upwards. So it would have to start at 500 m up, at a velocity of 31.6 m/s, and burn at half throttle for 31.6 seconds, ending up on the ground at 0 m/s speed. The total delta-v used by the engines in this case is 31.6 s * 2 m/s^2 = 63.2 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the spacecraft has infinitely high TWR, then it can stop right when it hits the surface, with a delta-v of 44.7 m/s. If the spacecraft burns at 1/4 throttle or less, that means it has a TWR of less than 1 on this body and it will not be able to slow down. So the delta-v used has a minimum of 44.7 m/s (with infinitely high TWR), and goes up to infinity as you go down in throttle to 1 m/s^2 of acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquations used here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-6/Kinematic-Equations\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekinematic equations\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also think of a landing as being the same as an ascent going backwards in time.

If we\u0027re talking about the landing and ONLY the landing, then I suppose a suicide burn is best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when thought of as a whole, when considering the design of the craft, then it\u0027s not effective. When higher TWR is required, building up the ship just so that you\u0027re able to do a suicide burn is ineffective in respect to craft design when you can keep that lower TWR craft, and adjust your landing. I mentioned earlier the Tylo landing.... I can land a much smaller lighter ship by flying it the way it\u0027s shown in the video I linked earlier. To do a suicide burn down to Tylo, I need a larger craft with more TWR and staging just to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my craft, it\u0027s 2-stage, the descent stage is 2700 Delta-V with a TWR of 1.4.

In that case a suicide burn (burning at the last second at full thrust so that your velocity reaches zero exactly as your position reaches zero) is always the most efficient. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell yeah, but you\u0027re almost never operating in this regime. You\u0027re almost always coming down from orbit. Suicide burns are nearly the same efficiency as a constant altitude burn for high TWR vehicles, but for low TWR, constant altitude burns can\u0027t be beat. Again, reverse it; when you\u0027re ascending from the ground to orbit, you get the best efficiency by getting just high enough to miss the terrain, then burn sideways with just enough upward angle to keep your altitude from dropping. For descent from orbit, most of your burn is going to go toward decelerating, not to braking your descent. A suicide burn necessarily takes longer for deceleration than a constant altitude burn (because you\u0027re devoting the max engine vector to deceleration for the constant altitude burn), so it\u0027s less efficient because you fight gravity longer. That\u0027s what tavert\u0027s charts showed on the post linked earlier, and what kosmo-not\u0027s video shows. Again, the difference is negligible for high-TWR ships, but is quite significant for low-TWR landers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T20:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe kinematic equations can\u0027t be directly applied, though; as I said in my previous post, the ship\u0027s mass is not constant (which by Newton\u0027s Second Law has the implication that the braking acceleration \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill increase with respect to time\u003C/strong\u003E) and the gravitational acceleration is also not constant (by definition, g = GM/R^2, where GM is the body\u0027s gravitational parameter and R is the distance to the center of mass - including altitude; since R decreases as you descend and it\u0027s inversely proprtional to g, g \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill increase with respect to time\u003C/strong\u003E).

If you\u0027re landing on the Mun with an Isp of 350s, the changing gravitational field and the changing ship mass are negligible when calculating delta-v while falling from 1 km up. The ship losing mass over time doesn\u0027t actually matter at all, since that\u0027s equivalent to raising the thrust in a constant-mass ship.
