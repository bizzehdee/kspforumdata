Just enough to have a very slow drain from lights and wheels, with a couple static solar cells. Kind of silly, really. Light side, I don\u0027t need lights, so the solar cells are redundant, dark side I need lights and the solar cells are useless.

It\u0027s actually impossible to circumnavigate completely by water, it\u0027s required that one travels across land at one point or another, so the boat needs to be amphibious as well. Although it is much faster to circumnavigate mostly by water rather than mostly by land; quite hard to keep up 150\u002B m/s over rolling hills and mountains XD\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T00:58:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ekku Zakku\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
