The more, the better, in theory. The problem I\u0027ve been having however, is that once I add too many (KSPX, LLL, II, KWR, B9 plus a few more) I get constant crashes. I\u0027ve got 8GB of RAM and I\u0027m thinking about doubling it to 16 GB. I don;t know much about the base code for the game, but all those parts and plugins are loaded into RAM when the game starts up, right? Would adding more RAM solve the crashing issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T12:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, more RAM does not help at all, since afaik KSP is a 32bit application and thus cannot use more than 3-4GB anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T13:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about it. I have 16 gig of Ram and I\u0027m running an OC rig with a 2600k @ 5 ghz, and an SSD, and I still get crashes with KSP (I\u0027m also running 44 add-ons according to Mod Manager).

Granted I\u0027d love to have a 64-bit .exe but with a RAM limit of like double what we got now so you can run more mods and still not lock the system (or configured to be up to 80% of a x64 system\u0027s maximum RAM)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
