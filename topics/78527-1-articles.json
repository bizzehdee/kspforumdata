Perhaps they could be in a minimisable tab, so as not to confuse or overload new players. There would be maybe 10 or 15 of them, and you could accept any one at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese would be broken down into sub-contracts, so your first one would probably be \u0022put a Kerbal in Orbit\u0022. This would be broken down into \u0022Launch your first rocket\u0022, \u0022Break altitude record of 5000m\u0022, \u0022Go on suborbital flight\u0022, \u0022Achieve orbit\u0022. The same amount of funds are available to unlock whether you do the individual steps and add the rewards together, or just go straight for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more difficult ones could be \u0022build a space station\u0022, so the first mission could be \u0022fly by a target in orbit\u0022, the second one would be \u0022rendezvous with a target in orbit\u0022, so within a certain distance, and below a certain relative velocity. Then \u0022dock with a target in orbit\u0022, all the way to \u0022launch space station core with A, B and C parts attached\u0022, and \u0022add a module containing X, Y, and Z parts to your space station\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther suggestions for \u0022big contracts\u0022 would be landers for all major planets and moons ( unmanned Flyby \u0026gt;\u0026gt; unmanned orbiter \u0026gt;\u0026gt; manned orbiter \u0026gt;\u0026gt; unmanned lander \u0026gt;\u0026gt; manned lander), bases, and satellite networks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would give new players a measured, logical progression, and lots of rewards and gratification as they advance through the game, while allowing them to learn important skills such as docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would give more experienced players a chance to go straight for the more advanced contracts with low-tier parts, instead of feeling \u0022forced\u0022 to do missions they are bored with in Kerbin\u0027s SOI because that\u0027s the only way they can get funds and rep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the procedurally generated contracts system running in parallel, we still get to make (and get rewarded for) interesting and quirky creations to test massive SRBs in Minmus orbit, and landing legs on Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I doubt it\u0027s much work for Squad, as it\u0027s not too much of a massive departure from the current contracts system, just adding more predefined contracts, changing when they appear, and tweaking the UI a bit so it all makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease Squad, make this happen! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strikerklm96","CreatedById":102539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T23:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the progression based thing.
