I play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Constellation so my idea was to copy a star file from constellation and edit that. Originally it worked, and I can make new stars pretty easily. The problems I have is in making planets orbit the star. If I change a planet file so it has a new reference body it resets the game to stock. Anyone having this issue. Any help welcomed. End game goal is to make a black hole system in either stock or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E that will have a realistic looking black hole with a well textured accretion disk. If I take the code to generate a ring and add two rings at 90 degree angles of eachother we can make what looks likes relativity effects on a black hole. If we set the perpendicular ring to always face the player in the same way then the effect should be convincing. What more if we could get clouds from a visual pack onto the accretion disk it would really improve the way the black hole looks. This might be difficult to visualize but essentially the goal is to make something that looks like this: \u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image result for black hole\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ut_interstellarOpener_f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce we can get a good black hole I would like to move on to adding planets that orbit the black hole and also giving the planets moons. I want to make each planet interesting and worth visiting. Ideally I\u0027ll do this in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E but we could always release a stock version too.
