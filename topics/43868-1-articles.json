We have truly lived up to our motto \u0022We make pigs fly!\u0022 I, ArmchairGravy, president and CEO of Porcine Avionics hope the saga of our rise will entertain and enlighten.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe early days of Porcine Avionics revolved around orbital and sub-orbital manned, er, kerbaled missions. The ORL-I is a great example of the orbital landers PA was using at the time. The problem with kerbaled missions to the Mun soon became clear: how do we get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany attempts were made using orbital tankers in Kerbin and Mun orbits. While Kerbin-based docking attempts went smoothly, Munar attempts ended in disappointment and failure. Clearly a new strategy would be needed if our exploration and exploitation of space was to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter combing through various space ship and Mun base design archives I shamelessly ripped off what I found to be the best and created the Porcine Avionics line of mega-rovers and the booster packs needed to get them to Mun and Minmus. The design of the proper booster design to lift the huge payloads proved challenging, but we persevered and came up with a 19-engine asparagus booster package that gets the job done with delta-v to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy going with mega-rovers Porcine Avionics has simplified the refueling process by doing it on the ground. Our Mobile Kethane Processor guarantees plenty of fuel for our Retrieve-R lander and return rover. Add in the Tank-R mobile fuel dump and the Munar RV, and you have a complete Kethane mining base! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am proud of our initial line of products, and invite you to check out these fine vessels on our product page: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47545-Porcine-Avionics-releases-their-initial-product-line%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47545-Porcine-Avionics-releases-their-initial-product-line%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
