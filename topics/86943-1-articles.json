I put the time wrap on a high speed, expecting the game to slow down as we passed below certain altitudes, but it didn\u0027t and my ship smashed into the planet surface. I did a second test and found I could time wrap at the highest speed while only a 100,000 m above the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this something new I hadn\u0027t notice in the changelog or is it a bug that happened to my save while updating. I couldn\u0027t find anything in the settings or difficulty settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T10:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt happens if you engage the highest type of warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T10:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, if you come in fast under the highest warp you might fool the system, I managed to miss an Eve intercept entirely, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame check for position every frame, on highest warp it might pass hours in game between each check\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingPigs","CreatedById":122671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T11:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmmm Time Wrap.... *drools down shirt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s nothing new to me.
