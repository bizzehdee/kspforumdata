Sadly I never had a chance to visit magic boulder as it had disappeared awhile after i started playing ksp. So basically I\u0027m wondering how you think magic boulder could be re implemented if you even think it should be re added at all! Personally I think that magic boulder should become a asteroid the size of a class A that mysteriously has an absolutely ridiculous mass of about 10,000-40,000 tons that has a similar appearance to the old magic boulder and with strange green light emitting from it. The kerbin system would always generate in orbit of Ike (or maybe even Dres!) and it would be regenerated if the previous one is destroyed. Maybe the devs could add an Easter egg where a kerbal can go up to a crack on the boulder and enter it like a spacecraft, effectively adding magic boulder as a really bizarre capsule! Actually it would be pretty funny if you could fly it around like a spacecraft! Heck the magic boulder could be the key to interstellar travel!! But those are ideas from my ramble, what would you do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T10:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that this is something that will happen soon. They have loads of other work to finish before they add something like another easter egg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after that yeah, why not, another easter egg could not hurt. However it would\u0027nt be an easter egg anymore because we all already know of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, do not propose easter eggs. They have to do them by themself.

It is too tiny to not be an asteroid. Sure it might be fun to try to find it and eventually redirect it to Kerbin or land it on KSC but I think it\u0027s not a top priority feature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want your own magic boulder, just set a regular asteroid on such orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
