But then again, there is hardly anything to be said against a better indication of orbital directions, right? Little arrows on the orbit for bodies/crafts when you mouse over them and for those intended satelite orbits when hover over any over the parameter-nodes, for example.

Sorry about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with respect, I hear what you\u0027re saying but in a game like KSP, where experimentation and learning is emphatically part of the game, I still don\u0027t see this as a developer problem. If Squad just gave you a set of orbital parameters and expected you to get on with it, then I\u0027d somewhat agree with you but since they\u0027ve also gone to the trouble of providing a very obvious visual clue within the game, then I think it\u0027s reasonable for them to expect players to at least try and figure things out on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonal anecdote - satellite contracts were when I realised that I was waaay outside of my personal understanding about spaceflight. Thanks to KSP I think I\u0027ve got a reasonable qualitative understanding of basic orbital mechanics (even if I couldn\u0027t do any of the calculations to save myself) but when I took one contract to put a satellite in an inclined, eccentric orbit around the Mun, it was just an exercise in playing with the maneuver node handles until everything lined up, without any real feel for what I was doing. I got there though - and I think the current maneuver system does a fantastic job of presenting really complicated stuff in an intuitive way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T17:09:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T17:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find myself going the wrong way every once in a while even though I spend 30 seconds trying to figure out which way I\u0027m going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrows; yes, warning; no.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
