As I\u0027ve [been saying for](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114541-Career-mode-set-up?p=1817699\u0026viewfull=1#post1817699)[some time,](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1767-Science-is-pretty-shallow-Could-it-be-shaken-up-a-bit) career mode is still flawed.\n\u003E The problem is conceptual- they made career a series of impediments regulating what the player can do until they\u0027ve progressed by fulfilling some else\u0027s space plans.\n\u003E \n\u003E  They didn\u0027t make it about planning and managing the kerbals, exploration and utilisation of space. That happens, but it seems secondary.\n\u003E \n\u003E When it was just sandbox, imagination ruled. People went to the planets, because it was awesome to explore, built complex vessels because it was fun to embrace the challenge, built stations and bases because it was fun to be a pioneer in space. \n\u003E \n\u003E All they needed to do was stick the right meters on things, and provide a way of measuring what the space program was achieving, )So we\u0027d earn/lose money depending on how cost effective we were,) and add a few more activities to make the experience complete. \n\u003E \n\u003E Instead, we\u0027ve got a set of task lists to tick off- unlock the parts, build the buildings, visit all biomes.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Then fly around doing someone else\u0027s missions until you\u0027re bored of it. \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not that what career mode has is bad per say- fulfilling some contracts can be a fun, working with limited parts an engaging challenge. But it just doesn\u0027t come together to create a fulfilling whole. And even though we may see great improvements in future expansions,  that is a problem when this is this the \u0027complete\u0027 game.\n\nI like the career mode. It\u0027s the only mode I play. I play with a lot of mods to enhance the experience like station science, remote tech, and about 50 other popular mods. There is something satisfying getting a rocket to land on the Mun and back with only 30 parts. The small decisions like well I guess I can only have 3 landing legs, 1 battery, do I need more rations on board in case I get stuck and need to wait for a rescue team. It\u0027s all a lot of fun, a lot more fun than having unlimited everything and landing a 150 tonne lander on the Mun and getting home with half my fuel left over."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T02:16:14Z","Content":"Contracts still leave room for imagination in craft design... but they are channeled to achieve an end that someone else decided. Yet, if you want to try getting to a far away place and back with just 30 parts at the start of career, there may not be any contract for it, but you could try it. \n\nTw1 has some good points. I feel like I\u0027m participating in a space program, meeting goals that are suggested to me - but not really \u0022directing\u0022 a space program. Others have suggested an alternate method for contracts, where the player might construct a mission. Pick and choose from lists of goals and restrictions that are of interest to the various contract companies, which added together make the final payout.

I didn\u0027t even get into the difficulty of doing so as that\u0027s really not a valid topic--of course games today are harder to fix than those of yesterday...\n\nAll I said was that 1.0 needs to be optimized and I don\u0027t think the next update is going to be the one to do it. KSP isn\u0027t ready for 1.0. There\u0027s still too much to fix.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Greenfire says that verifying the amount should not be much harder than it would have been back when you had 17 pennies.\n\u003E \n\u003E 5th states the exact opposite.\n\n...no...\n\nWhat I was trying to get at with the whole cartridge vs digital (then vs now) comparison was that back in the day, games that were considered \u0022Official Release\u0022 HAD to be borderline perfect. Because if they weren\u0027t two things would happen:\n\n1: You had to live with any bugs after the game shipped.\n\n2: The Public would ridicule you for making a sub-par game.\n\nAll I was trying to say was that I don\u0027t think KSP is ready for \u00221.0 status,\u0022 because there\u0027s too much that has yet to be addressed. Bugs, optimizations, missing features that really ought to be in the stock game (like Kerbin not being inhabited ONLY by the space center...)\n\nAt no point did I say it should be \u0022easy.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Greenfire32 started off just hoping, as do I, that 1.0 will be much more stable, and that the average player will collide with fewer bugs than any previous release.

Whether or not development will continue after 1.0 is not the issue.\n\nThe issue is that \u00221.0 status\u0022 is a BIG deal. It essentially means the game is complete as per the specs set forth by the devs. It\u0027s (and I\u0027m going back to the cartridges here), basically the same as saying KSP is officially \u0022done\u0022 and will now be \u0022produced\u0022 and sent to market for the masses to buy.\n\nSo if 1.0 is as big a deal as Squad, myself, and many many other people think it is, then KSP isn\u0027t ready for it. There\u0027s still too much left to do.\n\nLet\u0027s use Minecraft as an example.\n\nWhen 1.0 hit, the game was done. It had all the features the devs wanted, little to no bugs (at the time of release), and there was even a big \u0022Day One Release Celebration\u0022 where the game was symbolically released as an official game you could buy. Sure, they\u0027ve added a ton more stuff after the official release, but at least they made sure that Minecraft 1.0 was a viable stand-alone game that didn\u0027t need an update to fix bugs or add features that should have been there from the start.\n\nIn a sense, DLC has made gaming a better place. But\u0027s it\u0027s also ***removed the urgency of getting it right the first time***, since all you need is an update down the road.\n\n--------\n\nAll that said, I love KSP and I\u0027m not bashing the Devs for wanted to finally \u0022finish\u0022 their game.

Otherwise, your method for when to declare a 1.0 official release is unrealistic. If Squad held back their 1.0 because there was a sliver of doubt the game might crash under some permutation or combination of parts... which only (theoretically) occurs when your speed crosses a certain threshold value, and your G-loading is *%some number%*, and solar panel #3 is going into shadow... I think you get the picture. There are so many variables that even with automation tools, I doubt every possible combination can be tested. Striving for perfection is just that: striving. Doing your best, picking up the pieces and moving on when a problem is discovered.\nI remember apps crashing all the time on Win9x, increasing stability in WinXP, and now I\u0027m on Win8.1 and it\u0027s been the most stable OS I\u0027ve used yet, task manager says I have 1000 hrs uptime, atm.

This for me caters to a bad image, as I have had some bad experiences with other products and their development teams or lack of.\n\nSo until I can read a list, which also addresses the above memory related issues and bugs fixes etc. I\u0027ll remain very skeptical."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T03:05:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I was trying to get at with the whole cartridge vs digital (then vs now) comparison was that back in the day, games that were considered \u0022Official Release\u0022 HAD to be borderline perfect. Because if they weren\u0027t two things would happen:\n\u003E 1: You had to live with any bugs after the game shipped.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2: The Public would ridicule you for making a sub-par game.\n\nI\u0027m fairly certain that companies DID ship with a plethora of glitches and, if a glitch was serious enough, they WOULD release a different cartridge as a \u0022bug fix\u0022 (or, sometimes, it would simply be fixed in the international version.)\n\n[http://s9.zetaboards.com/Nintendo_64_Forever/topic/7118517/1/](http://s9.zetaboards.com/Nintendo_64_Forever/topic/7118517/1/)\n\n\u0022Concerning the letters you sometimes see next to these numbers (A, B or C), it\u0027s the \u0022Revisions\u0022 (or re-release) of the games, with slightly differences from the original ones (most often some bugs are corrected between two reprints).\u0022\n\nWhy are we really going all the way to cartridges though? Even game consoles didn\u0027t have a serious way of distributing patches.\n\nOf course... \n\n[https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061217170813AAASUHA](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061217170813AAASUHA)\n\n\u0022PS2 frozen during saving?\u0022\n\n\u0022just start the ps2 up again then all will be fixed.............that kindiff stuff just happends sometimes\u0022\n\n**In other words, neither result is accurate.**\n\nLook, most of the major issues come from Unity Engine and C# and there isn\u0027t much they can do to fix that. Unity 5 is NOT a bandaid, it has the potential to break more than it fixes and cause more memory related bugs.\n\nAs far as eye candy goes (which has been mentioned far too often), these tend to be subjective and do have a cost of valuable computer resources. Are we fixing bugs... trying to reduce the memory footprint... or adding bugs by increasing it in favour of pointless eye candy?\n\nSo, in short, unless YOU are volunteering to do the work, saying how bad the game is doesn\u0027t accomplish anything. There is only so much that SQUAD is capable of doing; and at this point, they\u0027ve likely near exhausted what they believe can be done.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Squad does too.\n\u003E That\u0027s why we\u0027re no longer all tester. We sucked at it.\n\u003E \n\u003E For every good, useable piece of feedback, there were 100 more \u0022GAME CRASHED! FIX! YOU SUCK!\u0022 reports.\n\nWell... the majority of people don\u0027t really know what a bug is. They often reference symptoms, \u0022x happened... fix it!\u0022 but don\u0027t understand that x was caused by y which was caused by z. The game crashing, for instance, is not a bug. The \u0022crash\u0022 is a feature of the operating system designed to protect your computer from damage. What IS a bug is what caused the crash. In most cases the attempt to allocate memory past what the system can provide."}]}
