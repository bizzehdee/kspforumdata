Much of that \u0022more\u0022 comes from some really great Mods. For myself, the drive has been having something to do when I got there, other than drive around and look at the different scenery. Adds on\u0027s like ISAMapsat, Kethane mining, for example have really brought the game to the next level. I\u0027ve been watching a few of Scott Manley\u0027s videos and he\u0027s just loaded with add-ons, but I\u0027m finding that add-ons are mainly causing game play issues. I\u0027ve had issues that I\u0027ve posted here in the post and the solution has always been remove the add-in and play the stock game. The issues I have with add-ons is mainly structural stability (ships falling apart while sitting on the launch pad no matter how many struts I put on) and the very irritating random ship disappearing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read enough to understand that the engine is only 32bit so there\u0027s a danger in loading too many mods and I am keeping myself limited to only a few mods. I\u0027ve also seen Scot Manley making several comments on the physics engine being temperamental and maybe that\u0027s really the problem and not the mods. Be that as it may, I\u0027m jealous Scott seems to be able to run mods just fine where I on the other hand can\u0027t seem to catch a much of a break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a several mods are written by the dev\u0027s of KSP, so I guess that\u0027s why I\u0027m so confused about why the support requests from them are always \u0022remove the mod\u0022! Removing the mod does solve the problem, but I\u0027m pretty sure most people will agree, we WANT the mods. So can we expect to see some of these mods integrated into the game at some point so that they are no longer \u0022mods\u0022 and therefore no longer dirty evil red-headed step children?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darth Maul","CreatedById":68962,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T01:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel ya.
