When you stage or undock, the child ship no longer contains the control part and it\u0027s not picking the first controllable part to go with. Thus all MJ controls are \u0027locked out\u0027. If you pick a controllable part (like the AR202) and \u0027control from here\u0027 it will clear the exception and work normally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaius","CreatedById":66495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T23:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup. I had the same problem last night: decoupled two spacecraft in space, and MechJeb was unable to control the separated craft until I did the \u0022Control from here\u0022 thing -- the Navball was properly reflecting the orientation of the ship, but all of the Smart A.S.S. commands were doing things relative to the other ship and freaking out, doing a kind of confused wobble in place as it tried to turn, but the other ship wasn\u0027t moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, in fixing this, you could also make it turn Smart A.S.S. to the \u0022Off\u0022 setting when switching control to the newly undocked ship, that\u0027d be cool. Note: NOT DISABLING the module, NOT closing the window, JUST setting Smart A.S.S. to the \u0022OFF\u0022 setting instead of \u0022\u002B TGT\u0022 or \u0022- PAR\u0022 or whatever. Alternately, upon restoring the undocked craft to its previous Smart A.S.S. settings, make sure it also restores the \u0022control from here\u0022 part and the targeted docking port. Right now if you dock with \u002BTGT or -PAR or whatever on, when you undock, that setting is restored, but the \u0022control from here\u0022 part and/or targeted docking port are not, and the ship often whips around at high speed and smashes your spacestation as it tries to instantly reorient to whatever random target it has or relative to whatever control part its using instead of using control part and the docking port it was using when it docked. This often happens faster than you can switch to the undocked vessel (whenever I undock, I end up in control of the space station rather than the undocking craft, and have to manually switch over to it and \u003Cem\u003Etry\u003C/em\u003E to hit \u0022OFF\u0022 on the Smart A.S.S. before it smacks something -- at this point, \u0022confused undock wobble\u0022 is a blessing when it happens).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T23:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.
