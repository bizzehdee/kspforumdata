Furiosa VI takes off into orbit carrying another Spaceplane, the Valkyria III (with 400 units of Liquid Fuel on board, and a detachable nose cone). In LKO, Valkyria III is detached to rendezvous with my spacestation to fuel up and plant a flag on Minmus to pay the bills while Furiosa VI lands back at KSC. When Jeb is done with his mission, Valkyria III also lands back at KSC. However, the side effect is that the detachable nose cone is left behind in orbit, making this SSTO Mothership/Parasite Spaceplane combo only 99.5% efficient.

Welcome to the K-Prize party guest list aka the roll of honour.\n\nEdax, the reason Furiosa VI was a gatecrasher was that \u0022Valkyria III\u0027s engine is engaged\u0022during the ascent, since Valkyria III is payload it breaks proviso A to rule 1 and is therefore an official gatecrasher! I hope you enjoy the notoriety. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nTynrael, thanks for your video. Much as I admire the innovative launch and landing procedures used with Barebones Mk I space drone, it is hard to ignore the fact that it broke the K-Prize rules because lift off was not horizontal since it began with 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 descent ! So I hope you will settle for a gatecrashers link which I am sure the interesting mission report deserves... p.s. if you altered the launch angle so it flew horizontally at the launch it would count, fyi.\n\nSuicidalInsanity, what a magnificent craft, unfortunately your doubts about FAR are applicable to the K-Prize because rule#3 was invented in the interests of fairness for the competitive aspect of the challenge and so that like can be compared with like otherwise. So sorry but I hope you dont mind too much that the link to your mission report has been added to the gatecrasher listing, with a miniscule quip and a subtle hint thrown in at no extra charge.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T17:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"parzr","CreatedById":115059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T01:29:46Z","Content":"Here is my Gigantor. 90.9 tons of payload to orbit and 100% reusable.\n\nShe took a number of attempts both getting it to orbit and more trying, getting home.
