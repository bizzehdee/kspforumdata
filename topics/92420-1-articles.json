So I went back to the VAB to adjust the position of my onion stages and found that suddenly my rocket was too expensive to launch, which was strange because I reverted the flight and didn\u0027t add any parts. I figured out that even though I was using 4x symmetry, the game had placed 7 copies of the boosters, with four of them occupying the same space. The parts from the three additional boosters appear opaque as if they were attached to the rocket even when they\u0027re clearly not, and it\u0027s also impossible to delete them. If I try, they just get placed behind the parts menu (and still opaque). The only mod parts I\u0027m using on this rocket are MechJeb and Procedural Fairings, but I don\u0027t think those are causing the issue. Also, trying to launch the rocket or exit the VAB just causes the game to freeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way I can edit the craft file to salvage the rocket, or at least everything above the KR-2L stage (I tried editing it myself, but that just messed it up more)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/dodIN.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/dodIN.craft\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;-- saved copy from before I tried mucking around in it myself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8M50wqO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228M50wqO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T01:32:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KevinW42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T00:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a corrupted craft file - try building another one, and see if it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinW42","CreatedById":66949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like a corrupted craft file - try building another one, and see if it happens.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a quick test rocket and tried another saved rocket and they worked just fine.
