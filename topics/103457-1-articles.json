Even if the two crafts hit each other dead on, the physics engine won\u0027t have enough time to notice and they\u0027ll just pass through each other (just like time warping straight through a planet).\n\nYour best bet is probably to work with **really** long vessels and right positioning (to maximize the volume they will share when passing through each other) and to set your delta physics time to something huge. But small satellites or asteroids are most likely not going to cut it"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T17:03:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good luck with that, I don\u0027t think the game is even capable of recording an impact at those velocities.

After reaching Mun orbit it turned out I could still go for Kerbin retrograde orbit. I just used Mun to turn around.

In LKO you are moving at over 2500m/s to turn around and head the other way you are going to need \u003E5000m/s. Out by the mun you are going at only a few hundred m/s and using the mun\u0027s gravity you can slingshot for even less.\n\nWikipedia says that a few Israeli satelites are launched retrograde, possible mostly because they only have a west facing coastline and they don\u0027t want to launch over their neigbours.
