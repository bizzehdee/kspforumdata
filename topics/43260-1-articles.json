Much like on the Apollo missions, you really only need a dedicated escape system for a relatively short period near launch. And in my experience, even then mostly only on relatively untried designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo had five main abort modes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMode 1: Launch Escape Tower. Used from the pad until about 30 seconds after second stage ignition (somewhere above 30km), at which point the LET is jettisoned. 3 Altitude Variations mostly having to do with getting the CM in the correct attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMode 2: Service Module Escape. Used from when the LET is jettisoned until they get high enough for Mode 3. Uses the Service Module\u0027s engine to clear the rocket, then proceeds to splashdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMode 3: Contingency Orbit Insertion. Once high enough, the S-II is simply jettisoned early, the S-IVB and Service Module are used to place the Command Module in orbit, with no possibility of a Lunar Mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E S-IVB to Orbit: Mode 3 variation where only the S-IVB is needed to get the CSM to Orbit. Still no possibility of going to the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMode 4: CSM To Orbit: If the S-IVB fails, the CSM is used to place the Command Module in orbit, again with no possibility of going to the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used variations on all of them at some point or another, although I consider Mode 3 and Mode 4 to be basically the same thing: Drop the damaged/malfunctioning stages and keep going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally find that an actual LET is only really neccessary during the relatively early phases of the launch, but even then mostly only if you have SRBs. A failure with the SRBs still firing is much more dangerous than any other type, because they have a disturbing habit of surviving the stack breakup and going flying all over the place (many of them into the stack, there\u0027s a marked tendency for them to curve inwards if they get loose.) They\u0027re REALLY fast when separated from the stack, so an EXTREMELY powerful LET is needed to have any chance of outrunning them (and even then it may not quite, but it still helps avoid them.) I made one design that used 16 sepatrons for a three man pod, and it STILL couldn\u0027t quite outrun the large SRBs (the small ones have a MUCH higher TWR and are EVEN FASTER!) Just make sure to set up a jettison action group for it. Helpful tip: Jettison the LET only after starting your gravity turn. I\u0027ve yet to have one fired straight up come down on a rocket, but it\u0027s ALWAYS close, so it\u0027s just a matter of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the absence of SRBs, a failure is likely to only result in damage to part of the rocket, which makes simply jettisoning the damaged bits and using whatever\u0027s left to get to safety quite viable. The main thing you have to watch here is TWR: If the lower stages are still firing, and your upper stage\u0027s TWR is less than the lower stage is providing, the upper stage will be held in place by the greater acceleration from the lower stage. This means you need to cut throttle before jettisoning it, or if that\u0027s not possible...well, you\u0027re stuck for a bit, so watch that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u0027s \u0027PANIC!\u0027 button on the translatron module (which I\u0027ve yet to find another use for) is exceedingly excellent for pulling a Mode 2 style abort. When you hit it, it cuts throttle and nigh instantaneously stages to the last stage with an engine. FAR faster than it can be done by hand. (It somehow sequentially fires them all in a fraction of a second, without the normal wait time between stagings.) It then activates an Autopilot which aims straight upward at full throttle for some seconds, and then activates the landing autopilot in \u0027Land Wherever\u0027 mode. This entire sequence takes only a few seconds, and I cannot recall an instance where it failed to save the pod when it was actually able to function. Loose SRBs taking out the upper stage are pretty much the only reason it\u0027s ever failed, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T20:44:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built one for my crew taxi and it\u0027s actually my first ship to have one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P9Uof3A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P9Uof3A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike most people I don\u0027t usually bother and just hit revert flight whenever something goes wrong, but this one is meant to be showcased in mission reports that involve crew trasfers, so I wanted it to look somewhat realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of hope that career mode limits the revert flight option in some way so that abort procedures would actually become a necessity or...at least, something you\u0027ll want to be thinking about when designing your rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of yet, however, I\u0027ve never even tried to build an abort system.

The few remaining groups are also taken up with other functions so the brakes action group toggles the cargo bay doors and abort toggles a bunch of Q-struts which secure the cargo. There was a heated meeting at kerbal HQ about this and in the end it was decided that having a switch to easily toggle all Qstruts rather than manually clicking on each one was more important than crew safety.
