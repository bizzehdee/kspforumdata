The contract says it must be a new unmanned probe built for the mission. I built a probe and sent it into orbit, achieved orbit with minimal deviation but the mission didn\u0027t recognize it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve then built a probe with 4 satellites in the fairing and deployed them in the orbit but still the orbit doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes someone have any advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnrico\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermanzooming","CreatedById":162393,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-27T11:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe contract window provides details about which\u00A0parts of the contract have been fulfilled; can you post a screenshot of that window contract when flying the sat that should complete it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-27T11:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest advice could be given knowing more about that contract and the actual orbit of your probes. Your savegame (by default, the file in /saves/\u0026lt;yourgamename\u0026gt;/persistent.sfs) has all the info needed to check this issue, would be great if you could upload and link it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the most common errors with achieving specific orbits is their inclination. Some required orbits are retrograde (inclination ~ 180\u00B0), often the direction of flight on the orbit isn\u0027t noted and players fail the contract though it appears in map mode the achieved orbit perfectly overlaps the required one (but, going in the opposite direction!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enrico shark","CreatedById":168777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-27T12:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere there is the persistent.sfs\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/61kcal18a92q113/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/61kcal18a92q113/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel is the one named Sat-Network I.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027ll work on the screenshot.
