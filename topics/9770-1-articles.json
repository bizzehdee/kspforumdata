Some sims do have missions or, by nature of being combat sims, are thrilling to play, but most of the real flight simulators such as the Microsoft FS series and the X-plane series are really only entertaining if you enjoy going to terrestrial destinations such as mountains, desert isles, big airports, tall buildings, or anywhere on earth that you can imagine in an aircraft of your choice. You can fly fast or slow, high or low, correctly or incorrectly. You can land (and try to takeoff again) on buildings and ships, bridges and highways, lakes rivers and oceans, deserts and mountain peaks, and with good simulators you can challenge yourself to learn to fly properly, thus gaining experience that could save your life someday (or you can just fool around all the time and fly low, takeoff without clearance, fly between building, and terrorize imaginary people).

Full realism flight from Heathrow to Kai Tak, well, thats gonna take a while. Yes, you can accelerate time, but if an engine fails and time is accelerated too far, you might lose it. maybe the elevators will hard-over and your swandive before you get time under control. Of course its flown by autopilot, your mostly just there in case, unless you really want to fly that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollect some scenery packages and mods and things can look VERY impressive in these sims. it can be quite worth seeing the sights just to see the sights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.youtube.com/watch?v=OcnqAt5E2yw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.youtube.com/watch?v=MKNw4Ii-uVM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.youtube.com/watch?v=IGTc8oGxUbg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.youtube.com/watch?v=OVNzSOVSl-k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZUq5Ti47Ys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think FSX has better terrain, but X-plane has much better environments, such as road traffic, which you don\\\u0027t get in FSX. Simple touch, huge impact on the atmoshere. A collaboration mixing their strengths would be ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that about sums it up. Simmers play them for the simulation more than anything. If all you want is flight, then go for FSX or X-plane. They aren\\\u0027t just airliners. Cessna\\\u0027s, heli\\\u0027s, and more. If you want combat, take your pick, Modern or WW2. If modern, are you a mudslinger(A-10), or a fighter(LOMAC), or both(Falcon 4.0)? They can get pretty intense, and even the hardcore sims have a quick and dirty start that leaves you seconds from the action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, none of the above are all that forgiving of a newcomer. Flight is difficult, and they will punish you for your mistakes, lol. IL-2 will let you go close to arcadish flight on easy settings, but you lack power to really fix big mistakes. LOMAC, A-10, and Falcon put you in aircraft that generally have a thrust to weight better than 1-1, so you can fix most flight screwups just by applying yet more power. Unfortunately they also involve missiles which are rather faster than you. lose too much speed and you can\\\u0027t evade effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis became ALOT bigger than i first intended, but I can\\\u0027t imagine you won\\\u0027t understand the genre after it, whether or not you see anything of interest is another matter entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T16:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m waiting for this one to come out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.indiedb.com/games/vector-thrust\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.indiedb.com/games/vector-thrust\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-22T16:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey simulate hypoxia now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDCS does.
