I\u2019m playing on PS4 and I\u2019m trying to dock two ships in orbit above Kerbal for the first time. All the guides say to target the other ship to close the distance, but it won\u2019t let me target it. I can target other things like regions for missions, but not the ship. Is there an upgrade that I need to do to allow me to target ships. Is there a component that I might have forgotten to add to me ship? \u00A0I really don\u2019t know what I, doing wrong. I have the ships in a similar orbit,\u00A0but I\u2019m not sure how to guide that last little bit of the way in without being able to select the other ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-11T08:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat level is your Tracking Station, and what level is your Mission Control? \u0022Not being able to target\u0022 usually means you only have a level 1 Tracking Station. \u0022Targeting\u0022 is an ability that your Tracking Station gains as you level it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T08:02:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
