I decided to manually launch. I went sub-orbital, and went to Maneuver Planner. Opened it up. Found out all these windows are just like regular windows, and not like the ones depicted in Scott Manley\u0027s MechJeb tutorial. Tried to circularize the orbit, but it simply said that it is coasting to node. Completely passed it, and went into the re-entry stuff.\n\nP.S. Using \u0022MechJeb2-2.4.2.0.zip\u0022. Version of KSP is 2.4.2"}]}
