I\u0027ve been having a frustrating issue with the MPL that nobody else on the internet seems to have, so I suspect there is something I\u0027m overlooking here.

I hit the button, it does a transfer for a while, then it gets to 100%, says \u0027Not enough data storage...!\u0027 and then the MPL has 1/500 data, and I can still keep the 1.6 science points the materials bay provides as well, separately.

According to what you\u0027re saying the MPL is working as it should, that is the data is recorded while you also get to keep the experiment. Some people think the experiment is supposed to be consumed when you use the MPL but you\u0027re really just sharing the data."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T05:24:13Z","Content":"Yes, I get that too. When 1.0 hit, I believe I only got that if the lab was actually full, and it meant that I couldn\u0027t process that experiment at the moment.\n\nHowever, in 1.0.4, I get that message for every upload. As SoWeMeetAgain points out, the error message is just a cosmetic bug, since the data does end up in the lab as expected."},{"CreatedByName":"Mekada","CreatedById":147460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:50:52Z","Content":"Ah, thanks for the answers everyone! It was certainly making me question if I was doing things right. I\u0027ve got many hours in on the game, but only recently needed to mess with the MPL. I\u0027d been playing science careers with 800% science gain for the longest time, which was great for learning things. I just started about a week ago playing the real career mode with just 100% science gain. Not nearly as hard to advance now as when I first got the game!"}]}
