According to what you\u0027re saying the MPL is working as it should, that is the data is recorded while you also get to keep the experiment. Some people think the experiment is supposed to be consumed when you use the MPL but you\u0027re really just sharing the data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T05:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I get that too.

It was certainly making me question if I was doing things right. I\u0027ve got many hours in on the game, but only recently needed to mess with the MPL. I\u0027d been playing science careers with 800% science gain for the longest time, which was great for learning things. I just started about a week ago playing the real career mode with just 100% science gain. Not nearly as hard to advance now as when I first got the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
