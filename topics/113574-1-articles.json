And post #2 in this thread had an idea. What if we could change the splash picture? Like, that picture that shows up while the game loads all the assets? Or even cycle through pictures? Like, say, just cycle through a bunch of screenshots from one of the wallpaper threads dotted around the forums. Or maybe take the most recent item in the Screenshots directory. Or something. Is this a thing? Make this a thing, Oh great modders with your mighty .dlls and .cfg files! I beseech thee!"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T10:03:44Z","Content":"AFAIK there\u0027s no way to change it. The best you might be able to do it is pop up a full-screen window over it."}]}
