Build your subassembly as normal, but before saving it set your root part to be the part you attach by. Saves lots of headache later. It may be messing up your part placement because you have boosters attached, and because of the tree nature of the editor if you set the root part as a booster (accidentally I assume) it has the potential to screw up the design."},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T06:09:42Z","Content":"Everyone explained what it is, but not how to use is, so here goes:\n\n1) Select root tool (click icon or use hotkey 4)\n\n2) Click on a part **right next** to your new root (some parts seem to bug out sometimes and can\u0027t be selected... try saving and reloading the craft)\n\n3) Click on your new root\n\n4) ????\n\n5) PROFIT"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T07:26:46Z","Content":"Now I ain\u0027t a big hydro ponicky farmer like the fancy ones in the city, but a root is dat bottom doohicky for a plant.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T13:15:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Everyone explained what it is, but not how to use is, so here goes:\n\u003E 1) Select root tool (click icon or use hotkey 4)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Click on a part **right next** to your new root (some parts seem to bug out sometimes and can\u0027t be selected... try saving and reloading the craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Click on your new root\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) ????\n\u003E \n\u003E 5) PROFIT\n\nStep 2 is not entirely true.
