Firstly, if it\u0027s the first part, it can be placed and selected, but doesn\u0027t really work, but once a root part is placed, you can not select it, copy it, or do anything with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, Lack is on vacation for a short while, and even then is fairly busy with other things. Thus this mod is in part maintained by the fans of this mod. Lack will eventually get around to working on many of these parts, but there is no time frame to give you when this will be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinally, I do agree that there is certainly a large lack of videos incorporating these parts. As far as your issue using these parts, what are you try to do with the cargo holds, that is causing problems, and which parts in particular are you struggling with. Screen shots would also be nice. Also keep in mind that if you aren\u0027t using tweekscale, you will not get the larger parts, so going through and deleting the tweekscale MM files, especially the size disabler might give you larger parts to build with. The tug, as far as I\u0027m aware of, is a stand alone part that has built in RCS and a universal docking port. Just attach it to any docking port and away it goes. (not sure if it isn\u0027t broken, as I have never actually used one, But I do love the looks and concept of them. I might need to make more use of them.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lack","CreatedById":47978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T16:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd back now (though a little jet lagged, slept 16 hours last night.
