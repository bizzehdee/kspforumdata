I had previously completed a Laythe water circumnavigation, this is my second Kerbin one- I cut across a continent on my first attempt. This attempt was water only, except for the land bridge. This is a completely stock game, as always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Amphib3c-K\u0027 is nearly identical to the vessel I used on Laythe, with a few small changes. Basically took some stuff off that I didn\u0027t need. I did lower the drill, but evidently not enough, because I still had to retract the landing gear to get to the ore. Yes, it still has wings and a rudder. No, it is in no way suitable for flight of any sort, or even tiny jumps off hills. I did briefly get THREE of the wheels off the ground at the same time without exploding, but that\u0027s as far as I pushed it. See the photos at the end of my Laythe entry for demonstration of how this thing handles air under the wheels..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEstimated a max range on this one at 750km. I did have one leg of 725km (between waypoints 4\u0026amp;5), and had a little fuel in the tanks at the end of it. It goes about 70m/s out of the chocks, sometimes reaching 76m/s. Most importantly, I was able to use 4X warp while sailing, once I burned off a little fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much as I miss my rover wheels, this thing actually held up fairly well on the land bridge. Kept the speed under 30m/s on land, and went much much slower crossing hills, worked out pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add some notes to the Imgur album tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/l6gro\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But I have a few concerns over my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the craft. It\u0027s very heavily based on the Rocketpilot753\u0027s rover design. My concern is that it may be too closely related and could be considered to be copying them. There\u0027s lots of differences but the main mechanisms for locomation are the same. If it\u0027s too close I\u0027ll go back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I use a good number of Ion thrusters. It could be argued that I could effectively fly over the surface with this many thrusters thus breaking the spirit of the challenge. Which is something I\u0027d like to avoid. Personally, after a few tests I havn\u0027t been able to produce lots of airtime using the thrusters, and it doesnt fly. But off of the right slope, I can see where it it would catch decent airtime nonetheless. If it\u0027s too much I could reduce the number of thrusters or remove them completely to have a craft more in line with the intended idea of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see images of my rover here. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/xHOba\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/xHOba\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for weighing in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-26T03:56:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2015 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gahooligan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixing typos/ had a part about hyperedit -- since redacted\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T23:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only-tweakscale-used Baja racer is ready for Tylo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q25SeRf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q25SeRf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T00:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I\u0027m trying kill time until 1.0.5 comes out anyway, and I have a rover on Eve already... one of my best designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now she\u0027s exploring remotely, but she has 3 seats.

The Agamemnon is rugged and reliable, but with a flat-terrain top safe speed of 15 m/s I\u0027m afraid I may run out of snacks. I spent the first 50 kilometers burning off the left-over landing fuel by leaving one of the four engines running on its lowest setting. That got the rover\u0027s GVW to just under 20 tonnes. No noticeable performance improvement. Next time I\u0027m making a dune buggy.
