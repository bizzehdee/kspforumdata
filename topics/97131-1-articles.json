I recently decided I would do some nuclear chemistry stuff. I\u0027m going to try to reproduce one of the first nuclear chemistry experiments, the bombardment of N\u003Csub\u003E14\u003C/sub\u003E with alpha particles to [hopefully] form O\u003Csub\u003E17\u003C/sub\u003E and some protons. It\u0027s going to take a bit of time to get the N\u003Csub\u003E14\u003C/sub\u003E or the apparatus set up, so... anything interesting nuclear-chemistry-ish you guys think I should do? I\u0027ve got an Am\u003Csub\u003E241\u003C/sub\u003E button source (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1 emitter, 1 uCi, ~3.7 uSv/h), Geiger counter, and some other assorted things of that nature. So, any interesting simple-ish nuclear chemistry-related things you\u0027ve heard of? Just curious what\u0027s possible. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-19T04:08:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2015 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YourEverydayWaffle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T03:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you plan to detect the O17? At uni, I would have done mass-spec or NMR, but these aren\u0027t exactly at-home options.

I\u0027ve been meaning to make a dry ice cloud chamber, and could incorporate that with this by using a certain amount of shielding to capture or stop the alpha particles, and hopefully let protons through when n14 is applied (and check for paths there from protons) or use something like CaFl as a target to emit gamma rays upon absorbing a proton. I\u0027m pretty sure my Geiger counter picks up gamma rays, so this may be a more suitable method. It\u0027s still in the R\u0026amp;D stages, if you will, so I\u0027m still deciding on some of the finer details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
