When you make a rover, do you create it in the SPH first, and move the rover\u0027s save file to the VAB? When I do this, I get the style of symmetry that I like, but get odd problems in the VAB. Once I clikc my rover in the VAB, it will then rotate so that the command pod is facing up rather than horizontal...and I understand that. But say I launch my contraption and crash, it no longer lets me return to the VAB from the end mission dialogue, only return to SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m just trying to figure out if it\u0027s easier to build in the SPH and move to the VAB, or fuss with the symmetry of the VAB for a rover. The problem I have in the VAB is that placing wheels specifically is a PITA, and I end up having to place one at a time......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T01:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Editor Tools mod allowed you to change symmetry modes on the fly, but 0.20 broke it and it\u0027s apparently not being updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Subassembly Loader mod can help move craft between the SPH and VAB but I\u0027m not sure if it works in 0.20 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wish the devs would add symmetry mode toggling to the game.
