Ok Alterate, you need to got to your KSP directory and open Gamedata up. Open the folder called \u0027Squad\u0027 and then all the sounds in the game are in the folder called \u0027Sounds\u0027. Hope it helped! (You will need to chance part\u0027s configs to make them play the new sound, though. Or else they make no sound.) Hope it helped you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
