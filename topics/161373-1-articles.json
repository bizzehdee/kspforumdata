I\u0027ve been to the Mun, Minmus, and Gilly which were all really fun, but I was kinda thinking it would be fun if there was a mod that simulated things going wrong, like an electrical malfunction or a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E nozzle refusing to fire. If there is a mod like this what is it? If not, then I think this would be a cool idea for modders (I have no idea how to mod lol).
