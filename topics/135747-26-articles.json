The problem for that is that the payloads should be in the pipeline now if they want to be available for SLS in the 2022 or 2024. But they aren\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience institutions simply don\u0027t have the budget to build \u0026gt;70t payloads. Even if they did, they can\u0027t really commit to that size because SLS is the only rocket that can launch them, and SLS\u0027s future is too uncertain. They risk building a several-billion dollar mission and losing their ride. It\u0027s much safer to them to stick to put their eggs into the 10-20t payload size where they can easily switch to another rocket if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of missions is what makes SLS unsustainable. NASA can\u0027t afford to maintain a launch site and logistics infrastructure for a launcher that only flies every 2 years, which is the intended flight rate. With no payloads or missions actually planned or funded at this stage, they will have to struggle to achieve a rate of 1 flight every 4 or 5 years. My guess is that somebody will finally realize this and put Congress in front their responsabilities, and SLS will be cancelled after 2 flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022reese1221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022reese1221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIts a MPCV it can do anything\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything within its specifications, which are: maintain 4 crew members alive for 21-days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is, what can you do in space in 21-days without any additional mission hardware?
