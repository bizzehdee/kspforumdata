Specialiced processing isn\u0027t really that new (one could argue that our pc\u0027s do the same thing with ie. graphics cards), neither is higher density = good or that lower latency is good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they\u0027ll be able to take these things to the next level that would be awesome offcourse, but... let\u0027s see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, how does \u0022optronics\u0022 significantly cut latency? Over large distances sure, but unless you use optical directly into the processor or memory, you will have some sort of conversion delays?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ok, so we have a 6x amount in capacity using 1/80th the amount of power.
