It is amazing how many small minute details have to be tested out while designing a purpose specific space plane like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to create a single stage craft that could reach everywhere in the system, and yet carry an ore extractor and processor to re-fuel. My first attempt was a gigantic clumsy rocket with several dozen giant tanks hooked to Rhinos... I then started working on this more elegant solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft has 10 R.A.P.I.E.R.s which do a good job of getting it up to 25,000m and 1,300 m/s.They can then be switched to close cycle to establish orbit. The craft also has 2 LV-Ns which enable fuel sipping efficiency while burning to other moons/planets. Finally, I included 8 bottom pointing Thuds which give a \u0026gt;2 TWR on all non-atmo bodies except Tylo (trying to think how I might be able to almost fully land with the R.A.P.I.E.Rs, and then tip over with the Thuds at the last second.... not sure if possible). I use the LV-Ns to shed most of my m/s while landing, and then switch over to the Thuds for the final descent. Mechjeb differential throttle is incredible helpful for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the defining feature of this ship is the cargo hold, which contains the ore processor and extractor. Additionally the 8 Thuds are mounted here, along with a Sr docking port. The idea with the docking port, is that you could either refuel, or even use it as an attachment point for an external booster. The docking port and Thuds are centered on the CoG, although this does tend to shift somewhat during some operations. The CoG, however should stay within the span of the port and Thuds. Fuel can be shifted if needed to tweak. Inside the hold as well, is a top facing Jr port, which is only used to \u0022Control from Here\u0022 while descending with the Thuds. Zoom into the cargo hold to find and select the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also included a monopropellant tank and a robust RCS system, which is a nice help for turning this long ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important feature of this ship, is its ability to reenter the atmosphere enabling a zero power landing. All parts were selected and arranged to mitigate heat damage. Air brakes are used to aid in the deceleration, and radiator panels assist in protecting vulnerable parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is enough fuel in the ship to take off from Kerbin, transfer to Minmus, and land. From there it can be refueled, and then pointed to its next destination.I think it might be possible to go straight to Laythe, assuming you could directly enter Laythe\u0027s atmosphere... you probably wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to do anything other than land though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary of custom controls:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: One pair of RAPIERs on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Three pairs of RAPIERs on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: All 5 pairs of RAPIERs on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: RAPIERs off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Toggle LV-Ns on/off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Toggle Thuds on/off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Switch RAPIER mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: Toggle drill extend/retract\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0: Toggle carbo bay doors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrakes are hooked to the Airbraks as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake care, and enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y15Lmr0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y15Lmr0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B8OFpac.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B8OFpac.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WfdkSBn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WfdkSBn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cQTvifr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cQTvifr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bo2iy1hfbkp7jsa/Perpetual%20Motion.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-16T22:30:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2015 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glome\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T23:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E long spaceplane \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it difficult to pull off a horizontal landing or takeoff?

It takes off at about 120 m/s on Kerbin. I included a medium tail wheel in the rear, which keeps the back from hitting the ground. Additionally, sitting flat on the ground, I made it so that it angled slightly up. This helps on both takeoff and landing. I have landed it many times, and so far it hasn\u0027t given me too much trouble, and handles fairly well in the descent. Landings of course are pretty shallow. You can perform a flare, touching down on the back and middle wheels and letting the speed bleed off before the nose drops. I usually find though that I can just fly onto the runway at about 60-70 m/s and that has worked fairly well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T18:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve tried IRSU SSTOs but gave up as they were too large/heavy/part count intensive to enjoy.
