There\u0027s been some backlash from the community, but nothing comparable to the time they said more advanced kerbals could actually effect your ships stats, and it\u0027s obvious Squad is moving ahead as planned. What is the rest of the communities opinion on this, and the topic of realism in the game as a whole? it\u0027s obvious that we\u0027re never getting anything game changing, like full scale planets, but how do you feel about smaller things like realistic fuels, or the new realistic aerodynamics?
