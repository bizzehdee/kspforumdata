There\u0027s been some backlash from the community, but nothing comparable to the time they said more advanced kerbals could actually effect your ships stats, and it\u0027s obvious Squad is moving ahead as planned. What is the rest of the communities opinion on this, and the topic of realism in the game as a whole? it\u0027s obvious that we\u0027re never getting anything game changing, like full scale planets, but how do you feel about smaller things like realistic fuels, or the new realistic aerodynamics? After all, this is a game that involves semi realistic (inb4 not n-body) orbital mechanics, and rocket design, it\u0027s already very realistic for what it is."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T00:50:54Z","Content":"It should be as realistic as it needs it to be."},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T00:51:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It should be as realistic as it needs it to be.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T00:52:10Z","Content":"for being a space sim, its important to have pretty accurate orbital physics, aerodynamics and such.

Kerbal fuel is as realistic as any other (except when nuclear propulsion uses oxidizer). The aero, water, joints and stress, exhaust damage, overheating... etc. should all be as realistic as possible. I\u0027d also love to see some kind of weather system added (yes, I know there is a mod for it).\n\nThe problem is that it\u0027s quite diffucult to make things work in 100% realistic environment if you don\u0027t have procedural parts.
