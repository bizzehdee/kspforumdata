I believe I\u0027ve done this fairly well, but there is still a little testing that I need to finish up to make sure that everything works well together, and that the prices are right. Upon finishing the SSTO mission, several weight-based missions are unlocked that pay by payload delivered to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly MissionController is listed on the page as a requirement, but not installing the Kethane Mod will break some missions (one that is in the pack and others that have yet to be written). However, not installing kethane shouldn\u0027t break the mission pack and the end objectives can still be reached. Following is the long data from my release notes. Pack can be searched by typing KIS on kerbalspaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# Kerbals in Space!

Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# Goal: This mission pack is designed around ease of playability to add depth to Kerbal Space Program. As such, running this mission pack to the extremes requires the use of other downloads availible for Kerbal Space Program. My goal with this project is to make a directed game that will focus the development of your KerbalSpaceProgram while still providing funds for independent research missions (as it should be). Thus, crashing a few rockets will not be held against you and you will be more or less free after the initial missions to continue the packs or set off on your own rocket designs for a while, comming back to the mission packs when you need more money. I hope you enjoy the laid-back pace as well as the depth that is added from these packs. Funding will change as you progress through the pack, but the intent is to give you a functional wallet from the get-go, so the first few missions are very generous. This is also explained through the dialogs to make it seemless so that it doesn\u0027t detract from gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# Installation: After mods are installed, put the KIS.mpkg into /KSP main folder/GameData/MissionController/Plugins/PluginData folder and start the game. MissionController will do the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# All testing done with the above modifications installed. Functionality is not testing with other modifications other than parts add-ons. Deviation from the above modification packages may make this mission pack act buggy or unusable. You\u0027ve been warned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# DEVELOPMENT HISTORY AND COMMENTS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/01/2013 - Officially began the KIS (Kerbals in Space!) Mission pack development. I will be focusing on the primary pack and if possible make it the only pack, but it may require some name-changes as I add side-story missions. One story line is not acceptable, and failure is not an option!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/04/2013 - I\u0027ve removed RemoteTech from the required mods just because the new ASAS is worthless when you have remotetech stuff installed. I hesitated to try it because of the lightspeed lag thing interfering with my rover landings and such, but after testing this mission pack it\u0027s become annoying, especially for planes. Use RemoteTech at your own discretion. I have the basic pack finished all the way to a \u0022first kerbal in space\u0022 but I\u0027m going to get a mun landing mission in there before I even consider release. Integration of the \u0022Commercial\u0022 missions ended up better than I though and I now have a solid blueprint for how to keep these sideplots rolling. Kethane integration was a bit tricky but I think I have mod part issues sorted now. Going back to work tomorrow, do I release now or wait till I have more missions?? Hmmmm, I think I\u0027ll wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/09/2013 - Removed TacLifeSupport to Reccomended Mods, as it should be up to the user to assess which mods they would like to add. Not having this mod installed is no long mission-breaking. Like RemoteTech, this mission pack is still designed around its use, but it is not required. Beta tested the original pack and expanded the Exploration missions to include all planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/11/2013 - Added more missions including spaceplanes. I\u0027m thinking the exploration missions should have a generic \u0022rover\u0022 mission that will offer cash for each landing or something, and the spaceplane missions will probably have generic missions based on weight. Bumping the dev to 0.3 tonight. Lots of missions still to be added and AKSF needs some refinement, but 1.0 is at least within sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/12/2013 - Version 0.33 - Added extended missions and finished testing SSTO missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/14/2013 - Version 0.36 - Fixed the extended missions to be a weight-based \u0022full-sponsorship\u0022 for your kerbal space program as a reward for building your first SSTO. As of this revision the KIS mission pack is fully functional, if not a little buggy. I\u0027m releasing this version to KerbalSpacePort, though there are still some kethane missions and possibly more exploration missions to add, so this will not be the final release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/15/2013 - Version 0.37 - Tested with Mission Controller Extended (0.18.1) and everything appears to be working fine. Started revising the missions because the pack is too \u0022easy\u0022 to play and there is no real threat of loss, thus taking away from the need to go beyond the sandbox and into some sort of mission based game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/19/2013 - Version 0.37 - Did a rekit on the first 10 AKSF missions, added a mission and adjusted the pricing. Still working but hoping to get 0.5 out pretty soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/26/2013 - Version 0.50 - Finished tweaking the AKSF Missions. Tested landing requirement with different vessels, seems to be working now, so I got that goin for me. Focused on career funding more, with lots of the missions being modified to have recurring daily stipends as a reward, even considering removing the extra missions, but keeping them in for now. Added some Exploration missions and tweaked the spaceplane missions. I still have plans to add space stations to the AKSF missions and the current changes need to be beta tested. But I think this is ready for update as future revisions should not be game breaking, unless I find a bug. I think you guys will like the modifications. I\u0027m still planning to put space station stuff in, but it\u0027s 2:30 in the morning and I\u0027m a little worn out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/26/2013 - Version 0.51 - Fixed a bug with the space telescope mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 08/30/2013 - Version 0.58 - Starting from the beginning, going through each mission and checking spelling/grammar stuff, adjusting rewards, and cleaning everything up. Most of the mission re-vamps are to increase the difficulty for hardcore mode, which should make the pack pretty tough for a noob but do-able. The total contract payouts are generous but because they are spread out over such a long time (1 year) I figured I could afford to be gererous. Verified that ClientControlled missions are paying out. Added some kethane missions to the commercial packs. Finished making exploration missions for every body in the Kerbol system. Changed the orbit distance on Commercial3 to get better mapping coverage, 200k is retracing itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# 09/01/2013 - Version 0.62 - RELEASE - Wow, 65 Missions total and more to come in the future. I didn\u0027t get a chance to test the new kethane missions but I want to get this released by midnight, and that only gives me another 20 minutes. I added a couple of bonus spaceplane missions, 3 AKSF missions for building a basic space station, and did a lot more testing. Reformatted the cost structure of the exploration missions, AGAIN. Added landing requirements to several missions. More testing, huf, puf. Up next will probably be space infrastructure but that will be a 0.7 or 0.8 release. Thanks everyone for your input and mission ideas, as well as my bug-finders, you know who you are. I hope you guys will enjoy this release and those to come. Hopefully all missions from here forward will not break the pack anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#09/02/2013 - Version 0.63 - Doing some bugfixes tonight. I\u0027ll try to update 0.63 to the server tonight. Changing some mission requirements as a result of some very good input from NathanKell, one of the developers for MissionController. Some other little stuff here and there. Nothing too fancy, no new missions unless I find something easy to work on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#09/02/2013 - Version 0.63 - RELEASE - Bug fixes and little tweaks to make 0.62 run a little smoother. Onto version 0.7 missions after tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E****************************** KIS is licensed with a standard MIT License *********************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS (Kerbals in Space!)

There are too many options with the kethane mod to be very specific in the mission profile without limiting the player, so it will be broken into smaller missions, that if they are not completed correctly will render later missions useless. I would like to put a repeatable mission in which a full keth tank landed safely on kerbin will net a nice sum similar to the cost of fuel. I\u0027ll probably also make repeatable missions for each fuel type (comparable to the set costs). Once up and running, xenon gas will probably prove to be very profitable, but it depends on how smooth your mining system is set up.

I took the landing requirement off because it can be a pain to land a spaceplane if you have the weight balance wrong or too few control surfaces, and RemoteTech doesn\u0027t help anything. I wasn\u0027t even putting remotetech stuff on my planes because of the annoying stuff it does to ASAS. I haven\u0027t used FAR but after tinkering with them long enough I found that I can make them pretty easy now, even larger ones. Right now the exploration mods don\u0027t contain dependencies for anything else, so they are kind of their own thing. Specifically because of the long distances, but maybe I\u0027ll unlock all of them at once that way you can do the landing missions without needing a probe first, but then, if you put legs and landing engines on your probe you can knock I and II out with the same craft for a given landing spot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Looks like I have some time today so I\u0027m going to get back on it.
