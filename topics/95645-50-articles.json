Although for permanent colonization bases or trips further out the greenhouse is required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour primary problem seems to be that you don\u0027t like the endurance numbers. You are not following a proper technological development because of this. There is absolutely no reason to separate food out into a different node. Remember all the capsules have life support built in anyway using a basic TAC LS module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll life support resources come should together in the same node. What your failing to see is the size and weights change through technological development and not availability. Higher technology does not affect the basic endurance numbers at all. What changes is the size, weight and ease of use of the containers. For example. If you throw in FAR aerodynamics into the mix you see that the radial tanks are a total pain to use. They need to be mounted in a service bay. It is all extra weight for just 10 points of each supply. Later on once passed basic survival. There is more sophisticated equipment. The stuff just gets easier to carry but the endurance calculations don\u0027t still don\u0027t change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, thank you for your detailed feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seem to be some misunderstandings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In 0.9.0.2, TAC life support is split between 2 nodes, enhancedSurvivability for oxygen and water, and recycling/LifeSupport for food. US is not fully supported, so I m not responsible for the location of the parts. I just saw no need to move water and oxygen, only to move them again in the next version. The other parts were intended to stay at LifeSupport node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I see food not primarily as \u0022food\u0022, but as the resource which extends life support beyond 360 days (\u002B the stuff in the pods). At least it would have avoided the possibility to send a kerbal to Duna with only 45 science nodes researched...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The US radial tanks are imho intended for rovers and landers and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that plan is scrapped now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll Life support containers (TAC and USI) go into enhancedSurvivability. Except the TAC Life Support clutter parts, which go into their own special 1 science node (cant make it 0 science), directly attached to enhancedSurvivability. So PP users can just avoid this node and everyone else just have to spend 1 more science and 2 more clicks.

When developing life support systems the problem is the water supply. To get more of that that you need a big power supply and or a big RO filtration system. It runs into the cube root problem. A system twice as wide and tall as another will have eight times the weight, and require a far stronger support structure. The only way to combat this by increasing the efficiency. We should indeed be forced into developing better technology before going passed Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, not \u003Cstrong\u003Efully \u003C/strong\u003Esupported.
