They look cool, I incorporate the \u0022crossing\u0022 technique on my designs sometimes, it makes it look sort of realistic, in a way. Like how the Russians use for connecting stages to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Development_of_the_Soviet_N1_Rocket.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Development_of_the_Soviet_N1_Rocket.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and are there any areas I could help out with Munshine? Like designing a rocket to fill in any gaps? I know there\u0027s one being worked on between Munshine IV and Munshine V, but anything else would be cool. And, one last question: will the higher end Munshine\u0027s be phased out into the new size parts, so they look less like, a bunch of fuel tanks strapped together? They already look nice but a nice SLS/Saturn style rocket would look really slick! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
