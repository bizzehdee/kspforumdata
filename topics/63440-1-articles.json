Other than that, only other real option is MOAR CHUTES! Make sure they\u0027re pulling on the whole ship more or less equally. If all your parachutes are attached to the command pod, it\u0027s probably gonna break off when they open.

Alter chutes to open as high as possible and fully deploy as low as possible. I don\u0027t remember setup now - I think lowest atmosphere pressure and lowest altitude.
