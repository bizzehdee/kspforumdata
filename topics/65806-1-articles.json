Your battery IS connected to whatever it is that uses power. There\u0027s an entire rocket in between them.

Unlike some people, I don\u0027t throw my rockets together and hope for the best, or use mechJeb, or any mods at all for that matter, I LIKE realism, I like building things and designing rockets to be incredibly dexterous and versatile, not just strapping a load of boosters to a command pod and thinking I\u0027m a genius.

I\u0027m a builder, I construct things - the more parts I have to work with, the more I enjoy doing it. Laying cables between Battery A and Part B, while keeping Battery Y for Part Z would mean more careful consideration placed on the location and size of batteries. Right now I just stick a bunch of any old battery pretty much anywhere on a ship and bingo, the lights come on. If this is all I need to do to make the light come on (and it requires no deduction, selection or reasoning behind choices and locations) then why bother with batteries at all? The suggestion of wiring was more of a personal requirement if I\u0027m honest, the idea of laying cables behind some of those panels and bulkheads to actually serve a purpose and really bring ship design to life is all it was intended to imply. Some of my ships are large and ostentatious just for the mere pleasure of putting pieces together. If I had a reason to design everything in a particular way it would make the game even more enjoyable - speaking for myself of course.
