Here\u0027s a little more detail about the situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a very simple rocket using the MK1 pod, a heat shield, some fuel tanks, the LV-909, the LV-T45 and some boosters. I used a service bay, attached to the MK1, and put some batteries and goo canisters in it. I attached radial chutes to the MK1, keeping in mind that they are as far from the service bay as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch to LKO with no problems. Re-entry, no problems. Deploying the chutes, also no problem. Landing safely and everybody\u0027s happy. So after using this rocket for 4 launches I was surprised to get the message: Unable to deploy chutes because they are stowed. Nothing was changed to its design and it all worked fine before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back to the VAB and changed the offset for the chutes just a tiny bit; problem solved. But still, Jeb is dead and I have no idea why it all worked the first few times and all of a sudden it failed. There has to be a reason for it unless it truly is random which is hard to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galileo Kerbonaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Galileo Kerbonaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELaunch to LKO with no problems.
