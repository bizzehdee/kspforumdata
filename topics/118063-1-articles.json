I know this tends to happen when the chutes are too close to a service bay, but how can it be random? If it worked once, let alone 5 times, it should work all the time?

More or less given up on them, since it\u0027s almost impossible to convince KSP the things you want in them ARE inside, and the rest outside).\n\nDepends on how you use them. I\u0027ve never had a single problem or bug with a service bay, ever. My guess is that the way I\u0027m using them must not be how most folks try to use it, but I find them really handy.\n\nMy main uses for service bays:\n\n- Put a probe core in them (handy during the part of career before the larger-size probe cores become available)\n\n- Put the little 100-charge radial batteries in them (handy way to avoid drag, before the larger battery sizes are available)\n\n- Put landing lights in them (couple of Mk1 illuminators; I then go into action groups and tie the \u0022Lights\u0022 action to the service bay, so that it swings open/closed when I toggle the lights)\n\n- Put science instruments in them, to protect during reentry\n\n...and perhaps the added factor that I don\u0027t get greedy (i.e. don\u0027t try to pack too much in there, allow a comfortable margin between the stuff in the service bay and the outer surface of the bay).\n\nIn any case, I don\u0027t want to derail the topic here, the original question was about parachutes-- hope to get some more detail there."},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:52:39Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies! Here\u0027s a little more detail about the situation:\n\nI built a very simple rocket using the MK1 pod, a heat shield, some fuel tanks, the LV-909, the LV-T45 and some boosters. I used a service bay, attached to the MK1, and put some batteries and goo canisters in it. I attached radial chutes to the MK1, keeping in mind that they are as far from the service bay as possible.\n\nLaunch to LKO with no problems. Re-entry, no problems. Deploying the chutes, also no problem. Landing safely and everybody\u0027s happy. So after using this rocket for 4 launches I was surprised to get the message: Unable to deploy chutes because they are stowed. Nothing was changed to its design and it all worked fine before. \n\nI went back to the VAB and changed the offset for the chutes just a tiny bit; problem solved. But still, Jeb is dead and I have no idea why it all worked the first few times and all of a sudden it failed. There has to be a reason for it unless it truly is random which is hard to believe."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:16:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Launch to LKO with no problems.

Your ship design sounds pretty simple and innocent."},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:42:47Z","Content":"Your guess is spot on.
