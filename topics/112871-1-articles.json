After tweaking around with the Duna periapsis to plan my return trajectory, I found out that Duna\u0027s gravity is too small to sling me back to the correct solar orbit that would get me back to Kerbin\u0027s nowhere-near-closest-approach position and I didn\u0027t have enough dV left to boost me to this orbit. Bill and Bob flew past Duna, then entered a solar orbit that touches the orbital height and inclination of Kerbin, but Kerbin is nowhere nearby."},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:34:11Z","Content":"I usually mess up aerobraking and aerocapture.

In hard game modes (no quicksave, 20%-30% reward settings) about half of my fails are bugs. As long as we do not have failing parts, I see that as an alternative, so I keep them without quicksaves.
