If not, do I get more for not transmitting and instead recovering twice?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each science experiment, there exists a maximum value of science points you\u0027re allowed to get from it. You can never exceed the value no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some experiments, like the thermometer, the value of one fully recovered experiment is equal to the maximum; in other words, recovering yields 100%. You can see that this is the case when the green bar is completely filled, and is one one uniformely light-green color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor others, like the goo canister, you receive less than the maximum possible value from recovering it. In other words, recovering yields less than 100%. You can see that this is the case when the green bar has two different colors in it. The light green color is what you get for recovering this experiment now; the dark green color is how much remains to get after recovering it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the transmision option, it works the same. There is a light blue bar that indicates how much you get from transmitting this now, as well as a dark blue bar that shows how much is left to get after transmitting. However! there is an additional transmission science cap that can never be exceeded, much like there\u0027s a total science cap. Even if the experiment allows you to get 100 science, it\u0027s very likely that transmitting will not allow you to go past a fraction of that. At some point (often after one trasnmission) it simply stops giving points. I don\u0027t remember right now if stock KSP even has an experiment that can be transmitted multiple times for incrementally smaller yields... probably not. Technically it\u0027s possible but it makes little gameplay sense to have it. Also, recovering will deplete the transmission pool as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you transmit an experiment, the science points that you get are subtracted from the maximum science cap. If your experiment is worth at most 100 points and you transmit for 50, then no matter what you do, you will never earn more than another 50 points from that experiment. In that scenario, it doesn\u0027t matter whether you would have gotten 100 points for recovering, or less than 100 points. The transmission gave you 50, so those 50 are removed from the allowed maximum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if recovering does not give you 100% (of what\u0027s possible) of a \u0027virgin\u0027 experiment, then it doesn\u0027t give you 100% (of what remains) of a transmitted experiment either. In the above example, if the maximum value is 100 and recovering would give you 80, then transmitting first will reduce the maximum value to 50, and recovering is now worth 40. Not 50, not 80, but rather 80% of the maximum remaining allowed value. If you recover it, there will be 10 points left, and the next recovery nets you 8 points... and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the following table helps illustrating how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor an experiment with:\u003Cbr\u003E- max value 100\u003Cbr\u003E- recovery 80%\u003Cbr\u003E- max transmission value 50\u003Cbr\u003E- transmission 100%\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    earned     remaining value      remaining transmission value\u003Cbr\u003Eunrecovered            0           100                           50\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered once        80            20                            0\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered twice       96             4                            0\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered thrice      99.2           0.8                          0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    earned     remaining value      remaining transmission value\u003Cbr\u003Eunrecovered            0           100                           50\u003Cbr\u003Etransmitted           50            50                            0\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered once        90            10                            0\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered twice       98             2                            0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Erecovered thrice      99.6           0.4                          0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in this specific example, if you had three experiment copies with you, then not transmitting and recovering all three of them would give you (slightly) more than transmitting one and recovering the other two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if the experiment does not become inoperable after transmitting, then transmitting once \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E recovering three times gives you (minimally) more still.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T11:35:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESrsly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly to another biome or planet.
