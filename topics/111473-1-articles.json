Excess hydrogen is used because H2 is substantially faster than H2O at the same temperature (both the mass of the molecule and the number of atoms alter the speed at a given temp, H2 beats everything we actually have the option of putting in a rocket) I believe the exact mix is variable, but for the shuttle it was ~6:1, though for a Jool scoop rocket I\u0027d suggest a pure mix and inject the helium instead of filtering it out, (Helium is beats H2 as exhaust but isn\u0027t normally anything approaching realistic, either you need a massive tank or a multi gigawatt cooling system).\n\nSecondly, its a jet, not a rocket. it can afford to move a huge amount of air at inefficient speeds to produce thrust because the air isn\u0027t ever going to run out. Earth/Kerbin based ones push 80% nitrogen out the back remember, its that more than the lack of oxidizer that gives jets a huge ISP.\n\nThe real trick to making a jet work at all at that kinda speed."},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T04:42:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Secondly, its a jet, not a rocket. it can afford to move a huge amount of air at inefficient speeds to produce thrust because the air isn\u0027t ever going to run out.

For turbofans, most of the reaction mass is air that never even goes through the turbine, especially for high-bypass turbofans."}]}
