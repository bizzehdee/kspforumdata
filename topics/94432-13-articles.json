At present, there\u0027s not a heck of a lot of difference between recovering straight from the runway, or recovering say 100Km out, which tends to bias things heavily towards the \u0022just ditch the plane wherever and recover\u0022 thing, and of course having the player fly in a straight line for extended periods of time to move targets further out isn\u0027t really practical anyways especially given the wonkiness of using time accel with planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately I view player time as the primary resource in KSP career mode, and it\u0027s a bit tricky to work things for planes so that the funds earned per unit time makes plane recovery worthwhile without massively inflating the price of plane parts or what have you. Decreasing the recovery rate with distance isn\u0027t really a solution either given something like 100 km is nothing for rocket recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, total tangent there, but suffice it to say, BTSM wouldn\u0027t really help at present with that, but I\u0027m working on it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T04:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas going to note here that it\u0027s working fine in KSP 1.0.3... but then noticed I had an outstanding change that has been waiting for a release for a while.
