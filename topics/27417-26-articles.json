The Curse plan is already set in stone, and I believe so is TT\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad makes a great game, but doesn\u0027t manage it well. I\u0027m likening their situation to a player getting himself to orbit by a barely-working rocket; it flies well enough, but can\u0027t do anything else. They should really set their ears up for their own people, lest their own game get bought by some other developer with more community support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I still think TT\u0027s decision to pull the plug is a foolish one, seeing that some people still enjoy it (I heard one user complaining that their favorite stockalike mods is about to disappear, this along with KSPX). He\u0027s making the situation worse, especially for the end-users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027m stuck with whatever things that are still in store now, seeing that the original developer just quitted and I have no modding skills. Though, I\u0027m sure I could find (or make, or request) a worthy alternative to this, short of B9 (too many parts, computer cannot take the strain).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
