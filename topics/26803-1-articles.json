Done properly, refueling in minmus orbit, dropping your kerbin periapsis to 80-100km, then burning at periapsis gets you into a planetary transfer orbit with the least amount of delta-V expended after the point of refueling than most other methods. There are a few disadvantages to this method, and in general, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it, but it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first disadvantage is obvious enough, it takes a lot more setup to do this unless you\u0027ve already got a fuel base at Minmus, and the only time that makes sense is if you\u0027re doing a lot of operations around Minmus or if you\u0027re using the Kethane mod to create fuel on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second isn\u0027t as obvious. It takes meticulous timing to get this right, and if you get it wrong, your correction burn could easily use up all the fuel that you saved, if not more. Basically, you need to time your ejection from Minmus so that it puts you into a Kerbin transfer orbit that will hit Kerbin periapsis right as you\u0027re hitting your ejection angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third disadvantage is that this isn\u0027t actually efficient because of the delta-V to get everything into Minmus orbit (unless you\u0027re mining kethane on Minmus), it\u0027s just getting you out of the system with almost full fuel tanks. Drop tanks of some sort would probably be much easier to do and achieve the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, here\u0027s how it works, and how it gets you into a transfer orbit with so little delta-V expended from the point of refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA burn to a Duna transfer from LKO takes 1000-1060 m/s delta-V depending on your parking orbit, so that\u0027s our benchmark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, starting at the point where you\u0027ve refueled, You\u0027ll burn 100-250 delta-V to go from Minmus orbit to a Kerbin transfer orbit, again depending on parking orbits, target periapsis, etc. A higher Minmus orbit is more efficient here, but it also means your Minmus orbit has a longer period, making it harder to perfectly time your transfer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you got the transfer right, you\u0027ll be hitting the periapsis of your Kerbin orbit with enough velocity to take you back out to Minmus, but at just the right time for your transfer to Duna. Since you\u0027ve already got about 900 m/s velocity over what a normal LKO would have, you only need to provide the missing 150 m/s delta V, for a total expenditure of about 400 m/s since refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is that not efficient overall? Because you spent over 900 m/s to reach the refueling point, and that isn\u0027t even counting the delta-V required to get the fuel there. However, if getting a transfer orbit with as close to a full fuel tank is the only measuring stick, it does quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atanar","CreatedById":59913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T18:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have gone from LKO to use the Mun gravity to get out of Kerbins SOI, is that efficient or am I wasting my time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"automcdonough","CreatedById":12249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T18:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ego straight from kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T19:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on the size of the payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor small spacecraft I just go straight from LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor larger craft I find it easier to refuel than to try building a massive vehicle, so I send them to Minmus first to refuel from a kethane lander that I keep there.

That doesn\u0027t have any effect here. Although, you might be able to first return from Minmus, then pass close behind the Mun on the way out and save a small amount of delta-v that way, and use that to alter your direction for a more optimal transfer to Duna. That would be hard though, and really awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crush","CreatedById":59094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T20:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can always save a bit delta-v with a well-timed mun encounter when leaving Kerbin, but it\u0027s not much because the vector of Mun is not much different from the vector of Kerbin on an interplanetary scale and the gravity well of Mun is not particularly deep.

This netted about 3000 m/s at Pe which i thought would be a nice speed to start the Kerbin ejection with. I understand that this isn\u0027t a slingshot because i used gravity to build speed after refueling in a very high orbit, and not to change trajectory or build/lose extra speed, except in the loose sense. I was trying to pick the cheapest ejection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentaly, i was flying a space station/fuel depot so it made sense to get it to Duna with as much fuel left on board as possible.
