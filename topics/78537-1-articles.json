You can go lower than 0.5 if you have a lot of excess thrust. Generally you don\u0027t need to go over 1.0 because past that you don\u0027t get much additional performance for the extra drag/weight penalties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnsolicited, but I also recommend:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 TurboJet per 12t (up to a maximum of 1 TurboJet per 15t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Intakes per TurboJet (minimum of 1, max whatever you feel like, but you have to start doubling past 3 to see much difference)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E150 units of fuel per engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are really basic rules of thumb I use to get started.
