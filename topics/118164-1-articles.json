AFAIK, impossible on windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - This is more for people who use steam. Sure you can have multiple installs on steam, but then only 1 can use the steam overlay, add to your hours played amount, etc. All I can think is that this might save a minuscule amount of space for non steam people, or maybe be a little more organized?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, now that that\u0027s out of the way, what am I talking about here? I\u0027m talking about using symlinks in linux to have different GameData folders that you can launch the game with different part/mod configurations, but have a communal settings.cfg, and all your saves in one place. For the text part of this I\u0027ll stick to a dual stock/modded setup, but for mine I actually have 3: stock, some info/utility mods, and then modded to all craziness. First, lets set up the multiple GameDatas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Choose a location for them, I picked ~/KSP.Installs, then create your subfolders there for each GameData (eg. Stock, Modded)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - If your current install is modded I\u0027d suggest cutting a pasting your GameData folder from your KSP install location into the Modded folder, then verify files in steam and cut/paste the new stock GameData into Stock. If you\u0027re running stock, copy/paste the KSP install GameData to both Stock and Modded, then add mods to Modded as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Delete your KSP install GameData folder if it\u0027s still there. You won\u0027t need it, and it\u0027ll confuse the launch scripts if it\u0027s there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to create the scripts. Create a file named something like KSP.Stock.sh and put this inside it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Erm ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/GameData\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/PartDatabase.cfg\u003Cbr\u003Eln -s ~/KSP.Installs/Stock/GameData ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/GameData\u003Cbr\u003Esteam steam://rungameid/220200\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this assumes you put your stock GameData in ~/KSP.Installs/Stock, and that your have KSP/Steam installed in their default configurations. Now mark it as executable through the properties window or \u0022chmod -x\u0022 and run it. If you run it in a terminal, there will be at least 1 error saying that ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program/GameData isn\u0027t there, and that\u0027s fine, cus the folder shouldn\u0027t be. There should now be a symlink to the Stock/GameData folder in the KSP install directory, and it should load up as stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Modded script:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Erm ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/GameData\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/PartDatabase.cfg\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/KSP.Installs/Modded/GameData/ModuleManager.ConfigCache\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/KSP.Installs/Modded/GameData/ModuleManager.ConfigSHA\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/KSP.Installs/Modded/GameData/ModuleManager.Physics\u003Cbr\u003Erm ~/KSP.Installs/Modded/GameData/ModuleManager.TechTree\u003Cbr\u003Eln -s ~/KSP.Installs/Modded/GameData ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/GameData\u003Cbr\u003Esteam steam://rungameid/220200\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this should load up the game using the Modded/GameData folder. Now, the reason for the rm commands for PartDatabase.cfg, and all the module manager data files, is that I\u0027ve found that when adding or changing parts even in a single install removing PartDatabase.cfg prevents buggyness when you load the game again. The same reasoning applies to the MM stuff. By deleting those files I\u0027m hoping to prevent 99% of the problems when I start the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, hope you all find this interesting at least, and here\u0027s some pics of the folders/scripts as reference:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dlWHQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
