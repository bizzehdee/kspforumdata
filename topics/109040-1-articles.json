Honestly i don\u0027t know if those numbers are available while that window is not visible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice if it could show other similar instruments - pressure (redundant, as its just under altimeter, i know), gravity scan and seismic. But those are not that useful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome bonus would be if it could highlight relevant thermometer on mouse hover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI searched on curse and forums without any luck finding something that could do just that, if you know about any, please let me know.
