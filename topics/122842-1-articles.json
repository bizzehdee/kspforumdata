We had our first successful powered flight in 1903, which before that, people thought it was impossible. 66 years later, we landed on the moon, and before we even touched the Karman line in the 40s, people thought it would be impossible to fire something in space. Nowadays, some people think SSTOs are impossible, but look at what history tells us now. If indeed REL builds this and successfully flies their first spaceplane (they hope to begin flying prototypes in \u002718 or \u002719), that will revolutionize everything, and we\u0027d have an entirely new approach to getting into space.

While not reducing absolute operating costs, more launches per year gives a lower cost per launch. Some early hypothetical studies examined 55 launches per year (see above), but the maximum possible launch rate was limited to 24 per year based on manufacturing capacity of the Michoud facility that constructs the external tank. Early in shuttle development, the expected launch rate was about 12 per year.[17] Launch rates reached a peak of 9 per year in 1985 but averaged fewer thereafter.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t be a problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022 When the decision was made on the main shuttle contractors in 1972, work was spread among companies to make the program more attractive to Congress, such as the contract for the Solid Rocket Boosters to Morton Thiokol in Utah. Over the course of the program, this raised operational costs,[citation needed] though the consolidation of the US aerospace industry in the 1990s means the majority of the Shuttle was now with one company: the United Space Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\u0022\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t be a problem for Skylon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill lots of potential problems for Skylon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo top it off, it will now be competing with reusable boosters from Space X, and other companies are developing tech to reuse their boosters too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re using a porcelain composite material for reentry heating.
