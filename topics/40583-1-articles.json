Upon restarting the design 3 times, i thought the community could come up with some excellent ideas for these bunkers to give everyone some inspiration. Thus, the challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGOAL\u003C/strong\u003E: Build a shelter, with stock parts, capable of housing your kerbals until rescue arrives. The challenge will be conducted on Eve and Duna, with leaderboards for each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJUDGING METHOD\u003C/strong\u003E: Points are tallied (see below) after qualifying tasks are complete, based on Kerbals on base and achievements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQUALIFYING TASKS\u003C/strong\u003E:Your shelter must be part of a simulated base, modeling the one you would intend to use on Duna/Eve. In order to demonstrate your system, you must organize a failure at your base- something that critically damages the base and necessitates rescue. I know this might be a tall order, so i\u0027ll leave it up to you to generate this (There may be a style bonus, however \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). I suggest dropping a lander or two on your regular facilities. Be as complicated or simple as you\u0027d like, the failure can be as simple as turning off the power. After the failure (which can happen at the UT of your choosing, such as before a transfer window for convenience\u0027s sake), you must send a rescue ship (won\u0027t be judged, but must be able to return crew home) and return your crew home, safe and sound. NOTE: Only the base need be stock, your rescue can use anything but Mechjeb or Hyperediting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBASE DESIGN RULES\u003C/strong\u003E: The shelter must be totally self contained in case of a total base failure, so here are the rules for the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbal Supplies\u003C/span\u003E: Each Kerbal requires nutrient stores (water and air are assumed recycled, see next rule), which are simulated by either ASAS modules or Structural Fueslages. ASAS \u0022cans\u0022 can support 1 Kerbal apiece, the latter 4 Kerbals. You can \u0022use\u0022 an ASAS you simply added for contol in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E Recycling\u003C/span\u003E: The other basic needs for kerbals will be simulated as power consumption: The base must have 200 power per Kerbal for this. Also, as part of this, you must have power generation to sustain a 1/sec loss per Kerbal. Redudancy is awarded bonus in the scores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EShielding\u003C/span\u003E: While optional, you can provide shielding from radiation/impact/storms in the design. If deemed adequate (basically, if it would actually protect it from most directions), there is a bonus (see achievements). Also, another bonus goes to proof of impact protection, or shooting a decoupler at it on Kerbin and having it survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMAIN SCORE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbal is worth 50 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbal over 8 is worth 65 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAesthetics are important.
