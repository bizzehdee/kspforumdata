When I play it, it seems to me RCS is good and the reaction wheels are weak. When your still hooked up to a launcher, or other cargo, the reaction wheels can barely move the Gemini, so I always use RCS. If you have just the Gemini by itself, then the R wheels are fine for maneuvers, but I still usually use RCS on fine control (if you don\u0027t switch to fine controls, the rcs is a little too powerful for just the pod by itself) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m running into now is that the r wheels are using monoprop pretty much all the time.
