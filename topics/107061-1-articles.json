Cannot say how true this is, but you can also equally argue that watching MechJeb do something (like a launch or landing) can let you learn how to do it yourself or that once you already know how to do stuff it can be nice to be able to just tell MechJeb to do it for you since you already know how to circularize things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027ve been taking a different approach. While I like the idea that rockets can be automated (especially when using RemoteTech) I feel like there should be more involved than simply attaching a part and then having it do all the flying for me. So I\u0027ve picked up kOS and written my own launch program (and am in the process of writing similar programs for other common operations). I really like this because although I now am slowly building an autopilot (for lack of a better term) it is one that I have cobbled together \u003Cem\u003Emyself\u003C/em\u003E using the things \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E have figured out, which feels much more like a real space program to me. It also gives me the opportunity to have realistic launch failures as a result of bugs in my code or setting parameters incorrectly (such as when I accidentally told my rocket to fly to an apoptosis of 100 meters instead of 100km). It makes my whole space program feel significantly more real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I also keep in mind that different people are playing the game for different things. I want a very hard, realistic approach to the game and run mods in an attempt to achieve that. Other people are more concerned with simply building a thing and getting it into orbit. They just want to see it in action and are less concerned with the actual flying. And then there are people who are more into testing their own ability to fly something even - or especially - when things go wrong. As long as the person is having fun doing it I\u0027d say that they are playing the game properly according to their goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, why is there this big argument over how to play the game \u0027right?\u0027 Is it that horrible if someone is having fun playing the game in a way that is different from how you enjoy it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Borsek","CreatedById":129852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 100 hours flying ships by hand it gets boring, but the building of successful ships doesn\u0027t, so I fly mechjeb whenever I can, have flown waaay too much to keep doing it manually.

The AGC was a joint effort between NASA and MIT.
