(I know the fuel tank doesn\u0027t take up the entire inside volume of the visible cylinder, but I\u0027m going with what I can work with.) Also, the volume of a cylinder 3 meters in diameter and 5.5 meters tall is 38.9 cubic meters. Not bad! That means that we can fit about 24.76 times more fuel in the big tank, which gives us... 12380 liquid units of fuel, for 54.472 units of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if we were going with physical size, this fuel tank should weigh something like 57 mass units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really, a simpler option is to just scale the objects appropriately by \u003Cstrong\u003Eperformance\u003C/strong\u003E (change mass to 7.6 mass units, due to fuel being 2.2 mass units per 500 volume units) as opposed to \u003Cstrong\u003Ephysical size\u003C/strong\u003E. Visual sometimes \u0026gt; gameplay, but in the interest of fairness, gameplay counts too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh no am I going to end up making a post for density of substances and scaling? eventually\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I would also like to note that I would totally not hate a far larger single nozzle (1 meter/standard width) with logical thrust and fuel consumption for use as a first-stage engine. Or maybe a cluster, Falcon style! Anything goes, I just need something visually different to be big and intimidating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nicholas482109","CreatedById":2048,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-17T05:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use this mod, obviously, but i have no idea what the tower is really for or what the retro pack does, can someone explain?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"innociv","CreatedById":1833,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-17T06:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think having them be \u003Cstrong\u003Eperfectly\u003C/strong\u003E balanced for mass vs. performance is better because it makes it harder to do the \u0027wrong\u0027 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also means you can make the rocket that looks how you want, instead of having to use the best performing parts so it flies right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they\u0027re perfectly ability, it\u0027s more truly about your design, and not your cherry picking the best parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stopped using mod parts, most of the time, because they feel unfair in my quest for speed.
