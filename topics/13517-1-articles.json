I got the idea when I was able to do this with Orbiter. I know I\\\u0027ve bugged the devs and a lot of people about having stars removed from the game, and so instead, I am wondering if there is just a way I can do it myself. With Orbiter, you can delete a file called \u0027Star.bin\u0027 and it removes the star texture from space entirely. I thought of this idea for Kerbal. Is there a texture file of the space clouds and stars that I can just delete?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T00:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think those images are part of the executable.
