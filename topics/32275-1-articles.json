I\u0027ve been playing the demo for about two weeks now, and lurking the forums (and youtube videos) for about one week. I have purchased the full game on steam, but am resisting the urge to install it till after my exams are finished, in 10 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve landed, and returned safely from Mun, launched capsules into orbit around Kerbin and done the closest I can at docking within the demo, and launched thing out of the Kerbol\u0027s range of influence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to playing with docking ports, rovers and the like... and especially look forward to participating in some of the challenges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a large section of last night trying to comprehend the mathematics of orbital physics, from what I could find on Wikipedia. I didn\u0027t succeed, though by the end my brain was dribbling out of my ears. Is it possible to calculate delta-v, orbital requirements, gravity assists and so on using just maths? And if so, what aspects of maths do I need to study? the equations in wikipedia made no sense to me at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to be able to draw up a flight plan, including burns and planet intercepts, before I leave the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T15:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums DesertPhoenix! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can calculate everything in KSP.
