Even if you don\u0027t come back down on the first pass, you generally will on the second, and the heat generated in the process is usually survivable. Now, if you want to be sure to get in on the first go around, go 30-33k, but be prepared to lose bits of your craft to heat; ablator or an engine on the end will mitigate that tremendously, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T17:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt need not be too low, but this depends on whether you\u0027re simply returning from low orbit, from the Mun or from Minmus.
