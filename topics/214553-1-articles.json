Flies well up to Mach 2\u002B. Landing speed a bit high, but lands quite well.

How does it work? As there is no jeep with a take off assistant to lift the wing tip from the ground on take offs,\u00A0I used a reaction wheel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel your wings, give it a full throttle and go.

The XS fuel tank, air intake and engine. Oversized wing. Simplest undercarriage. And the pilot seat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanded it on the island runway. Actually, could do it with much less \u0022untraditional\u0022 plane. But I like ultralights.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wish we had stock piston engines in KSP2.
