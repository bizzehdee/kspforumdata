I\u0027ve built a few SSTO planes and always found myself either bored flying them to orbit, or frustrated by them because I didnt hit the ascent profile EXACTLY right and now I wont make it or will waste a lot more fuel and time correcting it.

Contracts to survey or take temperature scans, etc, are even less worth the time and effort.\n\nSo for me, the only point of plane parts are Space Planes. They are much harder to build and pilot than a rocket, but it\u0027s an excellent change of pace for when you feel you\u0027re getting burned out on KSP.

Once you have something that will go fast at high altitude, redesign to add oxidizer and rockets. Keep your first SSTO limited to one kerbal and forget about trying to get cargo or anything extra like RCS up there.\n\nIt isn\u0027t all that hard to make an SSTO that will ferry one kerbal without payload up to orbit that can deorbit and return to KSC.

I embedded an imgur album, and you can see my basic spaceplane\u0027s MET from runway to orbit is 8:05. Typical rocket launch is between 4-5 minutes for me, so yes, it takes slightly longer but not that long! In earlier versions of KSP, yes spaceplanes took quite a bit longer, but with the new aero, it\u0027s even easier to be a plane jockey.\n\nI used to be like you, never messed with space planes or plane parts, but once I started fooling around with them they became an essential part of my space program. It started when I realized that my typical SCANSAT/Ore scanner satellite with all the bells and whistles cost ~22k funds, but launching it with a rocket cost ~34k. That meant fully 1/3 of my costs were being staged as junk all over Kerbin!\n\nAlso, in career, if you play with mods such as MKS or SCANSAT, there are times when you want to put something up like a scanner or station part or whatever, that you\u0027re not going to complete any contracts on to defer costs. My infrastructure usually lagged way behind my tech because I didn\u0027t want to waste all those funds. Spaceplanes and shuttles helped alot in this regard, lowering my costs for building.\n\nNow typically, I don\u0027t use actual spaceplanes for much other than light payloads, tourism, and crew transfers. I do have a few \u0022orange tank\u002B to orbit\u0022 designs, but for large payloads I do use rockets mostly. My \u0022biggest\u0022 use for spaceplanes is leveling kerbals up. I hate wasting a bunch of funds just to send some kerbals into solar orbit to get that third star. I have a nuclear passenger spaceplane specifically for this purpose.\n\n I have a series of \u0022shuttles\u0022 that I use for medium payloads. You can see my smallest one in the gallery I embedded. I use these mostly for station construction and MKS/OKS deployment.\n\nBasically it comes down to this:\n\nRockets\n\nPros:\n\n- Power \n\n- Easy\n\n- Less tech tree investment\n\nCons:\n\n- Lots of funds lost in staging\n\n- Hard to do precise landings in capsules\n\n- Can be boring!\n\nPlanes\n\nPros:\n\n- 100% recovery on runway\n\n- No staging losses\n\n- Cool factor!\n\nCons:\n\n- 100% loss if something goes wrong\n\n- A bit more time to orbit\n\n- Hard to design\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
