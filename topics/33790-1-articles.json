Long time no see! Kidding, I practically live on the forums whether I post or not \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. RL just got in the way of me doing any more releases. I have been playing around with this one for a while, actually, but I found that SABRES have the gimbal ability of a turd, and so balancing this so you can blast full throttle was... let\u0027s say challenging. Without further due, here it is in all its glory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2wNxVT4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2wNxVT4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222wNxVT4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is short of a workhorse: 2 pilots, 2 empty passenger seats, and a roomy payload bay that has been tested to get to orbit payloads of up to 20mT. A true jack of all trades, you could say, and with more than decent looks, and all clocking in at a mere 130 parts (which was a surprise, in a ship this big and powerful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say, the B9 pack produces some slick-looking crafts. In fact the shuttle itself is 100% B9 parts (except the landing gear, of course), the only use of KSPX is in the payload\u0027s RCS tank, and the other mods are completely optional (basically, navigation functions and a bit of flavour with the chatterer). You also have room in the shuttle to take the crew of the lander up in style, though you will have to fill the seats yourself (or with crew manifest). Let\u0027s see how it looks when we open the payload bay and show the insides:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/IjaBhY0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IjaBhY0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IjaBhY0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you ask, the payload lander is a Mun-capable lander. Mun-capable as in \u0022it can go from LKO, to the Mun surface, and back again\u0022. That will get you back to an aerobrake trajectory on fumes, though (I didn\u0027t make the most efficient landing, and therefore I had to finish the Mun escape burn on RCS), but don\u0027t worry: the shuttle itself gets to orbit with most of it\u0027s fuel left, so you can make the Munar insertion burn from a much higher orbit, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eor even get the whole shuttle to Munar orbit before you go down to the surface\u003C/span\u003E. RCS is always there as backup in case you screw up as I did (I only was lacking 20m/s!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, kerbal engineer redux says it has \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E1.7km/s\u003C/span\u003E 1km/s left in a 81x80km orbit, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eso I guess you could say this is Duna-capable\u003C/span\u003E. The main reason of that is the intake: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eit is seriously cheaty. I mean, I was able to keep the engines going full throttle until I was almost 50kms up! And going more than 1,900m/s (orbit). Talk about \u0022efficient engines\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EApparently version R3.2 of the B9 pack fixed it, and in response I added a boopload more intakes\u003C/strong\u003E.

Only a couple of further points to have in mind if you want to give this a go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The liftoff is tricky: wait till you are going more than 75m/s, then do it in one sharp pull, or you will start fluttering under ASAS and have a bad encounter with the runway. I just couldn\u0027t make the landing gear rigid enough, sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. Still, I\u0027ve managed it a bunch of times, and without letting any pieces on the runway, you have enough clearance, lift, and thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Due to the mysteries of fuel routing, it likes to start taking fuel from the payload first, so you will have to forbid that tank before you take off (or during flight). If you care about it, of course, you might also wait till you are in orbit to refuel the tank from the shuttle, and it should still be stable and not have CoM issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E (note some of the screenshots are form older versions with different wing profiles that ended up having unbalanced CoM/Thrust line issues)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Sfuh2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Sfuh2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/kmbb00iphi2ln60/Swan.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/kmbb00iphi2ln60/Swan.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I fixed the intake situation, and trimmed down on mods of which only one, optional, part was present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
