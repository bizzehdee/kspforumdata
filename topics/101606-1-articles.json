Seriously how many people are intrested in this and how did you imagin developing this mod when you don\u0027t even have access to a Oculus Rift?\n\nI could possibly get access to a Oculus Rift, although it wouldn\u0027t be mine and I wouldn\u0027t have the opportunity to test everything all the time. I could only use it occasionally. So I\u0027d like to have someone who can do this for me.\n\nDeveloping something for the Oculus Rift isn\u0027t difficult, even when you don\u0027t own one. I\u0027m already a bit experienced with the Oculus Rift SDK as I\u0027ve helped to develop a small game together with a few friends of mine.\n\nHowever, if no one is willing to do that (which would be rather sad imho), I\u0027ll just go on and do it on my own. It would be great to have someone helping me tho.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T12:43:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by codefox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nilok","CreatedById":21749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T09:06:36Z","Content":"I have an Oculus Rift DK2.
