It would probably have to be turning a Kania truck into a rocket. It was just for fun and I think I used infinite fuel to get it to space, but that\u0027s what the kerbals are about, right? Honestly, I haven\u0027t done that much kerbal-y stuff in KSP. I haven\u0027t really been to space that much. I\u0027ll put pictures of the truck here soon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I just made a helicopter version that actually (pretty much) works. Now I am working on a truck/plane!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANOTHER EDIT: The plane worked ok, and I landed successfully, besides that I lost part of an engine during the landing. It only happened because I have the wheel brakes set too strong and the truck turned and rolled a little as it came to a stop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-08T20:31:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2022 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Ben J.
