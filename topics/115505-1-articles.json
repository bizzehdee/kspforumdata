An F-15 pushes the brake up into the airflow then air pressure helps push it back down into the closed position but a snake eye retarded bomb tailfin will pop out the other way so that airflow helps to keep them open.\n\nIn game the actuator is always able to move the panel so it\u0027s largely down to aesthetics."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:01:58Z","Content":"Based on the part\u0027s default orientation I believe they\u0027re meant to go hinge-forward."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:07:28Z","Content":"They are modeled after real life airbrakes, which are oriented like the first screenshot mentioned above.
