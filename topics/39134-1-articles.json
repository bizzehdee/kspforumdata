Basically, do you have any instances of not just debris, but entire abandoned ships?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration is the lander of an Apollo-style mission in my new game. It was my first time trying such a thing and the orbiter was running on fumes. When the lander docked with it, I had no choice but to transfer all of its fuel into the orbiter. In order to lose weight, I decided to just leave the lander behind in a 66km munar orbit. This turned out to be a good call, since even then the crew just barely made it back. Now the lander just sits up there, and it\u0027s kind of creepy. I like creepy, so there it will stay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T16:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI... had *snip*... 0.21...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had one space station that didn\u0027t had it\u0027s solar panels unfolded, it is a really creepy thing in a weird orbit arround the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
