Here, in the presented version, you\u0027ll find a Refueler payload, more than 250t, which can be placed on a 1000km high orbit. Obviously, if you wanna use this launcher with a fairing and a \u0022standard\u0022 payload made of pods or equipment and fuel, you\u0027ll extend a lot these numbers allowing you to use the last stage for interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, let\u0027s go for pics since you like them more than videos \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E And a bit of description, even if my english won\u0027t allow me to be as clear as I would like :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NVu7ONw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NVu7ONw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the successor of the DC - Mendacium, another launcher presented in topics and which you can find on my Youtube Channel.

Otherwise, after something like a minute of use, the \u0022thrusters crown\u0022 can be seperated, the rocket has enough velocity. Thus, the main central thruster can show all its magnificent ISP of 380 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sbpKrPx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sbpKrPx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the 4 remaining nukes and the central thruster are still here, and the efficicency is great to circularize around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WymPADt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WymPADt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the payload and its use, the central thruster is also separable. This is made to guarantee the best perfomance while using the last large orange stage in interplanetary context ! Most of the time, such interplanetary mission won\u0027t be carrying refueler, so we can assume that the payload, even big, would be much much lighter. In this condition, the fuel remaining in orange tanks can reach more than 2/3 of capacity, which is a lot when consumed through Nukes ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E1yWfC9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E1yWfC9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, this is not our goal, so this orange final stage is separated, to come back to Kerbin or be used as a refuelling station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JK3S04g.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JK3S04g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eour payload, an refueller, is in orbit and weights 253t, not bad ! This is fully equiped, with power supply, antennas, and of course the three kind of docking ports for a maximum versatility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V5EAHPN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V5EAHPN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and in the center, you can see a Nuke ! This will certainly be slow as hell but the gives the capability to be fully autonomous and reach targets by its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you notice that the 4 large docking port at the rear, are corresponding to the 4 others which belong to the orange fuel ? This is made to ensure a wide modularity. Imagine a mission with an autonomous head, like a big scout vessel. This launcher can extract it from the Kerbin SOI, with lots of remaining fuel in orange tanks, equipped with nukes. You get something to travel, detach, moving around, coming back to interplanetary stage, and coming back home, the whole in a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/poXBAvG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022poXBAvG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this is it ! A final important information :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks that are \u0022fusionned\u0022 with others see their fuel capacity decreased to fit the exact remaining. It would be to easy to \u0022encrust\u0022 parts with no consequence ! As a consequence, the mass bilan is not in my favor since i\u0027m carrying \u0022tanks surfaces\u0022 that is not really used.
