Taking advantage of the infrastructure setup in Kerbin space in addition to giant rockets, wealthy individuals may set their sites on Eve, no matter how irrational their reasons are for doing so. Or perhaps it may be the Glorious Order of Snacks in their quest for more purple. I for one, cannot make the judgment of who will be colonizing Eve first. As long as they are willing to put up with the high gravity of Eve, care fairly little about getting an enormous amount of money back, Evian colonization could be conducted by a wide group of people, making it less definite what kind of governments are set up on Eve. I can easily imagine different cloud city-states being built by different entities, each with their own unique government, allies, and enemies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0However, this by no means excludes corporate colonization. A carbon manufacturing industry could take hold, using the abundant solar energy for what are likely high-energy processes, and the surface mining could aid the construction of structures around Eve, not to mention the possibilities for tourism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 As for how Gilly is governed, I imagine it could potentially be governed like a port authority. Gilly would become a port, with a beamliner station to accelerate and decelerate packages. Since Gilly can use its own resources to expand facilities, it would have a head start before any orbital habitats, therefore funneling much of the cargo to Gilly. The cargo is taxed, supporting Gilly financially. As for the governance of the authority itself, I imagine a board of directors being selected by the governments on Eve and by the people of Gilly, not dissimilar to the system discussed in the Moho chapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:26px;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EThe Issues of a Colonized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Eve has no immediate source of water. As a result, water must be gained from distant sources. The first approach is to establish mining operations on other worlds, primarily asteroids. Large asteroids will be refined on-site, since the amount of water available justifies a long-term operation. On the other hand, smaller asteroids will simply have the raw resources launched on mass drivers in small capsules down to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bubYK5C.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022570\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bubYK5C.png?1\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The next solution is to import the water, an option available as long as the controllers of Eve are not isolated or blockaded from their trade partners. Alternatively, only hydrogen is imported, combined with the oxygen retrieved from carbon dioxide in Eve\u2019s atmosphere. This would likely be the most mass-effective option, since hydrogen is significantly lighter and as a result takes less propellant or energy to transport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oz7ziQV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oz7ziQV.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EBe careful, this one might have missiles onboard!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The last option is perhaps the most extreme\u2014piracy. A direct invasion of the source of water will result in too much damage, but privateers will not. If Eve is shut off from imports, and the asteroids do not provide enough water, this may be the last hope. In return for capital, and a base of operations, the pirates will give Eve the water it needs, not to mention other goods carried onboard and more ships. Piracy could be particularly effective on beamliner network routes, since the propulsion of the beamliner ships is limited to only during the acceleration phases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RhMi3HA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022612\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RhMi3HA.png\u0022 width=\u0022908\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ELet\u0027s just say that the border\u00A0disputes are numerous...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0In the skies of Eve, the cloud-cities are constantly travelling along with the winds, which means that borders with longitudes in the sky are essentially useless. Two solutions that I can think of exist: first, the cities are given latitude \u201Clanes\u201D to travel in, or are given spheres of control, with spheres depending on the size of the settlement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0One of the first conflicts that I thought of for Eve is one between the cloud-dwellers and the surface-dwellers. If aerostats are difficult to build, then living there is only for those who can afford it. In contrast, the surface is shrouded by clouds, and the domes on the surface might be more affordable. The contrast in lifestyle might create a physical divide between the rich and poor if there is high inequality on Eve and useful in establishing a difference in the two worlds to portray the conflict in a story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Another conflict may be within those who want to heavily tweak themselves to the surrounding environment, to the point where walking may be possible on the surface with no gear, and those who would like to keep habitats liveable, especially to the un tweaked. The second group people likely live in the cloud cities, which are very similar in environment to Kerbin, and would therefore be a sought after place to live for baseline kerbals, not to mention the loss in tourism, since the tourists can no longer visit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0A key issue that will define Eve will be the debate of whether to terraform or not to do so. The decision will be divisive\u2014there will be proponents on both sides. Not only that, the decision must be decisive\u2014if there are multiple countries on Eve, they may answer to the terraforming question very differently, and as a result run (anti-)terraforming operations that are only counterintuitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Cloud dwellers will almost certainly advocate keeping Eve\u2019s climate the same\u2014at the cloud level, it is pretty much Kerbin-like aside from the high gravity. If terraforming began, which would entail the removal of atmosphere in some form, the aerostats would lose buoyancy. The nature of the terraforming project means that even gradual changes will take a long time, allowing the people and equipment on the cloud cities to be moved down to the surface. Nonetheless, there will be opposition to something that uproots their very way of life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface dwellers, on the other hand, will favor it, as will mining corporations. The rich resources of Eve become much easier to tap into, and it will be possible to walk on the surface with little more than an oxygen tank and protective layers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EMilitary and War\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Eve could likely muster the capability for a large military, thanks to the large availability of resources and an excellent base (Gilly).\u00A0If Eve is heavily reliant on sources of water they don\u0027t control, there would be a need for a medium-sized defensive military, making sure that their water supplies are not attacked, and to defend the world itself. In this case, the fleet would likely consist of a large number of smaller vessels, tasked with escorting ships. If they are relatively self-sufficient, they would also place their forces near their sources of water, to discourage any kind of attack. Self-sufficiency would also grant Eve the capability to be more on the offensive, with Eve building larger ships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 I see Eve as being a world where a war of independence could succeed, since it is largely self-sufficient, except for water. Speaking of water, that could \u00A0very well be another way war begins\u2014for whatever reason, the other factions refuse to export water. I personally think it is unlikely that Eve does not have the capability to establish mining operations to keep up with its demand, especially given the technology available in a future setting, but it is possible. This may be the backdrop for the privateer operations to take place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The conflict between the cloud and surface dwellers could potentially descend into military conflict, and be fed by the terraforming issue. The cloud dwellers would avoid military conflict as much as they can\u2014they know that their habitats are vulnerable to damage and destruction. The surface dwellers are vulnerable to the pressure difference between the habitat and the ambient pressure, but they can also better armor themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0An invasion against Eve may have less incentive to preserve the infrastructure\u2014it is less likely that their interests are monetary, unlike the corporate wars on Moho.

This means taking out the asteroid mines, and in the case that water ships are in heavy use, they will be escorted to drive away privateers, forcing Eve to attempt a risky invasion of water mines or eventually fall. The final method for stopping water from getting in will be by gaining space superiority around Eve. Unless the Evians find some unlikely source of water, they will be forced to give in eventually. The defenders do have a trick in case they lose space superiority\u2014they can install lasers below the clouds, either on the ground or even in the ocean.

By conquering or destroying the metal supplies, the mines on Eve will have to be expanded to fill the demand, and in the meantime will hinder the war effort due to the lack of resources. If Gilly is conquered, it also provides an excellent base for invading Eve directly, with plenty of metals, and close proximity. However, it will be a hard base to maintain, with the threat of constant attack by the defending Evians persisting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yaYMLEt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yaYMLEt.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The cloud habitats are highly susceptible to attack.

I don\u2019t recall the atmospheric composition of Eve, but if it is nearly all Carbon Dioxide, lasers could cut through the atmosphere without much loss. If not, however, they would mainly be relegated to a defensive role against the next weapon, missiles. Missiles could cause enough damage to prevent any immediate repair if detonated. Missile types, I would imagine, would come in two categories. The first would travel purely in the atmosphere, perhaps getting a speed boost and cutting travel distances with the use of a nuclear jet powered bomber as the launch platform. If such a jet is used, it may make Eve the only place to have a significant presence of military \u201Caircraft\u201D, as most other worlds would no longer use them due to their vulnerability from space or ground weapons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022givOW3n.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/givOW3n.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ELooking back, it would\u0027ve been advisable to space the release of the missiles by a\u00A0second or two...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The second would be the ones that go far above most, if not all the atmosphere.

A planetary invasion would be against dug-in, bombardment-resistant forces reminiscent of WWII amphibious invasions like Iwo Jima and Tarawa. A ground campaign would face a determined foe who just won\u0027t be stamped out, and uses the local environment to their advantage, like in the Vietnam war. And finally, the environment of Eve itself would strongly remind the invading troops of another setting - hell. No corporation would commit to such a war - there\u0027d be no economic benefit. And a government, even a dictatorship, would have a pretty hard time convincing its people to continue pouring generations of Kerbals\u00A0and trillions of monies and years of time into taking over Eve - someone might eventually ask why exactly they need to take it over in the first place.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003EGilly or the Mun\u0027s colonists are like the scientists from Black Mesa (Half-Life)\u00A0- killed by the truckload, with no real means of defending themselves.

Despite only some regions of the EC making attacks, the whole planet is now at war with several groups, though most of the countries on the powerhouse of Kerbin remain neutral. The convoys of spacecraft are now escorted, and no privateer is foolish enough to approach them.

A physical armor defense can be established, with a thin sheet between the target and the projectiles, which can be fairly small, since the speed at which the projectile will be travelling at to avoid interception severely limits maneuvering capability even with advanced rockets.

The first Kerbals stationed at Eve for any significant period were those on research aerostats that navigated the skies. Eventually, Eve also became a base for mining operations, and a carbon-based material manufacturing industry brought significantly more people to Eve. The construction of skyhooks was a major boost to exports, as earlier travel relied on laser launch or more conventional rocketry for the entire journey to space. Hotels on Eve would also become a major draw for stationing people there, as interplanetary travel decreased in cost and time, and this progressed into living spaces as well. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EYou disembark from the beamliner station, after a several week trip on the aptly named MatterBeam Spacelines on the Kerbin-Eve route.

You notice that there are appear to be three toruses nested inside of each other. The reason why? The Port of Gilly is meant to serve passengers from a variety of gravity backgrounds. For this reason, there is a torus at 1/3rd of a G, accommodating those from the Mun, Duna, and Moho; 1 G, accommodating Kerbin, most orbital habitats, and Laythe; and the full 1.7 Gs of Eve. It is rather expensive to implement this design, explaining why other habitats around Eve go for full Evian gravity, though this means they cannot serve as a port as well.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EThe outer torus also allows visitors to become better used to the gravity of Eve, and if it proves too much, they can stick to the inner levels for the torus. However, having come from Kerbin, you adjust fairly quickly, and board the massive shuttle bound for Eve. The shuttle \u201Clands\u201D onto a launch loop and is then decelerated. Once the shuttle stops at the terminal, you board a large lift and prepare for the descent into the purple yonder. Finally, the glittering, brilliant clouds of Eve fill your view, and the cloud city of well, Cloud City awaits. They say that it was a reference from some 2-dimensional movie some 700 years ago, but it strikes you as rather unoriginal, if accurate. Several dozen massive bubbles float in the sky, each interlinked.

The reason is that the Evian city-states travel at the cloud layer, the winds of which provide a significant boost to the cities and provides the appearance of a 6 hour day. The surface dwellers have also adopted this, as the surface is dark even in the daytime, shielded by clouds. You look out the observatory, and in the distance you can see two other great cities in the green palette of sunset slowly approach. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qEXZy3q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qEXZy3q.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERole \u0026amp; Conclusion\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ESo what, then, is the role of Eve in the Kerbol system?
