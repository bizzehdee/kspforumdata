I\u0027d like to create a stock-alike control surface that, for pitch and roll commands, functions normally, but when is told to yaw while still in a horizontal placement, splits into two pieces, as in the following pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3122/3161617018_4bd283c08c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223161617018_4bd283c08c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.richard-seaman.com/Aircraft/AirShows/Edwards2005/B2/B2Taxying9oClock2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B2Taxying9oClock2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do modelling and texturing starting in a few weeks, once school is over, but I\u0027d like some input/advice/assistance as to how one might implement such a part in Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
