I\u0027ve done my own Eve ascent using Kethane-burning turbines, which act like turbojets but use any atmosphere (including Eve\u0027s). The thick atmosphere does make your terminal velocity extremely low for quite a ways up, though, so you want to be very careful with your throttle; that same thickness that gives you plenty of lift ALSO gives you so much drag that you\u0027ll be wasting a lot of fuel offsetting it unless you\u0027re careful to take things slow. The big advantage of a winged design is that you don\u0027t need a high TWR; very few planes have thrust-to-weight ratios above 1.0, whereas every rocket needs to be well above that line. So you can get away with using weaker but more efficient rockets on your ascent, at least until you reach the upper atmosphere where ballistics takes over, which\u0027ll save you quite a bit of fuel in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horn Brain","CreatedById":49626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T19:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the way drag works in the game, I think you\u0027re better off just using rockets.
