Paintball -- Just Found One of my Favorite Childhood Games!","CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:26:35Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:26:35Z","Content":"![51EnkVJmG1L._SY300_.jpg](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EnkVJmG1L._SY300_.jpg)\n\nBack in my day, games came on discs! there\u0027s really nothing like picking up a box containing one of your favorite games and holding to up to light and saying \u0022I own this!\u0022 *Gotcha! Painball* was one of these games that make me proud to own, and to this day I see it as a one of the the greatest games I\u0027ve ever played. It\u0027s fast-paced, well designed, and extremely unique. Unfortunately I was going to relive my glory days with *Gotcha!* but couldn\u0027t find it in the shelf of old games. This was terrible! How could I lose such an awesome game?\n\nNow, lately I\u0027ve been a little under the weather with a pretty bad cold, so bad in fact I had to stay home from school for the first time in three years. I was feeling a nostalgic feel come the afternoon, and eventually I gave in to see if I could miraculously find *Gotcha! Paintball.* I wasn\u0027t expecting it to turn up, so I rummaged through some other games instead. An old motorcycle game of mine catches my eyes and I decide to open it. Crammed in side along with the game is the Zelda 25th anniversary soundtrack and *Gotcha! Paintball*! I put it all back and rushed to the computer to install the game.\n\n*Wow.* Even after these several years of being separated I would expect my older, wiser self to realize this game wasn\u0027t as good as it used to be. But I was wrong, and it was still as stupidly fun and outrageously intense as it always has. \n\nI would share screenshots, but I couldn\u0027t find a way to do so. So, I will have to use the power of Google images to convey the images to you all.\n\n\u003E ![cover.jpg](http://bestgamewallpapers.com/files/gotcha/cover.jpg)\n\u003E ![gotcha%201.jpg](http://media1.jex.cz/images/media1:49a10e3ebacce.jpg/gotcha%201.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gotcha-4e262a73cccd0.jpg](http://i.jeuxactus.com/datas/jeux/g/o/gotcha/xl/gotcha-4e262a73cccd0.jpg)\n\nNow for the discussion: what were some of the memorable games of your childhood? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T01:28:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thomas988**"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T13:13:03Z","Content":"Never heard of that game, but I went real paintballing once.
