The problem is that with this I can\\\u0027t build a shell for the top part as there\\\u0027s nothing to attach it to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Control Winglets only work in the atmosphere right? And when trying on some they only made it worse for some reason. I only have one SAS which is ontop of the command module. The radial liquid boosters, should it be the ones with the exhaust pointed out (Retro Booster) or the one pointing down (Liquid Booster). How will these boosters help me get more control and should I have SAS turned on with them on? Also in space when I\\\u0027m at my third stage my rocket becomes really unstable in space, it breaks off the SAS, is slow to turn and can\\\u0027t hold course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
