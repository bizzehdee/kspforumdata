No VAB breaks and stuff and I run it from my downloads folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It seems to me that many of the MJ problems posted have a bit to do with certain other mods in addition to MJ\u0027s weak areas. I really only use the Ascend, Orbital information, rendezvous, docking and landing functions. My most common problem is getting within 100 meters to select a docking port but that is probably because I do not properly set my orbits but just launch when I want to. The twitchy/stability issues seem to come when MJ and the new reaction wheel/input \u0027set\u0027 period are interacting. MJ is either \u0027on or off\u0027 while the reaction wheel SAS has a period after keyboard input (which is how the .21 setup will interpret MJ commands) to determine what headings you want it to hold. Pre .21 when MJ turned \u0027off\u0027 the capsule SAS was immediately applied. Now there seems to be a period of reduced control.

From the mechjeb tab there should be a \u0022docking autopilot\u0022 window you can open. Before activating docking autopilot, first rightclick the docking port on the active vehicle and select \u0022control from here\u0022 and then while the docking vehicle is active, move the view around till you can see the port on the destination craft, rightclick on that port and select \u0022set target\u0022. You are now ready to activate the docking autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Salanio","CreatedById":81936,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T16:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice reference to portal 2 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fedemotta3","CreatedById":80180,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T21:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try this.

It may become needed that rather than patched a \u0027light\u0027 version of MJ basic functions needs to be coded that works in .21 and a 2nd generation MJ be created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny, my biggest concern is that there will be game modes that do include some of the automation MJ provides and do it better, meaning I\u0027ll have to juggle more interfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad have no intention of providing MJ-style autopilot, I can\u0027t see a reason why this would break MJ at all - MJ doesn\u0027t use any built-in autopilot feature that the developers are likely to remove, just the programmatic inputs on position, velocity, orbit etc and a ton of its\u0027 own math and algorithms. Squad have huge interest in keeping the (sandbox) game as fun as possible, and I think they\u0027re unlikely to deprecate features without a path forward for all the mod users that are their fan base right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T11:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo has anyone figured out how to prevent MJ from glitching out the Map view camera?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T14:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest annoyance is how MJ bounces the throttle during maneuvers..
