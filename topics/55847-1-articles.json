So why do SQUAD make Kerbal engineers and scientist in the VAB work in such an unsafe workplace. Rockets at either too low making them a head bumping hight risk, helmets do not seem to be available for these guys or too high and thus creating a falling from heights risk, no fall restraints available either. I also think that high visibility work attire should be made available for the VAB work crew to reduce the risk of being taken out by the drifting vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the safety of the hard working Kerbal engineers and scientist who get no glory. Could all the Construction coordinators (gamers) please place any and all rockets under construction at a safe working height.
