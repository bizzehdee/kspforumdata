Engines in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere will perform similarly to in Kerbin\u0027s. You can calculate the TWR if you know the acceleration due to gravity (Anything slightly above 1 on Kerbin would be excellent on Laythe). The gravity turn I would ballpark at around 7km based on the height of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere relative to Kerbin\u0027s.
