As sal\\_vager said, for us who search for more realism there is still option to install whatever version of FAR will be called in future. But what they should adopt is new voxelization system that solves a lot of issues, is some part cliped or not, only partly cliped, does some other part in front of airstrem protect part behind it etc.\n\nAlso collaboration with ferram could alow him to easier maintain his mod, whole KSP project and comunity could benefit from this. Why SQUAD still refuse to collaborate with ferram even when he offered support is mistery to all of us.\n\nI doubt that money is issue, more likely it is stubbornness of some key SQUAD members.\n\nWell, we only play this game, don\u0027t know if we are allowed to criticise SQUAD decision.

Simple shapes, such as command pods and streamlined rockets without protruding parts, should have reasonable terminal velocities. After the baseline has been set, everything else should be built around it.\n\nSome problems are likely to remain even after the tweaks. Part clipping can still produce unpredictable and/or unreasonable results. Low-speed gliding will remain due to powerful reaction wheels and the way stalling has been implemented.

That, and i actually liked the challenge of 1.0\u0027s reentry heat, with a thinner atmo, it actually took some skill to aerobrake/whatnot, and heat shields made a difference, unlike now. 1.0.2 still far exceeds 0.90, but i feel it wasnt quite as good as 1.0, an update that was far more tested, and was actually balanced pretty well when it comes to engine ISP, performance, thrust, ect. Now its even harder to get into orbit, and with the all around ISP nerfs it makes it even harder to go interplanetary.\n\nWhile im goingt o admit, im not happy that most of my interplanetary SSTOs are dead and will never return, i accept that, and i started making new designs. But now that its incredibly hard to achieve orbit in a SSTo that has enough dV to do a laythe roundtrip, and 1.0.2 just ruined my laythe roundtrip SSTO at that, i just dont like the fact that they keep increasing drag. Less drag gives a better feel, more fun, higher speeds, and lets you have a little less super efficient designs that can get to orbit. \n\nI think KSP should stick to what is deemed more fun. For those that care about 100% realism (not that u ever get 100% but thats beside the point), there are mods: FAR, RO, ect. KSP was never intended to be a 100% real world simulator, and i sure hope it doesnt become one. I enjoy to make realistic craft on occasion, and i like that under new aero they act as you would expect, but i also enjoy making sci-fi whackjob designs, and i see no reason why they should be impossible to make anymore without resorting to cheats and debug menus."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:39:57Z","Content":"I get the feeling it is more like;\n\nBehaviour is unexpected \u003E tune existing simulation params to approximate desired solution \u003E start coding simulation changes/extensions required to correctly implement solution\n\nSo what we\u0027re seeing is the best interim approximation of the intended solution possible until the necessary code is in place to offer the desired solution"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:16:55Z","Content":"That makes sense to me, NoMrBond."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:06:57Z","Content":"I had been waiting for a long time for Squad to finally update the aerodynamics.

I am figuratively blown away with what they did. Sure there are some bugs, but the stock aerodynamics in KSP 1.0 are the best aerodynamics I have ever used in any game. They are fairly realistic and easy to use, and the system just feels like it fits with the simplicity of the rest of the game.\n\nI\u0027m all for suggestions on how to iron out some of the kinks, but please don\u0027t even start to suggest that there is something wrong with KSP aerodynamics as a whole.\n\nIf you\u0027re struggling to make your space program work with the current aerodynamics, try discussing it with someone. You might be experiencing a bug, or perhaps you need help with your strategies. Maybe you\u0027re too used to the old system and old habits are kicking your ass. There\u0027s many possibilities.

Most of the posts I have read about the aero model, it seems the same few people are complaining, and a bunch say it is good the way it is now in 1.0.2 and then there is a slightly larger group who say it is good and just needs some fine tuning. I am in the fine tuning camp and I don\u0027t even think the aero really needs much tweaking. I think the drag models of some parts and the re-entry heating need more tuning than the aero at this point. But these are small changes and with Squad already saying they are working hard on a 1.1 update, I believe we will see these changes and a few other tweaks no one is even thinking about (like radiators so they can re-implement the heating from drilling for ore). Right now I am just having fun playing the game, just like I have with every release since I started playing back in .19, running into a few bugs here and there and installing mods until my hearts content. \n\nAlso it might help for some people to remember you are dealing with an indie company that is quite small and is self publishing this game.
