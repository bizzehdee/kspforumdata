Mars is in many ways like an average of the Earth and the Moon. So if you want to test Mars-bound spacecraft elements, it would be orders of magnitude cheaper to just test them on the Earth rather than the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why a Moon mission could be relatively cheap is because it takes a very short time, a few days up to a couple of weeks. A Mars mission has to be much longer and that\u0027s why it needs many other spacecraft elements like a transit habitat and a surface habitat. But a long Moon mission, like a permanently staffed Moon base, would do away with that advantage and become probably just as expensive as a long Mars mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at the energy required to land something on the Moon vs landing the same payload on Mars. For the Moon, you need about 3.2 km/s for TLI, 1 km/s for LOI and 2 km/s for landing. Assuming LOI and landing are done with hypergolics, that means that if you wanted to land a 50-ton habitat on the Moon, you would need to bring about 300 tons to LEO. For Mars, you need about 3.6 km/s for TMI, a heat shield to aerobrake at Mars, and about 1 km/s for landing. So to land a 50-ton habitat on Mars, you would need to bring about 250 tons to LEO. So it\u0027s not really cheaper to get something to the Moon than to get it to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturning from the Moon is much easier than returning from Mars, but Mars has the advantage of being able to make the ascent propellant through ISRU relatively easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moon does have the advantage that it\u0027s closer, so that means it\u0027s safer with more abort possibilities. But lunar habitats need to be more complex in order to survive the harsher conditions on the Moon, and possibly more supplies needed since less can be made through ISRU (water, O2). The Moon might have some water deposits, but only in specific places at the poles and it\u0027s not really know if they actually exist. Mars is known to have subsurface ice almost everywhere on the entire surface, as well as an atmosphere available from anywhere on Mars (CO2 can be made into propellant and oxygen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s not really clear that having a crewed Moon base would be cheaper than a Mars base. On top of that, humans don\u0027t bring as much to the table on the Moon as they do on Mars. A robotic lunar base might be cost-efficient, and can be operated from Earth because of the very small light lag, but the same can\u0027t be done on Mars, so humans actually being there and making real-time decisions brings a lot more to the table in terms of science and exploration potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T20:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour bitcoin?

It simply is not possible with current technology to send that much infrastructure (or the infrastructure to build that infrastructure). It\u0027s a dream that is centuries away in the future. I\u0027d also suspect that it\u0027s a sort of romantic science fiction dream as a way to relive US history (a sort of new Wild West founded by space homesteaders...).

It would only support a small number of astronauts at first, from 4 to maybe 10. So whether we go the Moon or to Mars, if we want anything more than \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 we will first need to build the logistics to support a long duration outpost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I support building a lunar infrastructure.

If you put a momentum exchange tether in LEO, you can use it to accelerate ships from suborbital to orbital trajectories, making spacelaunch much cheaper. The issue is that the orbit of the tether decays every time you do that. A good way to restore it without sending rocket fuel from the ground (which would make the whole thing less efficient than normal multistage rockets) is to use the tether to slow down stuff to suborbital speeds, stuff like old satellites, manned capsules, or rocks launched from the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do that, you would need a mass driver on the moon, sending rocks or bags of dust on an intercept trajectory. Because the moon doesn\u0027t have an atmosphere, many things that wouldn\u0027t work on Earth are possible, from maglevs to stupidly large trebuchets. Rotovators are a seductive option, since there are the same technology as the momentum exchange tether in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever system you choose to send mass towards earth, it will likely need regular maintenance, a domain where humans are still far superior to telepresence.
