The Mk3, a refuel/tow truck, the Mk4, a mobile science lab, and the Mk6, a science/mining rig. Any feedback is welcome! All downloads can be found on my KerbalX page, [**http://kerbalx.com/Mega\\_Dunsparce/craft**](http://kerbalx.com/Mega_Dunsparce/craft). \n\nFirst off, here\u0027s a pic of each vehicle:\n\nE-USC 3:\n\n![M61mmd9.png](http://i.imgur.com/M61mmd9.png)\n\nE-USC 4:\n\n![LgGoZce.png](http://i.imgur.com/LgGoZce.png)\n\nE-USC 6:\n\n![5ABvo00.png](http://i.imgur.com/5ABvo00.png)\n\nSo, let\u0027s start with a rundown of the E-USC 3. This is the machine that I use to both refuel and tow vehicles. Although small, it has the ability to pull very heavy loads, along with 5 kerbals, very long distances, and has been invaluable to me on many different occasions. There\u0027s a variety of docking ports on the back, which allow for a multitude of different attachments, with a grabber claw being standard issue on every Transport Truck. I prefer grabbers over docking, as they allow for pivoting, which is vital for maneuverability.\n\n![9BpFwQU.png](http://i.imgur.com/9BpFwQU.png)\n\nLet\u0027s demonstrate its towing ability by starting small with a 30-ton dropship, because what better way to test the E-USC 3 than with an E-USC 2?\n\n![ljRFVeU.png](http://i.imgur.com/ljRFVeU.png)\n\nThe E-USC 2 is no match for the E-USC 3, and the Truck pulls it 1km downrange with ease. Victory!\n\n![4XgGDi1.png](http://i.imgur.com/4XgGDi1.png)\n\n**E-USC 3 STRENGTH TEST:**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ghFlSMX.webm\n\n**http://i.imgur.com/ghFlSMX.webm**\n\nThe Transport Truck, being made entirely of wing surfaces and structural supports, is virtually indestructible. I threw it off the VAB during early testing and was still be able to drive it away. In this test, a fully loaded 40t E-USC 6 travelling at 25m/s leaves it very much unscathed. The E-USC 3 also has a trailer attatchement! like the Truck itself, the trailer is also pretty much indestructible. It\u0027s a separate vehicle and can, to an extent, steer itself. To attach it to the Truck, just raise the trailer legs and position the truck underneath. Just be sure to disable the steering of the back wheels of the Truck, as the new center of the vehicle messes up it\u0027s all-wheel steering.\n\n![0cKECpZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/0cKECpZ.png)\n\nTowing example #2: 40t of refueling trailer!\n\n![KklXqlG.png](http://i.imgur.com/KklXqlG.png)\n\n![JtB64Ht.png](http://i.imgur.com/JtB64Ht.png)\n\n![Uc5GcLx.png](http://i.imgur.com/Uc5GcLx.png)\n\nMoving on, here\u0027s the E-USC 4 \u0022Sciencemobile\u0022! This was the E-USC line\u0027s first ground-only (discluding the abort system) vehicle. The E-USC 4 is designed to be an ultra-versatile/modular mobile science base, with room for up to 7 Kerbals. Complete with a science lab and just about every piece of equipment available, The E-USC 4 can handle the terrain of just about any planet. Much of the E-USC 4\u0027s systems, such as batteries, landing wheels, and fuel cells, are hidden under the wheel shielding. Its 8 wheels grant it an unboosted top speed of 25m/s, and no rolling, as long as you don\u0027t force it.\n\n![3es0hVh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3es0hVh.jpg)\n\nIn the event of battery depletion, the E-USC 4 grows wings, but it can easily travel 8km before needing to recharge for about 30 seconds. Also, on the rear axel is room for two \u0027pods\u0027 - for this showcase, I\u0027m using 2 Science Jr.\u0027s, with small engines for extra speed. They can quickly be replaced with rovers, planes, and equipment, amongst other crap. These Science Jr.\u0027s detach with decouplers.\n\n![Dr00aw0.png](http://i.imgur.com/Dr00aw0.png)\n\n![90T4GY4.png](http://i.imgur.com/90T4GY4.png)\n\n**E-USC 4 \u0022Sciencemobile\u0022 ABORT/RETROFIRE TEST**\n\n[**http://i.imgur.com/7LgVSUT.webm**](http://i.imgur.com/7LgVSUT.webm)\n\nThis is an demonstration of the E-USC 4 Abort System, Similar to E-USC 2\u0027s. Its actual purpose is to act much like a Soyuz capsule\u0027s retrothrusters - when landing on a planet such as Duna, this system is designed to slow the craft down just before touchdown. It can also be used as an Mission Abort System if you run off, say, a low cliff. The landing wheels are used to, well, land on. It should probably also be mentioned that the back docking port of the Sciencemobile allows for many bigger external objects to be added, like this mining rig.\n\n![BfkKwf8.png](http://i.imgur.com/BfkKwf8.png)\n\n![D6gs3Jn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D6gs3Jn.jpg)\n\n![WoTopsf.png](http://i.imgur.com/WoTopsf.png)\n\nLast but lot least, let\u0027s move on to the E-USC 4\u0027s bigger brother, the E-USC 6 \u0022Sciencemobile Jr.\u0022 The Jr. is the spiritual successor of the original E-USC 4, and improves on its design in almost every way. Based off the E-USC 4, it too has room for up to 7 Kerbals, a science lab, and a plethora of scientific equipment. But the E-USC 6 has 16 wheels and a higher chassis, a giant ore depository, and 2 drills. The Sciencemobile Jr. is equipped for every environment in the solar system and *then* some; So, With Harbur at the wheel and Val in the crows nest, the Sciencemobile Jr. sets off on a 16km maiden voyage. With so many wheels to share the load, the Sciencemobile Jr. glides over terrain like it\u0027s not even there - it also makes a broken wheel much less perilous. The ground clearance is about 3 meters, too.\n\n![vixLTCI.png](http://i.imgur.com/vixLTCI.png)\n\nIn the entire evolution and development of this vehicle, I only crashed ONCE, and that was a staging mishap. The reason it\u0027s so stable is my new steering arrangement: At launch, 4 of the inner back wheels steering is disabled. This makes the Jr. slower to turn, but impossible to tip at any speed. Pressing 1 enables all-wheel steering, which is perfect for tricky maneuvers below 19m/s. The Jr. also has, IIRC, double the battery capacity - one battery located under every 2 wheels grants 3605 units of electricity available. Always remember to disable one for when you run out, so you can open the solar arrays! \n\n![xPXMmFD.png](http://i.imgur.com/xPXMmFD.png)\n\nIt also carries 655 units of liquid fuel, 600 units of oxidizer, and a lifetime supply of snacks. Gone are the days of hauling a trailer with you - take them everywhere! It should also be noted that under each wheel nacelle is a small engine, which allows the entire Sciencemobile Jr. 1m30s (500m/s DV) of flight time on smaller planets. Above the drills is a parcel shelf, designed for smaller vehicles to be towed.\n\n![qEmSfPy.png](http://i.imgur.com/qEmSfPy.png)\n\nLike this tiny Munar lander!\n\n![TBbgsiP.png](http://i.imgur.com/TBbgsiP.png)\n\n**E-USC 6 \u0022Sciencemobile Jr.\u0022 ABORT TEST**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JNW33ee.webm\n\n**http://i.imgur.com/JNW33ee.webm**\n\nBecause E-USC 4\u0027s center of mass never changed, it meant the entire vehicle could be lifted up, and land heavily on 4 aircraft wheels. The abort thrusters could also be used as retrothrusters and slow down a fall, too, which was nice. But lifting the entire E-USC 6 was not an option, as it was far too big, and because of its ore barrel and cargo shelf, the C.O.M shifted drastically every trip. So, Just abort the Cuploa instead! The abort module is it\u0027s own little ship, and has 2m51s of thrust-limited burn time thanks to its two engines, so you can get even further away on a smaller planetary body.\n\n![wF4yRHv.png](http://i.imgur.com/wF4yRHv.png)\n\n![q0YLEqm.png](http://i.imgur.com/q0YLEqm.png)\n\n**THANKS FOR LOOKING!**\n\nI hope you enjoyed the showcase as much as I enjoyed making the craft.
