Like this:\n\n![iVkZkE2m.png](http://i.imgur.com/iVkZkE2m.png)\n\nAlthough when it is in GIMP it has the checkered transparency over it. Is there a way to \u0022pull\u0022 the texture from underneath?

I was able to copy both the color layer and the specular layer to another GIMP file, edited both as I pleased, then applied the spec layer as a mask. It seems to be working fine, and looks good in game, so I think I\u0027ve figured it out. I just need to figure out the animation rotation issue from my other thread, do some more cfg tweaking and balancing and then my parts should be ready to go ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Vtols are hard haha.."}]}
