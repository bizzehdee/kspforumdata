The original switch to LH2/LOX reduced that value quite significantly: The lower weight allowed a more aggressive, more efficient ascent profile, but the reduction in total Delta-V more than made up for it. Adding an extra fuel tank got the delta-V almost back up to the original value, and was still quite lightweight compared to its original design weight. It also needed only about 600 units of LH2 to climb to speed and altitude. Really more like 500, but I tend to be a bit conservative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new version it blows through that 600 unit allocation at right about 10000 meters.

It\u0027s just a differing philosophy of what RealFuels should be I suppose. On the one hand, there\u0027s maximal realism: assign everything a real-world counterpart. My take on it is that different fuels are exciting inasmuch as they impact the vehicle design. You can\u0027t just swap your tanks from LiquidFuel to LiquidH2 - it takes an entirely different vehicle to account for the volumetric energy density. Likewise it would be very Kerbal to have fluorine/pentaborane configs with high Isp but significant chance of going up in a green fireball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the differences in density and Isp between RP-1/H2O2 and RP-1/N2O4 is about 1%. There would be design considerations in a real rocket, but nothing we can model in KSP. Where it doesn\u0027t change gameplay, why not be parsimonious with the number of named resources?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differences between the hydrazine blends are a middle ground - on the order of 10%. That\u0027s more reason for a division, but I\u0027d argue still not one that changes designs in a big way.

The 1960/2940 kN it\u0027s supposed to be capable of would be SERIOUSLY overpowered, if it didn\u0027t just flat out break things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0027problem\u0027 is mainly that the fuel consumption roughly QUADRUPLED going from MFS 1.3 to MFSc 1a. I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t clearer about this, but I pulled those numbers by changing the ratios in the .cfg file with everything else being v1a standard. The original MFS used 13/87 as the LH2/IA ratio on the Sabres, and changing it to the 37.7/62.3 from v1a (roughly tripling the LH2 side of the ratio) quadruples the fuel use, with all else being equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, my personal suspicion is it\u0027s one of those cases where so much else about the engine varies from reality that it\u0027s hard to use any of the \u0027realistic\u0027 numbers, especially given the fact the entire game\u0027s scaled down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious as to where you got that \u002723 to 1\u0027 number from, because when I was poking around their site they listed a fuel/air ratio of 0.08 (or roughly 1 LH2 per 12.5 air). They don\u0027t specify how they arrived at that, but when talking about the LACE further up the same paper they mention the stoichiometric ratio being 0.029, which according to some other stuff I found is actually a rounded-off version of the stoichiometric ratio for hydrogen/air by mass. From what I can tell from the paper, it uses more fuel than air because they use up some of the LH2 cooling the intake air and powering the turbocompressor for it, although less than a LACE did. And it sounds like they shove that excess hydrogen into the outer part of the engine and burn it in that outer-ring bit, which is supposed to be some kind of weird pseudo-ramjet or something. Or somesuch. I\u0027m just a computer tech, I\u0027m learning this crap as I go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ooo. One thing is certainly much better in v2. The folders are much cleaner! I only had to remove one \u0027source\u0027 folder, it took like maybe 10-20% as long to get it installed as a result. Kudos!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Fuel use on Sabre-M now about 2.09/s in air-breathing mode with v2 setup. let me just quickly pull FAR out and try it to see what that does...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit3: Not a bloody thing.
