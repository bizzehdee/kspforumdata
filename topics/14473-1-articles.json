Space Ration Bars are a hearty mixture of Pinto and Black Beans, wrapped in a crust of reconstituted freeze-dried bread.

And I must say, he solved the problem briliantly. Chef Kerman discovered that Kerbals have a natural resitance to salt, so the only thing making seawater inedible was rocket debris. He developed the world\\\u0027s first sieve and used it to strain the seawater, which he know sells at the Speak-Easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPangalactic Gargle-Blaster: For those kerbalnauts with stronger stomachs and fatter wallets, there\\\u0027s the Pangalactic Gargle-Blaster.
