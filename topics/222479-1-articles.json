After nearly 2 weeks, KSP2 usage has dropped to the level of KSP1. The rate at which the stats drop seems the same\u2014if not steeper\u2014as when after EA release the game had a similar number of recorded players (early March). It\u0027s tempting to blame the holiday season for that, but with more time available player count tends to go \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E and the KSP1 stats confirm that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, assuming the numbers don\u0027t lie and are indicative of the popularity of the game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA lot of players have downloaded KSP2.

Yup, sure does it\u0027s not even remotely perfect, but KSP 1 wasn\u0027t either. It was a decade long grand adventure to build KSP in to what 1.12.5 became. It was a long hard road full of challenges and set backs but KSP 1 became one of the single greatest space games ever made and I believe KSP 2 can and is shooting for the stars in the same way and doing just fine after the last update. If they can hit the next milestones (reasonably quick, that being once a quarter or so) then I think in a year after several major updates where we\u0027re building colonies and slinging ships in to interstellar space without the smack in the face that is broken modded builds... it\u0027ll become even more captivating than KSP 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-03T14:08:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2024 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 3\u0022\u003EJanuary 3\u003C/time\u003E by RayneCloud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-03T19:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224354678\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704121297\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/1/2024 at 7:01 AM, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcharts.com/cmp/220200,954850#1m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Steam Charts\u003C/a\u003E tell a more sobering story.

You may chose to spend a play session running fund rewarding missions because you\u0027re saving up for a Jool mission mothership that needs a lotta expensive engines or a lot of launches for all the parts and fuel. You might be doing a low tech mun rush because you want to knock a bunch of early science out to avoid boring contracts. Whats important and compelling about the system is that you have options, many of them, at any point. Don\u0027t wanna run fund missions right now? Maybe you can scrap the jool mothership and do a probe flyby mission instead. Feeling a bit bored of mystery goo returns? You can throw a science lab in orbit, maybe take a space station contract for it and build out some permanent trickle of science off the back of processing basic experiments, and get paid for it to cover a cool mission somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, your only real choice in KSP2 is to take the same couple science parts to the same places, unlocking a fairly straight forward track. There\u0027s not really any alternative progression systems, nothing else for you to do if the next minmus biome sounds a bit boring right now - so you just don\u0027t play KSP2 tonight, and that break is usually the death of a save for most people in most games \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, its not because of some critical crippling failure of the game, the other stuffs just straight up not in yet.

Colonies without resources are simply a creative base building system: really fun the first two times, but not gonna hold water on its own as they\u0027ll simply be set dressing until they can do something more than launch free ships. Interstellar has the same problem, it on paper opens up a huge range of new spaces and ways for you to just run science experiments again.

What hope would anyone have for anything further, specially when the devs themselves don\u0027t even have what it takes to make a single promise about it? At least people are clearly getting bored of the main progression system after a couple weeks, that\u0027s enough of a message for themselves and the dev team, I\u0027d hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to use the word lazy, because (to paraphrase Oddball), \u201Cthose are, like, negative vibes, bro.\u201D The streamlining is not a bad thing as it takes some of the drudgery out of science, but unless we see an expansion in the future it certainly feels minimalist. I liked the Breaking Ground science where you set up a seismometer and then slam something into the surface. I was hoping for more of that. A sentinel and a DART mission, orbital surveys to find monuments, that mind of stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s hope that colonies will bring some truly new things to the table.
