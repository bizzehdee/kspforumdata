I couldn\u0027t figure out how to attach the rover within the stack of the ship, so I strapped two of them in symmetry to the sides of the lander. Then I couldn\u0027t figure out a way to launch them without them both crashing face first into Minmus and breaking or flipping over. So I made two detachable ramp systems and put them under the rovers curved outwards so that when I decoupled the rovers they slid right down the rails and landed perfectly wheels down on the surface. Then when it was done I could detach the ramps and all that remained was the core of my science base I was making. The game lagged like crazy, but I got it up in one glorious launch and it landed perfectly. I used F5 and F9 over and over again on the surface just to watch my rovers deploy and everything come online. So very proud of that thing. It would never ever work in the new aero...it would be like flying with deployed airbrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the feeling afterwards of realizing that the surface gravity was super low and my rovers didn\u0027t have enough traction to even work on the surface.
