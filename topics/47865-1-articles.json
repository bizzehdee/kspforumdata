Usually after 3 hours late one night I\u0027ll be doing some mundane task and realize \u0027Eureka! Why didn\u0027t I just do this instead!\u0027 So here are some scenarios where I know some of you veterans have developed easy tricks to make things like hauling station fuel a little less tedious. (I run bone stock, no MechJeb or anything).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) When I currently rendezvous with my target for docking, I use a slightly eccentric orbit with an apoapsis above my target\u0027s apoapsis and a periapsis just below or at the targets. Then near my periapsis I just burn retrograde near an intersect to match orbits. The problem; It takes many time-sped orbits to get a close intersect, and the more eccentric the orbit, the greater dV needed. I have seen tutorials that recommend something along these lines: First set your orbit concentric and slightly \u0027lower\u0027 than the target\u0027s orbit. Time warp a few orbits until you are close. Use a manuever node to burn prograde and then move this node along your orbit until you get a close intersect. Is this a better way? I find that when the orbits are only 10 km apart, say you\u0027re in LKO (70km) and the target is 80km, it takes a very long time for the two objects to intersect if you were sloppy with your launch time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any tricks? I\u0027ve recently started moving my parking orbits higher and higher to give me more wiggle room. Are two concentric orbits best to burn up to the target orbit, or better to burn down to the orbit? Eccentric orbits work? I understand there is no one best case, just some chatter on the subject would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When I am in the same orbit, and am closing with RCS thrusters is there a way to orientate the ship so that the WASD keys correlate to up, down, left, right translation on the screen? With unmanned control modules there is no cockpit view or is there? I find myself, as I close in on the docking point, moving the camera to the \u0022Chase view\u0022 (which doesn\u0027t get the rotation right?) and using Q or E to rotate the ship so that W, up, translation is up on screen. If I get this right, I can usually dock in 5 minutes from say 70m out. Is there something easy I\u0027m overlooking here? perhaps using the navball horizon? (I just thought of that as I sit at work dreaming about KSP). Also say for whatever reason you can\u0027t have a cockpit view (unmanned), and you can\u0027t orient your camera so that up correlates to W (station is tilted and you are trying to match alignments), is there an easier way than tilting your head at crazy angles or chanting \u0022up is left, up is left, up is left\u0022 as you attempt to close the last 10 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Lastly, what are the best methods for building in space? For example, I am currently building a fuel depot in a high orbit. My course of action is to build the light weight girders with nothing more than docking ports, lights, batteries, panels and some RCS. I\u0027ll blast this giant, oversized, but lightweight rigging into space. Then I\u0027ll drag a large fuel tank up one at a time and dock them into a docking port on the rig. Is there a way to join multiple assemblies together using a method other than docking ports? Can a Kerbal get out and \u0027fasten\u0027 items? I guess my question is simply, are docking ports the only way to join parts outside of the vehicle hangars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T11:08:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Turnip\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T22:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) The amount of time it takes you to orbit once depends on the semi-major axis (1/2 of the long axis) of your orbit. Doesn\u0027t matter if the orbit is circular or not; if two orbits have the same sma, they\u0027ll have the same period. If you\u0027ve matched orbits and your target is behind you, you want to orbit slower so it can catch up, so you raise one side of your orbit. The farther you raise it, the slower you go and the more quickly it\u0027ll catch up. Likewise, if your target is in front of you, you want to lower your orbit so you\u0027ll orbit faster and catch up. This is a good reason not to put your station at 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I know you said you\u0027re bone stock, but stock doesn\u0027t give you the right tools for docking.

If you are behind your target, your overall orbit needs to be lower so that you catch up. The converse is true if you are ahead of your target. When the two are relatively close to each other, at that point you should add a manoeuvre node to your orbit and adjust it so that it intersects your target orbit. Hopefully you should get an encounter marker come up, which you can try and improve by dragging the complete manoeuvre node around your orbit to see where you get the closest encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Most people recommend using chase camera view as the view in relation to your craft remains constant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Without using mods the only way to build a structure outside the VAB or SPH is to use docking ports.

Say if my station\u0027s at 100km, orbit around 80 or so. Time shift until you\u0027re behind it by about a quarter orbit or so, and then make a maneuver node to get you touching the station\u0027s orbit. Make sure the station\u0027s your target, and you should get a \u0022nearest approach\u0022 indicator. It\u0027ll probably be far off, so drag the maneuver node around your orbit to see how close you can get. If you get a lock, use that node to burn. If you don\u0027t, take another orbit and try again. For all of this, ignore your current periapsis and apoapsis, and those of the station. They are irrelevant to getting a closest approach in this manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor docking, don\u0027t orientate yourself to the docking port. Orientate it to you. Just get close to what you want to dock to, then switch to that craft. Control its docking port and set your ship as a target, and then get it aimed at you. Turn on SAS and switch back to your ship. Bammo, the port is aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf things start rotating weirdly, hit warp for a second. Warp kills rotation.

If the trahectory isn\u0027t on the target, change your trajectory. if your ship isn\u0027t pointing on the target and/or the flight direction: turn it into the right direction \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you start ignoring the screen on docking and focus on the navball, it gets sooo much easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T08:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the navball does not show the target orientation...

There are great tidbits in many of your posts. Thank you very much, I\u0027ll try them all out tonight! I will try a few add-ons like the docking alignment. I guess I should elaborate on why I was add-on adverse. Whenever a new version rolls out and you have a collection of add-ons installed, it is very tedious to remember which you have installed, and update them. I have a saved game that wouldn\u0027t load because I went a little overboard on the add-ons and updating them all manually is a bit daunting. (This is where someone points out an add-on manager and I facepalm).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T12:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an add-on manager but I found it more trouble than it\u0027s worth.
