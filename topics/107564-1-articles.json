This happens when you place the wing with the elevon already on it sometimes. But really, pitching isn\u0027t going to be very effective near the center of mass. The tail should be pitch, the outer wing should be roll, and the vertical tail should be yaw. The inner wing can optionally be flaps."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:25:05Z","Content":"My best guess would be that since the ailerons are attached to the wing, which looks like it has its attachment center ahead of the CoM, the game is treating them as ahead of the CoM. Try moving the wing slightly back and see if it changes anything.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah this seems to happen a lot with swept wings (or diagonally placed control surfaces).

Even without the ability to fix problems like this, neglecting to specialize them usually results in over-correction. At least in the FAR model, that\u0027s a one-way ticket to the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"surge","CreatedById":136150,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:26:10Z","Content":"What seems to be happening is that the CoM comparison point on the wing the control surfaces are attached to is wrong. The point they appear to be using is the leading edge of the root of the wing. The point they should be using is the \\*trailing\\* edge of the root of the wing (or better yet, the MAC, but that would be too slow to calculate)\n\nIt becomes extremely problematic with swept wings, because the apparent difference between those 2 points is large.\n\nAs others have mentioned, moving the wing back so that the leading edge root is behind the CoM fixes it.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure this is a bug, but I\u0027m new here so I probably don\u0027t have enough \u0027clout\u0027 to make it realised. If anyone with more experience wants to test this for themselves, and then file it as a bug, please do."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:40:30Z","Content":"Try right clicking and click the invert button.

I don\u0027t remember where it is, but try putting it right behind the Center of Mass, maybe it\u0027ll change that, since it seems to be making that decision regardless of CoM position."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T19:05:47Z","Content":"OK, I\u0027ve been thinking about this. When the flap seems to be moving the wrong direction, I think it\u0027s actually moving in the right direction. It moves down, which increases the vacuum on top of the wing, which increases lift, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T19:31:42Z","Content":"Control surfaces should move in opposite directions, if they are on opposite sides of the center of mass.\n\nSee [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_%28aeronautics%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_%28aeronautics%29) for how the rear should be oriented (and why it works).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T19:42:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prepper-Jack**"}]}
