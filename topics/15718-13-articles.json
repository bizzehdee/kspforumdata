Why \u0022Release 17\u0022? Because this marks the 17th release of the Anvil rockets and it is part of my new version scheme. The \u00221.7.2\u0022 type system doesn\u0027t really tell you anything so I decided to go with a simple linear numbering. In the event of a small bug fix I will use letters; for example \u0022Release 17a\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s so great about this new release and why did it take me so long to figure it all out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Smooth shading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA staple for all designers since just about the dawn of 3D graphics. Instead of shading every edge and giving the shapes a faceted look those edges are now smoothly shaded and it produces a nice, you guessed it, smooth appearance for rounded objects. Anvil now appears to be a true cylinder and I was able to give the appearance of a more realistic rounded shape in a variety of areas; in particular the fairings. It took me a while to get it all right and learn all the little tricks to make everything show correctly. In early test parts the shading just looked like awful and, for example, when you put two fairings together they wouldn\u0027t appear to be one continuous part like they do in the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Normal Mapping\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a must for 3D designers. This gives the appearance of bumps and ridges on an otherwise flat surface. Done right you can make a very simple object look like a very complex 3D one. The trouble I had was the whole \u0022done right\u0022 part. Even now you can see that my parts are much more simple appearing than they used to and that is because I have a great deal yet to learn about normals and implementing them right. This occupied most of my trial and error time as I tried to navigate my way into this world of \u0022painting\u0022 3D features. Yeah, I know it looks really simple, and it is, but that\u0027s the cost of doing something new. You start small and work your way up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Specular Shading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis determines how shiny a material is. This was a really simple feature to implement since there are pre-set shaders that include specular highlights in the KSP part tools. It was just a matter of finding it and tweaking it to look right. Many rockets have a nice shiny paint job that makes them very glossy so this was a nice little touch that I think makes my new rocket designs pop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee below and on the opening post for full details and download links. I had plans on making a video but maybe Imagur does the job well enough... still on the fence on that one.

Even though my main energy will be spent on the First Light I suspect this project will make it out first. I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at modeling simple rocket shapes and I wont be doing any major redesigns so it should go relatively quick. The biggest pain in the rear will be all the different payload fairings and that\u0027s just because it\u0027s so tedious. Blah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDune Raider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork has also already started on refreshing the wheels of the Dune Raider. I am adding knobby tires and smooth shading to make them extra sweet looking. That\u0027s the easy part. I also, of course, need to fix that bouncing issue and who knows how successful I will be at that. My first plan is to add simple colliders outside of the tires to act as guards. I suspect that the wheel colliders don\u0027t like being on their sides which may explain the goofy behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I am going to give the instrument panel a refresh and incorporate a normal map and emmissives. The plan is to give it a 3D look and to make the instruments glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve long planned to add a means of refueling the Dune Raider during a mission and that means a docking mechanism of some kind. I have an idea to add a custom one to the roof of the chassis which will allow the Dune Raider to drive under a refueling point and \u0022hook up\u0022. That\u0027s just brainstorming, though, so maybe it won\u0027t work out that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly on the Dune Raider I plan to add thrusters pointing in a \u0022Y\u0022 shape about the chassis. This *should* allow the Dune Raider to \u0022jump\u0022, \u0022squat\u0022 and \u0022barrel roll\u0022. Of particular interest is the \u0022barrel roll\u0022 because I hope to allow players to flip the Dune Raider back onto its wheels after a rollover.

Simply put I hate the way it looks and works now. It\u0027s not bad and I could salvage the design as is but honestly it was always a stop-gap measure to get the Dune Raider from point A to B and never an honest design effort on my part. The future Fire Hawk will be a drop ship type design (think Aliens or Halo) with the Dune Raider or other payload riding under the \u0022belly\u0022. I\u0027ve got a hundred different reference images of different designs I want to incorporate and hopefully the final product will turn out as I hope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest challenge for the new Fire Hawk will be the VTOL capabilities and the aerodynamics; neither of which I have touched before. For the VTOL I would like to design a system that relies on a single set of engines that can vector thrust where its needed; there\u0027s a few ways I think I can accomplish that. Plan B is to put in two sets of engines (one for forward thrust and one for downward thrust). Aerodynamics shouldn\u0027t be too hard to figure out but I imagine there will be a LOT of testing to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fire Hawk will stay a concept in the back of my head until I can get at least two of the above 3 projects released but I am excited and eager to get to it.

It\u0027s the same with, say, Devo\u0027s various Wayland ships. They\u0027re neat in a standalone way, but it doesn\u0027t really work if you want to integrate them into an overall gameplay scenario. It doesn\u0027t mean that I don\u0027t like them, as I also liked certain aspects of your previous concepts, but ultimately they\u0027re really only useful as \u0027toys\u0027. I\u0027d download and install them, mess around with them a little bit, but then end up deleting them because I didn\u0027t really have a use for, as a for-instance, a Dropship from \u0027Aliens\u0027, because that\u0027s all that ship can do and be. Same thing for his current \u0027Oblivion Bubbleship\u0027. It\u0027s really neat looking, and I\u0027d probably still have it installed if I wasn\u0027t having a problem with getting Infernal Robotics to work, but I wouldn\u0027t really USE it for anything.

I did it AGAIN. The latest iteration of the First Light just wasn\u0027t coming together. The detail features I was adding just weren\u0027t looking like they belonged and the whole ship seemed cobbled together.

Pictures soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to complete one module a week but I missed my target last week. In part I was enjoying the Labor Day weekend but more significantly is the fact I had to redesign the KEG. It\u0027s an old story: I finished it and suddenly hated it once I attached it to the side of the fuel tank module. Also part of that old story is the fact it wasn\u0027t a bad design. It just didn\u0027t work with the rest of the ship. Another issue I ran into just today was that the latest Unity build hates the way KSP does emissive textures and, in fact, doesn\u0027t work without some back door config work. I was lucky to find a post on these forums that explained how to make it work and you can see the results of my tests in the image gallery below. I tested the fix on one engine and not the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough with the typing. Time for some screen shots. I\u0027ve added pictures from the KEG static tests to the album you\u0027ve already seen in the previous pages. What do you think of the engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/f20XT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
