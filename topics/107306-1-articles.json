With different mix ups of 5-2 main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of the crafts i design are \u0022Shuttle like\u0022 Meaning I have the main engines on a SpacePlane setup, but most of the fuel on an external tank that is to the SIDE of the craft. All the designs have multiple main engines that need to drain fuel from the external tank, then from inside the craft once the external tank is dropped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I am continuously having is some of the fuel on only ONE SIDE of the ship is being used at the same time as the external tank. Thus resulting in my craft having less than optimal Delta-V on the SpacePlane once the external tank is dropped. On top of this problem is the issue of having fuel only being drain on only one side of the SpacePlanes tanks. Not even both symetrical sides are being drained, only one side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already checked and double checked my fuel ducts and they all seem in order. The Side tanks on my SpacePlanes are slightly part clipped in with symmetry, so they SHOULD have the same precedence. But in every design only one side will be used at the start of the flight, thus taking precedence over the Main external tank, even though I have fuel ducts running from the External tank, to the side tanks of the SpacePlane. In a few of my other designs that also ran into problems i mixed it up with a single middle median tank between the external tank and my side tanks, that then has fuel ducts going to the two sides of my space plane, and i still get fuel draining from the side tanks along with the median tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done designs like this before in older patches, but only now I am running into trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me also clarify that the engines I\u0027m using are not jet engines, and I am making a vertical take off system on the runway, in-case the fuel logic system takes craft orientation into account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you post some screenshots of your craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some links to pictures i just got up.
