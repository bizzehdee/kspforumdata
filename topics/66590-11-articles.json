Then there is no need to store waste liquids or use energy heating waste. Waste mass \u0060just hanging around\u0060 is something you should not have on a spacecraft. Keeping the usable water within the area heated for the kerbals will keep it liquid and also provide some thermal buffering in case of \u0060issues\u0060. this will have the benefit that the area to be heated has a lower relative surface area (than many smaller parts) so efficiency is increased and energy requirements are minimised. Keeping the water in a jacket *around* the kerbals living area will reduce their exposure to radiation too. This should reduce the external piping which requires heating to a minimum. Also ice expands and can break stuff so letting liquids freeze and melt can kill you unless there is a lot of thought gone into the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the only water storage is built into the pod, no heating of waste, the benefits of recycling of nutrients and water, and some fresh food every now and then...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say you only really need the processing unit in the utility ring although I would build that into the pod also to reduce the distance for waste to travel, pipes heated and energy usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best heated area you have is the one with the carbon units in it so as much \u0060equipment that should stay warm\u0060 should be within the volume heated for them as possible.

PC is semi-alive and version 0.75 is due to be released soon! This is mainly an aesthetic update to give me a good platform to develop the TAC pack on, especially considering i\u0027ve learnt so much since starting, and a lot of the parts needed to be remade. In particular, the new quadcore has gone down to 220 tris and a 128px texture map (an equal 1\\4 of the old ones stats); and the octo has been halved in polycount, and quartered in texture resolution. Looks sharper too, and has less UV distortion. They actually look like stock parts now, which is a big plus! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/32gFwcO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002232gFwcO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso scrubbed up everything else, added the new door mechanisms and structure, gave the EVA-X a flag toggle option, made the Science bay interior mesh optional, tightened up the collision meshes to prepare for better FAR support (may blow up crafts, be warned), added spawning \u0022clamps\u0022 on the cores, and added new parts!
