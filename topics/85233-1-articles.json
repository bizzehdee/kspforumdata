And if you transport, do you store in orbital fuel stations or do you use other means?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I just was thinking whether it was possible to make untweakable stuff (I know, Karbonite is tweakable, but what are cfg files for?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) \u0022storable\u0022 at the KSC or other bases (if you have them). My idea was going like this: You have no resources of let\u0027s say Karbonite (or Kethane or whatever you use) at your space center, so when building vessels you can\u0027t fill tanks with it. But you can then mine it, fill tanks with it, bring them back to the space center and from then on have this amount to use during building. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t put much thought in this as of right now, it was just a spontaneous idea.

Put a Karbonite converter/storage/whathaveyou rover near the launchpad (and another near the runway).

You might want to edit kethane or karbonite to make sure you have either of them at the launchpad just in case, otherwise it\u0027s a game over. I\u0027m not sure how that\u0027s done. Kethane saves the grid definition in the savefile, but I\u0027m not sure how to edit it so the hexagon containing the KSC has Kethane.

Land, convert (or use Karbonite engines), move the final product to your orbital station. So less about base building and more about where you want to put a 2-ton part (though we have some smaller ones coming out in 1.25m and 0.625m form factors). So really, there\u0027s no need for only having one landing spot. And Karbonite does run out given it\u0027s concentration based not deposit based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut RE your original idea, Karbonite works and has a pretty nice engine assortment to go with it in (radial and stack jets, engines in 0.625 1.25 and 2.5, and the sweet propfans everyone seems to love). Kethane also works though I can\u0027t recall it\u0027s engine assortment.
