This has to be done in a scene where the button is enabled, such as the spaceport scene. This reloads the textures and everything shows up fine again, until the next restart, then I have to repeat the process.\n\nI have stock KSP installed through Steam on a secondary drive. Steam is also installed on this secondary drive."},{"CreatedByName":"Silverfishstix","CreatedById":141084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:50:06Z","Content":"Well, thanks for the help sumghai and puhnitor! By looking through texture files, I remembered that I had Active Texture Management installed. It appears that it breaks the textures of a lot of parts, and should be uninstalled. Once again, thank y\u0027all for the help!"}]}
