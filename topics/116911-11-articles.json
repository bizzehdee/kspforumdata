I feel like there\u0027s no way that the scrubs with low end computers like me can run that at a decent framerate...\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t have any issues at all. I test my mod/parts on my good \u0027ol Samsung laptop from 2009, and do the modelling/texturing/Unity stuff on my high end computer. I\u0027ve made sure that all parts in the mod are as low poly as possible and don\u0027t go above 1024x unless absolutely necessary. So far I am not having any RAM or lag issues when testing the mod on my ancient relic of a laptop ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) This mod is not even close to as demanding as mods like FASA and Chaka Monkey, so basically everyone with a PC should be good to go.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nJust a heads up: Each finished/updated launch vehicle will start to go live (fancy way of saying \u0022getting a download button\u0022) throughout the day. I\u0027ve finished the update, and now I just need to pack every thing up and check for any last minute changes.\n\nIt occured to me that maybe not everyone wants every single launch vehicle, or maybe only need one or two of them for something specific in the game. So I decided to split the download into separate downloads, in addition to the \u0022full pack\u0022 from KerbalStuff. This way people wont have to download the entire thing and then start deleting the launchers they dont need/want.\n\nSounds good? Ok then, let\u0027s start getting you guys these shiny new rockets ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Woah!

Every engine in this pack that has a extendable nozzle skirt will have its skirt auto-extend once the engine is ignited.

The ME configuration has better overall performance as it utilizes the Vinci upper stage engine instead of the HM7-B upper stage engine. It also uses a 8 meter Sylda instead of the old 5-ish meter one, in addition to a 20m fairing instead of a 17m fairing. This will allow you guys to launch much bigger and heavier dual payloads, and in all honesty looks a heck of a lot better than the ECA configuration.\n\n![Ariane_5_ME_configuration_large.jpg](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2011/06/ariane_5_me_configuration/9639903-3-eng-GB/Ariane_5_ME_configuration_large.jpg)\n\nCheck this [link](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Adapted_Ariane_5_ME) for more information on the Ariane 5 ME.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T11:25:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype**"},{"CreatedByName":"mark7","CreatedById":143108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T12:56:59Z","Content":"So,is it okay to release tomorrow\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C5\u00B8Not pushing u ,just it seems that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153m gonna have another week away from my laptop\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6"}]}
