The ME configuration has better overall performance as it utilizes the Vinci upper stage engine instead of the HM7-B upper stage engine. It also uses a 8 meter Sylda instead of the old 5-ish meter one, in addition to a 20m fairing instead of a 17m fairing. This will allow you guys to launch much bigger and heavier dual payloads, and in all honesty looks a heck of a lot better than the ECA configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2011/06/ariane_5_me_configuration/9639903-3-eng-GB/Ariane_5_ME_configuration_large.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ariane_5_ME_configuration_large.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Adapted_Ariane_5_ME\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E for more information on the Ariane 5 ME.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T11:25:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mark7","CreatedById":143108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T12:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo,is it okay to release tomorrow\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BC\u00C5\u00B8Not pushing u ,just it seems that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153m gonna have another week away from my laptop\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
