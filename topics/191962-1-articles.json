But i can\u0027t figure out how to open the kerbal inventories. i can\u0027t figure out how to deploy the deploy-able experiments. That\u0027s a lot of science i cant access. I can place them in the storage boxes while in build mode, but when i get to where i wish to set up the deploy-able experiments, I can\u0027t seem to open the inventories on the kerbals, and i would rather not use mods. So the simple question is, How do i open the inventory on the kerbals themselves, how do i deploy the experiments from the storage boxes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-29T20:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2020 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Wytewolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarify my question\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-27T20:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour question has been moved from Tutorials to Questions since you are seeking help rather than offering it.
