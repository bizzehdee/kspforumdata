So here they go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, a family overview. Basically, the stuff that they have in common is that they use the same wingform (the old one, slightly tweaked) and a single RAPIER. That is kinda important now, since it means you can put one of these one the runway for less than 45K Funds (Whatever those are!). Well, except the Science edition, those delicate instruments sure are expensive, but even that is \u0026lt;70K, and none of the part counts goes over 65 (or under 50). Most action groups work the same, so check them out in the description before flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/yNNoxJq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yNNoxJq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yNNoxJq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said before, you get four models: from left to right, Duna edition, Laythe edition, Shuttle edition, and Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 edition. Let\u0027s look at each one, shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDUNA EDITION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the best performer, it has the greatest fuel load with the least auxiliary systems mass. It clocks in at over 2.5km/s in the KER simulation when loaded with 100% LFO mix (standard load leaves some oxidizer out to account for the ride out of kerbin\u0027s atmosphere), which makes it capable of landing on Duna under rocket power and then taking off again to orbit, with a big margin. And I say \u0022land under rocket power\u0022 because it is a rocket VTOL, with enough T/W to actually fly on kerbin, so lowering speed to safely put her down on Duna should be a breeze. The VTOL system also comes in handy to put her down on airless moons on its wheels, and the added weight is minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TLDkYcA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TLDkYcA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TLDkYcA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside is that the craft does little else other than carrying a kerbal around, but that is what this game is about, ain\u0027t it?

The VTOL system is completely overhauled, with the successive weight reductions in the family allowing a single jet to take the place of the rocket VTOL system, and giving unprecedented autonomy in hover mode. Explore at leisure the planetary surfaces with oxygen, taking as slow a look as necessary at interesting places and setting down wherever you want (if you are good at looking into the future, the jet engine lag takes a bit to get used to in VTOLs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/15lROl5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/15lROl5.png\u0022 alt=\u002215lROl5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, it handles great. Sadly, all that performance in air comes at the expense of performance in space. It is the model with less delta-v in space, by far, and does little else than the Duna version at that, carrying the single kerbal and no payload of note. But have I told what a joy it is to fly? There is a reason I haven\u0027t uploaded a standard boring 100% airbreather plane in ages... they don\u0027t fly as good as this SSTO.

Like rescuing stranded kerbals, for example (my first fulfilment of a contract in 0.24, BTW \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E). In those cases you want an empty seat, and flying the ship there by remote control (all Darts are equipped with on board computers capable of autopilot) either feels cheaty, or you just want some extra room to roleplay extended missions or whatever. In any case, here comes the double seater, sporting an interesting passenger cabin arrangement (works without a hitch every time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/GTHPAbP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GTHPAbP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GTHPAbP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI especially like the way you get a side window on the plane which is actually functional. In all other respects, this version is functionally identical to the Duna edition, other than the added weight of the passenger cabin both decreases delta-v somewhat (Duna orbit-land-orbit missions are dubious if you have to dip into the fuel to land too much) and T/W to the point where this is the sluggiest one to get to orbit. Just leave it on a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb and go for coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESCIENCE!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 EDITION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for a bit extra money (it\u0027s actually true now! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E), you can take all that payload capability of these models, and use it for the highest purpose a kerbal can aspire to, the gathering of Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Sporting one of each scientific instrument available to kerbalkind, you will be able to get all that Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 that you don\u0027t really need since this thing requires most of the tech tree already unlocked.

But form there to around 30 kms is where you pick up speed, so you have to pitch down when you get to this point, in order to lower vertical speed to give time for the plane to accelerate. You should get to at least 1,500m/s on jets alone before you think of using rocket power, and there is a handy indicator for vertical speed a lot of people miss to the right of the altimeter, keep an eye on that and consider its scale is logarithmic! Settle for something like 50m/s vertical speed and go for a speed run on those ten kms. By the time you get to 30,000m, though, a couple things have happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You are going so fast you have to pitch down all the time to keep a stable heading, because the planet curves below you so fast (\u0026gt;1,500m/s surface speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Air is getting thin, the intake indicator reads 0.01 or less but it is sort of stuck on that number. This is the reason you can go so fast, the thin air, but you will flame out soon since the only thing keeping air on your engines is the fact that you are going so fast, and soon not even that will work, because your drag/thrust ratio keeps getting worse for sciency reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, you reach serious diminishing returns by staying longer in the atmosphere, so let the plane pitch up by itself until you get the RAPIERs automatic switching to rocket power (No flameout on that puppy unless you set it to manual!), at which point you can close the intakes to cut drag, though that\u0027s not necessary. Pitch a bit down to prograde once your vertical speed is above 100m/s to be very efficient, and go to map view to take a look at your apoapsis and time to it, because from then on you are flying like a rocket. Once apoapsis is outside the atmosphere, coast to it adjusting for drag as necessary, and circularize afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
