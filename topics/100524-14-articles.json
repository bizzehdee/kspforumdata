The V-tail, however, was a spur of the moment decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design was \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E successful - it made it into orbit under its own power and launched a fully-loaded payload without issue. But, it didn\u0027t have enough Oxidizer afterwards to de-orbit. I\u0027m guessing my flight profile had something to do with that, though (maybe I lit the rockets too low), so I\u0027m going to try again tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing I\u0027m worried about at the moment is whether or not the plane will still be dynamically stable after fulfilling its mission (i.e. during descent and landing). It strikes me that the main wing may be a bit too far forward, and RCS Build Aid is telling me the CoM is going to shift back quite a little ways (the RCS you\u0027re seeing in the SPH screenies is for the probe; the plane itself has no RCS capability). Makes me wish I could rely on the CoL marker to be accurate. FAR green lit me up to 30k/M4, but that was with tanks full. I might see what it says with tanks empty before I try the next launch. Maybe put the wing a little further back (it\u0027s not like I don\u0027t have plenty of room to do that) and move the Mk1 Fuselage tanks forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure something was borked with my instance of KSP last night - I had some weird behaviors going on later on when I switched over to my career game. The NaN readings I was getting from KER were not a good sign either. Couldn\u0027t tell if the voxels I was seeing with the Ballista\u0027s wings were good or not; I know there have been issues between B9 Procedural Wings and FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit of advice on the design that may help a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you sunk the radial fuel tanks into the hull a bit more to give it a more streamlined shape it would smooth out the overall airflow issue. Also if you were to extend the point of the nose a fair bit more, try adding an antenna on the tip of it to give you a point in the airstream. DONT extend the antenna it will just blow off. Lastly move the solar panels behind the wings or into your cargo bay so that they are not blocks metal in the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis past weekend I was able to unlock enough technology in my career game to start seriously utilizing spaceplanes in it.

Is that a known bug? It\u0027s like it\u0027s treating the bay as being non-existent - I\u0027ve got a Reaction Stabilizer, a couple of batteries, some solar panels, two roundified RCS tanks (it\u0027s a rescue craft so it does have RCS capabilities) and a quad of linear RCS ports in there (two forward, two back, don\u0027t know why it took me this long to come up with that particular idea - and it works, BTW). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I had some serious problems with this design. First, FAR borked; gave me NaNs on lift and drag and try as I might it went into the drink. I would\u0027ve reported that one to ferram but it hasn\u0027t happened since and I don\u0027t know how to get the error log he needs to fix these sorts of things anyway. After restarting KSP, it was pretty obvious the CoL was too far forward; it see-sawed up and down until parts started flying off. No problem - I moved the wings back a bit. Then I started experiencing parts breaking off at low altitudes, by which I mean the elevators. I repurposed the flaps to serve as an auxiliary pair, which worked on a relatively successful flight; it tells me I need to tone down the pitch control of the main elevators. Got it up around Mach 3.8 at 20k. Lit the rockets...and failed to make orbit. I made orbital altitude but didn\u0027t have enough juice to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost-mordem then - What\u0027s wrong with the design? FAR gives my Max Cross Section as 3.59 square meters and the wave drag area as 3.25 square meters, critical mach is 0.768, if that\u0027s at all helpful. Only other thing I did to the design after making those screenies was to put a small antenna on the nose (which incidentally overheated and exploded during the flight - so I guess I might need to work a bit more on my flight profile).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I could fill in the little gap there between the fuselage and the wing towards the tail. The fin probably needs to be redesigned to a more traditional fin-and-rudder; I don\u0027t really have a reason to have an all-moving fin (I was being lazy again there).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T14:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing wrong with your design is a bug in FAR: the voxelisation isn\u0027t picking up the bottom half of the cargo bay.

Watch the control surfaces as you do so; the AoA settings will kick in and move the surfaces to match the level flight AoA. This should help you get an understanding of what they\u0027re doing. You can also test spoilers and flaps like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T01:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHighly recommended.

There\u0027s a story there - last night I did the fourth attempt to bring the two of them home in the Night Hawk. The fourth re-entry went pretty much the same as the previous entries, where I tore the airbrakes off as the Q got too high. But, I managed to get the temperature under control and brought them into subsonic flight about a hundred klicks downrange from KSC. As I closed to fifty klicks, I did a quicksave and then tried to make an adjustment to my course to align with the Runway and the plane came apart, with the expected end results (it wasn\u0027t that violent of a maneuver either, just a quick little tap on the elevator to bring the nose up - at a Q of about 28 kPa). When I did a quickload, the Cockpit promptly exploded with the plane dangling in mid-air. Reload and this happened again - I did this three times before I finally said \u0022screw it\u0022 and went to the space center. Naturally, I\u0027d lost the money for Diissa\u0027s rescue contract, but I noted the Astronaut Facility listed her and Jeb as MIA - so I knew I had been hit by a Kraken, and I still had access to both of them. The game gave me a new rescue contract shortly thereafter - Pepe\u0027s contract - which gave me an chance to make some key fixes to the Night Hawk design (among them, adding struts to the inside of the cargo bay and adding a few cooling fins to the Nacelle). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPepe\u0027s contract only took two tries to get right; I promptly whacked the damn fins I\u0027d added when I took off and still cooked the ladder off the side of the cockpit, but otherwise there were no mishaps in the ascent. Ripped off the spoilers on both re-entry attempts (the second time while trying to retract them at Q=9 kPa), and both times I got the plane subsonic and to the KSC Runway; the first time I botched the touchdown and destroyed the craft, the second time I was able to produce the screenie above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve got some testing and a few more tweaks to make to the design at this point; I\u0027ll take all your advice to heart and we\u0027ll see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T01:21:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
