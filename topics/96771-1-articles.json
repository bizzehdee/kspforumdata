They also don\u0027t have enough stopping power. I almost didn\u0027t feel any effect using them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Add a drag chute. Stock chutes automatically get cut when the plane touches the ground. So they can only be used immediately before.

I reduced engine power to 0% several kilometers before the runway. My planes usually glide very well in FAR but I tend to mess up either by still being to fast or to slow or to low or to high.

Some have been mentioned. Let\u0027s start with what you have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Gears. Round about way of doing it, but don\u0027t add gears to be air brakes. That\u0027s not going to help you much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Spoilers. Spoilers do slow you down quite a bit, but you can change them to deploy at a negative value. That means you can use a pair of spoilers to deflect in opposite directions and create air brakes. Spoilers will mess with your lift also, which may be desirable but not always. Air brakes create an equal drag in symmetry so it doesn\u0027t alter lift. You can also get air brake mods like in B9, but make sure you place them in symmetry too! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Real Chute mod, that\u0027s the only way to do it. It fixes not only the cutting of the chutes on touchdown, but you can configure for a drag chute so it pulls from behind you instead of slightly above. (In case you didn\u0027t know, drag chutes should only be used to slow down on the runway, not in the air)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. This is the tricky part. The solution is Flaps. With Flaps being too slow is less of a problem. In case you don\u0027t know, Flaps create more lift than the wing would normally so this allows the plane to fly slower without falling out of the sky. Perfect for final approach. They simply reduce the minimum safe speed, bonus, they create drag to slow you down. If you land at a slower speed, your wheel brakes wont have to do so much work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee. Technically possible, it\u0027s unnecessary though, personally I think it\u0027s silly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther tips: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Don\u0027t be afraid to use the engines, unpowered landings from orbit like the Shuttles do is very hard, one of the last things you will learn to do with planes. If you come in too short, fire em up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Circle around. If you feel your going too fast, go past the runway and come back ocean side (assuming a typical equatorial approach), that gives you time to bleed off speed and personally I find approach from the ocean a little easier because you don\u0027t have to worry about staying high till you pass Mount Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Banking maneuvers automatically slow you down. Perform S curves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*PAPI mods help. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85353-0-90-NavUtilities-ft-HSI-Instrument-Landing-System-v0-5-RC3-*Dec-2014*\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E NavUtilities \u003C/a\u003Ehas a PAPI system that tells you if you are on the glide slope. When using it, position your plane so the pink arrows on the right and left are sitting on the center line. If the arrows go high, increase your altitude and if they go low decrease your altitude. (Sounds backward, but the arrows indicate the position of the glide slope relative to you so if the glide slope is below your plane the arrows will be down) It will also help you line up the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Tip: PRACTICE. Don\u0027t get discouraged, you will get it in time.

You\u0027ll bleed horizontal speed in a big hurry if you have your engines off (or at low power); once you\u0027re either at maximum AoA or you start losing altitude, nose back down again a bit to avoid smashing bits off your tail and let your rear gear touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens next depends a bit on the plane design.

The answer to having an easier time slowing down is to not be in a rush to land, simply - just don\u0027t descend as steeply, plan your descent around it not being as steep and fly a longer approach. From space I usuallly don\u0027t exceed 30m/s vertical speed downwards and probably more like 20, and I\u0027ve done it enough to know what altitude to fly at what distance to run to get the right deceleration, to the point where it\u0027s really rare to use engines at all for any of the descent - but it\u0027s usually at least half an orbit if not more to slow down and at KSC I\u0027ll land on 27 ( from the sea ) despite re-entering from the west.
