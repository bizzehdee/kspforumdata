On top of that, both SpaceX and ULA have well-proven boosters (Falcon 9/Heavy, Atlas V, Delta IV Heavy)... and if you account for the planned cancellations of Atlas V and Delta IV, that literally only leaves SpaceX as a long-term choice with a fully proven booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Vulcan Heavy,\u00A0New Glenn, OmegA and the Superheavy\u00A0booster do not quite yet exist, but are based on well-understood technology. The Starship is highly experimental, but even a fully expendable Starship is likely to cost a lot less than SLS.\u00A0Even if Starship/Superheavy didn\u0027t exist at all, SLS still compares unfavorably to extant commercial HLVs (\u003Cem\u003Ei.e.\u003C/em\u003E Falcon Heavy, Delta IV Heavy), and even less favorably to highly-probable near-future HLVs (\u003Cem\u003Ei.e.\u003C/em\u003E Vulcan Heavy, New Glenn, OmegA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m seeing isn\u0027t any objective reason to explain why SLS is a good choice for NASA, but rather a lot of hate for Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, leading to a dismissal of anything they do... and utterly ignoring ULA and Northrop Grumman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Okay, if I\u0027m being honest, there are a few objective factors in favor of SLS... just not enough to outweigh its downsides. Yes, it has more single-launch capability than anything else. Yes, it has a pretty enormous fairing. Yes, it can, with a single launch, transport astronauts to what is technically a lunar orbit. These factors, however, are outweighed by issues like its enormous expense, its slow launch cadence, and the risk posed to astronauts by using such an untested vehicle that still possesses some of the safety flaws of the STS (e.g. a core stack that cannot lift itself without SRBs, enormous SRBs, enormous amounts of highly energetic hydrolox propellant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-04T13:02:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2019 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-04T12:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223575683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221554350019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Musk or Bezos aren\u2019t one of those fat cats?

These factors, however, are outweighed by issues like its enormous expense, its slow launch cadence, and the risk posed to astronauts by using such an untested vehicle that still possesses some of the safety flaws of the STS (e.g. a core stack that cannot lift itself without SRBs, enormous SRBs, enormous amounts of highly energetic hydrolox propellant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Delta/Atlas cancellation comes after the arrival of Vulcan which is built on the reliability and effectiveness of those two rocket families.

The low thrust trajectories require more delta-v but as long as the ion engines have high isp you get away with less propellant, and if you\u2019re clever, less total mass in LEO for a given mission payload mass.
