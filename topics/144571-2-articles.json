One of the easiest might be to go to college (assuming you\u0027re not already) and speak to your technology transfer office. They should be able to help you, or if they\u0027re not willing to help you directly, to give you some advice and put you in touch with the right kinds of people to speak to if you want to try and make a go of your idea yourself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you\u0027ll need investment.
