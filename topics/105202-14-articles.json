I\u0027d be more likely to agree that it should be bundled with the mod if this was Roverdudes only mod, but He has and maintains something like 15 mods. And I\u0027m pretty sure he removed mm from every bundle. it saves him time most likely. Because if he does bundle, then need to constantly follow the MM people and see every time they update it, then update all of his mod packages and re upload them all to github and anywhere else he hosts his mods for something that is really a small change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much easier for him if he puts a dependency notice on the post somewhere an has the player download and worry about MM themselves. In my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: and I missed a post by Roverdude on the the previous page, where he said MM will be bundled again in a future release. It wasn\u0027t bundled before because it hadn\u0027t been updated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T22:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
