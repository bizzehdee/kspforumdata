That\u0027s why I made this, the ENgines TEmperature SensOr (or EnTeSo), to monitor engine temp in real time and give some means to cool them down in any conditions (in or out atmosphere, at low or high altitude and while running or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the pic below you can see the sensor in action:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QQAprDT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QQAprDT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a sequence of pics showing how amazingly effective cooling is in KSP (as in 40 seconds, a Mansail cool down from 2558.2 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to -34.4 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, Celcius scale is assumed). Considering cooling is space is less effective as we may first thought, despite the very low temperature in the dark, the stock parts looks like to be magically cooled down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut engines can still overheat and explode, especially under heavy duty (pushing an heavy mass) or when they are close together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverheat bar by the way looks like to be displayed when engine temp \u0026gt; maxtemp - 1100 (almost) \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, maxtemp as defined in part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith maxtemp = 3600, overheating condition start at ~ 2500 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks connected to an engine don\u0027t really get high temperature (in some previous experiments, a FLT-800 connected to a LVT-30 engine get only 200-300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C as far as I remember, using stock thermometer connected to it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, maxtemp of most parts are 3600, do you know a lot of materials which can keep their current solid phase as such temperature ? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETungsten have the top melting point of all metals (3414 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C according to wikipedia) at normal pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, all parts have some undisplayed parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EheatConductivity = 0.12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EheatDissipation = 0.12 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(seen in Part class)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think of modifying these values for stock/all parts by default and add passive/active cooling system with better values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd add these parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- one radial passive heatink \u0026amp; one surface passive heatsink\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 or 3 active cooling systems: one computer fan surface attached, one which looks like an intake to use in front for maximum efficiency and another one which could be used anywhere in the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B use of Kelvin (better as KSP use International System of Units) and Farenheit scales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- temperature reading ok (simple ModulesEngines(FX) classes extended \u002B ModuleManager patch for all engines using these two modules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor heating dissipation, I don\u0027t really want to make something as accurate to our real word and as complicated as KSPI or Near Future parts which use thermodynamics rules I guess to do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/JustinKerbice/EnTeSo/releases/tag/0.1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eversion 0.1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELicense:\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/JustinKerbice/EnTeSo/blob/master/license.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhatever license 1.1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: temperature looks like to be in Celcius degree, as we have a pleasant 19\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at ground level, water is liquid (but may be very very salty as nothing sink), ground is not fully covered by ice and snow, we\u0027ve got contrails and temperature can be very low (-200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0), so it definitely can\u0027t be the Kelvin scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-15T16:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2014 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Justin Kerbice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ealpha release added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent!

Both of which can be measured and budgeted for in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, what we currently have in the game is not heat it is temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, the rate at which heat is removed by the heat pump is influenced by the rate at which the stock game is trying to dump it back in. There are potential ways around it that have been suggested that revolve around adjusting dissipation and transfer but it\u0027s too easy to make parts explode that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourthly, I have NEVER experienced the heat pump draining all EC in 5 seconds.
