This console alongside the Sega Genesis (or MegaDrive outside of the US (boo!)) owned the 90s, and even helped pioneer new graphics, technology and polices that we still use today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe Super Nintendo was the home to many new series started by Nintendo that they still continue, such as F-Zero, Star Fox, Pilotwings, Donkey Kong (referring to the Rare series, not the Arcade ports), and many many more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe biggest aspect that defines this console was the \u0022Bit Wars\u0022 that was occurring during this consoles lifetime where Nintendo had to compete against Sega for the video game market. Each of the companies consoles were known for their processing speed or more specifically the number of bits it could process. The original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was an 8-bit console, which was crushed by Sega when they released the Sega Genesis/MegaDrive, as it was a 16-bit system which meant it could have far superior graphics than the NES. Nintendo later release the SNES which allowed it to compete with the Sega Genesis as the SNES was also 16-bit. This is what led to a long strong of competition between the two companies. This competition run for the entire consoles lifetime and even after as it gave way to the Nintendo 64.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nOne of the most amazing things about this console was it\u0027s ability to persevere and overcome it\u0027s rival Sega as it stepped itself up with the Super FX Chip which allowed the console to run 3D shapes and also have many more graphical modes which trashed Sega Genesis. The Super FX Chip debuted with the release of Star Fox which was an immediate success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nAs an owner of a SNES I\u0027ve owned for even longer than I\u0027ve been born (it was a hand me down), I can say first hand, this console is amazing and I love to pick it up and play it anytime.

Every old console looks like a GameCube to me, even though lots of them are not cubes. I also remember playing with my Dad\u0027s gameboy, it was amazing. Old nintedo stuff is cool and nostalgic. It is like stepping into life before you even existed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun fact: I stole my aunts atlas, it was made in 1978 and it looks brand new, it has countries like the Soviet Union still in it, i am amazed. It gives me the same sort of feeling as playing with ancient Nintendo consoles, expect alot older.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-26T23:50:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2016 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NSEP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T00:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFF3, SF2, SimCity, and of course Zelda and Super Mario World.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis song: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uR7doemZD0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uR7doemZD0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
