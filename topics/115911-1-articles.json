Can a magnet be used on both a pusher plate and Terran base that repulse eachother that can push the plate up into GSO? Can magnets repel eachother at that distance?\n\nFor example; a mobile free floating plate with a giant magnet on its belly is facing another magnet on the ground. The magents are both charged with the same current (-- or \u002B\u002B) and repel eachother thus pushing the plate up. The magnet plate on the pusher has magnetic fins that are also charged and can steer inside the magnetic field like fins on an airplane to keep it inside the field. \n\nIs this possible? How much energy will need to be used? How big will the magnets need to be?"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:42:46Z","Content":"Main question from me is \u0022how you want to solve stability problem, because magnetic field changes and fluctuates?\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:47:25Z","Content":"Yes, it would be completely unstable unless stabilized in some way. Also, there is no known magnetic monopole, so \u0022charged with the same current\u0022 makes no sense.\n\nThe field strength required would be enourmous. Well beyond what we can do, and well beyond what we should do (unless you want to fry every electronics on earth, and possibly some brains, too)."},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:01:33Z","Content":"Active control systems are a very good way to solve the stability problem. The instability thing only applies to magnetic fields that are not controlled, like permanent magnets.\n\nThe real problem would be power delivery, as there is a minimum kinetic energy required to maintain orbit, and magnetic fields don\u0027t work over long distances well.\n\nMagnetic repulsion is two fields repelling each other, and both of those fields fall off as 1/R^2^, which means that the force exerted by one field on the other one will fall off as 1/R^4^.\n\nThat means that for every doubling of distance, the same force requires the application of **16 times as much energy** to both fields.\n\nThat gets really problematic really quickly, as we can only make magnets so strong before they either fly apart, overheat, or otherwise stop working.\n\nIn other words, it won\u0027t work. Magnetic fields as a force carrier are only a good idea over short distances.\n\nA better idea would be using the carbon nanotube cable of the space elevator as a track for a magnetically-levitated elevator car propelled by linear induction motors, as carbon nanotube can be a good conductor of electricity.\n\nTransmitting the power for the maglev and induction motor systems on the elevator car would be done thru other sections of the space elevator.\n\nThis would work because it only requires the magnetic fields to act over a short distance, requires no active controls on the space elevator itself, and uses the material of the space elevator that\u0027s already there to transmit the power needed by the car. All of these save weight which means you can either haul more stuff on the same space elevator or use a smaller space elevator to haul the same amount of stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:38:22Z","Content":"@SciMan power delivery shouldn\u0027t be problem just put few nuclear power plants and transfer energy, using microwaves or other kind of radiation, to vehicle.\n\nOr we could shot magnetic beam from Earth and build elevator that would climb it [http://www.google.com/patents/US5929732](https://www.google.com/patents/US5929732) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:43:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @SciMan power delivery shouldn\u0027t be problem just put few nuclear power plants and transfer energy, using microwaves or other kind of radiation, to vehicle.\n\u003E Or we could shot magnetic beam from Earth and build elevator that would climb it [http://www.google.com/patents/US5929732](https://www.google.com/patents/US5929732) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nYou can\u0027t just magically transfer energy as microwaves: that will require excessive cooling and such. Anyway, I think you have a wrong understanding of the amount of power required... you might need Petawatts or more of power to get that thing into orbit, simply because of the scale of that magnet.

I hope you weren\u0027t thinking steel..... The problem is both strength and mass. Whatever material is used, it must be strong enough to support its own weight, which necessitates very low mass at very high strength of you are never going to have a \u0022cable\u0022 reach GSO, let alone beyond it.\n\nImportant note: your anchor mass must be *beyond* GSO. If its in GSO, it contributes no counter-mass at all, and all of the mass below GSO will be suborbital and will fall and take the anchor with it. This eliminates trying to have a short length untethered that periodically lowers some cable to raise other bits, you\u0027d leave orbit(one way or another...) if you tried, unless we aren\u0027t talking a pure space elevator but some unusual hybrid with active thrust to keep it up there..... If so, i hope you have a trick to get more fuel up there than the elevator burns trying to lift that fuel up there. If you don\u0027t have active thrust, your anchor must be beyond GSO, and if it is, but is not constantly tethered, then it will not remain in GSO as its center of mass is moving too quickly for the orbit its in, and it will enter an elliptical and otherwise useless orbit.\n\nGo here, look at breaking strength: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_strength)\n\nBreaking strength is the length, in kilometers, of which you can have a vertical column that will be able to carry its own weight, we can\u0027t do it yet, even with nanotubes, we can\u0027t make them strong enough, yet. Of course that is compounded with us being unable to even adequately produce them, let alone sufficient quality.\n\nOff the top of my head with no google-fu to back it: Kevlar would be better than steel I think, its light and has great tensile properties, which are necessary, but its still far too massive for a space elevator.\n\nNow remember, that\u0027s just the breaking strength, which is, as noted the measure of how much of itself a column can hold up under earths gravity, but you need to double that when you are looking at your centerpoint, because everything below wants to fall, and everything above wants to rise, and the upward force is greater than the downward of the elevator will not be so for long.\n\nWe have nothing that is remotely feasible yet, but we do have a few promising materials that may work out after some lengthy R\u0026D.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T01:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Amram**"}]}
