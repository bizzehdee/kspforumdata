Nosecones:** All air intakes, all 1.25m nosecones, and the shielded docking port all produce the same amount of drag.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t seem quite right, since some of the parts should realistically be more aerodynamic than the others. \n\nThe 1.25m parachutes only produce slightly more drag than the nosecones.\n\n![SOL5bLcl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SOL5bLcl.jpg)\n\n**2. Mk2 to 1.25m adapters**: Contrary to what you might think, the long adapter produces (slightly) *more* drag than the short adapter.\n\n![EEZhc3Zl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EEZhc3Zl.jpg)\n\n**3. Back-facing surfaces:** A back-facing flat surface produces the same amount of drag as a forward facing flat surface. \n\n![3Rc7CCSl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3Rc7CCSl.jpg)\n\n**4. EDIT: First assumed to be an aero bug, but turned out to be a rendering bug. Sorry about the confusion.** \n\nDrag arrows do not always render properly when objects are perpendicular to the air stream. \n\n![CAsm99yl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CAsm99yl.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T23:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chronosheep**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:02:53Z","Content":"Great investigative work, have some rep!

Alternatively, could it be that their drag is \u0022added\u0022 to their parent in-line part (it doesn\u0027t look like it, but we might as well be sure)?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T23:15:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi**"},{"CreatedByName":"JokingHinge","CreatedById":109457,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:08:55Z","Content":"This desperately needs more attention, here\u0027s some rep."},{"CreatedByName":"Volix","CreatedById":144192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:13:59Z","Content":"Good things to know, and good screenshots to demonstrate them. How were the parts placed for the two screenshots under 4? Were they placed directly, or moved into place with the widgets? As far as I know things moved around using the translate widget are occluded according to their original placement (small fuel tanks radially attached then moved into a larger tank still create drag). Perhaps this is related? Strange behavior either way.\n\nEDIT: Questions answered before post was approved (new member).

You are correct sir, and the drag errors appear correctly when you divert from prograde, so they are definitely in the right spot. Seems like a bug in the aero arrow code, a bad rotation matrix or cross product somewhere.\n\nEDIT: More information. If I surface attach the side tanks using just an S rotation from default, I get the pancake/no arrows behavior. However, if I surface attach using just W they work normally.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T00:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:07:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thankfully seems to be a rendering bug.\n\nAnd here I was thinking about how I could launch my space station sideways...\n\nGood idea with the test series!"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:11:55Z","Content":"Nice to see it\u0027s just a visual thing."}]}
