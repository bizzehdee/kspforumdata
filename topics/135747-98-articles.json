The v1.1 Falcon actually has a pretty low TWR off the pad and stands to gain quite a bit from reducing gravity losses with more thrust. There\u0027s also the densified propellant thing, where they squeeze a few extra kilograms of propellant into the tanks by chilling it to lower temperatures than normally required. The second stage\u0027s own TWR meanwhile is lower because it is heavier, but this is not an issue because it already has an unusually large engine for an orbit insertion stage, and it gets more of a push from the upgraded first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a landing attempt adds little to no complexity, I would wager. The whole process may be complicated, but it is also completely hands off and requires (nor allows) no human interaction.
