Sadly the project was too time extensive and had several annoying technical issues so it could not be completed, and has an annoying wait at the beginning to get the song working properly due to Scratch 3.0 being an absolute idiot. I decided to share it anyways, and it is now 1/3 as long as it should be. I\u0027m very proud of it nonetheless and I\u0027d enjoy it if you provided constructive feedback for what I did make (and please don\u0027t criticize the technical stuff going on at the beginning, blame Scratch, not me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re still interested link to my version is below.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/328776179/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/328776179/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nfeel free to watch if you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceFace545","CreatedById":196943,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-25T21:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, I thought everyone on scratch was a 3rd grader making a stupid pong knockoff but, you did something awesome\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-26T03:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223826121\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221595713975\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196943\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceFace545\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, SpaceFace545 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, I thought everyone on scratch was a 3rd grader making a stupid pong knockoff but, you did something awesome\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
