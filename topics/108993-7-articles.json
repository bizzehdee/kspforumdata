Int the meantime use the stock heat shield unless you like krispy kernels.\n\nTry to use a shallower descent profile. start further out, use (-120, 0, 0) node if you are in a ~71km circular orbit (which is a darned fast orbit). Start the burn (~12 seconds retrograde with the monoprop engine) about 75-80 degrees clockwise from KSC to end up pretty close - jettison back end after the burn and enter with just the capsule, nose, and heat-shield. Go hands off after you set the capsuel to hold retrograde the whole way with torque and SCS (use RCs once you\u0027re in the flames if necessary and if you have much). The rest is just watching until parachute time. You should hit 60k altitude going about 2200 m/s. You\u0027ll see red (dynamic pressure 500pa) as you cross 50K at about 2250m/s. It will get a bit toasty at 45-35k but the speed bleeds off starting at 35K, and and the heat and speed drop rapidly between 30K (2000m/s) and 10K (700 m/s). By 1500-1200m altitude your speed should be about 225m/s, and you can pop the chute. Landing is a nice thump at 6-7 m/s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T03:55:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne**"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerwaffe044","CreatedById":143917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:02:30Z","Content":"Is there any Launch Escape Towers for this pod.

I\u0027ve also scanned the chute config and MM patch but I don\u0027t see anything alarmingly wrong that should cause this, so any help would appreciated!\n\u003E \n\nI recall this one; it\u0027s a weird model interaction between the chute, and the nosecone \u0022cap\u0022, if I remember right. I\u0027ve had it on a couple craft, of similar configuration, but I don\u0027t know the exact cause. Well. Here is what happens, I just don\u0027t know WHY ultimately. So, you can hit f12 to visualize aerodynamic forces. You\u0027ll note that they\u0027re represented as colored vectors. A red one is drag, such that as you fall, the drag results in an \\*upward\\* vector, opposing your flight path, slowing you down.  So, the snag, when that cap pops off, you can see it plainly: a new vector appears, also red (drag, I presume), but aimed pointing at the ground, 180 deg out of position. This effectively cancels out the actual drag vector, resulting in a very effective plummet. \n\nI don\u0027t know if a drag cube is out of whack, but that would be my guess. I don\u0027t know nearly enough about that system to guess how to adjust it. (Pinging [@NathanKell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/), is there documentation anywhere on drag cubes? I\u0027ve stared at them a few times, but beyond them appearing to be float curves (and I may be way off at that; it\u0027s been a little bit), I\u0027ve not deciphered their savory details as of yet.) A dirty hack I found on accident (you try near anything in a sudden plummet...), which works sometimes, is to tumble the craft as much as possible off the nose up rear down bugged plummet orientation. Drag on the sides of the vessel seems to be still working correctly. This can sometimes jog whatever has gone nuts into working, or at least slow you enough to not destroy said chutes when they pop. \n\nThat said, I\u0027ve not played with realchutes (beyond the lite version with/from/for FAR, at least), so I\u0027m not sure how it would tie in. It might be useful to test it in a sandbox save w/o realchutes to try to isolate some cause/effect. \n\nGood luck, brave test pilot! o7"},{"CreatedByName":"FiiZzioN","CreatedById":108954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T06:15:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, komodo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ---- Snip ----\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the info! Hopefully Nathan might be able to chime if he has time and explain if it\u0027s drag cubes, and if so, how to configure them. I\u0027m just glad that it wasn\u0027t just me getting a random bug as it means it\u0027s (most likely) not something unique to my install."}]}
