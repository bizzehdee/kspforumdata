I looked at my Science Archive and noticed that Minmus\u0027 Greater Flats was missing the probe science - i.e. seismic, thermal and gravitic (high, low, and landed) - largely because it was the site of my first Minmus landing, which did the other stuff. After a moment\u0027s thought and a quick look at some thrust and gravity data on the wiki, I decided I could land and take off with a small probe on RCS alone. So I threw one together with a Minmus TWR of about 5 ish (probably a little more, it was an estimate in my head), connected it by a Jr docking port to an orbital probe/service module which had chutes for the return. This assembly on an overpowered lifter was more than sufficient, leaving the full orbital module over Minmus while the lander descended, took its readings and left. Rendezvous and escape for Kerbin went well too. I actually think that with possibly an additional RC-10 and replacing the docking port with a parachute, I could have done away with the orbital stage entirely, but it all worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentaryEscape and the Minprobe were returning at roughly the same time, but it wasn\u0027t too hard to space out their aerobrakes at that distance.

Minprobe returned straight off, the docking port enough to hold it together when the chutes opened and it landed in the water. Then Jeb started to decelerate for landing.

This time he decided to recreate a scene from \u003Cem\u003ECowboy Bebop\u003C/em\u003E, specifically the episode \u0022Wild Horses\u0022. Some of you are already probably thinking this is either insane, hilarious, or both, but for those who do not know the scene in question... Well, it involved a rescue mission using an old NASA space shuttle a mechanic was refurbishing in his spare time. Launched without the LFT or SRBs. Sadly, Jeb was unable to tow the modified KSO shuttle he managed to procure out to the runway with an M4 Sherman as he had hoped to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7456/12847491863_a5bf1e48e5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212847491863_a5bf1e48e5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain engine start!
