The scenario I\u0027m seeing in about three in four approaches: Vehicle stops about six meters short of contact, corrects to docking axis, moves in about 50 cm, stops and corrects, moves in another 25, stops and corrects; eventually stops dead a few meters out showing status \u0022Approaching at 0.0 meters / sec\u0022 or \u0022Moving toward docking axis at 0.0 meters/sec.\u0022 Sometimes disabling the autopilot, nudging it towards target and re-enabling puts it back on track, sometimes it just corrects to axis and stops again. Makes no difference whether or not target is SAS-stabilized. Very time- and fuel-consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jean Deaux","CreatedById":59842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad it\u0027s not just me. I\u0027ve got 2.0.8 and all I\u0027m doing is the back and forth burn the fuel maneuver. Normally I\u0027d just dock it myself but I tend to make some big arse ships and can\u0027t get the view I need to dock manually. I do hope they put an emphasis on fixing this feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
