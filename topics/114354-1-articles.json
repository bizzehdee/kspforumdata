This happened with SAS on, as without it. With RCS on, as without it. With a Reaction wheel running, as without it. To counter this I only used the engines in intervals, when the attitude of the craft was near my maneuver node marker. Later (with only ca 2-3 tanks) everything would behave nicely and balanced again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
