Older devices have poor shielding[citation needed], and often emit a very \u0022dirty\u0022 signal over the entire 2.4 GHz band.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can cause considerable difficulties to Wi-Fi and video[citation needed] transmission, resulting in reduced range or complete blocking of the signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IEEE 802.11 committee that developed the Wi-Fi specification conducted an extensive investigation into the interference potential of microwave ovens. A typical microwave oven uses a self-oscillating vacuum power tube called a magnetron and a high voltage power supply with a half wave rectifier (often with voltage doubling) and no DC filtering. This produces an RF pulse train with a duty cycle below 50% as the tube is completely off for half of every AC mains cycle: 8.33 ms in 60 Hz countries and 10 ms in 50 Hz countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis property gave rise to a Wi-Fi \u0022microwave oven interference robustness\u0022 mode that segments larger data frames into fragments each small enough to fit into the oven\u0027s \u0022off\u0022 periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 802.11 committee also found that although the instantaneous frequency of a microwave oven magnetron varies widely over each half AC cycle with the instantaneous supply voltage, at any instant it is relatively coherent, i.e., it occupies only a narrow bandwidth.[3] The 802.11a/g signal is inherently robust against such interference because it uses OFDM with error correction information interleaved across the carriers; as long as only a few carriers are wiped out by strong narrow band interference, the information in them can be regenerated by the error correcting code from the carriers that do get through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference_at_2.4_GHz#Microwave_oven\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference_at_2.4_GHz#Microwave_oven\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T18:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
