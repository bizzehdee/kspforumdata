I used my first low-tech Minmus craft to test FAR, expecting epic fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZksBZEq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZksBZEq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI accelerated to the atmosphere friction burn threshold and the rocket started rotating along its length, but I made it, with an apoapsis of almost 200km just by using SRB\u0027s, whereas before I would barely bring my Ap up to 40km before SRB\u0027s ran out. Also, nothing fell off my completely exposed lander with all the little things sticking out. Some things started overheating due to DRE but never went critical. I can say I was somewhat surprised, mostly at the ease of reaching such high altitude. Again, this isn\u0027t a complaint, merely an observation as I found it curious, I can imagine the atmosphere in FAR is as more difficult to fly in as it is easy to transverse on a given powerplant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the issue - this is my revised Mun craft. It was identical to the Minmus craft apart from the wider lander with more fuel, but as a FAR makeover, I removed the out of place centerline SRB\u0027s and replaced them with two BACC units on the sides (the centerline arrangement was a remnant from when my launch pad limited me in weight and I had no weight room to put two more BACC on). I also downloaded procedural fairings to streamline the ship and ended up with this. I strutted each SRB once near the top as I always do, using symmetry of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Sh5iJx3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sh5iJx3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking this would be awesome I went to launch. My rocket violently wobbled itself to death before I even launched, in less than 10 seconds. As soon as it settles on its rocket holders it starts wobbling and this only increases until it falls apart. I\u0027m baffled. Do I need more struts, or the hardened joints mod or what?

On a reasonably designed rocket, NEAR/FAR reduces drag by a lot - enough that surface-\u0026gt;LKO takes something like 25% less delta-V.
