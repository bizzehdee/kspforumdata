I\u0027m completely aware that KSP is a sandbox type game, but then look at games such as rollercoaster tycoon, the sim city games among many others, the career modes where enjoyable because they limited the decisions for the player and forced them to think creatively in order to meet certain requirements. An unorthadox parallel would be the Elder scrolls games, which allow the players to go wherever they wanted and do anything they wanted right from the start, and of course there are optional missions, but there are always the same key dynamics, for instance if you steal you get fined. KSP needs similar dynamics in order for the career to stay interesting, currently, asides from the tech tree and science which is simply a very basic progressive limitation system, there is no such dynamic to speak of, and if they introduce finances, there needs to be a way to, gain, lose and economize those finances, without simply spending them in the VAB otherwise they simply have a secondary limitation system rather than a funds and management system... besides the recovery of components would not be mandatory, people would be free to take it or leave it, but when times are tight and the game gets tough, it would be a thrifty idea to keep used components for reuse\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-21T15:37:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2014 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T16:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see single reason why the game should give you any money for delivering scrap metal back on Kerbin.

I have the same problems in KSP, my SSTOs cannot carry much more than 3 or 4 tonnes into an LKO and that only just leaves enough Dv to make a rendezvous and return to kerbin, if I want to travel any further I generally need to jettison engines or build a very small SSTO which carries nothing but its own weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso your economy statement confuses me, you state that a conventional rocket which loses components as lifts off is MORE economical than an SSTO would be? surely you have that backwards\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T17:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very well made and presented idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T18:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso your economy statement confuses me, you state that a conventional rocket which loses components as lifts off is MORE economical than an SSTO would be? surely you have that backwards\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt consumes less fuel, has less mass and complexity than an SSTO for a given payload.

You need to make sure whole plane can endure atmospheric reentry, not just the return capsule.

Shuttle was chosen because it looked like it will pay off, assuming at least 30 launches a year. Reality was not even close to that and it was much more complicated to prepare the shuttle for another launch than originally anticipated. NASA could have sent twice the amount of payload to orbit for the same money using conventional rockets if they didn\u0027t have the shuttle program to care about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this is KSP and it does not have to be completely realistic.
