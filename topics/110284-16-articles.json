It stems from figuring out a rover for DSEV Phase 2, and then realizing that I could do a crossover between DSEV and Pathfinder. A simple rover wouldn\u0027t do, you need a truck. I saw the little trucks driving around KSC and knew I had my solution. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: forgot about this one, but this is another inspiration for the Buffalo. I started this in December 2013 and finished it mid January 2014.\n\n[http://spellflight.com/albums/ContactLostArt/RABBIT.jpg](http://spellflight.com/albums/ContactLostArt/RABBIT.jpg)\n\n[http://www.spellflight.com/albums/ContactLostArt/RABBITOrthos.jpg](http://www.spellflight.com/albums/ContactLostArt/RABBITOrthos.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-28T22:11:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2015 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T10:07:32Z","Content":"Wow, didnt know that MKS had some alternative.

The cab alone is large enough for two crew members to sit and drive, but they\u0027d need a bit more space to camp out. If you look at the NASA MMSEV in the picture, it has a section with docking ports and solar panels. The Buffalo will have a similar \u0022camper shell\u0022 extension that provides more room. In addition, the Buffalo will gain a sleeper cab extension that provides a small amount of room for life support stuff. The kerbals would still need to fold down the seats and string up a pair of hammocks like the Astronauts did in the Lunar Module. It will be cramped but the kerbals can rough it for a couple of days.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T16:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"PowWowKen","CreatedById":148913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T23:05:45Z","Content":"Amazing Mod, I love the factory addition, with that said i discovered a bit of a bug (or limitation of the game) with the Chuckwagon warehouses, where I has filled the warehouse with EPL Metal, entirely full, so a huge weight should\u0027ve stuck it to the ground, instead the weight was focused at the connection point as if it were uninflated (which is off the ground) and thus ripped itself apart trying to stand on end.
