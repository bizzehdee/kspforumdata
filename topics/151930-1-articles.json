Between January 2015 and May 2016 - that\u0027s sixteen months - the cost for new utility-scale solar installations dropped by 50%. Then, five months later in September, it was down \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E 25%. In 2015, 40% of all new power production equipment installed in the United States was solar... in Q1 2016, it went up to 64%. This summer, a massive solar power plant has been proposed in Nevada that, once built, could sell electricity at less than 3 cents / kWh with optimistic assumptions... and even if that is too optimistic, the average electricity price in the area is around 12 cents / kWh. It\u0027s hard to imagine that it won\u0027t at least match it, and it most likely will beat it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really going to be very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E cheap going forward, and especially when combined with wind and battery storage, it\u0027ll effortlessly serve the majority of humanity\u0027s power needs for the foreseeable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion meanwhile has its work cut out for it. Recent estimates say that in order to match the cost of non-renewable energy production (mainly coal), a fusion reactor will need a power factor (ratio of power output vs. power input) of greater than 20. To put this into perspective: to this day, no sustained fusion event has had a power factor greater than 1. There was one experiment that achieved enough power output for the reaction to keep itself going... but it happened in an instantaneous blast, in a special reaction chamber unsuited for continuous operation, using a type of fuel that cannot be supplied at runtime. So that doesn\u0027t count. And neither do fusion bombs (which admittedly do get large power factors). Even the Chinese reactor this news talked about only posted a high temperature endurance record - it didn\u0027t exceed power factor 1 and produced no power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, the \u0022producing power\u0022 part is another unsolved thing. Right now, scientists are still trying to even get a net energy positive reaction going... but once they have it, they still need to tackle the problem of actually extracting that energy from the reaction. Only once that has successfully been implemented can you hope to build a working power plant. And for the time being, only theoretical ideas exist for this. Nothing has been built or tested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd along now comes solar power, advertising costs of a quarter of conventional fossil fuels. Now the fusion reactor needs a power factor of 80 just to be competitive - with the solar power of \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u003C/em\u003E. Solar power isn\u0027t done yet; we\u0027re in the middle of a continuing downwards trend. Ten years down the line, cost will be at a fraction of what it is today. And fusion reactors still won\u0027t be producing power - heck, we\u0027re lucky if the ITER research installation even starts its comissioning phase by then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO, fusion power at utility scale is dead before it even came to be. Renewables can already satisfy our power needs at a fraction of the cost. There may be interesting applications for fusion, for instance if we succeed in building a lightweight and efficient spacecraft power source from it, but I don\u0027t see it ever become commercially viable on Earth at any point in what future we can realistically foresee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-14T11:27:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2016 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T12:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big interest of the industry in fusion reactor is that they will have the big installations in their power, whereas the solar installations can perfectly been distributed between the consumers, being able to be self-producers of the energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is interesting for space enthusiast like us, is that a propulsion fusion device doesn\u0027t need at all to contend the energy or to keep the reaction going, only to be able to focus it, you can think of it more like a engine with an energy amplifier than a proper generator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T14:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222849574\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479076881\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104935\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, cantab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s great to get the plasma controlled, but really just a stepping stone.

Between January 2015 and May 2016 - that\u0027s sixteen months - the cost for new utility-scale solar installations dropped by 50%. Then, five months later in September, it was down \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E 25%. In 2015, 40% of all new power production equipment installed in the United States was solar... in Q1 2016, it went up to 64%. This summer, a massive solar power plant has been proposed in Nevada that, once built, could sell electricity at less than 3 cents / kWh with optimistic assumptions... and even if that is too optimistic, the average electricity price in the area is around 12 cents / kWh. It\u0027s hard to imagine that it won\u0027t at least match it, and it most likely will beat it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really going to be very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E cheap going forward, and especially when combined with wind and battery storage, it\u0027ll effortlessly serve the majority of humanity\u0027s power needs for the foreseeable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion meanwhile has its work cut out for it. Recent estimates say that in order to match the cost of non-renewable energy production (mainly coal), a fusion reactor will need a power factor (ratio of power output vs. power input) of greater than 20. To put this into perspective: to this day, no sustained fusion event has had a power factor greater than 1. There was one experiment that achieved enough power output for the reaction to keep itself going... but it happened in an instantaneous blast, in a special reaction chamber unsuited for continuous operation, using a type of fuel that cannot be supplied at runtime. So that doesn\u0027t count. And neither do fusion bombs (which admittedly do get large power factors). Even the Chinese reactor this news talked about only posted a high temperature endurance record - it didn\u0027t exceed power factor 1 and produced no power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, the \u0022producing power\u0022 part is another unsolved thing. Right now, scientists are still trying to even get a net energy positive reaction going... but once they have it, they still need to tackle the problem of actually extracting that energy from the reaction. Only once that has successfully been implemented can you hope to build a working power plant. And for the time being, only theoretical ideas exist for this. Nothing has been built or tested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd along now comes solar power, advertising costs of a quarter of conventional fossil fuels. Now the fusion reactor needs a power factor of 80 just to be competitive - with the solar power of \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u003C/em\u003E. Solar power isn\u0027t done yet; we\u0027re in the middle of a continuing downwards trend. Ten years down the line, cost will be at a fraction of what it is today.

For comparison of that number the world wide plastics production was 280,000,000 tonnes in 2011, so if the solar panels were all plastic it would take 56,6 years to produce them, while leaving the world without plastic for anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Take the different panels composition and multiply by whatever it would take to cover the worlds energy supply with those solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. As a point of comparison the Andasol powerplant in spain vaporizes\u00A02,610,000 cubik meters a year of water. To match the worlds energy supply in 2012 via similar methods would vaporize 819,935,454,545 cubic meters a year. Which is equivalent to 124,402 amazon rivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Again using the Andasol 1\u00A0powerplant for comparison it uses 28,500 tons of molten salt for energy storage. To scale the plant to match the worlds energy supply in 2012 would require 28,049,952,531 tonnes of salts, which are 60 percent sodium nitrate\u00A0(16,829,971,518 tonnes)\u00A0and 40 percent potassium nitrate (11,219,981,012 tonnes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Depends on how this is supposed to be understood\u00A0\u0022The storage tank consists of two, 14-meter high tanks with a diameter of 36 meters and a capacity of 28,500 tons of molten salt.\u0022 ... If the capacity is for 1 tank rather than both,\u00A0we would need to double the above numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about sodium nitrate production, but afaik. potassium nitrate comes from potash, whose production was 37,620,000 tonnes in 2011. It can\u0027t all be potassium nitrate, but even if all production went to solar energy storage it would take 298 years to produce enough, but the lack of fertilizers would probably solve the energy problems in a quite different way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Define safely and define large scale? How much hydrogen storage is required for the 104,426 TWh consumption and 155,505 TWh supply?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Indeed... And I genuinely don\u0027t think they account for eg. just the massive square footage area of eg. solar panels and what that implies for distribution and maintenance of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will leave you with this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Log_scale.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/6/62/Log_scale.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for comparison we would need \u0022just\u0022 3,456 nuclear powerplants like Bruce power station\u00A0to match the total world wide power\u00A0supply of 2012. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T10:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to supply several billions of people with energy you will allways have huge numbers...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDont forget that Uranium is not a renewable resource, so you would run out of it quite fast when using it to power the whole earth.
