There\\\u0027s always a point where games that are too easy are boring, and games that are too hard are frustrating. KSP on the other hand? Provides you with a balance between \u0027To Easy\u0027 and \u0027To Hard\u0027 , and gives you something to look at with a sense of accomplishment. How many of you looked up at the moon and thought, \u0027I\\\u0027m going there\u0027 when you first got KSP?
