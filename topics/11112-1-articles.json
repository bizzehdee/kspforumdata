There\\\u0027s always a point where games that are too easy are boring, and games that are too hard are frustrating. KSP on the other hand? Provides you with a balance between \u0027To Easy\u0027 and \u0027To Hard\u0027 , and gives you something to look at with a sense of accomplishment. How many of you looked up at the moon and thought, \u0027I\\\u0027m going there\u0027 when you first got KSP? I\\\u0027d wager we all did, and I\\\u0027d ask another question...\n\nHow many of you, that made it to the moon, sat there with the UI turned off, watched a kerbol-rise or a kerbin-rise and took a picture and just smiled? Thinking to yourself, \u0027I did it ... I really did it.\u0027 How many of you were glad just to get into orbit? There\\\u0027s this huge sense of accomplishment in each step to the stars that this game gives us all as gamers. Now we\\\u0027ve got Spaceplanes as well giving us a sense of accomplishment when they fly.\n\n**Failure**\n\nPut shortly and sweetly? Is a good thing and should always be an option in video games. It should always be a learning tool and in KSP it is... When you fail? You go back to the drawing board and rack your brain trying to figure out what went wrong. Why? Because you want to succeed and failure is a driving force that teaches you how to succeed and builds a desire in you to succeed.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nlet\\\u0027s be honest, when we look at total explorable landmass across all three stellar bodies right now, and then think of a fully realized solar system? Well, Skyrim aint got sh\\*t on that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nJust a few thoughts, we can all only hope this gem grows and gives us another year of stary eyed dreams, red faced frustration, mind racking research and plain ol fun.\n\nDream for the stars and you just might get them."},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Orion","CreatedById":22245,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T11:28:58Z","Content":"Well, gotta admit, that was a bit over-dramatic!\n\nAlso, when I first got KSP, I couldn\\\u0027t look up at the Mun.
