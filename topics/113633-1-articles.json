I was really looking forward to using it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn researching this (trying to anyways, seems like I might be the only one with this problem), I came across the issue KSP had with Network Adapters. With KerbPaint in the GameData folder, I disabled everything under Network Adapters in Windows\u0027 Device Manager, and it was still slow. But, then I removed KerbPaint (my most-recently installed mod) from the GameData folder, and even after re-enabling all of the network stuff, loading takes about 12 seconds. It\u0027s definitely KerbPaint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone heard of this happening, even with other specific mods, unrelated to the network adapter issue? I didn\u0027t see anything about KerbPaint causing this when I hit Google. PageFile and RAM usage didn\u0027t seem to go much higher at all when the game was trying to load with KerbPaint installed, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s mods. I have about 10 others and never had this problem after installing each of them. I have the latest version and the latest ModuleManager as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice would be greatly appreciated, was pretty excited when I came across this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKellerBR","CreatedById":144229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-1-0-Release-5-0-April-28-2015-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-1-0-Release-5-0-April-28-2015-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt \u0022compact\u0022 images/Testures of mods, reducing their size, consequently, reduces the memory used and the game load time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, I\u0027m over 40 installed mods and Kerbal takes between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on the applications I am using at the same time (Steam, Skype, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I loaded it took almost 1 hour to compress the textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now the load time as well fast!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Detroit12","CreatedById":146643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T00:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t it noticeably affect the quality though? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this would work for KerbPaint, but I just came across the Near-Future parts pack that I wanted to try and I can\u0027t even get to the main menu without the game crashing when it hits 3.2GBs of RAM during loading (Kerbal alone, not total-system). KerbPaint and KSP in general worked fine after I waited the half-hour for it to load, just to see if maybe it was a first-time thing or not, which it wasn\u0027t, unfortunately.
