I\u0027ve connected both rotor and blade angle to main throttle so I can control the climbing/descending speed with one finger, but cutting the throttle means that the blade is set to -23\u00B0, which results in the whole thing hurling into the ground because there\u0027s no lift at all, and it\u0027s just pushing itself down at full speed. Ended up with several crashes when I panicked near the ground and smashed X.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be nice if I could just limit the deploy angle so it won\u0027t turn any further than what I see as safe descending speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T12:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes good suggestion but I think they need a total redesign\u00A0altogether IMO. When you look at how easy/fun firespitter props are to use, it makes you wonder the logic behind designing them this way. It\u0027s akin to having to manually set gimbling and fuel mixture on rocket engines on the fly to me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-04T06:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you made me worry about \u003Cem\u003EIngenuity\u003C/em\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it doesn\u0027t use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
