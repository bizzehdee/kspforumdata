I got them to play, but now I\u0027m stuck on working out how they\u0027re controlled by the config (for the record, I started with a Squad config for the turbojet and have modified it to fit my part). Here\u0027s what the section for the running thrust looks like right now...\n\n    AUDIO   {    channel = Ship    clip = FlightPathDev/sounds/large_thrust    volume = 0.0 0.0    volume = 0.5 0.5    volume = 1.5 1.5    pitch = .7 .7    pitch = 1.2 1.2    loop = true   }\n\nThe problem is, since the config file isn\u0027t commented, I haven\u0027t been able to work out exactly what these numbers control."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:39:01Z","Content":"The first number is an arbitrary value that the part module controlling the sound sends the sound module. The second is the actual pitch or volume of the sound for that value that\u0027s sent. It interpolates the rest. So to make UT quieter at full volume, you\u0027d change to:\n\nvolume = 1.5 1.1\n\nSimilarly for the pitch, and all values in between are interpolated. Hope that makes sense?"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyWest1218","CreatedById":139209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:48:04Z","Content":"That helped a lot, I got my sounds working just right. Thank you!"}]}
