Its starts at a velocity of about 4/10ths of second later and velocity starts slowing down its drop, previously about -20 kmh/second. The initial quarter of a second dropped the decline to about -10 kmh/second, the next quarter second the drop is around 0 kmh/sec and it holds that for about 2/3rds of a second, then is ramps up power again to gain 3 kmh/secong (Remembering we start with -20, the angle of attack has risen after decoupling so is fighting more gravity) About 2 seconds after the original engine engage it increases to 6 kmh/second and by 5 seconds later is about 9 kmh/second, after this the power up slows. If we remember the boosting topped out at about 3.6g of ground relative acceleration. 9kmh/s is about 0.25g and given the ground deceleration and loss of potential (we are not aware of) the engine is only producing TWR of 0.8.

There is actually some logic to this, because their space craft does not have an optimal, prograde angle angle. You can tell because the stage 1 rises first relative to the camera as the space craft has pitched up and view is pointing down, as the spacecraft gains thrust the stage 1 comes back into view and quickly disappears on the anti-horizon side of the image. So it kind of makes sense to push up deploy the nose cone while the remnant atmosphere is thinning then turn and go full power. You can tell when the Merlin is close to full power, the outside edge of the bell starts to flex About T\u002B3:00, but if you want to see real flexing of the bell go to about 3:45 and watch the velocity increasing and the amount of flexing. By 4:20\u00A0 minutes its gaining about 21kmh/sec with a TWR almost double (1.61) that of 2::52. The second stage has a burn time of 397 seconds and thus in has burned maximally 24% of the fuel, so yeah through 3 minutes and to 4 minutes the second stage engine is still powering up, not likely due to bell housing temperature effects either. Another thing is that you can see vibrational gimbling from 3:00 goes on and may be causing some of the optical illusion that the bell housing is flexing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T22:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is how deep can it throttle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T23:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222569147\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462726283\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101028\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WildLynx\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, WildLynx said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real world, engines tend to extinguish, or worse, vibrate themselves apart, when set to unfavorable power setting.
