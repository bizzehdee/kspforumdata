I was excited and tried to launch my first vessel in a Science Mode game. It immediately crashed and didn\u0027t even leave a report. I confirmed that this happens only when I try to launch vessels, as I can exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E as well as the game itself without issue. It\u0027s only when I try to launch a vessel do things begin to get tricky. It freezes on the loading screen, makes some sort of computer noise (I have long forgotten what noises mean what, but it sounds suspiciously like the ding that plays whenever my computer attempts to stop and give me a \u0022Are you sure you wish to run this program\u0022 message. On a side note, It is telling me that I can\u0027t delete saves I\u0027ve made. It gives me a message saying that the save is \u0022imcompatable\u0022 but allows it to disappear from the resume game screen anyways. They are still there in the folder (as I have it on my desktop) and I have to delete them manually. I think I have a corrupted version of KSP.
