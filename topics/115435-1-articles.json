If I let the connection between the command pod and the fairing explode and separate, it stops, but of course I don\u0027t want that. I had to use the debug menu just to get this screenshot.\n\nThe very first thing that starts overheating is the short Rockomax adapter, if that has anything to do with anything. The large nuclear engine has nothing to do with it, there\u0027s nothing active under the fairing either. The heat spread speeds up with the fairings deployed. If I let the adapter explode, the fairing piece cools down over time, whereas the small parts attached to the command pod remain a consistent temperature where the heat gauge is half-full, and the radiators do nothing to dissipate it. \n\nHas anyone figured out what causes this, and how to fix it? Even the radiators do nothing. If you need any more information, like the parts of the ship or a video of it in action, then I will be happy to provide it. If you think the output logs will help then I can post those too, it\u0027s just that the debug log in the debug menu shows nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T23:43:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:56:08Z","Content":"I had this problem when using the 64 bit hack.

I offset the adapter out of the fairing base so no part of the adapter model was touching the fairing base and it stopped it....temporarily. It happened again, but once I was near Moho\u0027s orbit. I knew it probably wasn\u0027t the Sun because the heat spread was happening insanely quickly (this happens when the fairings are deployed, which they were) and I wasn\u0027t firing any engines. It\u0027s very odd...\n\nI\u0027m going to try to recreate this with 100% stock parts.\n\nEDIT: It happened again with a different ship made of stock parts, this time a decoupler kept overheating and exploded. I think it may have either something to do with service bays or heatshields since that\u0027s what is near the adapter on my first ship, and near the decoupler on the ship I made just now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T12:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 12:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheppard","CreatedById":93282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T15:54:50Z","Content":"I have this issue with a large SAS unit, others with batteries, stuff inside fairings or struts.

I found out that the radiators store heat while in the sun and transfers this heat to other parts and makes them explode. Only use radiators while using equipment and keep an eye out for rising temperatures. Don\u0027t leave radiators open while not using them for anything or they will transfer radiation from space all throughout your ship and make it overheat and explode. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-03T23:40:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2023 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 3\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Maat Chu**\n  \nI figured out a different cause of my problem."}]}
