If I let the connection between the command pod and the fairing explode and separate, it stops, but of course I don\u0027t want that. I had to use the debug menu just to get this screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very first thing that starts overheating is the short Rockomax adapter, if that has anything to do with anything. The large nuclear engine has nothing to do with it, there\u0027s nothing active under the fairing either. The heat spread speeds up with the fairings deployed. If I let the adapter explode, the fairing piece cools down over time, whereas the small parts attached to the command pod remain a consistent temperature where the heat gauge is half-full, and the radiators do nothing to dissipate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone figured out what causes this, and how to fix it? Even the radiators do nothing. If you need any more information, like the parts of the ship or a video of it in action, then I will be happy to provide it. If you think the output logs will help then I can post those too, it\u0027s just that the debug log in the debug menu shows nothing out of the ordinary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T23:43:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem when using the 64 bit hack.

Only use radiators while using equipment and keep an eye out for rising temperatures.
