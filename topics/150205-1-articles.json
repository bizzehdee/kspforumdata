After seeing that it had been updated to the 1.2 I decided to come back and have some fun. Loving the changes so far but I miss the mods I used to run. Since I have been away for so long I will be playing it without mods for a while. However, I do intend to regrab some mods for this game. Sadly everything was on my old HDD that died on me so I don\u0027t have my old lists not to mention there have been a lot more added since then.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I was hoping for was for kind souls to list their favorite mods within the catagories I state to help me out. The mods I\u0027m looking for need to add difficulty to the game in a realistic manner, more parts and tech based off the real world (with the usual KSP flair) as well as realistic possibilities for the future. Basically realistic progression from old to future. Also more features (I remember a mod that had satilites that would map the would and find resources), and more resrouces added to find and use. I do remember using mechjeb but not sure what it does anymore I just know I liked it so more like it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have looked using the games mod portal but most don\u0027t have that great of a discription, or I\u0027m just glancing. Probably that later, changing jobs atm.

In fact, if at all possible, you should use it. The increased memory headroom makes playing with mods so much more comfortable.

The selection is much smaller than it was a month ago. I\u0027m going to make suggestions regardless of whether or not something is updated, because frankly I can\u0027t memorize the release status of every single mod \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It\u0027s for you to look at and find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt generally helps if you are more specific with your questions. We get generic \u0022recommend me your favorite mods\u0022 several times per week, every week of the year. And the selection of KSP mods is so vast that none of those threads ever receives the exact same recommendations, even though the question is the same. So asking something specific has a better chance of focusing the responses you get on what actually interests you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say \u0022realistic\u0022, do you actually mean \u0022realistic\u0022? Or do you mean \u0022real life inspired\u0022, or \u0022believable\u0022? Those are very different things. In the former case, you might want to consider Realism Overhaul, or at least some of the many mods it uses to do what it does. In the latter case, there are several parts packs that add stock-compatible recreations of real life spacecraft, such as Bluedog Design Bureau (US side) or Tantares (Russian side).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod you remember that mapped resources via Satellites is SCANsat - although stock does this too in a simplified manner nowadays. More resources to find and use? \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kolonization System together with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support will make your head explode. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It actually works on top of something called Community Resource Pack, which several different other mods also use to some extent. For example, Near Future Technologies (seee my signature), since you were interested in progression towards future concepts. But note that everything in this paragraph is not fully \u0022realistic\u0022. It is merely \u0022believable\u0022 and makes concessions to the fact that KSP is in fact a game (as opposed to a full blown simulator like Orbiter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want to get into challenging yourself (and you are not using Realism Overhaul, which is about as challenging as you can get), then grab Sigma Dimensions and change the Kerbin system to a different size. Suddenly you don\u0027t know how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E it costs to do stuff anymore, and you have to test and learn everything anew. And perhaps throw in New Horizons, which completely rearranges where the planets are, and adds several new ones. Surprise, Kerbin doesn\u0027t have moons anymore, but instead is a moon itself. If you\u0027re tired of going through the same motions towards the same destinations everytime, this is for you. (Changing Kerbin like that is somewhat buggy, though, so you need the stomach to deal with that.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, Kerbal Construction Time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-17T12:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2016 12:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dark Zeak","CreatedById":41032,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T07:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I remember using the Realism mod at one point as it added physics for something that wasn\u0027t in the game atm (I think), but since I\u0027m asking for future tech and parts Believable would be good enough. \u00A0Also I don\u0027t intend to use mods right away. \u00A0I just reinstalled the game since it hit 1.0 and I would like to see what all has been added. \u00A0I\u0027ll check out your mod after I write this, but I will also state that I\u0027m looking for progression from past (just starting out with maned rockets) to future (possibly ending with wrap?) in a long progression track for he tech tree and parts. \u00A0In other words more things to work towards to both extend the game and give more obstacles and things to do. \u00A0This is also why I asked for more resources to add to that.\u00A0 I\u0027ll check out all the mods you suggested, but I do have two questions. \u00A0For New Horizons what type of bugs are we talking about as I have no idea how modding Kerbin can affect things, and the second, what is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E? \u00A0Been a while and I never used the wiki or anything like that to play the game I just played till I got things right lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sorry to make a post you guys get so often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: \u00A0I also remember Kerbals at War mod. \u00A0It was fun shooting at things every so often as a distraction. \u00A0Hows that mod now days?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-18T08:01:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2016 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dark Zeak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T08:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is shorthand for delta-V, which is science speak for \u0022change in velocity\u0022. In space, there is no such thing as not moving; you are always moving, and all other objects are also always moving. Therefore your ability to reach another object is determined by whether or not you can change your movement to match that object\u0027s movement. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E has thus become the de-facto metric for how far you can go in space. Whereas a car would say that it can travel 600 kilometers on one tank of fuel, a spacecraft would say that it can change its velocity by 3,000 m/s on one tank of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022reparenting Kerbin bug\u0022 in the current (1.1.3) version of Kopernicus (the framework mod required for modding the solar system) basically results in the sun not moving in the space center view as time passes, desyncing that view from the rest of the game. If it\u0027s night when you load up the space center, it stays night permanently, no matter how much you timewarp. If you go into the tracking station and then back out, that corrects the sun\u0027s position... but since you\u0027re back at the spacecenter view, it\u0027s frozen once more. The bug doesn\u0027t prevent you from playing the game, but it\u0027s quite noticable since it\u0027s \u0022always in your face\u0022, so to speak. Also, it can cause real issues if you go to a flight scene directly from a strongly desynced space center view, as opposed to launching from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E or loading from the tracking station. This unfortunately means Kerbal Construction Time, which normally loads to the launchpad directly from the space center view, requires you to jump through hoops to use it error-free with New Horizons. You need to put the vessel on the pad through KCT\u0027s menu, then enter the tracking station and load the vessel from there, for every single launch you do. Forget it once, and you might break things to the point of requiring you to restart the game and reload from a point before your mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether this bug will be fixed in 1.2 or not, I cannot predict.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor extended progression, most of the mods I mentioned (and a lot more besides) make use of something called the Community Tech Tree. This is an extension of the stock tree, with many additional nodes beyond where stock stops. That\u0027s where you\u0027ll find all those future technologies. There are other modded tech trees too, but those generally throw the stock tree out completely, and replace it with something else entirely, if that\u0027s more your cup of tea. Though with those, you normally need to check if all your part mods are supported, because a lack of stock nodes means parts will never appear anywhere unless the tech tree\u0027s author specifically supports them. CCT doesn\u0027t have that problem, because it preserves the stock tree. If a part mod has no idea about CCT\u0027s extended nodes, it will just add itself to the stock nodes as normal. Which isn\u0027t ideal, but at least the parts are accessible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Both issues can of course be manually fixed by you via simple, if tedious, Module Manager patches.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals at War, i can\u0027t tell you anything about.
