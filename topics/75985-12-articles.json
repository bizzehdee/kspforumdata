You could either have a button that takes you to a random mod, or even add one tile on the main page, possibly in a different color. I think this would be useful to give visibility to mods that are either old or with few downloads, since they would always come out last with the rating algorithm you are using.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1, I have suggested a similar feature for those few downloaded mods before.
