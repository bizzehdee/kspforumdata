Starting from smaller payloads, I\u0027m trying to create a 2.5m cargo bay (to house 1.25m parts with stuff on the sides). Due to the size of the craft I\u0027m aiming for, I need the cargo bay door mechanism to be compact, and preferably a one I can assign action groups to And doesn\u0027t use fuel or RCS to open.\n\nWhat\u0027s the best method to do this? So far I\u0027ve tried landing legs but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m doing it correctly because the door hardly opens."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T09:33:41Z","Content":"Ummm... given that we have the mk3 cargobay now... can\u0027t you just use that?\n\nThe mk2 cargobay also fits 1.25m parts with stuff on the sides (along 1 axis, not 2)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaun","CreatedById":66344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T09:36:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ummm... given that we have the mk3 cargobay now... can\u0027t you just use that?\n\u003E The mk2 cargobay also fits 1.25m parts with stuff on the sides (along 1 axis, not 2)\n\nTrue, but the Mk-2 cargobay is too small in terms of height, and the Mk-3 is too big and heavy.

All stock hinges where, before the cargo bays, not that useful. \n\nYes it was a nice design trick but it was glitchy and ugly.

I\u0027ve made little 1 kerbal munar landers that fit in the bay.\n\nThe mk3 is rather heavy... at 6 tons... but its rather big... its the same mass as an empty fuel tank of the same size.\n\nThe one that is about the same length as the mk2 bay (its a little longer IIRC) is only 3 tons... that won\u0027t work for you?"}]}
