Does it take these two values and just add them together? That of course would be easiest, but it would not only overstate your actual lift, it would also report a lift number that corresponds to some unknown direction in between cyan and blue lines. (Half way between them if they generate equal lift, for example)\n\nPresumably, this is why the \u0022Upwards Force\u0022 stat exists. I\u0027m I correct to assume this stat does the trig to find out the force perpenticular to the ground from all aerodynamic forces (Both lift types and drag). If it is, I\u0027m tempted to say to heck with lift to drag ratios, I want upward force to drag ratios. You may be getting fabulous lift, but 50% of it is pushing retrograde!

Wing lift is however fully calculated as perpendicular to the lifting source, and thus it (and the blue arrows) do include lift induced drag.\n\nSo yes, total lift adds those values together. Upward force is the dot product of that and the up axis, so that may well be what you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Right","CreatedById":80269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T22:27:14Z","Content":"Thanks for the quick answer! My initial usage of the \u0022Upwards Force\u0022 stat is a bit confusing. Take this [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3eGJZe1.png).

Shouldn\u0027t the upwards force be Cos(30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) lift? (288.73kN)\n\nChecked the upwards force without the wings at the same point and speed, its near 0.
