That just seems like the easiest way to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just spent an hour talking down a fellow KSP\u0027er off the ledge because he couldn\u0027t get his version to update. He was following the official instructions and kept trying the Launcher (aka Update Tool). He eventually called me and I tried it as well. There is nothing listed as \u0022Update Tool\u0022, which was confusing since the directions refer to it by name. The Update button on the Launcher just opens a terminal window but nothing happens. Hence our frustration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is the Launcher broken on the OSX version? Can the Readme file be changed on the next version be changed to explain that in order to update KSP, the user needs to download a full, new copy? Or is there some secret to using the Launcher that I\u0027m not aware of?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T13:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPatcher is broken on OS X.

First I did everything wrong. I don\u0027t have the game in Applications, I have it in my Download folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I copied the contents of the DMG file over, I did it over the KSP file in Downloads. It asked I wanted to overwrite or merge the folders. I said \u0022merge.\u0022 Then I decide to remove all my old mods and launched the game. Any ship that required a mod, i.e. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, those ships weren\u0027t loaded. Ha! I lost all my ships in flight!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix it I reinstalled the mods with the newer versions and then went back to my old KSP folder and copied the persistent files from the different scenario\u00A0folders into my new KSP scenario folders (first saving my new persistent files with a different name just in case.) All my ships reappeared! Whew!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that this might help someone in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
