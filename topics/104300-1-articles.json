Yea!!!\n\n2nd one says fly above 18,500m or something like that, then take another reading.\n\nSo I fly out over the ocean and I climb up to about 19,000m then I get the message that I\u0027m \u0022Entering the zone\u0022 it told me to go to.\n\nSo I\u0027m like \u0022great!!!\u0022\n\nI right click on the little meter, and then I click on the \u0022Log readings\u0022 button and it says to me \u0022You can\u0027t do that right now\u0022\n\nI\u0027ve tried to do it so many times. But the only time I can get the Gravametric meter to work is on the ground.\n\nI\u0027ve already unlocked all the tech trees for my career, but I would really like to get the extra money so I could finish upgrading the last few buildings\n\nI have to upgrade.\n\nCould someone help please?\n\nThanks in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T07:44:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solar71**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T04:43:53Z","Content":"The negative gravioli detector doesn\u0027t work while flying so you\u0027ll have to do the \u0022above X m\u0022 parts of the contract from orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Solar71","CreatedById":140993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T05:12:15Z","Content":"Oh I see.\n\nWhile being in orbit the Gravioli detector works?\n\nI didn\u0027t know that!
