It\u0027s like OMG, I\u0027m being accused of creating drama in the craft builder forums already.

Along the way in life I picked up some education in applied psychology and I can understand and help people with special needs so yeah, I am capable of handling and turning issues such as autism, ADD, psychosis, etc, into something positive in a person\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m having a hell of a time managing things; it\u0027s not like in my day job where resolving a problem means applying a solution and making sure it sticks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point in the relationship the partner\u0027s parents, and then the family, started using me as a sort of emotional punching bag to blame all sorts of problems onto my person (we don\u0027t even meet up or communicate online with the family, go figure). Every conversation with the partner becomes sort of gossip scandal where I did this and I did that and I will just reply - where do your parents/siblings fabricate all the stories from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have used (in this order) tolerance, understanding, reason, problem-solving, assertion, and outright anger to stop people from leaving hate messages on my phone at work. Yesterday I lost it because a 10 year old kid hijacked the partner\u0027s phone, used it to send hate messages and when I called to enquire what was wrong, I get told off in low-class gangster talk to shut the F* up B****. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was like wow. Do they educate their kids? Manners? Respect for people 2, 3 times their age and contributing economically (yes I pay for my partner)? I left text and verbal warnings of that note. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I suck at relationships, although I am the \u0027people person\u0027 in my department and absolutely enjoy resolving issues raised by irate customers and formerly-hostile colleagues. I\u0027m sorry for the rant but I feel like a failure. But I thought to ask before I go build some strange crazy thing in KSP 1.0.5 - how do people deal with a relationship where the family is toxic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T06:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*not responsible for advice taken or not taken*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDealing with any toxic people is bad,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important things to do are to establish who else can see it, your relatives and friends, and theirs, as well as your partner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you know who else see\u0027s it, you have a framework of support as well as knowing that the issue is not internalised or blown up, if your partner does not see it, then you need to either get them on your side or consider calling it a day, of course take some decent time with that, not talking days here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have support from within their family or them, you need to work on getting them to point it out subtle like, if that doesn\u0027t work you and your partner need to consider a straight forward \u0022look, this is bull ...., if you can\u0027t pick up your act, then we have to disassociate ourselves\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T07:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this comes off in an unintended way. I\u0027m absolutely in no way, bigoted, but I\u0027m curious if bigotry may be at the heart of this. Is the relationship in anyway outside the socially-accepted norms of the traditional status quo? It may be that the family doesn\u0027t approve not because of who you are as a person, but because of some near-sighted dogmatic nonsense. Sometimes even being of a different denomination in the same religion can draw a lot of flak, to say nothing about the more \u0027extreme\u0027 kinds of relationships we have in the world now.

I am very appreciative of all the replies here and they\u0027re very useful for managing my situation. I think we managed to make a few improvements to the situation without upsetting anyone and you\u0027re right; there is an element of cross-cultural interaction involved, and this must definitely be handled at the partner\u0027s end - and she has agreed with the same as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very impressed with the scope and depth of all your replies and they are all dead on. I didn\u0027t actually want to give a lot of details that might prove too personal or too much \u0027dirty laundry\u0027 for a spaceflight game forum but you\u0027re all correct! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe notion that my partner should take control of the issues on her side of things is definitely valid but I had no opportunity to advise her of the same prior to this \u0022incident\u0022, but rest assured she has taken necessary measures to ensure no one touches her communications devices nor will they be allowed to benefit from her goodwill in sharing, from now on. It\u0027s like what you all said, stealing contacts off someone\u0027s personal phone and misusing is criminal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis situation has drastic implications for the future; if her family wants to s*** on her every achievement just because she grew up with mental illness, then the fruits of her labor will not be available for them in future as well. This is her own decision and strategy and she has voluntarily requested to learn a few new tricks to add to her growing arsenal of business related skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole problem with the toxic family started \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E I demonstrated that things like ADD, autism are \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E barriers to a person\u0027s success in studies and science. Parents started forcing her to be confined at home to do housework; she wants to go out to join the workforce and start building a career portfolio. Parents want her to squander her future salary buying property for the rest of the non-working, non-academically-performing, lazy siblings, I teach her property and people management skills; they should work for it and not expect handouts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssues like culture and religion, I won\u0027t discuss here due to the sensitivity, but there are certain religious principles that remind people to welcome all cultures/races. The funny thing is while the \u0027younger\u0027 generation seems to have a bone to pick with me, the partner\u0027s grandparents seem to have taken a curiosity towards us and regularly asks how I am doing. This is funny, because isn\u0027t it the other way around - the younger generations are more open, etc? Strange world, but I don\u0027t hold it against them; not everyone has the same upbringing or desire to neutralize cultural boundaries but in this case I find it the right thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople should not be looking down on those with special needs, restricting them to the home, not teaching them anything to control their disorders, not sending them for treatment. When I found my partner she had violent tendencies and was at risk of causing physical harm to self and others but within a few months these all gone away. I am curious why, if I can say a few nice things and teach her to be positive about her issues and to see them as a unique way of thinking differently - why has no one else done the same?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats why I like to be with her - for humanitarian and security reasons, sentiments very much appreciated and loved by the other party. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll write more and reply in more detail later but I\u0027ll just leave this here for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
