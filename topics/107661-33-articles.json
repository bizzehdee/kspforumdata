No expectation for you to fix this, but thought you might be interested.\n\n*edit:* Did a little poking around in the source. in xScienceEventHandler it does a refresh every second whenever the players science amount changes or science is sent to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. In Kerbalism, the data is transmitted constantly, so those events both fire constantly but just far enough apart so [x] is refreshing just about every second or two the entire time (could be minutes long or longer). The faster the data transmission speed (so closer to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E), the more pronounced it is. Changing lines 257 and 263 to use (false, 5) instead of () stops the stutter entirely during transmission, as it delays the refresh until it\u0027s all done.

No expectation for you to fix this, but thought you might be interested.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *edit:* Did a little poking around in the source. in xScienceEventHandler it does a refresh every second whenever the players science amount changes or science is sent to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. In Kerbalism, the data is transmitted constantly, so those events both fire constantly but just far enough apart so [x] is refreshing just about every second or two the entire time (could be minutes long or longer). The faster the data transmission speed (so closer to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E), the more pronounced it is.
