To rule out any issue with my final comparison, I did a fresh install of 0.25 and 0.90 in different folders with zero mods and let each generate default config files. Opened config files and aside from a few new keybinds and 1 new graphic setting everything is identical by default. I tried running in OpenGL, DX9 and DX11 and all have the same results. Tried 32bit and 64bit. Conclusion: KSP 0.90 runs ~25% slower than 0.25 in all scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T21:26:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hazens1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inglonias","CreatedById":2460,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this will cease to be an issue later today as I move back home to my gaming rig, my laptop at school is almost completely failing to run KSP .90, whereas it was only sort of failing to run 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the computer I\u0027m using: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834312933\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834312933\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm the FPS drops.
