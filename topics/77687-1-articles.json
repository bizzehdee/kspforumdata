So far I\u0027ve achieved around 7m/s rate of climb. However, the craft tends to drift its heading, requiring constant attention to keep it on course. I\u0027ve tried changing the wing\u0027s dihedral, different placement of center of lift vs center of mass, and turning SAS on or off, but no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way I can make this thing never drift off the vertical, so that I can just weight down the Q key and have this thing fly up by itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.T Marcus","CreatedById":86085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T06:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm if I am picturing this correctly I think I may have a question for you, Is it\u0027s center of lift vertically in-line with it\u0027s center of mass?

A single monolithic rotor is always gonna be dynamically unstable due to asymmetric lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay your craft has four blades and is moving vertically upwards, and for some reason or another your rotor disc is tilted slightly to one side. The blade 90 degrees before the high point on the disc is moving slightly upwards, and the the blade 90 degrees after the high point is moving downwards. The upwards-traveling blade is moving slightly faster relative to the airstream, so it generates more lift. This lift manifests as an increase in the tilt of the rotor, which will quickly flip the whole thing over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelicopters have to deal with this too, but the cyclic control allows the pilot to correct for the asymmetric lift. Without a similar mechanism, control will be very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.T Marcus","CreatedById":86085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T06:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm I don\u0027t think the stock KSP aero-model simulates this as you described it, so perhaps there could be a way to design a rotating propulsion system to carry a payload... but I think the payload may need a torque module on the underbelly, that last part may of been what you were saying with helicopter payload arrest systems only explained less elegantly lol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goduranus","CreatedById":112154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T06:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP dos simulate the effect Knizzle had described, I think, as it occurres due to wing lift being proportional to speed. Controlling the cyclic in KSP is pretty easy though, but correcting it through a 4 hour climb from the depths of Jool is tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get home today I will try adding some drag sources(intakes or vertically placed) above the rotor disk, perhaps that\u0027ll drag the axis of rotating back to vertical when the thing starts sliding to the side?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.T Marcus","CreatedById":86085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T06:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould you consider using mods?
