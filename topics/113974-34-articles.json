That, as it happens, is [\u003Cfont color=\u0022#37588a\u0022\u003Eexactly\u003C/font\u003E](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040402098830408) the case. Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, or CL-20, was developed as a highly energetic, compact, and efficient explosive. What makes it unusual is not that it blows up \u2013 go find me a small hexa-N-nitro compound that doesn\u2019t \u2013 but that it doesn\u2019t actually blow up immediately, early, and often. No, making things that go off when someone down the hall curses at the coffee machine, that\u2019s no problem. Making something like this that can actually be handled and stored is a real accomplishment.  \n\nNot that it\u2019s what you\u2019d call a perfect compound in that regard \u2013 despite a lot of effort, it\u2019s still not quite ready to be hauled around in trucks.

Yes, this is an example of something that becomes *less explosive* as a one-to-one cocrystal with TNT.

Now, if you complain that this one doesn\u2019t have enough nitro groups in it then there\u2019s something wrong with you, but apparently there are still those who look at this structure and say \u201CDang, not explosive enough\u201D. Recall that this is the compound whose cocrystal with TNT is *actually less dangerous*than the pure starting material itself, and yeah, I know that sounds like the guy at the pet store packing a starved Komodo dragon into the carrier with your new dog, just to calm him down some. But there it is.\u0022\n\n\u0022The experimental section of the paper is worth a read, and again, you can tell that Matzger\u2019s group has good technique because everyone made it intact to the writing of the manuscript. There are pictures of the crystals themselves, which are very nice, until you realize that they\u2019re plotting to blow you into the ceiling crawl space at the first opportunity.
