It would make things really confusing if people could just swap usernames whenever they want to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically you have only one option: Live with your current username (I don\u0027t really see any problems with it tbh if that helps). Registering under another name with a different mail adress counts as having several accounts and is not allowed. I could be wrong though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T22:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/110713-the-name-change-thread-warning-one-time-only/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
