The problem is the end.. I have no ladder that can reach down past the engines and lander legs. Now.. in the past to solve this problem ive always just hacked gravity, but.. im making the effort to do a land and return so I don\u0027t want to skimp out on something so trivial. So.. out of ALL the mods.. which has the tallest ladders? Im currently using AIES. The stock ones are a bit longer, but I need a good 20 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T14:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t you construct some platform ending at the same height as your engine bells? and from there on use a normal ladder?
