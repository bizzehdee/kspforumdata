So I jacked up the garage walls and poured lightweight concrete under the edge with rebar, and the poured light weight concrete on Styrofoam sections (IIRC 4\u0027x1.5\u0022x15\u0022; stack as needed) with occasional beam. I was really conservative about concrete use because of the weight and expense, and so the top-slab tended to range 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm). I did this in order to keep the weight of the material down, the soil in our area is more or less a spongy mud so you don\u0027t want to put alot of force on one side of the foundation. During the last 2 \u003Cem\u003Ehurricane\u003C/em\u003E, my wheels were bone dry. Worked so well I jacked up the adjacent slab and slid Styrofoam 1/2\u0022 x 4\u0027 x 8\u0027 sheets underneath and compressed sand to fill and that hasn\u0027t lost level in 10 years. Given one had moved 12\u0022 in 45yr and the other 6\u0022 (3\u0027 of tilt) in 45yr I would say its holding quite well. The stability I attribute to the styrofoam, it absolutely stopped wicking and I believe the wicking between rains was causing the soil to deorganify faster and shrink. It also absorbs shifts better than concrete (which tends to crack). I was sure the floor would crack and subside where the Styrofoam was, but to date no cracks, got a fully loaded pleasure boat wheels and a car wheels setting on it so . . . .yeah styro holds. Smartest thing you can do if you have to build up on soft soils. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo an experiment yourself. Take a long pipe and a flat piece of Styrofoam (shipper foam will do), seal a cap on one end of the pipe, hold it strait up on the styrofoam and add water to the other end (or get help) you will see that it will take alot of water. You can remove the pipe and see how much the stryofoam has given, your are probably going to have to buy another section of pipe before it seriously damages the stryofoam. Now imagine the weight if you had a room filled with that much water (and proportional weight of pipe). When they pour the concrete on the foam beads there will be some dimpling (small rocks, aeration damage, etc) but after that it will resist compression. Where you will see perturbations of the foam is on the bottom, where roots, critters, cracks and deformations of the soil occur. If that was your concrete slab, there would be a good chance it would have cracked, the stryo is a buffer between the hideous DoT forces that occur underground and your slabs desire not to be bent or twisted (it only likes to be compressed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T06:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t forget you have to multiply by 9.81 m/s^2 to get the force in Newtons... kg is a unit of mass.\u003Cp\u003E75 kN/m^2 is a unit of force per surface area- of pressure.
