That isn\u0027t very realistic lol. The real asteroid belt is so sparse that even if you were standing on let\u0027s say Ceres for instance. The closest asteroid you\u0027d see would be a moving dot like satellites in our sky.. if that. Only in movies and planetary rings ( only Saturn really ) have those dense fields. If that were the case and our asteroid belt was that thick then yes it\u0027d be visible as a gray line in our sky.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T16:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Proot","CreatedById":98932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T17:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking for ways to make a non-physical asteroids belt a bit beyond of Eeloo, right now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could get that the detail of the texture (not the main texture that wraps the objects) would produce collisions if a ship passes through.

A ring around a moon would be inherently unstable. It might last a few millenia, but I couldn\u0027t see long term rings around any moon.
