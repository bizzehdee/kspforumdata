Renaissance compilation has the requirement of other mods to run (Environmental Visual Effects (EVE) for the clouds and city lights effects and Texture Replacer (to change kerbal faces, hair, suits, planet textures, skybox), PlanetShine to get a nice reflective effect of the planet on your vehicle, RSS to get rid of the white horizon, Custom Asteroids for Rings around planets, Distant Object Enhancement for more accurate skybox rendering when looking into the sun (no visible stars due to brightness)). Guess it just depends on how big your GameData folder and the memory footprint gets, but I had it (Renaissance) installed with a few other mods and crashed constantly from memory restrictions. ATM completely reduces this (I have 23 mods installed currently, including Renaissance and over 1Gb of overhead on RAM right now w/ATM.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also depends on what exactly you want. Renaissance includes Rings around Jool and some other things to space as well. Some of these mods can be left out if you just want a \u0022stock\u0022 look with enhanced visuals and clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be to install everything without ATM and try to load up and see...if you crash due to memory, install ATM BASIC and test again. My guess is the BASIC pack of ATM will do, as it doesn\u0027t sound like you plan on installing much else in the way of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- I strongly dislike the lens flare effect, if a mod implements them and they can\u0027t be disabled then I\u0027m not interested.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERenaissance has a lens flare effect, but I don\u0027t believe the .assets file is the same in .90 as it was in .25 (you have to change a .assets file in the KSP_Data folder to install the lens flare) so it wouldn\u0027t work.
