Your system is dual core which means two cores. Unless you have a multi cpu motherboard which I doubt you have since they are mainly used in servers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour issue is mainly the weak cpu. Ksp is cpu intensive because most physics based calculations are done on one core. Therefor cpus that have high amount of instructions per cycle are the best for this type of game. Those would be the high end intel cpus like the i5 and i7 versions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second issue is your graphics card which is really low end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet for better frames is an upgrade in the cpu and gpu departement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
