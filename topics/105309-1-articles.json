To seperate the base of the fairings prior to going interplanetary, you would need to put fairings around ALL of your interplanetary vessel, thus making them unessessarily large, adding more mass to fight gravity at liftoff.\n\nAs it currently is, the optimum (and really only reasonable use) of fairings is to release relatively small volume payloads into orbit.\n\nI\u0027m kind of on the fence with this one. On the one hand, I think programming design that limits gameplay possibilities is wasteful, especially in a sandbox game.
