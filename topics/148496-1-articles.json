When lifting from Duna reducing drag\u00A0matters little, from Eve it is essential. From Kerbin\u00A0it is quite important. Let\u0027s talk about Kerbin though as I suspect that\u0027s mostly what you are interested in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can overbuild your rocket and, as long as the\u00A0stages aren\u0027t stupidly un-aerodynamic, you can usually get your craft into space.

This means a nosecone at the top of each stack, using the same diameter parts downwards or where they get fatter or thinner to use a tapered adapter (preferably one filled with fuel). If they are just tanks then putting a nosecone on the bottom helps too. A few longer stacks is usually more efficient than lots of short ones.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne biggy to watch for is extra bits stuck on. These can produce a lot of drag.
