In fact, windows recognises 2 different devices, as seen here:\n\n![Q2QIDfr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q2QIDfr.jpg)\n\nThe problem is that, when I\u0027m binding the axis, KSP thinks they are the same device, mixing the inputs..., so one of them is useless. This happened before (in 0.90), but I dodged the problems using the Advanced Fly By Wire mod, that worked perfectly since the start.\n\nThis is how the config file looks like: (ignore the fact that they are both controlling the pitch, it was just a test to map the same axis from both devices)\n\n    AXIS_PITCH{\tPRIMARY\t{\t\tname = Saitek Pro Flight X-55 R. (MADE USING THE STICK)\t\taxis = 1\t\tinv = False\t\tsensitivity = 1\t\tdeadzone = 0.05\t\tscale = 1\t\tgroup = 0\t\tmodeMask = 7\t}\tSECONDARY\t{\t\tname = Saitek Pro Flight X-55 R. (MADE USING THE THROTTLE)\t\taxis = 1\t\tinv = False\t\tsensitivity = 1\t\tdeadzone = 0.05\t\tscale = 1\t\tgroup = 0\t\tmodeMask = 7\t}\n\nAlso, on input devices only one is shown:\n\nINPUT\\_DEVICES\n\n    {\tSaitek Pro Flight X-55 R. = 0}\n\nThe joystick gives correct values in windows, and works in games like DCS and War Thunder, being recognised instantly without anything else to do.\n\nI used some workarounds before, with virtual joysticks, but I think it\u0027s not the way to go in a 1.0 release!\n\nThanks in advance for the time and help :-)\n\n**edit:** Also, I get about 1 second lag from the inputs -.-. This was a known issue back in previous versions, apparently between Saitek software and Unity. Anyway, must be doable to fix, considering it was fixed perfectly by a mod in previous versions (Advanced Fly By Wire mod).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T18:19:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by m1sz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Megadyptes","CreatedById":97435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:40:55Z","Content":"Yeah, having exactly the same problem."},{"CreatedByName":"jfjohnny5","CreatedById":64610,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:14:37Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to add my voice to this one.

I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because it truncates the stick name. There is another issue with configuration as well, if you remove the joystick and try to assign another one, the control assign interface will freeze up. You either have to manually edit the old stick out of your configuration, or delete the whole thing. To add into some of what others are saying, being able to edit your controls while IN-GAME would be, should be, a feature as well. It\u0027s a huge nuisance to have to back up all the way to the main menu to make a button change, it should AT LEAST be available from the space center."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiana","CreatedById":107476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:03:49Z","Content":"I also have the same issue, as it isn\u0027t just a particular set of the Saitek family.
