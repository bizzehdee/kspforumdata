However, we obviously still have gas-powered cars (like the Crawler and those various vehicles that drive around the construction buildings), so would it be possible to make a wheel that consumes a small amount of fuel to run early on? It would help with rovering early on, and later on it could still be useable in the same way that a fuel cell can be used instead of an RTG.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor operation in zero atmosphere conditions, it would have to run LF\u002BO, which would be a vastly more complex and advanced piece of technology than either an electric motor or a normal internal combustion piston engine operating on atmospheric oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I say \u0022NO\u0022 to this. Additionally, I don\u0027t think you can reasonably assume that the various vehicles you see running around the space center are actually running on IC engines. They could very easily be electric vehicles. The unseen crawler most likely would use IC engines, due to the power needed to move large rockets, but more likely diesel-electric (so still electric motors driving the wheels/tracks, or possibly diesel-hydraulic) than diesel-mechanical (mechanical transmission does not scale up nearly as well as hydraulic or electrical transmission).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what you\u0027d want is a Generator part that converts liquid fuel \u002B atmospheric air into electricity the same way the fuel cell converts liquid fuel and oxidiser into electricity.
