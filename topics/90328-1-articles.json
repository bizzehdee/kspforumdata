Regolith\u0027s real end goal is to provide modders with a framework for handling resource harvesting - both planetary as well as asteroidal - along with a handy replacement for the stock module generator (and one that will continue to process even if your ship is not focused, similar to TAC-LS). Reference implementations of Regolith can be found in all of the 0.90\u002B USI mods, and there will be API documentation forthcoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo why another resource system?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally I used ORS. Which rocks (and still rocks - there would be no Karbonite without ORS). Then I extended it. Then forked it. Then extended it some more. And with some of the plans I have, realized that it had hit a point where I needed a new foundation. Some examples of subsystems I want in a resource system that I did not have in ORS-X (my fork) and by extension ORS include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No reliance on PNGs (it was making support for stuff like StarSystems, etc. tough)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Variable and depletable resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More player-resource interactivity (fracking, prospecting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More robust animation and particle effect support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Support for dependent parts (asteroids) as well as drill bit orientation (ala Kethane)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the design behind Regolith is all about extensibility and interoperability. So first and foremost on the list is how to deal cleanly with multiple mods who may have very different ideas on composition. etc. (i.e. is Jool a ball of Karbonite or a ball of Hydrogen?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, it brings together the actual converters that we use for resource acquisition (drilling and mining) and the converters used for transformation (ISRU modules). So there\u0027s a very consistent feel between these. At the end of the day, whether we\u0027re harvesting or converting, it\u0027s still all about taking stuff and making other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Here\u0027s a quick demo showing a Regolith implementation for asteroids)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZG5wh5f8yo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go forth, find bees, and enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: CC 4.0 BY-SA-NC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGithub Repo (source): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/Regolith\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/Regolith\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/Regolith/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/Regolith/releases\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T02:42:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T02:58:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eawesome, so is this going to replace art?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: first!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T03:00:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by endl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Contagano","CreatedById":111364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T03:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFreaking awesome!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamuchi","CreatedById":110857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T03:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds promising and just intime as I\u0060m about to setup for a permanent vessel on an asteroid as a base, now it doesn\u0060t needs big fuel delivers and top off when small planes come \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, this makes capturing E class abit easier aswell for my next project \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T04:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eone word: DAYUMMM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso are you going to make asteroid habitats like what dtobi was doing with his asteroid cities mod before he discontinued all his stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T04:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Helix935\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Helix935\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eone word: DAYUMMM\u003Cp\u003Ealso are you going to make asteroid habitats like what dtobi was doing with his asteroid cities mod before he discontinued all his stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be rebooting asteroid cities with Dtobi\u0027s blessing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But I wanted to get a common foundation down first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T04:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is very cool.
