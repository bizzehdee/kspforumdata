You know, dropping the rocket from the wing of an airplane, igniting the engines, etc. When I would try to mount the rocket under a wing, I would always run into some complications, whether it be explosions during separation or the part just not wanting to stick on properly. Do I make the rocket in a subassembly or merge two craft files?

start with, I\u0027ve never gotten the whole \u0022merge\u0022 thing to work right so I use regular subassemblies instead. \u00A0The whole process would go like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1. \u00A0Build the Pegasus by Itsel\u003C/u\u003Ef\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesign and build this in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E as if it\u0027s the only thing you\u0027re going to build. \u00A0This will eventually become a subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2. \u00A0Attach a Hardpoint to the Pegasus\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPut this on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Pegasus so the aerodynamic loads of the Pegasus don\u0027t try to twist it off. \u00A0The hardpoint will separate between itself and the Pegasus leaving no residue on the Pegasus. \u00A0It blocks crossfeed so the Pegasus will have full tanks when dropped, and it has an ejection force to toss the Pegasus clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E3. \u00A0Create the Pegasus Subassembly\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttach any other part (such as a small box girder) to the top of the hardpoint opposite the Pegasus. \u00A0This extra\u00A0part is just to facilitate making the subassembly so it doesn\u0027t matter what it is. \u00A0Now use the re-root tool to make this extra part the root of the Pegasus. \u00A0Open the subassembly creation page in the editor. \u00A0Now grab the hardpoint and pull it and the whole Pegasus below it off the extra part. \u00A0Drag this assembly over to the subassembly creation box and save it. \u00A0The Pegasus subassembly is now complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E4. \u00A0Build the Carrier Plane\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStart a new ship and build the carrier plane (or open a pre-existing plane).

the wing of the carrier plane. \u00A0The subassembly will be able to attach to the carrier plane only by the top end of the hardpoint (thanks to the re-rooting done above). \u00A0Attach the subassembly under the wing. \u00A0This will add the hardpoint\u0027s decoupler and the Pegasus\u0027 engine to the staging menu of the carrier. \u00A0Move these as needed so they don\u0027t conflict with the engines of the carrier plane. \u00A0I would recommend putting the hardpoint and the Pegasus engine together in the same stage, separate from and above the stage with the carrier engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E6. \u00A0Save the Combined Carrier/Pegasus\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0027t do any merging. \u00A0Just save the whole thing as you normally
