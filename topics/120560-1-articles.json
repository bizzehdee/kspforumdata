Upon asking about the propulsion method, I was told that the ship used massive particle accelerators to generate matter-antimatter pairs which actually had more mass in total than the starting matter. Enough of this new matter was collected to sustain the particle accelerators, while the rest would be electromagnetically propelled away. I don\u0027t pretend to understand anything about quantum physics, but is something akin to this technically possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T02:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a truly incredible story.

The you put more energy into accelerate them. With out the energy input they vanished back into vacuum space. you would have to be very fast though, because these appear at 10E-43 second and are gone just as fast. The pair are actually not free, the energy you put into capture them is minimally two photons of high energy. you only get that energy back if they annihilate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should add that this is theoretically possible because it is possible to create high energy photons without using antimatter as the source, and you coukd calculate the minimum hv require for pair production, but if you are dreaming, why not create a proton anti-proton, as these have more momentum your push off mass will be be greater. in this dream you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecalculate the spectrum and perfect incident angles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou create two photon sources, you incrase hv a little over desired\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou scatter the frequency a little therefore creating a perfect beam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe collision happens every time, followed by two massive EM fields that project the charge to contaiment field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are kept only momentarily and fed into the particle accelerator, the ship is very long and the charges are accelerated GeV energy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one problem with the dream. We don\u0027t know how to make the proton making photons by any conventional method, the photons themselves are highly coorosive and prefer to interact with matter, so. The other problem is high a accelerators are heavy abd need alot of cooling which means alot of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T13:15:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
