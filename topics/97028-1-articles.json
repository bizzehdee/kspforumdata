That\u0027s a new thing certainly. Will make driving them less annoying, but also give less reason to take a Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for crew reports, for as long as I can remember there has been no requirement for the command pod to be \u003Cem\u003Eoccupied\u003C/em\u003E to take them.
