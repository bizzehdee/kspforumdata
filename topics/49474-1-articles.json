These should be some rockets and some cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese rockets should be the basic system. And depending on the mission I am going to start I\u0027d like to add some different assemblies, like a moon lander, a satalite or something like this. But It seems that I am not able to combine these parts later on, since the game won\u0027t find a point at the parts at which it can join them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some kind of tutorial or someone able to help me building my assaemblies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the End it should look like something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.youngmusic.de/bilder/kerbal-subassembly.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbal-subassembly.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Module will be the part that stays controlled by me. The Rocket part will be decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone can help or tell me with what parts to beginn and in which order of parte to continue building then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T17:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can attach subassemblies radially to eachother as there are no attachment nodes.

This rocket won\u0027t be flyable though - very hard to keep stable with your center of mass all to one side. Put that little pod ship on top of your middle rocket (get rid of the cone on the middle one) and put a decoupler there and you\u0027ll be golden. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use subassemblies when I have a successful lifter that I\u0027ve put a lot of work into to make it stable. I name it with the approx amount of weight it can lift or its dV. I also use subassemblies for successful science probes (when I\u0027ve added a bunch of stuff to a probe and have it balanced and tuned). I haven\u0027t gotten to subassemblies for middle stages yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roosterr","CreatedById":61317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T23:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cannot create my first subassembly with more than one part.
