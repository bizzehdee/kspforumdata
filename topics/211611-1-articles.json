It\u0027s close to this video\u0027s version of the NGAD. I\u0027m curious if they ever take ideas from this game or are the potentials what the games parts are based on? I think I had a more or completely tailess version also. The whole point was delta V shaped wings like this. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not that original, but it would be interesting if that is seen now given how popular games have been for so many generations now. I\u0027ve played online with people working in MIT projects and other places and had conversation and spit ball session on various projects in the past. It\u0027s pretty common depending on who you used to run into in a game or whatnot. Let alone a public forum like this. Edit: I even called it idgad. But I don\u0027t think it was related to ngad. It has some stupid acronym I forget behind it. But that was 2016 and ngad was 2014 unless the name came later. But I may have started the design farther back than 1.2. That is just when this varient was made and it\u0027s not the first. It was my farvorite plane design for quite a while. Edit2: IDGAD meant \u0022I don\u0027t give a damn.\u0022 It was my name for a random build I started way back for fun as I couldn\u0027t think of something to make. It started with a potentially tailless delta win just like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I started it in 2016(not sure): I wonder if NGAD also means Not Giving A Damn. 8) (on top of Next generation air dominance.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed339978488\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30639-sstos-post-your-pictures-here~/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2777733\u0026amp;embedComment=2777733\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:295px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CyP4usB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CyP4usB.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sWyYtLVo_PI?start=621\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Why the NGAD is more like the F-111 than you think\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, beside yaw problems a little. That design is insanely stable with auto conrtrols as it has minimal need for trim and flies perfectly straight if you go by it\u0027s horizontal aim. Even after taking off the V shaped tails, which probably help with yaw, it\u0027s minimal on the roll/pitch needs. With the ability to fine control this once you get the nose set this things is rock solid. Must be interesting on a real one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vrlsaif.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vrlsaif.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can even get to orbit fairly easiy. I can see why it\u0027s good at high altitude cruising.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also did manage to do variable geometry tail surfaces on my bigger transport vehicle, which was also originally and idgad line of my ships. I might be able to do the same for the wings for an F14 like plane or similar. I think I saw someone else do this and a transformable macross one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-20T21:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2023 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
