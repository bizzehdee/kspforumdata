Flying your rocket improperly can have a huge effect on your initial sub-orbit. Ideally you want to pitch over slightly and let gravity and aerodynamics tilt your rocket toward St he horizon so that you are basically horizontal at about 36km. This should result in a nice gentle slope that goes at least halfway around the planet and requires no more than 1km/s of dV.

A steeper ascent with a large circularisation burn minimises drag losses but maximises gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most circumstances drag losses are massively outweighed by gravity losses, so you\u0027re better off using the flatter ascent. A gravity turn is designed to get you quickly out of the thick lower atmosphere, but then flatten off afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as you\u0027ve noticed, one of the exceptions to that is when your craft is too unwieldy to be easily controlled in the lower atmosphere.

It is very, very difficult to do by hand without producing a completely misshapen orbit that would cost a load of extra fuel to boot. Even veteran players and autopilot addons generally don\u0027t bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo generally, fly the \u0022raise apoapsis to 75km, coast, circularize\u0022 style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as you get better at the game, you\u0027ll discover that something magical is happening: your coasting phases become shorter and shorter, and you spend more and more time burning in the atmosphere and require less and less dV to circularize after the coast. Effectively you coasting trajectory becomes closer and closer to the ideal continuous burn trajectory. You\u0027ll never quite get there completely, but you can get so close that the difference in fuel efficiency is a mere footnote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to raise your velocity to about 2200 m/s at a 75km apoapsis in order to lift the periapsis out of the atmosphere. Your circularization burn at apoapsis will be whatever the difference between your current speed and that target speed is. Therefore, the faster you are already going at apoapsis, the smaller your circularization maneuver will be. Going fast at apoapsis requires pitching over early and flying relatively flat (but not too early and flat!).

For example, if you are going 1000 m/s (and thus need to burn 1200 m/s at apoapsis), that\u0027s not good and leaves a lot of room for improvement. If you are going 1500 m/s, that\u0027s decent. If you\u0027re going 2000 m/s (and thus need to burn only 200 m/s to circularize), that\u0027s very good and you can congratulate yourself on excellent piloting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, ManuxKerb: what slows you down on your way towards apoapsis is not so much air resistance, which largely stops above 30km, but rather gravity. And you do not lose that speed permanently either. In space, everything you lose on the way \u0022up\u0022 to apoapsis, you will always get back on your way \u0022down\u0022 to periapsis. You can easily see this effect happen if you for example keep your periapsis at 75km but lift your apoapsis out to beyond the Mun\u0027s orbit. You\u0027ll be going very fast at periapsis, very slow at apoapsis, then very fast at periapsis again... the more eccentric (elongated) your orbit is, the greater the speed difference between periapsis and apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T13:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ManuxKerb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to achive orbit, so i need a periapsis of 73 or above.

I usually fly my rockets manually so that they need less than 100 m/s for circularization. Note that you need to throttle down quite a bit in the upper atmosphere for that to work. Coasting starts above 65km altitude.
