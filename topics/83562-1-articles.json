Even following all the good advice above, you\u0027ll still meet the Kraken from time to time and sometimes, as in my case here, quicksaving early and often won\u0027t save you. So just accept it as inevitable that periodically your game will be ruined in whole or in part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason not to be scared of this, however, is that starting over is pretty routine and will remain so until KSP reaches its final form. While KSP\u0027s still in the alpha-beta stage, the frequent game updates will either break your save, break the mods the save relies on, or introduce new features that make you want to start over anyway so you can play with them instead of continuing what you\u0027ve already got, even if it survives the update. So, because you\u0027ll probably be starting over every couple of months anyway, having to start over in between updates due to a Kraken attack really isn\u0027t a burden.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
