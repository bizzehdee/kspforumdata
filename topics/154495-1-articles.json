I\u00A0agree when i get to the point of landings it is so going to be an epic pain. Probably gonna build a super lander to handle the Mun/Minmus run in one shot. I\u0027m still at the \u0022haul them to orbit and back\u0022 stage which is fairly easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-05T22:47:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2017 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T00:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222911834\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483655862\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222645\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Carl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Carl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s nothing time to rewards that matches mass tourists, (playtime anyway), some contracts can pay more sure, but your still going to have to send a ship places to go do them, thats still going to take time, and you can;t stack as many of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatellites missions are pretty \u0022stackable\u0022 \u00A0in the sense that you can launch several satellite at once or/and use the same satellite for several missions . \u00A0After launching it takes maybe a minute or so of actual playtime for matching a orbit. A trick I use its to change the satellite name to include the remaining deltaV so I don\u0027t take a mission to reposition a satellite without propulsion.
