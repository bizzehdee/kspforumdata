Ignoring how it would ever be created with this rotation speed, would it be possible for a planet to have such a fast rotation to have an apparent gravity of zero (or even negative)? At first, I\\\u0027m thinking no, because the mass that is spinning too fast to be held down by gravity would just be flung off into space. However, rock is fairly solid from my experience, so if the planet were created, allowed to harden into a ball of rock, then spun up to a necessary speed to cancel gravity, would it still fly apart?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Strange","CreatedById":12742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-31T21:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe it would work theoretically.
