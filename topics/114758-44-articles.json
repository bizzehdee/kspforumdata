I have been able to set up awesome bases on the mun and on minmus. The new wheels look great, and while i love the new central hub i was able to build a similar one, with some stock parts. I can build a fully functional base in as little as two launches. I have read most of the suggestions and would like to see some of them implemented. btw the IVA\u0027s are awesome. I would recommend however for your triple base, to increase the diameter not the part bottom but the top, as it will prevent parts from merging. I would send pictures then i can figure out how to do so on a mac. more to follow.
