When I read the description I thought you meant a button to switch better VAB and SPH without having to go to space center. This is not as trivial of a change as it sounds because if you are building a rover, you can launch it from either VAB or SPH and editor extension plugin won\u0027t change launch location (only building symmetry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T16:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...and editor extension plugin won\u0027t change launch location (only building symmetry)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErrr, it is certainly meant to change the launch location.
