There is one downside though. Unless you have the plugins to change the settings, Sketchup will delete/remove textures, resize and change the axis (rotation) of parts. So you may end up with the wrong sizes and no textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you can model in Sketchup and then use Blender or some other program to texture and export back into KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
