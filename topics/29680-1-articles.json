I honestly thought it was going to be a step up from a flash game. I was so so wrong lol. I\u0027ve managed to explode dozens of ships on the launchpad, got into orbit once by luck, and ... that\u0027s about it. It\u0027s just enough to motivate me to learn how to control it instead of goofing around \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T01:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you\u0027ve been enjoying the game. It is one of those games that sort of tricks you into thinking it\u0027s going to be easier than it is at first glance, but the pride of accomplishment is certainly worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d definitely recommend that you check out the Drawing Board (link in my sig) as you\u0027re learning, as it has a number of tutorials that help explain some of the most basic principles of getting rockets into space and getting them to stay there. Once you can get into orbit consistently, you\u0027ll be ready to tackle bigger and better things -- as they say, \u0022Once you\u0027re in orbit, you\u0027re halfway to anywhere.\u0022 Don\u0027t be afraid to ask questions in the How To section as well. If you just want to show off your progress, too, you can post your most memorable missions in the Mission Reports thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farnswerth","CreatedById":68125,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T15:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Right now I\u0027m entirely too proud of getting into orbit close to where I intended lol.
