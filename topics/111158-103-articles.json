The queue fills at roughly 2-10 posts per hour and must be cleared out several times per day.\n\nWe receive anywhere from zero to perhaps 10 reports per day, which we review, discuss amongst ourselves, and either leave alone or act upon. The action may include moving, warning, or warning and hiding from public view, or it may call for a reply. Less commonly, it might be split into a new thread, or merged into an existing one. Several times per week for those.  \n\nWe also each read a fair fraction of the forum\u0027s content ourselves, and actually find more issues that way than are reported to us. Threads submitted to the wrong subs, for example, are more often found by mods than reported to us. We move between zero and 10 of these per day. \n\nWhen we can, we also greet new members and answer player\u0027s questions about the game and the forum. \n\nI myself typically spend 1-4 hours per day on these activities."},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T04:33:22Z","Content":"[@Tex](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75164-tex/) you should come and hang out in the forum games!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mjp1050","CreatedById":159323,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T04:46:46Z","Content":"I notice that both [@eloquentJane](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-eloquentjane/) and [@Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/) are moderators (congratulations to the both of you!), but they weren\u0027t last week, so I have to ask: Are you currently recruiting moderators?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T05:18:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 26 minutes ago, Mjp1050 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I notice that both [@eloquentJane](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-eloquentjane/) and [@Dman979](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123837-dman979/) are moderators (congratulations to the both of you!), but they weren\u0027t last week, so I have to ask: Are you currently recruiting moderators?\n\u003E \n\nYes we are.
