The apparent value of a unit of ElectricCharge varies wildly depending on what kind of part one looks at. I was thinking of doing a mod with a ModuleManager rune that would adjust (eg) all parts\u0027 energy storage by a like factor so if they were balanced relative to stock parts, they would remain balanced in that way. (Then, presumably, it would turn out to break some specific mod parts which would need special treatment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we ask ourselves, how much is a unit of ElectricCharge? (In particular, I bet there is at least one hilarious error in what follows - point it out to me?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar energy flux near Earth (and hence near Kerbin?) is circa 1400W/m^2; 30% efficiency would give us 400W/m^2. However, the ISS\u0027s arrays produce 100W/m^2 when it is not eclipsed. An OX-STAT is 0.3*0.5m and puts out 0.35 EC/s; that would make a unit of EC between circa 40J and 170J.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis implies that probe cores draw somewhere between 1 and 5 W (not counting torque). This doesn\u0027t seem implausible - it\u0027s in Raspberry Pi territory, say. Presumably most of the volume is reaction wheels and leftover Snacks wrappers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s pretend a unit of EC is 100J, somewhere in the middle. But round batteries have an energy density of 4 EC/kg. That\u0027s... 2kJ/kg. This is quite low compared to, say, a Tesla 85kWh (sigh units) battery which holds 560kJ/kg! (Lithium thionyl chloride batteries, actually used in aerospace, do better, but it\u0027s not a rechargable chemistry). Let\u0027s be generous and say kerbals engineer really superb solar panels and so a unit of EC on the solar scale is _200J_; now round batteries do 4kJ/kg. We would need to multiply up battery capacities by a hundred to get them into the same general efficency range as solar. Conversely, battery weights want one EC to be around 20kJ... but then that probe core draws 500W!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerospace fuel cells provide c. 500 W/kg. A KSP fuel cell array (different chemistry, mind) provides 0.075 EC/s/kg. This would make an EC around 6.6 kJ - closer to the battery scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA SNAP-27 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E as used on the Apollo missions provided about 3.3 W/kg (and this is not an atypical figure). A PB-NUK provides about 0.01 EC/s/kg, suggesting an EC is about 3kJ. Not a bad deal compared to the fuel cells, especially given you never have to refuel it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA USILS kerbal uses 0.01 EC/s for their life support needs. On the solar scale, that\u0027s 2W - pretty generous for an astronaut. On the battery scale, it\u0027s a perhaps more plausible 200W. (TACLS used 1 EC = 1kJ and on that scale a kerbal uses circa 20W with TACLS consumption, 10W with USILS). Humans are bigger than kerbals, and Skylab seems to have used circa 400W per astronaut over and above its uncrewed power consumption, so that\u0027s at least in the right ballpark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any errors in that, and any thoughts on which direction the adjustment should be done? There is something to be said for adjusting everything towards the 1kJ = 1EC convention which at least some modders have used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-11T21:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt struck me on the way home that for many purposes, the power to mass ratio of a solar panel is what matters, even if the area looks funny. It is also quite hard to find figures on the mass of solar panels, but each ISS \u0022wing\u0022 is around 1,100kg (and is 1/8 of the overall output) for 27 W/kg. A Gigantor produces 0.08 EC/s/kg. This would make an EC around 340J. However, I think I\u0027m willing to say that the ISS solar array (which also has a low output compared to what you\u0027d expect from a naive assessment of its size, solar flux, and typical efficiency) is more robust than a Gigantor (which, after all, shatters into a million pieces if you look at it funny) and the power/mass ratio isn\u0027t a total outlier compared to the power/area ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-11T23:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who does probably the most electric stuff with KSP... yeah it\u0027s totally out to lunch in stock.

The small wheel can use 0.75 EC/s, the medium one 1.35 EC/s, and the large one 1.80; between 0.009 and 0.015 EC/s/kg. This gives us anywhere between 660J and 5.5kJ per EC.

RemoteTech\u0027s root range model doesn\u0027t help much (stick a powerful antenna on Kerbin and a less powerful one on the ship), both because they cap out at the GX-128 (there isn\u0027t a super-powerful antenna to talk to weak ones at Eeloo) and because Kerbin has no ground-based electricity infrastructure other than at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

On the other hand, not\u003Cbr\u003E\nmultiplying up risks an inadvertent nerf to parts like the HECS2\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich contain a significant mass of battery. I think best to err on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nside of caution (and also before you could just stick on an OX-STAT and\u003Cbr\u003E\nrun the wheel forever) which also spares me writing a giant rune about\u003Cbr\u003E\n_which_ part to edit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course there\u0027s a gotcha here that fuel switching mods won\u0027t know\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout this.

The temperature and engineer quality affect output and EC consumption equally, so we can ignore those; so a single Drill-O-Matic might pull up 0.225 Ore/sec for 15 EC/sec. (On an asteroid, it might pull up almost 500 Ore/sec. Sigh.) That\u0027s 0.015 Ore/EC; 33 Ore/EC on an asteroid. Take the inverse; it takes 67 EC to get a unit of Ore on the best planet; 0.3 EC to get a unit of Ore on the best asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat Drill-O-Matic\u0027s cooling wants a trivial amount of EC so we won\u0027t worry about that right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Convert-O-Tron will turn 1 unit of ore and 60 EC into 0.9 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (and the corresponding volume of O) or into 2 units of monoprop, so the total cost to mine and convert one unit of Ore is circa 130 EC (planet) or 60 EC (asteroid).

If, say, the Drill-O-Matic was raised to 150 EC/s and the C-O-T to 250 (so both parts at least consumed as much electricity as their heat output), you\u0027d still only be putting in about one MW to get 60MW of fuel cell output out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem here is that a realistic profile for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E mission is (a la _The Martian_) to drop a lander for years which will then burn up the resulting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O in minutes.

This could be applied in three places; Convert-O-Tron input (but equally it can hardly be pulling in 25MW electricity to put out 250kW heat), to Convert-O-Tron output (good because at the moment you can turn about 10kg of stuff you dug up into 5kg of rocket fuel and oxidiser, which would be pretty amazing even on a planet that _is_ full of dead dinosaurs; arguably bad because it breaks \u0022mine Ore here, move it some distance, convert it there\u0022 but that was already a bad plan in stock) or to drill output.

You now pay about 500EC to convert that Ore. Decrease C-O-T output per input Ore by a factor of 75.
