The main body of the craft it attached to the cockpit via a decoupler and the cockpit has septrons to push it forwards (3 for the Mk1 cockpit, more on larger ones or small craft that go v fast in the lower atmo) and a couple to push it up. I also always have the parachute on a separate group to abort (always 0) so it can be deployed once the cockpit is clear of the craft, otherwise bad things can happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat design has saved countless Kerbals from aircraft related deaths and on a couple occasions (by angling the cockpit and firing septrons 1 by 1) has manged to get a stranded crew back home. Also on all space fairing craft the cockpit/command pod has an RCS tank (that is disabled at the start) and a couple thrusters as a last resort return option and for making re-entry adjustments once everything else has been ditched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but I kinda like designing and building escape systems. I would like to put more escape systems on stations, but it often comes down to part count limitations and stations are usually pretty safe (except the ones that aren\u0027t, but then it usually goes wrong so fast that no one has a chance to reach the escape-pods anyway!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T06:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll usualy include a pair of seperatrons and a seperator to kick the command pod off my maned rockets tied to an abort sequence. normaly not perfectly aligned to COM but close enough that the SAS can keep things stable as it blasts off at an angle.
