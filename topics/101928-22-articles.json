It\u0027s a standalone mod working with or without KAS.\n\nWinches, pipes and struts will always remain in KAS. So if you want this features, you will need KAS too.\n\nI agree that the situation can be confusing right now between KAS and KIS, especially when both mod are installed (each one using a different method for part handling). \n\nThe end goal is to remove the old storage system of KAS and update it to use KIS instead. I\u0027m working on the update but that can take some time. \n\nMeanwhile, you can use KIS for inventories, grab and attach capabilities. It can be interesting to familiarize with KIS before KAS update ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:19:25Z","Content":"Yeah, I might just do that while I wait for RT to come out so I can start my career, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:52:13Z","Content":"Hi KospY,\n\nI\u0027ve updated Universal Storage to KIS and everything is working great except one thing.\n\nThe EVA Propellent in the EVAx doesn\u0027t add to the total EVA Propellent for the kerbal.\n\nI tested the EVA Prop part included in KIS and that isn\u0027t adding to the total either.\n\nWith KAS you could select the Kerbal and the carried item and transfer between the two, but this doesn\u0027t seem possible with KIS.\n\nIf this a know problem or a new bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:04:33Z","Content":"I was just about to wonder what to put in the new service bays... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks for the 1.0 update!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:22:33Z","Content":"I was just wondering earlier today when KAS would be upgraded to 1.0, and here lookie, an even better version.

I didn\u0027t use partmodule to run my item code, I [extend the ModuleKISItem class](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/wiki/ItemPlugin), allowing me to run item code even if the part is stored.\n\nHowever, I added a new possibilty in KIS 1.1, you can now set ModuleKISItem to spawn the item part on equip. The rigidbody will be removed for technical reason, but at least the part will run normally and there will be no need to code your own item (for increasing fuel storage on equip for exemple). But keep in mind the code will only run when the part is equipped.\n\nYou can also set the part to \u0022physic\u0022, but I do not recommend it for what you want to do (eva RCS will not work correctly and the part will not follow the kerbal bones).\n\nWiki is not updated yet for 1.1 (I\u0027m working on it), but here is an exemple of what to do to enable this : \n\n     MODULE {  name = ModuleKISItem  shortcutKeyAction = equip  equipable = true   equipSlot = jetpack[B]  equipMode = part // model (default) or physic[/B]  usableFromEva = true  usableFromContainer = false  usableFromPod = true  usableFromEditor = false  useName = Refuel  equipMeshName = jetpack_base01  equipBoneName = bn_jetpack01  equipPos = (0.06,0.04,-0.09)  equipDir = (10,0,0) }\n\nEdit : \u0022equipMode = part\u0022 is also usefull for science parts, as they can\u0027t be used from another vessel/kerbal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T19:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KospY**"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:53:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For information, all KIS item currently equipped are only spawned on the kerbal as a model only.....\n\nThat works, thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAre there plans to add carried (or just equipped) resources to the Kerbal in the future or is that out of scope for the mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"KospY","CreatedById":33868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:59:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That works, thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Are there plans to add carried (or just equipped) resources to the Kerbal in the future or is that out of scope for the mod?\n\nNot sure if I understand what you mean.\n\nIf you are talking about the EVAx, just add equipMode = part to ModuleKISItem in your part config. \n\nThe part will be spawned on equip, this way the kerbal will be able to access the part resources (part is \u0022docked\u0022 to the kerbal on equip in this mode).\n\nIf you have any problem with this keep me informed.\n\nEdit : Also, KIS eva propellant is working, it\u0027s just that it need to be used differently.\n\nIt do not extend the eva fuel, It only add a way to refuel the eva pack in flight : Right click on the item in the inventory and choose \u0022Refuel\u0022 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T20:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KospY**"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorFoo","CreatedById":80711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:36:21Z","Content":"KSP crashes when attempting to attach a docking port."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:39:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...KIS eva propellant is working, it\u0027s just that it need to be used differently.\n\u003E It do not extend the eva fuel, It only add a way to refuel the eva pack in flight : Right click on the item in the inventory and choose \u0022Refuel\u0022 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI see how that works now, that is exceptionally cool! \n\nI\u0027m going to resist asking any more questions until you\u0027ve had a chance to update the wiki.
