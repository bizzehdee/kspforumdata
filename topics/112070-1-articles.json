But what I realize is that the joystick can only register 2 motions! Forward and back, and side to side. The problem is, how do I map these 2 functions to 3 types of turning (pitch, roll and yaw)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the joystick twist? If not then there is no way to turn 2 axes into 3. I would recommend returning it if possible and look at something like the Logitech extreme 3d pro for about $20-30\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
