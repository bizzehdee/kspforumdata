Something like Iron man style with partial transparency, so player would get a feeling he is inside helmet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanetary bases:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdd basic structure for base, single part with special ability to attach itself to planet surface. While base is attached it is unloaded from physics engine and every additional element that will dock to this base structure is also unloaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECareer:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrent tech tree is... bad. IMO if we would get it super simple like experience points for Kerbals, but for every single part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example if we are using basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E points for more advanced SRBs are increasing for each mission, after few missions we would unlock tier 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and have few points on tier 3. Of course for each tier we would need more points.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame with engines, tanks or wings, if you want more advanced wings you have to use planes and you have to take missions for atmospheric tasks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplayer:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf this ever happen we could have use of different frequencies in communication parts, so each player would have to allow other people to use his communication network or they would have to guess what frequencies he uses \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StupidAndy","CreatedById":171175,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-03T02:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the frequency idea for multiplayer, it could work for international sabotage or yadda,\u00A0 tech tree, everyone hates it...
