(seriously why doesn\u0027t ksp do this by default!) Anyway, I wondered if they will still fly without assymetric flameout in a totally unmodded install, if the intakes would stay arranged properly because I want to share these crafts in the spacecraft exchange. Amd would like them to work for everyone just as they work for me.
