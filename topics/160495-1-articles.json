It sounds tough, and it is, but you\u0027ll get the hang of it with some practice. Remember, if the action they want is a crew report, you\u0027ll actually need a crew. Meaning a Kerbal on board. Until you unlock the better probes, I always thought a pilot was better anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the training missions, they teach you invaluable skills you\u0027ll need in the game. They\u0027re a great way to learn, and also get a feel for flying. I did them all the way up to the docking mission. I couldn\u0027t figure it out, so I just started playing. Did my first docking in-game like 3 months later. I didn\u0027t know about this forum for over a year, unfortunately. That would\u0027ve really helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as \u0022the mod that will not be named\u0022, that would be a personal choice.

That would pretty much some up the differences in the community\u0027s feelings towards it. I don\u0027t consider it cheating the game, I just consider it cheating yourself. Doing your own flying (and learning how to do it) is incredibly rewarding, and a lot of fun.

But you will not move towards your target, because your target will not be there when you reach the point where the target currentlyis. Instead you need to \u0027lead your target\u0027, that is, go toward a point the target will be when you get there. Also the more efficient way to reach the target is often to make a small adjustment in your trajectory to result a encounter a long time later, instead of a more aggressive maneuver that make you reach the target quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223052978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494506637\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177671\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jonpfl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, jonpfl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0should I go get [\u003Cem\u003Einsert mod name here\u003C/em\u003E]?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is probably the most controversial question about KSP.
