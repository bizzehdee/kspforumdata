I must have really read the release notes wrong. Is there no in-game way to tell how draggy certain parts will feel? Or am I just not getting it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:56:41Z","Content":"Parts are now draggy based on how they look. So if something looks pointy or rounded (like a nosecone), then it probably has less drag than something blunt (like a fuel tank end).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
