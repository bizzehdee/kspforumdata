As the mission gets more ambitious the difference becomes even greater still, and pretty soon the difference between stock and RSS becomes ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock parts aren\u0027t actually that bad anyway. You can push a respectable 3% payload fraction with a 3 stage rocket. That\u0027s not quite as good as real rockets, but then you get to orbit.

It\u0027s more of an iterative process rather than putting fuel tanks of the same type together. In RSS with Realism Overhaul, you must choose what fuels to use based on size limitations, boil off rates, efficiency, and other factors. I have two separate installs to enjoy both simultaneously because I don\u0027t think that neither RSS nor stock should replace each other. Why not both? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It\u0027s also fun with Realism Overhaul because you can choose from real life engines with real stats, and you feel like you\u0027re a real engineer, sort of. The burn to orbits are also different because instead of reaching an apoapsis and circularizing from there, most real life launches are done all at once with the engines burning the whole time, because engine restarts can get complicated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T05:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll the ISPs are adjusted up.
