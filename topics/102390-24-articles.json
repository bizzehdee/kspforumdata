Basically, build something that can propell 15 tons at 1.45 TWR with at least 4000 dV, and you are done. And parachutes, at least one for each 4 ton of empty total rocket weight. No boosters, nothing that separates. Ofc, this limits rocket total capacity, but most payload falls within 15-20 tons - rest can be assembled in orbit.  \n\nSuch a rocket costs about 10-15k to launch, if you manage to land it near KSC - you get 80-95% cashback.\n\nUsually I can combine -  1-2 Kerbin orbit rescue with 2-4 tourists (space tourism pak), which bring 100k-200k in.\n\nAlso, launching asporagus-style satellite into polar orbit of the mun with OKTO and science exactly to cash on \u0022measure xxx above/below xxx meters at mun\u0022. Thats pure 100k from contract.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T23:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal101**"},{"CreatedByName":"bonesbro","CreatedById":104036,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T06:00:38Z","Content":"Some good ideas there Kerbal101.

That $BaseConstruction flag is meant to be to stop the rover missions and the create base missions from generating at the same time (because otherwise the rover can end up all over the place).\n\nIn your case, it looks like you never completed BaseCreate so the flag never got turned off again. (You probably just built the base without waiting for the contract I\u0027m guessing?). I can\u0027t even see that it generated.\n\nWhat you need to do, is pop into your save and find this section:\n\n        SCENARIO\n        {\n            name = PersistentDataStore\n            scene = 7, 8, 5\n            DATA\n            {\n                TouristCount = Double:16\n                TouristLowOrbitCount = Double:16\n                Tourism_HotelConstruction = Double:1\n                BaseConstruction = Boolean:True\n            }\n        }\n\nChange that line that says BaseConstruction = Boolean:True to BaseConstruction = Boolean:False.\n\nTo answer your other questions:  \n\nThe Scan Mission will be skipped if you\u0027ve already done the scan. It will just go straight to the rover mission.\n\n$BaseConstruction is independant of body. It\u0027s switched on when you complete BaseRover and turned off when you complete BaseCreate. The reason for this is quite simply that I can only define one rover at a time. If you happen to accept another rover mission before you accept the Create mission, the contract won\u0027t be able to find the location of your new base and will error.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T06:02:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 06:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"mcortez","CreatedById":153791,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T06:11:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, severedsolo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In your case, it looks like you never completed BaseCreate so the flag never got turned off again.

Sorry [@Nicholiathan](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146998-nicholiathan/) but I think the issue is either at your end, or with CKAN. Either way afraid I can\u0027t help you, I\u0027d post on the CKAN thread if I were you."},{"CreatedByName":"Samapico","CreatedById":125867,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T05:48:13Z","Content":"I got a contract to do a crew rotation on a base I landed on Duna, but it\u0027s giving me something like 1 year and 160 days to complete it. It\u0027s pretty much impossible to reach Duna and come back in that amount of time, unless it happens to coincide with perfect transfer windows, and still...\n\nI guess I should have read the fine print of the contract before accepting it, but I think the deadline should be scaled to the target body. I\u0027m not fluent in ContractConfigurator, but the config for this type of contract seems to be a fixed random amount of time:\n\ndeadline = Random(500, 700)\n\nOn a side note, is there any way to extend my current contract? I tried various things, including changing the second value in the \u0022values\u0022 entry because it looked an awful lot like the deadline duration in seconds."}]}
