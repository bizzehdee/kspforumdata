In some cases the PC is worse, because it is much easier to sell \u0022always online\u0022 to a PC consumer than a console consumer. Well, the problem is mainly Steam - Steam is like one huge DRM machine. For most of the games on steam, you buy it and you don\u0027t even own it, you have only payed for the privilege of licensing that game from the studio who made it. If the game becomes un-supported and the servers are switched off? Tough luck. You only paid for a license agreement, and that agreement clearly states the developer can withdraw online support at any time. At lease on a console (and I guess to a lesser extent, with some PC games) it is still possible to buy a disk and have full rights to do almost whatever you want with that game. You can play it on your console, your friends console, or sell it on and it will always work no matter how many times it swaps hands. You buy a disk based console game and it works (yes, online passes are a thing, but luckily it looks as though they are dying).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is so much wrong with how the gaming publishers of today are treating their consumers. DRM shows that the big studios just don\u0027t trust their consumers, and they see a people as just bunches of potential cash. And people are starting to realise this and not be taken as idiots any more. Many people didn\u0027t buy Sim City because it has un-necessary draconian DRM that actively interferes with gameplay in an extremely negative way, and that certainly hurt EA\u0027s reputation and wallet. Many people were willing to boycott the Xbox One simply because of its DRM rules and Microsoft 180d that decision. At least the consumers are finally being heard, even though it\u0027s already too late as almost every game you buy is swimming in online authentications and DRM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
