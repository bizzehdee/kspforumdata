Only one copy is active, but the remaining ones are lingering, causing confusion - some Add\u0027On can think the valid one is the first, some other may choose the last one - not to mention the duplicated UI that doesn\u0027t works as expected.\u00A0Currently, KSP uses the latest, but who knows is this can change in the future?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo TweakScale, when saving a craft, intercepts the saving and mangles the name of every TweakScale Module\u00A0but the one being effectively used. This prevents any accident due the duplication, but from sometime ago to nowadays, KSP is complaining about unknown modules (it didn\u0027t did that at the time I pushed this stunt).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIn a way or another, this stunt turns a potential catastrophic situation into an annoyance. You can really ignore that TweakScaleDisable stunt - it aims to make unusable the Module duplicates to prevent causing damage when you share your craft and savegame on KerbalX or something.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ETo detect if your installment is problematic, load and save twice the craft. On Sane installments, the second load will be clean (as KSP doesn\u0027t saves orphaned data, and TweakScaleDisable is orphaned by design). On problematic installments, you will see that turd\u00A0every load, because the corrupted GameDatabase will inject again the duplicates, that so will be mangled on saving, that so will be ignored on load, but then the GameDatabase will inject again the duplicates\u2026 You got it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ETo get rid of that annoyance, we need to check your KSP.log and a mangled craft file\u00A0(and I need a copy of the Module Manager ConfigCache to identify any additional\u00A0problematic parts). Then I can identify the patch that is double patching the part and we can fix it. It\u0027s a bit cumbersome, but not exactly hard.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E(yes, I\u0027m a bit busy, thank you very much for caring!)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
