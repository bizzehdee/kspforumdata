Waste disposal isn\u0027t a major issue, weapons proliferation is a major issue, water consumption is a moderate issue, and safety...well, the problem there is again political rather than technological.

Not any one of them, but all of them: hydro, geothermal, wind, tidal, solar (both thermal and PV), etc. And, most important of all, efficiency. Most of the problem is not that we can\u0027t cleanly produce sufficient power; it\u0027s that we insist on wasting vast amounts of power in ridiculously idiotic ways.

You can save a lot of electricity through just being a bit cunning too. I\u0027m a big fan of putting things on timers so they automatically turn off overnight. Being green doesn\u0027t have to mean making an extra effort.
