It assigns buttons properly though.\n\nDo I have to assign the axis to a key outside of the game, and then assign the key to the control in KSP? If so, this would seem to remove the point of having the joystick, where you can apply partial response (instead of all-or-nothing).\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:44:10Z","Content":"There\\\u0027s a joystick section down below.

It detects the buttons alright but x y and throttles don\\\u0027t seem to be detected.
