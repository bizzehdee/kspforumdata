And your problem is FAR. MechJeb just can\u0027t handle things correctly with FAR. Really you just have to make a choice: MechJeb or FAR. Until the creator of Boths try to make a compatible version for each other (which would probably the greatest thing ever), you can\u0027t use both without one flipping everything off course. If you decide to keep FAR, just make your gravity turns very, very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E slowly. Else dreag will you set you off course. Else if you keep Mechjeb, just have it do your gravity turn from 10 to 70km, with 40-70% and it will go great.

(on my onega\u0027s second version , i usually go full throttle after the boosters separation) plus, add some stabilizers wings (with control surfaces) at the bottom of your rocket - this will lower a bit the center of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T06:14:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sgt_flyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hansman1982","CreatedById":62705,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T12:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was even having problems with \u0026gt;1.5 TWR on my rockets.
