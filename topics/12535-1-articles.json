(Of course, there\\\u0027s my theory that Kerbin is actually a Dyson sphere around a neutron star that has accreted so much material on its outside over time, it\\\u0027s spawned life, but that\\\u0027s really just a joke.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of whether or not our universe is infinite in size (and the current consensus is that it is), that\\\u0027s a fundamental issue that you can\\\u0027t get around. So the laws of physics say that Kerbin doesn\\\u0027t exist in our universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, if the \u0027many worlds\u0027 theory of quantum mechanics is correct--and the latest developments in cosmology, particularly involving membrane theory, indicate that it probably IS--then there are also an infinite number of universes out there, none of which have to have any physical laws in accordance with our own. What\\\u0027s more, every time that a particle at the quantum mechanical level has multiple possible things that can happen in a given length of time, \u003Cem\u003Eall of them do happen\u003C/em\u003E, with each one splitting off its own alternate universe. That might not seem like a lot, but let\\\u0027s look at it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a universe consisting of one photon. Nothing else exists in this entire universe, just this photon and pure vacuum. What\\\u0027s more, it\\\u0027s a one-dimensional universe, so that electron can only move in two directions; furthermore, there is some force that *forces* the photon to constantly move, so it never has the option of remaining in the same place. (For simplicity, assume this universe has the same speed of light in a vacuum as our universe.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, every measurable unit of time--every time the photon can be observed by the system as a whole--the photon can go left, or it can go right. The \u0027many worlds\u0027 theory says that it does *both*, going left *and* right, with the left-moving version being in one universe, and the right-moving version being in another one, identical in every way except that this time, the photon went the other way. The smallest measurable unit of time, Planck time, is hard to explain the details of (Wikipedia lost me on that one), but it\\\u0027s equal to about 5.391*10^-44 seconds. This means that the number of universes we have from that one photon *doubles* 1.855*10^43 times \u003Cem\u003Eevery second\u003C/em\u003E. Anyone who\\\u0027s ever looked at the powers of two knows how quickly it expands; I don\\\u0027t have any calculator that can give me even a scientific-notation answer for that--indicating that *every second*, this hypothetical universe would split off more universes than \u003Cem\u003Ethe total number of particles in the observable universe\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, imagine a similar universe, but with TWO photons in it. This time, every Planck time, there are FOUR possible configurations that can result. By doubling the number of particles in the universe, you square the number of possible results. Again, all four configurations happen, resulting in *four* universes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow consider how many particles there are in the universe, how many different directions they could move--including not moving--at every observable time, how long the universe has existed, and the number of possible configurations that could result every Planck time. While technically not infinite, the number of parallel universes that our universe would be splitting off every second is literally inconceivable. At the physical level, there would be a huge percentage that are indistinguishable from our universe (and one could argue that those end up being the same universe, explaining how we\\\u0027ve discovered quantum mechanical effects with observations in just this one universe and greatly reducing the headache of distinguishing them), but there would be far more that are different in some way at the physical level--and that\\\u0027s an infinite range of differences there, too; it could be as simple a difference as my the dead pixel on my laptop\\\u0027s screen being a couple pixels to the left of where it is in this universe, or it could be as big as a universe where Harv is Captain Kerbin, the greatest superhero of the Kerbal race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe implication of the \u0027many worlds\u0027 theory is that not only \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E fictional universes exist, but indeed that \u003Cem\u003Eevery fictional universe ever imagined really does exist out there\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of a sobering thought, isn\\\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T15:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jeb_Kerman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jeb_Kerman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as space goes on infinitely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it doesn\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/thread]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainArbitrary","CreatedById":28110,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-12T15:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it doesn\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/thread]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears to do just that.
