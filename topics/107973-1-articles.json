This is a problem I\u0027ve hade with the contract system since its inception. The fact that contracts inevitably have science attached to them means that science stops having any value, especially as you increase the difficulty settings. The main purpose of the contract system was to create an economy so we can earn money to pay for a space program, and a secondary purpose was added with the reputation system. \n\nThe problem with adding science to contracts as well is that, when funds are in short supply you are force to grind a bit and do a lot of small contracts to make enough to move foreword, but since you are earning science the whole time you are rarely limited by science. You generally have plenty of science for where you are in the game and so science stops mattering. And what\u0027s worse is that when you increase the difficulty, science matters less and less because you are forced to do more and more. \n\nI would prefer a fixed amount of science with none coming from contracts, or at least a more limited system where there is only small bits of science coming from the one time contracts, like achieve orbit Or return from the Mun, with none ever coming from the endlessly regenerating contracts. But a bare minimum would be to add it as an option in the Difficulty Menu. As it is, you can only decrease overall percent science received, but with unlimited contract science, this isn\u0027t very helpful.

Note that satellite launches, and parts testing can stay strictly commercial, and keep the name contracts.\n\nTo visualize this, forget the word contract, as it implies doing a task for renumeration, I will use \u0022mission\u0022 going forward for all these \u0022contracts\u0022 that make sense coming from your own space program, not as a commercial money making scheme.\n\nThe general missions are things like \u0022Explore the Mun.\u0022 The specific missions, like \u0022visual survey of area X on the Mun\u0022 are areas your own program\u0027s scientists think merit specific observation. The funds allotted are a BUDGET, and the science is excess science your scientists think can be gained by comparing those areas. Science from orbit? Same thing, various missions Linus, Werner, et al, have come up. \n\nRemember that the entire points system is already entirely arbitrary, and no less gamey than having your science staff direct some particular landing spot locations to you. You can always go to the meeting, and tell them you think that\u0027s a dumb idea, and come up with a more interesting spot to study (i.e.: reject the mission and wait for a better one)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:45:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d prefer no science from contracts as it\u0027d encourage players to go further than Kerbin/Mun/Minmus just to get science, it\u0027d be both a reward for going out to the planets and add an element of planning when choosing which contract to do, players would want contracts that pay for the trip to new places just so they can do experiments there.\n\nThat\u0027s my feeling on it too. In .90, between the high science values from certain parts-testing contracts (Mainsail in orbit was giving something like 400k funds, plus gobs of science), and the funds-to-science strategy, I didn\u0027t even need to biome-hop Mun and Minmus to clear the tree, I was doing it with super boring test contracts. I rapidly lost interest in those playthroughs since I was just unlocking nodes to get better part testing contracts, to unlock more nodes, and then whoops, the tree was totally unlocked and I hadn\u0027t left Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\nI enjoy the lower science payout on contracts now, since I don\u0027t have to worry about them overshadowing my actual science vessels. I very much like, conceptually, the idea of taking fund-payout contracts to set up and send science expeditions that are coming straight out of pocket. Tourism is another great way that we\u0027re starting to see a decoupling of funds and science missions.
