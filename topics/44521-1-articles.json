I strive to make things ridiculously epic, and so incredibly awesome that they don\u0027t seem feasible, within Kerbal Space Program. I like to make things within the realm of possibility, and am DESPERATELY waiting for a multiplayer mod of some sort that works! Lastly I am excited to be here with a truly epic community who have all had the same us and downs as I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T21:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! There is a mod which adds camera views of other players, which isn\u0027t bad.

That mod definitely sounds good, however its not quite the same as actually having a friend there! A way i thought of doing it is like a request system, one player asks and everyone needs to accept, it will also pause the game temporarily while everyone accepts/ declines so nothing gets screwed up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghost Works","CreatedById":79959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T22:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Capt\u0027n!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T22:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to look into the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35310-The-L-O-G-Multiplayer-Project\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EL.O.G. project\u003C/a\u003E.
