Jet engines are balanced to counter drag parameters. Ergo, modifying jet engines is within scope, though I would prefer to simply break them completely and require the use of AJE instead. Jet engines only had the properties they had because Squad doesn\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing with respect to aerodynamics or engine performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@dzikakulka: \u003C/strong\u003EThat\u0027s just the drag from the engine itself.

Not nose-first, as I would expect if the vehicle was unstable, sideways. It refuses to remain pointing retrograde, and instead falls at an angle of attack of up to around 30 degrees! With Laztek\u0027s Falcon 9 landing legs attached and folded, it falls at an extreme angle of attack even at hypersonic speeds (and as a consequence breaks up due to a combination of heating, aerodynamic failures, and G-forces. With the landing legs removed, it falls at a survivable but still significant AoA at hypersonic speeds, and then increases to around 30 degrees at subsonic speeds. At less than 150 m/s, the rocket is approximately horizontal, and the prograde vector is about 30 degrees below the horizon. It stays in this orientation all the way to the ground.
