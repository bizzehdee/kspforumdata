I received a text from a friend that they had no recollection of sending. Later my iPhone sent the same text to someone else while supposedly turned off.

People have determined that it causes a crash, and they\u0027ve determined that the key factor in causing the crash is a particular string in the unicode. They did NOT verify it was not malicious code. The problem is, \u0022Many Eyes\u0022 is false security because it really is about removing the necessity for you to act securely from the picture. You believe that there are \u0022Many Eyes\u0022 checking something and thus you don\u0027t check it, you put faith in others and then we go from \u0022Many Eyes\u0022 to \u0022few eyes\u0022.... even on the whole \u0022Many Eyes\u0022 being done as intended, you assume people actually are verifying in a rigorous manner, especially with the use of a debugger. The underhanded C contest is enough to show how \u0022Many Eyes\u0022 are easily blinded.\n\nThe only testing being done is to discover how it worked, not what else it did. Apple wouldn\u0027t be one to admit they had a virus when they can cover it up and save face in PR; the people figuring it out don\u0027t even describe using a professional environment and are throwing mud and seeing what sticks.\n\nI say again, overflows are extremely powerful tools in a virus maker\u0027s arsenal. Yes the overflow caused the crash, but did it cause anything else?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T22:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T22:42:43Z","Content":"What I mean is that nobody else is reporting the subsequent battery issues or the message being sent on, at least in large enough numbers to show up in the first few pages of Google."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:00:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I mean is that nobody else is reporting the subsequent battery issues or the message being sent on, at least in large enough numbers to show up in the first few pages of Google.\n\nIt could be a sleeper that just activated; or only fully work under a unique set of conditions.\n\nThese things really are more dangerous than people treat them."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:22:41Z","Content":"There were several articles on this a few weeks back which fully documented what was happening and why, it\u0027s entirely due to the way unicode was being handled and nothing more... people have been sending it out all over the place in light of playing jokes on friends.
