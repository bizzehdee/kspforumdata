I had an idea about balancing part costs. I suggest generating a given part\u0027s construction cost by multiplying its mass by some constant for that \u003Cem\u003Etype\u003C/em\u003E of part, then adding the cost value from the config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: A simple structural or aerodynamic part will be relatively inexpensive, so Cost = (mass)x(100)\u002B(cfg cost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fuel tank or RCS tank is slightly more complex, so Cost = (empty mass)x(500) \u002B (cfg cost), and of course you wisely count the actual fuel cost separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn SRB has to be stronger than a fuel tank, but is still fairly simple tech. Cost = (empty mass)x(1000) \u002B (cfg cost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA liquid-fuel rocket engine is very complex, so very expensive, and has a few more factors to consider, such as thrust, Isp and gimbal range. Cost = (mass)x(5000) \u002B (thrust)x(500) \u002B (gimbal range)x(1000) \u002B (Isp in vacuum)(100) \u002B (cfg cost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn unmanned probe core represents the heart of the payload, so is even more expensive than an engine. Cost = (mass)x(10000) \u002B (cfg cost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, a manned crew capsule is the most expensive piece of equipment you can find. Cost = (mass)x(25000) \u002B (crew capacity)x(10000) \u002B (cfg cost)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the config file cost as part of the equation allows mod authors to still have a large influence over the relative costs of their custom parts. And obviously all these numbers are just what I made up out of thin air to illustrate the idea; they would need balanced. I\u0027m no coder, but it seems to me that since you already read the fuel quantities to generate costs, a system like this shouldn\u0027t be too very different.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-17T02:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2013 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by White Owl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
