Also, if this is just a bad idea, I need to know before I put in the hours modeling these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRC\u0027s, if you didn\u0027t know, are tiny, flying-saucer shaped devices which are meant to collect a small sample of asteroid rock or solar wind and reenter into the Earth\u0027s atmosphere. They contain their own avionics and parachutes, so it will need to be its own probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now the plan is to have 4 different SRC\u0027s, each except one modeled after a real life sample return mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is the SRC from the Genesis mission, which had circular discs called collection wafers inside of it that were meant to be exposed to the solar wind to collect samples and return them to Earth for further study. These collection wafers look a lot like DMagic\u0027s solar collector instrument, because that\u0027s what DMagic modeled them after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is the SRC from the Stardust mission, which is similar to the Genesis SRC except it uses a grid containing aerogel instead of collection wafers. The aerogel was meant to minimize the impact of particles which are traveling faster than high-speed bullets in order to preserve them as much as possible, so this SRC will probably be more expensive, more efficient, and researched later than the collection wafer SRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third is an SRC that uses the TAGSAM device on the OSIRIS-REx mission (touch-and-go sample acquisition device). It\u0027s a small, short cylinder that\u0027s open at one end,and it\u0027s meant to blast pieces of rock off of the surface of an asteroid using a jet of pressurized nitrogen gas. The original design has a separate arm that is not inside the SRC itself, which then deposits the head of the TAGSAM inside of the SRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth is a cheaper, less efficient method to the one above that uses a shorter arm with a smaller drill bit which is contained entirely within the SRC. This does not have a real-life version but I feel like it\u0027d be much less confusing to create an SRC that has the arm already inside of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo do you guys think it\u0027s a good idea? Do you have any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T08:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it certainly is a good idea since the Soviet did it with the Luna program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s gonna be a hassle to get the surface sample in the the return capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T10:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103075-WIP-Sample-Return-Capsule\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPast discussion on the topic\u003C/a\u003E.
