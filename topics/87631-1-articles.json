All KSP\u0027s input curves work the same way, that includes Velocity Curve (Thrust based on Velocity); Atmospheric Curve (ISP based on Altitude); also Steering curves in ModuleSteer and ModuleWheel, and all the settings in EFFECTS{} for particles and audio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasically, you set the thrust to the velocity range you want the engine to produce thrust. so for a simple curve you set the engine produces 1 (100%) thrust at start (0 m/s); and 0 (0%) thrust at top speed 500m/s. the thurst engine produces will gradually decrease as you fly faster until you approach 500m/s and the engine produces 0 thrust. in game you would never reach 500m/s due to atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso you can set an engine to only produce thrust from say 50m/s to 500m/s by setting 0~49m/s to produce 0 thrust; and 501m/s (all velocity higher than 500m/s) to produce 0 thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother example using the wind turbine generator, you set the velocity curve to 0 0 0 0; 50 1 0 0. this way the turbine will reach max thrust (which you set very low in the ModuleEngine, or block it with a collider in unity.). ModuleAlternator will generate ElectricCharge when the engine is running above 0 thrust.
