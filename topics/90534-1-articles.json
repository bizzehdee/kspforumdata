The three biggest ones, I feel, are the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The abilit to generate an infinite amount of contracts at will, thereby enabling you to force any contract you want to appear when you need it to. Just completed a \u0022return science from X\u0022 contract by transmitting from one instrument, but your spacecraft has three other instruments left, and half a dozen other biomes to visit? Just force the contract to reappear over and over, it takes only a few seconds each time! Boom, infinite money, maximum reputation, tech tree fully unlocked. Regardless of difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ability to complete \u0022return science from X\u0022 contracts without returning science (i.e. transmitting a zero SP result). Because if you didn\u0027t already exploit enough with the above, worry not, there\u0027s more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The massive amount of science points and reputation associated with part testing contracts in particular. I get about 20 times as much reputation for testing a solid rocket booster in flight over Kerbin as I get for rescuing a Kerbal from orbit (say what?!). In addition, if the difficulty is set at nominal (100%) science payouts, I usually need only two or three easy part testing contracts or so to unlock another node. I could probably effortlessly unlock the entire tech tree without ever achieving orbit, and it would be faster and easier than trying to actually do it through legit gameplay. Especially since the difficulty sliders make legit gameplay just as much harder as they make exploiting less valuable... so nothing really changes regardless of what you set them to. My ideal solution would be to make part testing contracts non-repeatable - that is, a part can be tested \u0022in flight over Kerbin\u0022 only once, but it can still generate contracts for testing it in other situations. Until those are completed once, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that there are mods that add new contract types, and those are all fine and dandy; but what I\u0027d really like to know is whether there\u0027s something I can do to close at least these three loopholes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T10:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode as it is isn\u0027t really balanced at all, and where it is balanced, it\u0027s intended more for new players learning the game. As such, many have noted that it is quite easy to abuse the system. As career mode develops, we will likely see changes intended to prevent such things, or mods that provide such balance. Until then, the best way to approach it is to choose not to abuse the system. You could choose to directly edit the save file to give you money, and that\u0027s not all that far from abusing broken aspects of the contract system, but neither of those ends up being fun. For now at least, put limits on yourself to play as you find it fun, and as career mode comes closer to being finished (with wonderful additions like the Fine Print mod) balance will start to become a priority.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T11:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware that Squad has future plans for balance passes, yes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m looking for a more near-term solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChoosing not to exploit doesn\u0027t really work... the issue I have is not that I am forced to exploit, but rather that I have the option. It\u0027s actually a common theme in game design - you can look it up in pretty much any textbook on the matter: the mere knowledge of the presence of an exploit lessens the enjoyment derived from playing legit. This is why for example MMOs never release any info about exploits they\u0027re patching, even if the effect on the game world is negligible and/or effortlessly reversed. It\u0027s a user experience thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it wouldn\u0027t be so bad if it was a rarely encountered system, but as it stands, if you are playing career mode you must interact with the contract system for every launch, especially at higher difficulty settings. And it\u0027s precisely the broken part testing contracts that are often your only options of farming funds on demand. I want to pay for a science mission, but the only option I have to do so is by doing a series of contracts that generates all the science I needed without even launching the mission. This just irks me so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own solution to this is simply not playing career mode. But on the other hand, I\u0027ve been avoiding it since .24 dropped and I\u0027d like to give it a serious try one of these days. So I thought that I\u0027d come look and see if there were any mods that addressed the most common complaints.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T11:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty settings are calibrated for someone who has never played KSP before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the faintest idea what you\u0027re doing, then you should [1] probably be playing on hard mode. You should absolutely be playing without the ability to revert mistakes; using revert makes the funding and reputation systems largely pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, it\u0027s easy to abuse the system to grab epic amounts of science. You don\u0027t even need the exploits you mention; just use the difficulty menu to start the game with 1,000,000 science in the bank. But nobody\u0027s forcing you to; just stay away from the outsourced R\u0026amp;D strategy, and don\u0027t use the obvious exploits like spamming flag missions next to a permanently emplaced Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, on the mod side: Fine Print, Kerbal Construction Time, TAC-LS, Deadly Reentry, RemoteTech, etc. As well as adding difficulty in themselves, these mods also block a lot of exploits. Combine Kerbal Construction Time with TAC-LS and your flag-planting Kerbal is going to get very hungry unless you\u0027ve planned ahead. The greater diversity of contracts in the soon-to-be-stock Fine Print also sharply reduces the ease and temptation of repetitive contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus FAR; this actually makes things easier once you\u0027re used to it, but the FAR turbojet nerf and the requirement to build aerodynamically realistic ships prevents a lot of exploits. If that\u0027s not enough, a self-imposed LV-N ban makes interplanetary travel much more challenging. And, if you really want to crank it up, there\u0027s always RSS; even 6.4X makes the game a lot more challenging, especially if combined with AJE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: start with hard mode, Fine Print (discourages contract repetition), FAR (discourages lazy unrealistic spacecraft designs), TAC-LS (discourages leaving Kerbals sitting around forever) and Kerbal Construction Time (encourages planning ahead and running diverse missions in parallel, and makes tech nodes require time as well as science to unlock, disincentivising rapid science spam). If it\u0027s still too easy, start on RemoteTech; after that, RSS and the rest of the RO suite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] Actually, you should do whatever is most fun and satisfying for your own game, whatever that is. But you know what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to add: didn\u0027t see your later post until after posting this. I get what you\u0027re saying about the irritation of self-handicapping, but a bit of it is inevitable in a sandbox game. And the mod recommendations stand, especially Fine Print and Kerbal Construction Time. And, of course, hard mode including lack of revert ability (I keep quicksave/load enabled to guard against game crashes, but if you feel like living dangerously, disable that as well).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-17T11:39:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2014 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T12:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am playing with all the mods you mention, yes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E And it\u0027s set to harder-than-hard-mode, with payouts at 50% instead of the default 60%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, that actually doesn\u0027t solve anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Difficulty settings are utterly irrelevant because at the same rate that they make exploiting contracts less rewarding, they make legit gameplay less rewarding. The relationship between the two never changes... If there\u0027s a gamplay difference related to contracts between low and high difficulties, then it\u0027s the fact that you need to focus much \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E on the contract system on high difficulty settings because of how constrained you are by funds. This isn\u0027t a bad thing because it\u0027s believable and appealing to launch missions that have a contractual purpose, but it just makes it that much harder to ignore the obviously WIP system and its various shortfalls and loopholes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Every mod that adds additional difficulty and/or tedium to legit gameplay only makes the exploits \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E appealing, because those are not made harder.

You can fix Outsourced R\u0026amp;D with a config file edit quite easily (in fact, several other strategies also benefit from adjusting them manually). Sadly you cannot fix contracts that way because they are not defined in a config file.
