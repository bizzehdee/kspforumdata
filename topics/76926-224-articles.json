I\u0027m not using wing mounted guns, mine are radially attached around the fuselage with no rotation offset. More extensive testing today has shown me the problem is not as bad as I first stated. There is still consistent undershooting, but the overall average performance is better than the last mod version. I think the overall piloting logic of the A.I. might still need some work, such as trying to fire guns when rolled 90 degrees for instance. You lose all your vertical component of lift, causing your nose to drop, thus consistently undershooting your target. The A.I. does need to be taught some basic stick and rudder skills, and have better options for evasive maneuvers. Just wobbling around hoping not to get hit is not what I had in mind, and barrel rolls are cool looking, but they don\u0027t actually help as an evasive maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most basic maneuver would be the break turn: Turn 90 degrees either left or right as fast as possible. Level out on your new bearing before deciding whether or not to take further evasive action, or turn into your target if they were thrown off your tail. It\u0027s simple but effective, and the A.I. is currently incapable of doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot trying to be a PITA, as I said the overall performance is better than it was, but some more A.I. work would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoppio\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoppio\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI take that you never saw any of the AI fighting league that are running...
