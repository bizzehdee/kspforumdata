I\u0027m trying to get my first part into game. I have no log errors, and the part shows up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but a) you can tell the texture is not wrapped correctly, and b) when the part is instantiated and hanging on the mouse cursor, it\u0027s invisible, and adding it to a node it\u0027s still invisible. The log file lists that the part was added to the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of recounting the arduous steps getting to that point, lemme ask the basics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imported A.fbx and B.png into my Unity project.

Would that mean I need B.dds? Or should it be A.dds? Does the png need to be deleted?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I need to flip something somewhere? Where does that step fit in? I assume that\u0027s what I missed for the texture to show up incorrectly in the parts list?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help!

I knew the PartTools linked in that old wiki was wrong, and found that same updated page, but somehow I downloaded the wrong link from that page (the older one).

It also has other object types selected, so it\u0027s a good reminder that you either need to unselect what you don\u0027t want, or delete them from the blender scene/layer/idk before export, which is what I\u0027d been doing anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Unity, I used a built-in box collider, which I added as a component to an empty game object that I added as a sibling to the model, under the Root parent empty.

The wiki says you can just unzip it into the Assets folder. Not true. Once you do that, you must locate the part tools object in the project view, click on it, then in the inspector you click Open. A new window opens and lists all the stuff in there, and you click Import.
