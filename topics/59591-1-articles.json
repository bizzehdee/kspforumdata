It\u0027s great that they are gaining some interest from ESA, but those are just preliminary studies and lab experiments. It\u0027s going to cost billions and take decades to develop all the technology they need.

Sorry, but I don\u0027t believe that. It took Boeing $32 billion and 10 years to develop the 787, which is just an airliner with fairly mature and well-understood technology. EADS spent $25 billion dollars to develop the A400M, which is just a conventional turboprop cargo plane. With cost estimates so hugely underestimated, it throws a shadow of doubt on their performance and operation estimates too. Besides, airliners and military aircraft projects have a market, with firm orders years before the first test flight and minimal risk.
