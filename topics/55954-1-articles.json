Minmun is my next target and after that manned missions to Duna. Already brought a science drone into orbit around Duna and I\u0027m currently preparing one for Eve as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite a modfreak and have enjoyed using mods in all kinds of games. And, well, KSP is no exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be glad to hear about your suggestions and tips. And I\u0027ll be thankful when you point me in the right direction should I happen to violate any rules.
