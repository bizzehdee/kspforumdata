This idea mainly came from the recent release of the Dragon v2 from SpaceX (which looks amazing if I may add). So anyway, why not add real world space modules into the game? (or at least command modules based off real world modules). A few modules I was thinking of include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dragon v2 (obviously \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the Soyuz crew capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orion module (although it does look quite similar to the Mk 1-2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the Gemini space craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- maybe even Vostok 1 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould anyone else be interested in seeing these implemented at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T07:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i dont rly see a point here, other than aesthetics tbh.

Not perfect, I know. There might be better replica designs in the spacecraft exchange. It is impressive what some can do using just stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
