It is a test of a friend\u0027s battleship, which took quite a few hits to destroy. It\u0027s all 100% real combat; at certain points in the video you can see the UI, because it was difficult aiming and at the same time filming. But I think it turned out really well. I also tried to imitate Kerba speak, by taking random audio clips and playing them backwards.
