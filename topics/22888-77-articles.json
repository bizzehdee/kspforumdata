However, that\u0027s Frizzank\u0027s decision, not mine.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Frizz, you might want to check the collider mesh and node placement on the new S-IB thrust structure, the one with separate fins; the old one was steady as a rock, but the new one jumps around like a Rockomax-8 with a Mainsail under it and a Jumbo-64 on top; I\u0027m having to \u0022staple\u0022 it down with struts to keep it from having the booster slowly and inexorably tip over during ascent due to the wobble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You answered your own question as to why it is scaled to 3.75m and 5m.
