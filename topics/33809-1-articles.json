Capable of deploying the following colonial equipment to the destination body:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) A large colony base, with room aboard for at least 32 Kerbals. The colony should be landed manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E A set of outposts, each with room for at least 4 Kerbals. There should be no fewer than 4 of these outposts. The outposts should be landed manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c) A set of manned rovers, each with room for at least 4 Kerbals. There should be no fewer than 4 of these rovers. Note that the rovers can be landed unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d) A set of space stations, at orbital inclinations of 0, 45, 90, and 135. Each station should house no fewer than 8 crew members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e) Any other equipment that is deemed useful (Kethane refining equipment, mapping satellites, what have you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Capable of travelling from Kerbin orbit to orbit over any planet or moon in the Kerbol system nonstop and returning to Kerbin orbit after dropping off the colonial equipment, without refuelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Capable of long-term operation (i.e. should have as little reliance on consumables as possible - for instance, using gyroscopic steering instead of RCS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. All colonists should be kept in a habitation block during transit - i.e. the colony equipment should not be used as habitation space during the journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Capable of unmanned return to Kerbin orbit, to pick up a new load of colonial equipment, and delivering this equipment to a different body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Capable of deploying any piece of colonial equipment at any time - there should not be a requisite order for deploying equipment (e.g. \u0022this piece deploys before this piece\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Designed as a single, monolithic mission architecture (i.e. multiple flights to the target body should not be required to deliver all requisite equipment/fuel.
