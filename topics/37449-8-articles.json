Take away the TAC prefix from the resource name. Nobody is going to be using 2 life support mods at once so you dont need to prefix it. Just have the resource names be oxygen, water, and Food. It breaks the immersion to see TAC_Oxygen instead of just Oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. for waste water you can convert it. But CO2 and waste cannot, Normally astronauts either use single-use CO2 scrubbers in which case they would be added to waste, or on the ISS they absorb the CO2 and pump it into space, in both cases it would not need a bar in the resources menu at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I recommend you remove the waste water and CO2 bars completely for the most realistic representation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I have an awesome idea for waste. Have it fill up the ship and give the crew an option to have waste collection from another ship after docking which can take it back to kerbin. OR the option to eject it into space. The first one is more troublesome but the second one will spawn a debris object in space which will be floating around and create a risk of colliding with other ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. the resource tanks are so ugly and cartoonish. No space agency labels their tanks like that. I recommend reconfiguring the standard tanks to hold the resources.
