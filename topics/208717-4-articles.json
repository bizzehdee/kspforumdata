Its difficult to determine what photographs have and haven\u0027t had any post-processing work applied to them, and this also has to be balanced against the fact that KSP is limited in being able to provide a photorealistic depiction of Earth, what with there being no infinite resolution or realistic atmosphere recreations and what have you. I like to think, though, that I nailed it given these limitations. Low orbits are going to be a bit blurrier than I\u0027d like, but this is a result of a combination of things that, ultimately, all come down to limitations in either KSP and/or the mods that make this mod possible.

Strictly speaking, both TrueSight and Vibrance variants of Mars are \u0022true color\u0022 in the sense that Mars can look like either one in real life. The reason for this is that the overall visual colors of Mars change depending on the time of year, the amount of dust in the air, and a few other factors. This is why whenever you search for true color photographs of Mars, you always get a hodgepodge of photos that range from the yellowy beige to the starkly orange-ish red.\u00A0 So, for these two variants of the planet, as trying to simulate the planets real behavior is just, not in the cards, you have the option between these two \u0022extremes\u0022 if you will.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrueSight will provide you with the yellowy-beige look. This was chosen as \u0022TrueSight\u0022 because yellowy-beige is closer to what the planet is going to look like in person most of the time when you\u0027re on the surface. If you\u0027ve viewed photographs from Curiosity or Perseverance, the yellowy-beige is the most common overall color of the planet that features in those photographs. Do note however that much of the effect was achieved through a clever use of clouds, TUFX, and Scatterer trickery; the surface will be a bit redder than orbit would lead you to believe, which is accurate to real life as well.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, Vibrance will feature the more starkly orange-reddish variant of the planet. Simple as.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EClouds: \u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EMars is funky ya\u0027ll, So Mars has quite a few different types of clouds. Some form from dust. Some from the sublimation of dry ice, others from water ice. Some are bright white, some are dusty, and some are iridescent and shine pretty brightly. Some hang low to the ground and others are practically out of the atmosphere. All of these are featured, and are dynamic. Unlike Earth, the Martian climate revolves what has or hasn\u0027t sublimated, and this is also why when viewing pictures of Mars sometimes clouds are conspicuously absent, while at other times the planet is covered in them.\u00A0 The difference is the time of year. The Martian winters provide relatively clear skies, while the summer is often cloudy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, as Mars has seasons similar to Earth (though twice as long), its seasons come with the peculiar problem that its northern and southern hemispheres are in different seasons. This summarily causes the global cloud coverage to tend to be centered on one of the hemispheres.\u00A0 Fortunately though, there is a few times of year where global coverage is evenly balanced, and thus our Mars\u0027 cloud map assumes this time of year as a constant (specifically, it was based around the time between the Summer Solstice and Autumnal equinox, which was the easiest to find photographs of). While dynamics could theoretically enable truer to life seasons, we of course still need a lot more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E features.

As such, it doesn\u0027t have the near constant aurora\u0027s that we see in places like Earth or the Gas Giants. However, aurora\u0027s still occur. Mars\u0027 has a series of minor dynamos (that could occur for a variety of reasons that science doesn\u0027t seem certain on just yet) that sporadically generate the fields necessary to have aurora phenomenon show up. Where this activity occurs has been mapped, and Mars\u0027 Auroras in this mod are linked to these real locations, and through dynamics we can mimic their sporadic nature.\u00A0 Do keep in mind, Mars is funky. These aurora\u0027s are going to be strange to look at when you can spot them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Stuff:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSunflare: The mod features its own bespoke sunflare. This sunflare was designed to be accurate to life based on my own interviews with a number of astronauts, notable among them including Alan Bean (Apollo 12, Skylab 3) and Jerry Ross (STS-88).\u00A0 This means no accompanying lens flare, as that isn\u0027t something you actually see without a camera between you and the Sun. Likewise, the starburst pattern of the flare is based on how I estimated my real eyes would perceive the Sun if i were able to look at it from space. I determined this with small scale experiments with flashlights, as well as by staring at the actual sun. (not smart, but still valuable data)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI believe I will provide a Vibrance version of this sunflare, which will bring a lens flare, but will also carry on the spirt of Vibrance being the \u0022false color\u0022 version of the Solar System, and as such, the Sun will be yellowy-orange.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod will provide its own bespoke TUFX profile, which while not required, is necessary to achieve the intended look of the mod. The settings of this profile primarily concern bloom and some other settings, and is largely tuned both to my sensibilities and to what the mod needed to enable city lights to look as they do. Thus if you want to add other settings you should be able to build on it. I won\u0027t shame you for wanting to deep fry your KSP.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompatibility: As far as I know, the mod should work fine with parallax as far as being on the ground is concerned. Any parallax effects that take place in orbit of the above 3 bodies (I honestly don\u0027t know if there are any nor do I care to research that question) may or may not work.\u00A0 The mod as it stands now was built around KSRSS Reborn, but if you for whatever reason are still on the older KSRSS, it should actually work fine there as well with minimal issues, though you\u0027ll be on your own for making that sort of install work. Beyond these, anything KSRSS Reborn is compatible with should also be compatible with SOL.\u00A0 On that note, the other bodies in the system that aren\u0027t Earth, Mars, or Luna will still retain their original KSRSS Reborn visuals. Presuming things go better for me the idea is to eventually touch these bodies as well in the same manner as the initial release, starting the remaining two Inner Planets and moons and then working outwards.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mod will also natively have a selection of texture options ranging from 2k-16k in both variants.\u00A0 In regards to performance and the like, if you can run KSRSS Reborn at its best, you can run my mod. While it may not look like it, what has been done for SOL isn\u0027t actually that that much impactful on performance than the original mod is, though it will hit your memory a bit more, so if you\u0027re already running into memory issues, that will be good to keep in mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo note though that in general, this mod was never intended for people playing on potatoes. When I first made Ad Astra back in the day, my intention was always to push the graphics as hard as I could and that carries on in this mod.
