Regarding online images and streaming of KSP user-generated content (twitch, youtube) what are the legalities of posting KSP content? \n\nI know there are a lot of youtubers out there posting KSP videos, and a lot of stuff gets posted to imgur.com and reddit.com. Is this content marketable? Could Scott Manley sell copies of Interstellar Quest on DVD? Is it even technically permissible to have Youtube ads to monetize content, or is that a violation of the license and copyright of KSP? \n\nThe KSP EULA ([https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php)) states:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 4.
