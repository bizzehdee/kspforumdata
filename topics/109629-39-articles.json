He can do whatever he pleases whenever he pleases. I love the shuttle and I am a professional structural engineering 3D modeling teacher at university so when I found Mike was getting a little bussy I could step in to help a bit with the aero and the IVA. I have created a shuttle from scratch for RSS last year (for private use) and had a bit experience with getting the shuttles aero done okay. My work done is only a little drop in the bucked compared to what Mike did and I know that probably my continues pushing to get the development more structured is part of the reason Mike is burnt out. Mike my guess is you will come back, you just love this thing too much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I will leave the aero to you and let you handle it without me yelling and whining about organization here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T05:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour support is grand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I will continue, but with those who understand the principal of testing prototype parts snd how to place or overwrite files in the game directory.
