This model also features 4 hydraulic actuators which can gimbal the nozzle up to 0.93 degrees. This particular engine is designed to replace the LAE series of model, permanently. (Mostly because they sucked).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, an early design decision allowed subsystems to be implemented that would enable the chaining of multiple engines through a single fuel pump, similar to those of our Russian friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeight: 1.75m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiameter: 1.0m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8146/7568567338_49cd6d0dc1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227568567338_49cd6d0dc1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur standard fuel tank;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have the XFT-S100, a simple fuel tank; slightly higher capacity than the rugged fuel tanks, (which I lost the specs and there will be no 2m version) due to the larger volume.
