This would create a lot of asteroids (like the ones orbiting dres) but also 2 small moons of this planet that was once the home of Dres. One would be formed of the original planet and the other from the proto planet that collided with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you think of this?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI got the idea from the snarkiverse mod wich moves Dres to the same orbit that kerbin has.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForgive my spelling Im not a native english talker\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW have a great day/night\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
