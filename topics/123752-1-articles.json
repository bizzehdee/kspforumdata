For example, if I take Jeb out on EVA, when I board, Jeb will be back in the capsule with full control, but a clone Jeb will be on the ladder outside, preventing from doing any time acceleration (plus being creepy as heck).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clone Jeb acts like its own ship, I can switch to it using the [ ] keys, but I need to take control of him, make him let go then let the clone drift off into space. Same thing happens each time I go on EVA, I can have 2-3 clone Kerbals stuck on the ladder. If I manage to get back to the Space Centre, it gives me something like : \u0022Part Jeb cannot load/not found\u0022 or something to that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mods I have/had are/were :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Chatterer (still there)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hot Rockets (recently removed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Planetshine (removed after a day of use)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I also managed to fix another bug, the disappearing tech tree, which was caused by Module Manager with Hot Rockets. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134407-Tech-tree-disappeared-after-upgrading-R-D-facility\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134407-Tech-tree-disappeared-after-upgrading-R-D-facility\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering if Module Manager has anything to do with this, and I\u0027m a complete noob regarding the persistent.sfs file even though I fixed the earlier issue with the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anybody have any ideas on fixing this Kerbal cloning issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd apologies if this has been covered in another thread, I looked and could not find one, still a bit new at finding stuff on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : This is happening in Science mode, so I started a career and the same problem occurs, so it\u0027s not a save file issue it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-26T01:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FroggyCanuck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T13:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this bug once, I found a couple of threads about it, but not much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a craft on the way to minmus, did an eva to get the science, and he was cloned trying to get back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most promising thread I found stated that if you could board the external kerbal into a different part of the ship (not containing the internal clone) and then moved both copies of the kerbal so that they inhabit the same part, they would \u0022re-merge\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, in my case, I only had one, single seat pod, so I could not do this, instead I managed to insert the craft into orbit with external clone clinging onto the ladder outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn trying to rescue external clone (with an empty, two-seat pod, so I could try the \u0022re-merge\u0022), when the rescue ship arrived, I saw something very large in the distance, orbiting minmus.

Right-clicking on the shroud and jettisoning it means this cloning occurs. It is however possible to first right-click and then have it think it is jettisoning the shroud in the staging queue. I usually end up doing this because... I dunno, I just prefer right-clicking on it...\u003Cbr\u003E\n*end edit*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFly Safe,\u003Cbr\u003E\n/Akely\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-20T19:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2016 07:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Akely\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDid some testing, found things.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
