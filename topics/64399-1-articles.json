Many of his observations revolved around him noticing that jeb derived a sick sense of pleasure making him get out of a perfectly good capsule over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mapping went very well uncovering several potential locations for mining colonies near the equator. One location near a large crater on the far side of the mun, that bill dubbed the east farside crater, even had overlapping fields of kethane and ore deposits withen a degree or two of the equator. It may not have much of a view of kerbin but if landing conditions are good it may be an idea base for mining. Interestingly enough there was virtually no kethane on the kerbin facing side of Mun. The lab monkeys are still pondering the implications of this finding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a Sol day of orbiting the mun the low res altemitry scan completed for a windfall of 60 science worth of data. Sadly the tech whines had not designed this sensor to have its data removed directly but they\u0027d stuck a transmitter on-board the high flyer. Bob dutifully flipped the switch to transmit that science home. He also asked why they had a sol day that was 24 hours when a kerbin day was 6 hours. Mission controll told him to shut up and concentrate on continuing to miss the ground while he was falling towards the mun. The panic this statement induced kept him busy for several hours and let Jeb take a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis nap nearly lead to disaster as 38 hours into the mission kerbin eclipsed kerbol for an extended period of time. Sensors were not deactivated in time and the ship ran out of power. Bill proved that dispite his tendency to panic he works well under extreme pressure. Activating the engines generated enough charge to rotate the ship and get the air flowing again. Angling the ship so as to reduce its inclination kept him from flying too far off corse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zbDINhL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zbDINhL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there was enough charge to power up his EVA suit he went for a bit of a walk for half an orbit as his suit consumed power more slowly than the ship.

The guys in medical were also concerned about the potential of space dementia, a theorized consequence of long term space flight.

Bill was not informed of his test subject status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs preparations to separate from the transfer stage were underway it was realized that the techs forgot to put any solar panels or batteries on the return capsule.

A set of landing gear and some extraction equipment later and he had an automated lander that could fill up on kethane and rendezvous with KISSC from either moon. Bob, after yelling at Jeb about prison and more importantly not messing with his designs added a power system and balanced the RCS so it could actually dock properly.

At least the poles are rather easy targets to hit even if it is fairly expensive on the dV.

Bob was needed back at home to help design the next mission and to hopefully keep jeb under control. So despite the fact that the KERS could return on its own he climbed in and set a course for home.

Large structural panels help shield the engines from swaying loads and double as rather nice landing legs. The crane has 5 winches, a central stack winch underneath, 2 radials to assist the central one in securing larger loads, and 2 more mounted above the pod for whatever utility the kerbal pilots come up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bONA5Jm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bONA5Jm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far its made a rather effective extension cord to transfer power and other supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bnWBsGL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bnWBsGL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter its first successful trip back to orbit the kerbals decide that the first drum is not big enough and the skycrane has the thrust to carry more so they build a bigger one after the first shipment was processed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/92y6eBB.png\u0022 alt=\u002292y6eBB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that this was not one of their better ideas.

Stearing on the other hand... not so much. Who knew that slinging 150 tons underneath a 20 ton ship would make it so hard to turn. Dispite how slow and wobbly the turn was they managed to achieve orbit thanks to liberal use of the RCS and setup an intercept for the venture. They actually managed to get withen 200 meeters with the relative velocity down to almost 0. However there was a problem. For one thing the crane was out of fuel and the kethane 1 had to be called over for a resupply run. Second that heavey weight under the crane started to occolate in very strange ways. In the time it took the kethane ship to dock with the crane strange forces had somehow boosted the orbit from the 15km orbit of the venture up to a 90km orbit dispite no reaction mass being expelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientists back at the KSP were baffled by this report. This could be a sorce of unlimited propultion if it could be harnessed. However that is a thought for another time. Matt had the bright idea to cut the 2 side lines helping ancor the container to the ship leaving only the central stack. This at least eliminated the phantom forces at work but made it even harder to controll. After 3 hours and many orbits attempting to rondevuse with the venture the decision was made to cut the load loose as fuel was getting dangerously low again.

One such designer happened to be watching a nature program at the same time.

Not an ideal situation having to haul its heavy drills and refinery equipment along with it but it could be done. With this amount of throughput the lifting capacity of the skycrane was just not enough. It could haul 1 tank at a time but if it was too big it would have the same issue as the bigger metal bin, aka it couldnt stear. Realizing this Kerbal engineers came up with the Supremely Optimized Fuel Tanker (SOFT)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wj3wAOw.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Wj3wAOw.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAble to haul 100 tons of fuel along with one kerbal to hook up the fuel lines this workhorse lives up to its name. Its acronym also serves as a warning to its pilot. As its literally nothing more than a flying gas can with engines strapped on land it softly or else.

While the skycrane and its now infamous attempt at proving this was most entertaining it was decided that a more dedicated design was called for. One that they could keep pointed in the right direction even full. And so they designed the Highly Advanced Rock Deliverer. (HARD) the kerbal responsible for both the SOFT and HARD names was later found tied to the KSP flag pole with cling wrap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v0WSDhX.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022v0WSDhX.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HARD is able to haul the same amount of metal into orbit as the test run of the skycrane with the big container. This time however proper placement of reaction wheels and RCS thrusters alows it to turn quite easily. Its still slow and lumbering but it wont spin out of control and crash. If it does the techs assure us that it is most definitely pilot error and not a design flaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the cargo capacity of the HARD was pointless if they could not fill it in a reasonable time frame so the designers slapped together several smelters and a bigger drill with a set of engien pods and sent it down to the original refinery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qNl5BFO.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022qNl5BFO.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs uranium stocks were limited they elected to not include a reactor and instead pluged it into the origonal refinery\u0027s power grid.

On a more pressing front the tech whinnies back at KSC sent up a reminder that new experiements that were not avalible on the initial Science expedition were now available. Thankfully some could be done from orbit so a small probe bristeling with science probes was launched. It would gather Magnetospheric and Gravitational data both near and far from minmus as well as on its way back down to kerbin.

Apparently there are diminishing returns on the enjoyment of the same explosion that is directly proportional to the diminishing returns on performing the same science experiment over and over. Who knew?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill after 10 crashes the arcives had a wopping 2237 science in them.

There was no more need of it to process science experiments and in fact the venture could build a new module should the need arise. Still the Venture\u0027s crew couldnt send their fellow interns home without a parting gift. First a module to purify water and scrub CO2 was added to the KISSC followed by a shipyard module. No refining facilities were included but a sizeable supply of rocket parts were so smaller ships could be built as needed. Resupply ships would bring more parts as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uVyYktH.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022uVyYktH.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 kerbals that remain in minmus orbit have about a months worth of supplies so they should be good until a supply run can be arranged.

Being bored they decided to make better acomidations for themselves. The Venture was sort of an adhoc build as needed design. This time they built a proper habitation module and plenty of fuel/parts storage into the design. Here we have the Minmus Shipyard. Plenty of parts and fuel storage, room for 32 kerbals and the storage needed to keep them alive for 2 years if KSC ever ships up enough food to fill it. The skycrane is currently docked to one side and a drive cluster is on the back. It could be moved if the skycrane undocked but it would take forever, particularly with a full supply load (400tons at half stocked).
