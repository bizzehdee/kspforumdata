Take subassemblies for example. I used the subassemblies mod for a while and found it invaluable, but when flags came out and the flag button replaced the subassemblies button, it kind of broke the mod. A short time later it was updated and I reinstalled it and moved over all my subassemblies into the right folders, a small inconvenience but still tedious.
