The lack of tracking is a bit of a weakness, but you can always keep a battery turned off in reserve so you can turn the full load towards the sun even if you run out of power.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-04T19:52:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghpstage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T19:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave an RTG would be a simpler, albeit more expensive, solution for back up power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T00:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, especially with Remotetech, there\u0027s the possibility that you\u0027re getting power, but you\u0027re draining your batteries more quickly than you\u0027re filling them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T01:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea, if you have more than one battery on the craft, turn off one battery as a backup.
