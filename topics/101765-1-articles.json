Kerbin never loads, the rocket never loads, and the Navball itself is also all black.

The satellite had not yet cleared the atmosphere. Upon reloading the game, the satellite launcher appears on the launchpad, but when I try to go into it to launch it, the above happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosed the game again, relaunched, and now the rocket is not on the pad. Go into the Tracking station, and it has the satellite listed as \u0022Splashed down\u0022 but the Tracking station screen showing Kerbin doesn\u0027t load, and is all black. I click on the satellite name and click the \u0022kill/destroy\u0022 button. The game stops responding again. I repeated this, same result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make a backup of my save directory. Then I go into the persistent save file and delete the satellite from the save file. Relaunched the game again, this time everything seems better, the satellite isn\u0027t listed, and the Tracking Station loads. However, any attempt at launching any craft recreates the black screen issue described above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERevert my save folder, relaunch the game, and go into the tracking station. It loads fine. Fly a vessel in orbit, and it loads fine. Do a ctrl\u002BF9 to recover an older quicksave that should not have any corruption in it (I\u0027ll lose a few hours, no biggie) and the same thing happens when loading this lander on the moon (GUI fully populates, but the rest of the screen and navball are black, game freezes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELog File:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62531235/output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62531235/output_log.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods List:\u003C/strong\u003E (I think I have them all, and correctly listed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive Texture Management x86 aggressive 4-3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALCOR 0.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALCOR IVA 0.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASET Props 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace R5-2-8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter Buoyancy 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContractConfigurator 0.6.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContractPack-AnomalySurveyor_1.0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts_Window_3.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrossFeedEnabler_v3.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOuter Planets Mod 1.5.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistant Object Enhancement 1.5.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor Extensions 2.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced NavBall 1.3.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE 7-4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFASA 5.22\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR 14.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreeEVA 0.3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuelTanksPlus 0.6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHot Rockets 7.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System 0.4.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement 2.4.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock 3.2.3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer 1.0.15.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPRC 0.1.9.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry 2.6d2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazTek SpaceX Launch Pack .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics 0.19.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2 2.4.1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb and Engineer for All v?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOARdv FASA Gemini IVA 2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Rocket Systems Parts Pack 1.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule Manager 2.5.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavyFish DockingPortAlignment 4.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Construction 0.4.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Electrical 0.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Propulsion 0.4.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Solar 0.4.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Spacecraft Parts 0.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetShine 0.2.2.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterPropMonitor dev19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid 0.5.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChute 1.2.6.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech 1.6.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafeChute 1.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat 10.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCART91 head textures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScienceAlert 1.8.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmokescreen 2.5.3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoundingRockets 0.2.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceY Lifters 0.11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStageRecovery 1.5.2.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer 2.4.1.1008\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture Replacer 2.2.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToolbar 1.7.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories 1.1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakable Everything 1.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakScale 1.49\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUniversal Storage 1.0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVNG Parachute 1.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVNG Plugin 0.7.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaypoint Manager 2.1.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help here would be great.
