I landed on Minmus, Duna, Ike, and Laythe. But since I installed .25, every single lander I descent into Mun surface, simply.. explodes. Gear is set down, engine isn\u0027t touching the ground, and it should be everything good, but, well, it isn\u0027t as I wasn\u0027t able to land four differend landers. This problem also occures on Kerbin, and sometimes, on Duna. But only if I use gear, when I get down on chutes, it works perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody can help me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T19:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information (such as screenshots) is helpful to see if there\u0027s something with your design or if it\u0027s something with the game. So I\u0027ll point you at this thread which tells you where to find that info: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first guess is that this is often to do with the terrain detail setting. If you have the terrain set too low, sometimes the surface doesn\u0027t line up with where the game thinks the ground is. If you have your terrain all the way down, try turning it up a bit and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
