Quite frankly, it\u0027s not any easier or harder... just wasteful, he wastes so much fuel bring his relative speed to 0 several times which is not necessary. You can adjust your heading without killing all of your relative speed simply by burning ahead of the prograde marker to pull it toward you (and the pink marker) or burning behind the retrograde to push it away from you (and the pink marker) which one you choose depends on how fast you are approaching your target and if you want that to be faster or slower.

Most people here have developed intuition about docking (and orbital mechanics) that allows them to customize their approach to taste.\n\nThis is a simple approach.\n\nFirst stage (after orbit in same direction) is intercept. It sounds like you have this figured out but I\u0027ll include it regardless. Match inclination with target (you can do this later, but it makes node placement harder). The larger orbit has less rotational velocity. Preferably the larger orbit is \u0022ahead\u0022 of the lower, but the cyclical nature of orbits will get you a rendezvous regardless. What you don\u0027t want is two intercepts. There is little difference in period in that case. Regardless your goal is to plan and execute a node to create an intercept point. The less distance at intercept, the less fuel you need to burn for rendezvous. The planning is best done with intuition, but you can simplify it by creating a single intercept of the orbital traces (so one orbit \u0022rolls\u0022 in the other) and mofiying the orbit at the intersection to get an intercept.\n\nOnce you intercept, your nav ball should automatically switch to target mode. You don\u0027t need the map from here. To close distance, burn on a heading between target and retrograde so that your prograde and target markers align (once you develop the intuition, you actually want progeade to be slightly off of target to account for the rotational velocity). Mind your heading (to keep on target), speed and distance (to avoid overshoot) to target. Your goal is to reach less than 1m/s within 30-50 m from target. Intuition is important here. TWR determines your acceleration and thus which closing speed distance combinations are controllable. Most ships can zero speed with less than 10 seconds.\n\nOnce you rendezvous, you need to dock. Don\u0027t touch main throttle without developing proper intuition. Rotational velocity of orbit will cause ships to gradually rotate along the normal axis. Aligning ports to this axis allows you to ignore attitude adjustments (tools and/or intuition are almost required to dock along a non-normal axis). Use RCS translate so that the target and (anti-)normal indicators align. Then give a little trust to add a prograde marker to the set. Keep these three aligned (stop the ship to do so if you lack intuition to correct in route) and you should dock.\n\nI strongly recommend learning to dock on simple ships (low part count, docking port aligned to control direction and in line with CoM). You want to develop your intuition four maneuvers before dealing with the challenges brought from complex craft. OTOH, dealing with such craft strengths your intuition, so don\u0027t avoid them forever."},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T22:00:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I find the intercepts difficult to use combined with the tricky camera in the orbital map view.

Once you will be reasonably accelerate time to burn off most of the excess until your ~5 minutes from the maneuver node (or however long you think you need to make an intercept maneuver node). What this is doing is getting the orbits to align reasonably close, and it\u0027s the time inefficient part of this process.\n\nStep 3:\n\nScrap the existing maneuver node, then create another at about halfway between your current position and the intercept.

For that, the Docking Port Alignment Indicator that was previously mentioned will be important (and, I think, is probably closer to the tools that NASA used?) Without it, it is quick difficult.

But I\u0027ll run through it once...\n\nPart one, getting kinda close....\n\n1) Get into an orbit that is similar, but not identical to the target.\n\n a) You want the orbits to touch at one point (or one crosses the other a bit).\n\n ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Usually, for low Kerbal rendezvous, I set the periapsis of the ship to touch the orbit of the target and the apoapsis to be maybe 100 km higher than the target orbit.\n\n c) The orbit have to line up (have the same inclination). In the map, click on the target and choose \u0022select as target\u0022. Then you will see \u0022AN\u0022 (ascending node) and \u0022DN\u0022 (descending node) labeled on your orbit with a number (the number of degrees by which the planes of the orbits don\u0027t match). \n\n d) These points are the places where your obit plane crosses the plane of the target orbit. At one of these you have to burn to make them match. Burn straight north (if the number is negative) or straight south (if the number is positive) until the number is zero. (Closer to zero you get, the easier the next steps will be). \n\n e) At, or near, the point where the orbits touch, you will see the indicator(s) of closest approach. (If you can\u0027t see them, the orbits don\u0027t line up or they don\u0027t cross\u0022).\n\n f) You will also see where the target will be when you reach the closest approach (and hovering over the closes approach indicator will show how far you will be from the target you will be at closes approach). (the intercept.)\n\n e) If you put a maneuver node just past the closest approach, it will show you the next closest approach after the maneuver node (ie on the next orbit).\n\n f) Your keep clicking on the maneuver node to set it ahead one orbit, you will see the next closest approach on the next orbit(s). \n\n g) As you do this, you will see the indicator of where the target is move showing its position on the different closest approaches. \n\n h) Do this until you get a close approach.\n\n i) then use the node to adjust that approach (burning prograde or retrograde) until it is as close you are can get it. (A few km\u0027s or less, hopefully).\n\n j) make sure you don\u0027t adjust the orbit so you hit the atmosphere or ground, if that happens, try the orbit before or after instead.\n\n k) For me, with an orbit bigger than the target one, I usually can see the position at closest approach get closer and closer as I advance orbit by orbit. I do this until it passes the intercept. Then burning retrograde moves it back to match up. This has the advantage that I\u0027m bringing the orbits closer together (with will make final approach easier).\n\n l) Once done, you wait until you reach this closes appoach and then match speeds.\n\nStep two, getting close.\n\na) When you are within 25-50km of the target, use your nave ball (set on \u0022target\u0022 rather than \u0022orbit\u0022) to turn your ship so that if points away from the relative direction of motion (the yellow circle with three lines sticking out and a cross inside). This is the direction that you will need to be pointing to kill the relative velocities (and match orbits).\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) as you get close to the intercept setup above, switch out of map mode. When you are within 25-50km of the target, you should be able to see the target indicated on your screen with the distance listed.\n\nc) You intercept indicators will be telling you how close you can expect to get.\n\nd) At that point, the target will be off to the side moving laterally.\n\ne) Just before this point (allowing time for a burn, you will have to play with this until you get a feel). Do a burn away from the direction of relative velocity (as above) until the relative speed (as indicated on the nave ball) is as close to zero as possible.\n\nf) If you burn too much, flip around and burn again to get to zero.\n\ng) Now point your ship toward the target.\n\nh) Do a gentle burn to move slowing toward it.\n\ni) If you have RCS thrusters, you can use them to try and line up the relative velocity indicator with the direction the target is in. (Making you move more directly right toward)\n\nj) When you get as close as you are going to (or before you run into it), flip away from the relative velocity and do a burn as with \u0022e \u0026 f\u0022 above. (Or use your RCS thruster to kill you relative velocity.) \n\nk) You are now relatively motionless with respect to the target, but closer than you were with step e \u0026 f)\n\nl) repeat steps g-k again until you close enough for the stranded Kerbal to EVA and fly to your ship."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:45:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looking over the comments, the video by GoSlash27 may be too ambitions (trying to launch directly into docking with the target) for beginners.\n\n I absolutely agree with this.
