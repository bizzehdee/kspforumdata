Most people here have developed intuition about docking (and orbital mechanics) that allows them to customize their approach to taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a simple approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage (after orbit in same direction) is intercept. It sounds like you have this figured out but I\u0027ll include it regardless. Match inclination with target (you can do this later, but it makes node placement harder). The larger orbit has less rotational velocity. Preferably the larger orbit is \u0022ahead\u0022 of the lower, but the cyclical nature of orbits will get you a rendezvous regardless. What you don\u0027t want is two intercepts. There is little difference in period in that case. Regardless your goal is to plan and execute a node to create an intercept point. The less distance at intercept, the less fuel you need to burn for rendezvous. The planning is best done with intuition, but you can simplify it by creating a single intercept of the orbital traces (so one orbit \u0022rolls\u0022 in the other) and mofiying the orbit at the intersection to get an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you intercept, your nav ball should automatically switch to target mode. You don\u0027t need the map from here. To close distance, burn on a heading between target and retrograde so that your prograde and target markers align (once you develop the intuition, you actually want progeade to be slightly off of target to account for the rotational velocity). Mind your heading (to keep on target), speed and distance (to avoid overshoot) to target. Your goal is to reach less than 1m/s within 30-50 m from target. Intuition is important here. TWR determines your acceleration and thus which closing speed distance combinations are controllable. Most ships can zero speed with less than 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you rendezvous, you need to dock. Don\u0027t touch main throttle without developing proper intuition. Rotational velocity of orbit will cause ships to gradually rotate along the normal axis. Aligning ports to this axis allows you to ignore attitude adjustments (tools and/or intuition are almost required to dock along a non-normal axis). Use RCS translate so that the target and (anti-)normal indicators align. Then give a little trust to add a prograde marker to the set. Keep these three aligned (stop the ship to do so if you lack intuition to correct in route) and you should dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly recommend learning to dock on simple ships (low part count, docking port aligned to control direction and in line with CoM). You want to develop your intuition four maneuvers before dealing with the challenges brought from complex craft. OTOH, dealing with such craft strengths your intuition, so don\u0027t avoid them forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T22:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrklaw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mrklaw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI find the intercepts difficult to use combined with the tricky camera in the orbital map view.

As an aside, I will say that if you want to dock two docking ports (and you will), the final approach is the hardest thing (mostly because you are working on a 3-dimensional problem on a 2-dimensional screen). For that, the Docking Port Alignment Indicator that was previously mentioned will be important (and, I think, is probably closer to the tools that NASA used?) Without it, it is quick difficult.

In the map, click on the target and choose \u0022select as target\u0022. Then you will see \u0022AN\u0022 (ascending node) and \u0022DN\u0022 (descending node) labeled on your orbit with a number (the number of degrees by which the planes of the orbits don\u0027t match). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d) These points are the places where your obit plane crosses the plane of the target orbit. At one of these you have to burn to make them match. Burn straight north (if the number is negative) or straight south (if the number is positive) until the number is zero. (Closer to zero you get, the easier the next steps will be). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e) At, or near, the point where the orbits touch, you will see the indicator(s) of closest approach. (If you can\u0027t see them, the orbits don\u0027t line up or they don\u0027t cross\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E f) You will also see where the target will be when you reach the closest approach (and hovering over the closes approach indicator will show how far you will be from the target you will be at closes approach). (the intercept.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e) If you put a maneuver node just past the closest approach, it will show you the next closest approach after the maneuver node (ie on the next orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E f) Your keep clicking on the maneuver node to set it ahead one orbit, you will see the next closest approach on the next orbit(s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E g) As you do this, you will see the indicator of where the target is move showing its position on the different closest approaches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E h) Do this until you get a close approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i) then use the node to adjust that approach (burning prograde or retrograde) until it is as close you are can get it. (A few km\u0027s or less, hopefully).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E j) make sure you don\u0027t adjust the orbit so you hit the atmosphere or ground, if that happens, try the orbit before or after instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E k) For me, with an orbit bigger than the target one, I usually can see the position at closest approach get closer and closer as I advance orbit by orbit. I do this until it passes the intercept. Then burning retrograde moves it back to match up.
