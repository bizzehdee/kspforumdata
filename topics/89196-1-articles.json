Would it be possible instead to implement scripts for random encounters with alien ships, similar to asteroids? I know nothing about modding KSP, but it seems like it would be fairly straightforward to simulate the presence of a hostile and/or friendly AI with random scripted encounters and different effects on your Kerbals and ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay for example on your first successful Mun landing an alien ship is spawned in a low fly-by of your landing site, with an impossibly fast escape trajectory. Later, after a random number of landings or after 3 planets, whichever comes first, there is a second fly-by that drops off a small probe lander that impacts near your landing site, and carries a beacon/artifact that you can pick up using KAS. The artifact could have a variety of effects, such as playing an alien gibberish soundbite, being reclaimable for science or funds, or attracting hostile/friendly encounters, or all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe hostile aliens would teleport and abduct your kerbals during EVA while on a fly-by or damage your ship if you got too close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?
