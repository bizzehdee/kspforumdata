It looks like a nice modular design and I think I made something similar for 40t when I started making SSTO rockets. The 1x2 engines aren\u0027t too efficient but they do make a simple and reliable design :-)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethose are definitely a quick and dirty solution to transport, im not looking for efficiency in my ground to orbit stages, thats why my space booster system runs on nukes. i probably should have been more clear in my original request when i said i was looking for a effective design i wasnt looking for some crazy scheme to get fuel up cheap with a complicated design, i was looking for something low on the parts count that can do the dirty work of sending something heavy up with reliability and a good range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T20:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep - there are many different criteria for \u0027efficient\u0027; lowest mass, cost, part-count, fastest, etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours is actually optimised more than mine, but mine is fully recoverable.
