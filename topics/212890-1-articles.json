I built a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane and got it into orbit, left the game, and upon rejoining the wings were glitched. One wing wasn\u0027t attached to the body of the craft anymore, floating a bit off to the side. The rudder was also bent to the left \u0026amp; both of the wings were bent at a certain angle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, when building a rocket I noticed during the launch sequence that the fairing began to visually \u0022crack in half\u0022 splitting into a bunch of small parts. My plane seemed uncontrollable once the glitches occurred on the wings/rudder but the fairing breaking did not seem to effect the flight of the rocket. I wasn\u0027t able to capture a screenshot of this but I will post one if I do end up capturing it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
