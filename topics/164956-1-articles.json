I am looking for the file I must edit manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need to do it since I am using Realism Overhaul with Real Solar System and the pressure on Venus surface is 2.375 times higher than max pressure for ANY part, which is set at 4000kpa. I am using KSP 1.2.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand, in the real world, there were human probes landing on Venus so, I want to correct this in the game files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T03:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parameter is called \u0027maxPressure = 4000\u0027 (4000 is the current default for all parts), and the cfg files of parts can be found in /GameData/Squad/Parts.
