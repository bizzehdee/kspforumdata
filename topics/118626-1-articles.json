KSP by default starts in borderless windowed, and changing it in settings doesn\u0027t work ( there is a hack to force it though). Since Windows desktop can be treated as fullscreen application, shadowplay has a setting to just record everything on desktop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably your problem is that in previous version of Windows you were using \u0022record desktop\u0022 mode of shadowplay to record KSP and update disabled it.
