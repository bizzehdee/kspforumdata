COM/COL balance is as good as any craft, looking at far statistics its not the best craft but there are worse builded planes i made that flies better, pitching causes some rotation as more pitch leads to more rotation , realy fierce to fight through(that is IF YOU CAN GET OUT OF THE RUN WAY) since plane just roates to left or right in the run way, rotating a lot in the opposite direction so before you rotate too hard you have enough speed to lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/547037/SPIRIT-craft.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/547037/SPIRIT-craft.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is craft file, if you want to test you have to proove worthy of testing my craft by waiting 10 seconds \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (sorry, i usualy upload images not files)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReaper","CreatedById":75943,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T19:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso i have put this plane and similar designs with updates to the tests, and got interesting results, appereantly this wing design and similar ones with updates creates some problems with the game and over all aerodynamics, with this new design pitching is a bit better and plane keeps its nose when i stop pressing something, i dont know how all the controll surface loads on the back previously wasnt enough,it doesnt fix the take off problem it wants to roll over again, but once you do take off, some interesting things happen, such as using YAW controlls, like A or D, will resbond in the opposite direction when the engines are on, for example if you are looking at the plane from behind, presing A will turn the craft to right side, when the engines are off yaw controlls return to normal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Ebl5b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
