Might I suggest using this model.

The author (from his posts on the linked thread) is ok with someone turning the model into a part for KSP. You could use this, as it would save you much work, it should only need a collision mesh, as it is already modeled textured and uv mapped.\n\nThe one major issue with that model is that it has a tri-count of over 130.000 and face-count over 200.000 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) That is way overkill for KSP.
