Rarity and utility factor into that somewhat, but demand can come from completely abstract (and potentially bs) factors like \u0027intrinsic value\u0027 or \u0027collectibility\u0027. I\u0027ve done some work in the antique toys business, and I\u0027ve encountered plenty of items that are in good condition, have good build quality, are quite rare and are *literally worthless* because nobody collects them. If we get stuff like that in an auction lot, it either goes to a charity shop or is left at a car boot sale with a sign saying \u0027take me\u0027.\n\nMay I say, that I do hate that so many people don\u0027t understand what supply and demand REALLY is about. For instance, there is a very limited supply of MY toenail clippings, yet I can\u0027t get anyone to purchase even a single one. There\u0027s also an extremely large supply of drinkable water, but we gladly pay extra just so it can be in a bottle. Supply and demand is a relationship of *perceived value* and nothing more, the real point being made is how to exploit it into getting people to pay more for something that costs less.\n\nThe thing is, value really is simply \u0022what someone is willing to pay for it.\u0022\n\nLet me point something out, Open Source treats the end product as have no value, but then some people misconceive that the labor \u0022already committed\u0022 can have value that remains unbalanced. Open Source is a \u0022donate to improve\u0022 economy, but if you\u0027re improving DESPITE the lack of donations all you\u0027re saying is that your labor has NO VALUE. You cannot recover free labor, you cannot get pissy and rant about the lack of donations, it is economics 101 and many developers fail to understand exactly what \u0022value\u0022 is.\n\nIf you do work \u0022for free\u0022 then the value you put on your labor is \u0022free\u0022 and that is the value that others perceive your labor to be."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T14:45:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E And raised values in high demand - why do you blame the seller ?

Problem solved.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It is an exploit. Increasing the price of something by the same amount, in small increments at a time, makes it so that it goes up in smaller and smaller fractions each time, making people believe that it is only a small increase, and still worth the buy. It\u0027s just another way to pull money from people because of greed.\n\nIf you want prices to be well - maintained and things are rationed, go to NK.
