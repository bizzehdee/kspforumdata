I always wondered what radiators would weigh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is what... just over four kg of radiator mass per kW of waste heat? Yes, that number includes the shielding, but for simplicty\u0027s sake, let\u0027s call it 4 kg per kW of waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would put NASA\u0027s SAFE-400 test reactor at 1,200 kg radiator mass since it has 300 kW waste heat to reject. And a total system mass of ~1,750 kg, which presumably includes shielding already, as I didn\u0027t bother subtracting it above. Since it produces 100 kW of power, that would put it at 57.14 W/kg, or if you prefer, 17.5 kg/kW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does solar offer by comparison? Well, a wikipedia quote from around 2005 says that arrays with 300 W/kg are available. A convenient data point, since the SAFE-400 is also from the early 2000\u0027s. That\u0027s rather puzzling, isn\u0027t it? It suggests that, as long as physical size is not an issue, solar cells from ten years ago will significantly outperform our best attempt at a space grade nuclear reactor even as far out as Mars, where roughly 43% of sunlight is available (~130 W/kg with the mentioned arrays). It outperforms it by such a large margin that even if modern technology flat-out halved the weight of the radiators compared to the TOPAZ system, the reactor would still not be anywhere near competitive at Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering how nuclear reactors are always touted as the wonder solution to electric propulsion, I always end up really puzzled whenever I look at the numbers like this, and I wonder what the rest of you are thinking.
