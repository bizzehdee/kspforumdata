Lots of internal changes for only a few external ones. This took something like 20 commits on github and quite a bit of testing (thank you JeffreyCor for putting up with so many broken builds).

You are given 15 extra upgrades automatically instead. This is still much lower than before (it would take 38 upgrades to reach a 1BP/s rate in both buildings). If you didn\u0027t delete the settings file, you will want to change the number of upgrades given to sandbox games to 45, the new default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can edit ships that are in progress or already completed in case you forgot to add a part or need to take one off. The amount of progress made on the ship is reduced by 1.1 times the difference in BP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Scrapping partially completed ships adds parts to the inventory, meaning that time isn\u0027t totally wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Added a window at new game start (will popup for everyone this update).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed a bunch of issues with the crew selection gui.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease take a look at the changelog, it gives a better list of changes than this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t really be available for questions too much today or tomorrow, but ask away and I\u0027ll try to respond when I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote to JeffreyCor: You\u0027ll notice that you also get 15 upgrades at game start despite getting them already.

Ideally it would appear instead of the default window that pops up when you click on the launch pad or runway. Maybe I\u0027ll try to get this working for the next update.

Perhaps also requiring down-time between launches before you can reuse a Kerbal. I plan on doing this as a separate mod that KCT interfaces with, so I can learn how to do that and also so people can use it even if they don\u0027t want to use KCT. It\u0027s a secondary priority to KCT, and I won\u0027t be able to start work on it for at least a week. I\u0027m thinking of having it take a few days to train them, with a rate dependent on their stupidity (less stupidity means a faster rate), with a special rate for Kerbals with the badS trait (like Jeb). I like the idea of having different stages/classes of training (as a purely visual thing) that they go through (which would be somewhat silly but reasonable), like \u0022Lithobraking 101\u0022.
