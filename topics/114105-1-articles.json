It\u0027s such a strong spin that I can\u0027t stop it even if I lean on the controls to prevent it. This is with SAS enabled and the engine\u0027s own gimballing.\n\nNow, through a bit of trial I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s the probe core\u0027s own torque wheel seems to be causing it. When I turn off the wheel it doesn\u0027t spin like that. On the other hand it renders the probe unable to turn when the engine is off, so it makes orbital maneuvers hard.\n\nI think I have also noticed this with other craft since the release of 1.0.4. Has anyone else seen this?? For reference, I only use a few mods (FAR, EngineerRedux) so I don\u0027t think those are the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T16:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wilconquer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T10:47:41Z","Content":"Have you used the \u0022offset\u0022 feature ?\n\nI had this problem ona plane where I offset a part.

First, it\u0027s not FAR assists, those default to \u0027off\u0027 and I barely use them. Second, I have checked the Kerbal Engineer and there will be a huge torque, but only when I\u0027m on the retrograde marker-side of my vectors. For some reason, it doesn\u0027t want to point retrograde at all (this is why I got so angry yesterday when I couldn\u0027t land a basic, teeny-tiny probe because it kept flipping around). But it seems to settle really nicely on the prograde side and will obey pointing commands with SAS on. Also, I keep hitting Option\u002BX for resetting trim (I\u0027m on OS X) and I *think* it\u0027s resetting? I\u0027m honestly not sure.\n\nRight now, I\u0027m trying to remake the probe in the VAB and balance it better (grid-snap on, symmetry for all parts) and see if I can make a better probe. Thanks to all, hopefully this doesn\u0027t become a thing that makes my current save unplayable."},{"CreatedByName":"wilconquer","CreatedById":146948,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T16:54:06Z","Content":"Okay, I\u0027m really confused now and I keep rage quitting when I can\u0027t make simple orbital insertions. Update: I build a whole new craft, use only symmetry mode, lock to grid, double up on parts that I don\u0027t normally (two antennas to \u0027balance\u0027 them). I make sure that FAR assists are disabled. I have reset the trim (I can\u0027t tell if it goes, but I hit Option\u002BX anyway). So I get to Minmus, point the thing retrograde, fire full thrust...\n\n...and it whips around prograde like it\u0027s in the wind or something...\n\nYou know when you\u0027re reentering with a capsule and it\u0027s in a sort of locally-stable orientation? If you let go of the SAS you KNOW it\u0027ll whip around the other way? This is what\u0027s happening, only with the actual control surfaces doing it. I can see the pitch and yaw controls in the bottom left suddenly slamming down and right when I hit the Z key to go full throttle.\n\nI have no idea! I\u0027m going to slowing uninstall every mod (there aren\u0027t many) until this goes away. Could this be kOS doing something? I just installed it to try it out, and I never had problems with KSP before I installed kOS."},{"CreatedByName":"Viatic_unicycle","CreatedById":147011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T08:23:06Z","Content":"I have had the same problem with the lv-909.
