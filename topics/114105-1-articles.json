It\u0027s such a strong spin that I can\u0027t stop it even if I lean on the controls to prevent it. This is with SAS enabled and the engine\u0027s own gimballing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, through a bit of trial I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s the probe core\u0027s own torque wheel seems to be causing it. When I turn off the wheel it doesn\u0027t spin like that. On the other hand it renders the probe unable to turn when the engine is off, so it makes orbital maneuvers hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have also noticed this with other craft since the release of 1.0.4. Has anyone else seen this??

First, it\u0027s not FAR assists, those default to \u0027off\u0027 and I barely use them. Second, I have checked the Kerbal Engineer and there will be a huge torque, but only when I\u0027m on the retrograde marker-side of my vectors. For some reason, it doesn\u0027t want to point retrograde at all (this is why I got so angry yesterday when I couldn\u0027t land a basic, teeny-tiny probe because it kept flipping around). But it seems to settle really nicely on the prograde side and will obey pointing commands with SAS on. Also, I keep hitting Option\u002BX for resetting trim (I\u0027m on OS X) and I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s resetting?
