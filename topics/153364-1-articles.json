I was going to have the santa mod installed and take female kerbals around my .90 save to all my colonies that only have males since females hadn\u0027t been added yet. I want to copy the files for female kerbals to a copy of .90 but I don\u0027t know where to start. Is this even possible?

You need to introduce a second name generator to a game that was built with the assumption that only one such generator will ever exist. You need to modify the way savegames are read and writtem to include a reference to the gender of a Kerbal. You need to load and animate the model.
