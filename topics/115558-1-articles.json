A little overheating isn\u0027t a problem. I often break the sound barrier by like 5 km. Your rapiers should no longer be accelerating you on airbreathing at about 24-25 km. By then you should do at least 1300 m/s and if you really do it well, over 1450 is possible (though you will run a bit hot by then). Shallow out at about 10 km, but no sharp turns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal gut feeling is that letting the engines run at low key and keeping apo at 45-50 seconds till you actually hit your target apo at near orbital speed saves some fuel compared to shutting the engines down after hitting the projected apo and then coasting up to there, then firing the heck out of them to circularise. My gut tells me you\u0027d be reaching the same speed twice... and since I lose up to 200 m/s while coasting up, that sounds quite non-efficient to me. (note, the earlier method does take a bit more time).

I\u0027ll take a stab at it anyway.

Now, we have the wing area, but that\u0027s the total wing area; for each individual wing, we want half that area, so you\u0027ve got 0.5A = 0.5 * [r\u002Bt] * s. The 0.5s cancel each other out: A = [r\u002Bt]*s, and then you solve for r\u002Bt: [r\u002Bt] = A/s = 110 / 7.42 = 14.825 meters. You put the root length at half the total length of your plane, and whatever\u0027s left goes to the tip. If the tip length turns out to be longer than the root length, you need to lengthen your plane. If the tip length is zero or less, you\u0027re building a pure delta. In between those two cases your plane is a cropped delta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut like I said, I don\u0027t have knowledge of the stock parts, so I couldn\u0027t tell you what combination of parts would give you these figures. The formulas work; I can tell you that much - anything that flies in FAR should fly in stock just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T16:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T15:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use FAR just look at the AoA value, if it\u0027s under 5 degrees you\u0027ve got enough lift for easy level flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeg:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QwpW6mH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QwpW6mH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also tells you wing area, and quite a lot of other info about how the plane will behave.

Also get rid of your strakes in the front they may be blocking airflow for your intakes. Finaly switch to shock cone and precooler as I feel this gives more air when you going faster then 1100 m/s for less drag. Just like with everything else less here means less there. Less wing area means less weight and less drag. Thus you can have less engines. less engines means you need less fuel which means you can have less lift. My SSTO achieved 21.5t per engine and i think 12.9t per lift\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically if it can barely takeoff you probably have a good chance of making it to space. I do want to try trading lift for thrust i.e. 18t per engine and 16t per lift and see if that works better. Aiming for something that can hit 200\u002B by the end of the runway and just barely fly until 350ish. This should be able to hit 1470ish at 22km on air saving you a ton of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T20:08:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith 4 or 3 rapiers, set air breathing /rocket modes to action groups so that when you start running out of intake air (flaming out), you can toggle only two of them to rocket mode (or maybe just one if using 3 rapiers). That way you can use that economic air breathing mode to as high altitude as possible, switch the rest to rocket mode only when they start flaming out again. I find doing this helps spare some fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
