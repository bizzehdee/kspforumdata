They are (as far as I understand) pretty much ramjets with oxidizer and fuel, except more efficient.

As far as I understand they need some sort of cowling/intake around the body which redirects the air towards the exhaust. I see two problems here: while the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E would probably be higher the cowling/intake part adds drag, mass and as the air flows into the exhaust it probably lowers the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the engine (because of raised pressure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I imagining this correctly?

So...it should help from about mach 0.5 to mach 5 (maybe as much as mach 10 depending on ascent profile? I dont know), but beyond that... its added dry mass.

Because specific impulse = exhaust velocity, as far as I understand..???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit, augmentation adds reaction mass, which at same or even lowered Isp, adds thrust. Which will mean higher total delta-v. Am I wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe specific impulse is a measure of how much impulse (momentum) is provided by an engine per unit mass of propellant. For rockets, this can be found simply as the exhaust velocity, for obvious reasons: ejecting one kilogram of propellant at 1000 m/s provides 1000 kg*m/s of momentum. Now the time derivative of momentum is force (in this case, thrust), and the time derivative of unit mass is mass flow rate (in this case, fuel consumption), so we can say that a given engine provides a certain amount of thrust at a given fuel consumption rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inverse of thrust at consumption rate is consumption rate for a given amount of thrust, also known as thrust-specific fuel consumption. If you know your engine\u0027s thrust-specific fuel consumption, you can derive exhaust velocity and thus find specific impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor airbreathers, however, the measure of impulse per propellant unit mass is different. Because the engine is using the atmosphere as part (or even most) of its reaction mass, the actual exhaust velocity is unimportant. Instead, you find out how much fuel is consumed every second for a given amount of thrust, and then you derive \u003Cem\u003Eeffective\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Especific impulse from that, even though it is no longer tied in any way to the actual exhaust velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn air-augmented rocket uses ram pressure to collect and channel airflow. The engine exhaust is then used to compress and accelerate the collected air. The actual exhaust velocity is lower, but since you are working with more reaction mass, you get much more thrust for the same fuel consumption, so the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeffective\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Especific impulse is higher.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the case even if you are not actually using the oxygen in the air to burn with fuel. It\u0027s just free reaction mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem is that as you move faster and faster, the drag produced by collecting that air makes it less and less \u0022free\u0022. So you can only use air augmentation up to a point. This point is typically higher than what could be used by a scramjet, though, since you don\u0027t actually have to combust the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223001407\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490779538\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002239636\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Veeltch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore isp means more delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s like having a balloon full of air.

With a balloon the actual thing you\u0027re dealing with is the air resistance against the balloon. Releasing a balloon allows the thrust to continue for a while, pushing through the air. Popping the balloon has the same specific impulse, more or less, but the thrust is not sustained and so the air will immediately slow down the balloon fragments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe confusion arises because when you\u0027re dealing with chemical fuels, higher-specific-energy fuels like liquid hydrogen are not as dense as lower-specific-energy fuels like kerosene, and so\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0rocket engines with higher specific impulses have lower thrust-to-weight ratios.

If you can push kerosene through the engine for high thrust and low specific impulse at launch, then gradually switch to liquid hydrogen for higher specific impulse when your thrust requirements aren\u0027t so high, you have a great system. Of course, designing an engine and turbopump that can run on different fuel types at different temperatures is no easy task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love to see an aerospike engine using staged-combustion HTP to run the turbopumps and\u00A0variable-mixture LH/RP1 as fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T13:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome more thoughts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAir augmentation by itself doesn\u0027t necessarily give enough added performance to easily enable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it could be really useful if combined with other concepts.
