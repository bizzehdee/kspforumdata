This one flew to a higher altitude at a faster speed, due to a very-slightly-more-powerful motor. This time, thanks to the addition of some electrical tape, Jeb remained safe on his carrier seat. In other words, the flight went as close to perfectly as anyone could hope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the video.

I\u0027m glad that so many people are taking an interest in model rocketry. It\u0027s a really cool hobby, and I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s understandable for KSP players.\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket was built from a Madcow Rocketry \u0022Cowabunga\u0022 kit [link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.madcowrocketry.com/Cowabunga_Rocket_p/k-128.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.madcowrocketry.com/Cowabunga_Rocket_p/k-128.htm\u003C/a\u003E ]. I wouldn\u0027t recommend building a Cowabunga if you don\u0027t have much rocketry experience, but once you\u0027re ready to fly big things, it\u0027s a good place to start. I also built a short, custom payload section on the top of the rocket for the GoPro camera and for the Kerbal. With Kerbal and camera in tow, the rocket is four inches in diameter, a little over two feet tall and a hair over three pounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cowabunga originally cost $59.95, though with shipping and purchases of items such as parachute protectors, the cost ended up closer to $100 for that section. The custom-built bit cost only about $10 (it was mostly made out of inexpensive cardboard tubing). The rocket motor was a reloadable, so the casing cost $60 but the actual propellant only cost $25 or so per flight. For recording flight data, I used an AltimeterTwo, which cost about $60. The camera was by far the most expensive part, at $500. As for Jeb? He only cost ~$3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always fly the Cowabunga on an H123W reloadable from a rocket-motor manufacturer called Aerotech. (The H123 is large enough to boost the rocket to an impressive altitude while still staying under 4oz. propellant, and the total rocket is \u003Cem\u003Ejuuuuust\u003C/em\u003E under 3.3lbs, which means I can fly it without a wavier or anything! My rocketry club covers the FAA notification so I don\u0027t even have to do that.). Whenever the camera\u0027s on the rocket, I can expect about 1500 feet in altitude, but without the camera it has reached 2,000 feet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any questions, comments, concerns, complaints or consternations? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T18:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etoo cool! just shared this on my facebook! two thumbs up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T21:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...and, just to keep the thread alive, a few photos \u003Cstrong\u003E(Very large!
