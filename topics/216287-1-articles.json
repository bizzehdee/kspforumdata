I dont know why Alt\u002BZ doesnt reset it, or why the both craft suddenly gained loads of yaw trim without me holding alt, but with the issue visible I was able to fix it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI launched a vessel into orbit - a very simple one - and the vessel constantly acts as if I\u0027m holding the D key, and will keep spinning until I disable the reaction wheels. Alt-Z to try and reset the trim doesnt work. I sent another vessel to dock with it, and that vessel was fine until it got within simulation radius of the previous one, then it did exactly the same thing: It will spin like I\u0027m holding D until I turn the reaction wheels off.
