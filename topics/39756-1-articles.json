At first due to structural failures on launch which have been fixed, now my orbits are degrading, and rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been attempting to put it into higher, and higher orbits but each time before I can send it to my station its orbit degrades and it ends coming back down to Kerbin. I started with 80km orbit, went to 90, 100, 125, 150, testing 200 now and even so I see it coming back down. If I switch to the map screen I see my orbit as showing as stable with the closest me getting to kerbin around 180 but for some reason I am continually coming back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T13:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by annallia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T23:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny orbit above 70km should not decay.

The orbit is determined by velocity, independent of mass, provided you get periapsis above 70km where the drag kicks in (for Kerbin, see the wiki for other planets). Now it does take a lot more propellant to get more mass to orbit, hence normalizing fuel using delta-V rather than propellant mass (it also accounts for the logarithmic nature of the rocket equation). For 2 different rockets the delta-V to achieve the same orbit should be close - with the flight path and drag being the key additional variables. Two spacecraft in the same orbit should have the exact same velocity at the same point in their orbit (angle relative periapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T23:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will try time warping to fix it, it cannot be energy, all of my refuelers have generators on them (just in case I clip more panels on the station..) and enough that even with everything on they don\u0027t ever run out of energy.
