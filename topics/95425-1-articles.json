The problem was during the descent the plane seemed to just lock into a nose dive. If I disable the sas and pull up it only moves up a couple of degrees and then bounces back. If I reactivate the engine it starts into a spin or just speeds up the descent. I try to pull up until I hit 600m then deploy the emergency shoots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Plane: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZroVQmN,gYHo20R,qfTIFAv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ZroVQmN,gYHo20R,qfTIFAv\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T22:10:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by locustgate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalMacDa","CreatedById":133064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T21:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably too heavy and doesn\u0027t have enough lift.
