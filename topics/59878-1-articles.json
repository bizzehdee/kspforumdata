This is an area that has always fascinated me... and to be frank, all the satellite trackers I\u0027ve seen have been very lacking. It would be cool to suck in real-world telemetry and build an interactive map of man-made objects throughout the solar system (and their paths). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this hasn\u0027t been done before, I would imagine someone would need to set up a server to constantly import tracking data and make this available in some sort of useful format. From there, a mod in the game would need to import this data into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a long-term stretch goal would be to actually have realistic craft files AND info on how much propellant a ship has left.
