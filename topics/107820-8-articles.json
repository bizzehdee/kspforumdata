At high altitudes other engines choke where pulsejets/ramjets simply shine.\n\n2. I had to add Tweakscale support for parts to make them workable on my craft. All i did was add Tweakscale MM patch used for stock engines and intakes respectively.\n\n3. I did notice that partially clipping (even if only \u0022near\u0022 mesh) parts with pulsejets cause phantom forces on launch, i don\u0027t know if this is related to scaling, more specifically it was B9 proc wing clipping with exhaust\n\nI like how engines each cover one stage of ascent (and by \u0022stage\u0022 i don\u0027t mean separating, just switching) with enough overlap to secure transition from standard flight to suborbital trajectory.\n\nPulsejets pretty much haul for first part, providing plenty of thrust where its needed - at high altitudes my upscaled engines provided about 10MN of thrust (yes you read it right - MegaNewtons).
