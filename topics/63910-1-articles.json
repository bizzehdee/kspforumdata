As I\u0027m playing now I do have that, but that\u0027s a way off from where the AAR written is so here you\u0027ll only have Kermins in KSC etc, written about but not seen in the pics... yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Call it retconning if you want *shrugs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETesting\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFootsteps clattered down the mostly empty halls of KSC, the few people who were up at this hour of the early morning hurried to get out of the Kerbal\u0027s way.

Oh, right. We\u0027ve got primary and secondary telemetry links to establish, cross check the main data bus on remote guidance feed, do a subsidiary and primary diagnostic on the sensor systems as well as a full system integration analysis.\u0022 He said, slowly slipping back into his more usual, geeky persona.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger wilco.\u0022 She said, getting started, then after a few seconds paused and turned back, nodding towards Ipdel\u0027s cheek where she\u0027d kissed him. \u0022By the way, that meant yes.\u0022 and she turned back to her controls, satisfied that she\u0027d managed to fluster him again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, heck. If all these guys were going to \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E she was dating him, she might as well get something out of it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was going to be an interesting tour in Mission Control!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N6G7tI5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N6G7tI5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And we have liftoff!\u0022 Gene announced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe somewhat sombre tone in Mission Control lifted a little now that the rather truculent drone was finally in the air. The last few hours had been... troublesome. Numerous problems had cropped up with the linkage between the flight control computers and the onboard systems. Ipdel had been run ragged as the scheduled launch slipped back hour after hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally he\u0027d sorted the last problems with the secondary data relays and the countdown had restarted for the last time. As the crew watched the ship soar into the sky the tired Ipdel pored over his controls, his new assistant somewhat worried for him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know now it\u0027s going you could take a break? I can monitor the systems to...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel frowned at Machel and shook his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022During a launch? You gotta be kidding!\u0022 He said, then went back to the displays. \u0022MJ Systems speed regulation is stabilized at terminal velocity... and holding. Standing by to engage acceleration limiters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027trick\u0027 of limiting your speed to the terminal velocity (the speed that an object falling under gravity stabilizes at) for a neutral object at the specific altitude you were at had been known for some time. Jeb had notoriously flown to orbit on one of the early flights without telling flight control that he\u0027d \u0027acquired\u0027 a simple chart of terminal velocities (for a falling Kerbal has it happens, not the regulation \u0027neutral object\u0027 KSC had later approved) and manually matched it on ascent, reducing drag losses without loosing more due to gravity loss that he gained. The results were arriving in orbit with extra fuel, more leeway on landing utilizing that extra fuel, and Jeb thoroughly \u0027thanking\u0027 the young scientist who\u0027d printed the chart out for him. She\u0027d gone on to bigger and better things at least, or so the scuttlebutt around KSC said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp till recently the same trick was programmed into the ship\u0027s systems, giving a readout of what the current terminal velocity was at any given altitude. If the ship\u0027s engines pushed it faster than that, throttle down. Fairly simple. Now with the new automation systems the ship could automatically regulate to terminal velocity without any pilot input, on the ship or remotely from KSC. It heralded quite a few simplifications during launches in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of acceleration limiters, to throttle back as the ship lost mass so high acceleration wouldn\u0027t stress the frame, was almost an afterthought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gravity turn initialized.\u0022 Machel said quietly \u0022Systems steady.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control slowly became more tense again as the shutdown of the boosters and the initialization of the new atomic engines got closer. The ship arced further and further over, slowly approaching horizontal as it\u0027s altitude increased. A couple of minutes into the launch and the ship was well over fifty kilometers up and the single stage of boosters was nearly spent. The last few checks on the new engines were run before the staging command was given. This was not left up to automatics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1WmNB4S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221WmNB4S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And... booster shutdown. Jettisoning boosters.\u0022 Ipdel nervously eyed the readouts, but the boosters separated perfectly. \u0022Warmup sequence on reactor is... complete. All readouts are in the green. Thermal dissipation panels extending... and locked. Pumps read green on thermal dissipators. Coolant systems nominal... I am reading slightly higher than expected thermal transfer to the dissipation systems. Flight, can I get a check on estimated thermal balance?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene routed through EECOM and Telemetry as well as a few other stations to get an accurate estimate on where the current thermal systems would end up after a few hours to a day or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s going to be high, but within tolerance. With the reactor at 30% it should stabilize at maybe 80% to 85% thermal load.\u0022 Gene said finally, relaying the data from various sources around Mission Control. \u0022Since the reactor only needs to be at 100% for the main engine, and the main engine actively cools the systems I don\u0027t see it as a problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Understood flight. Going for NuExT initialization.\u0022 Ipdel said, routing the reaction mass of the large quantity of hydrogen from the tanks to the \u0027Nuclear Exhaust Thermal\u0027 engine. \u0022Telemetry reads good. We are on heading for circularization burn. Engaging drive.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone tensed as the nuclear rocket warmed up, slowly rising to twenty five percent thrust at first. True, they\u0027d had LV-Ns running for over a year now, but this was a more complex animal altogether. No-one wanted a nuclear accident to rain radioactive debris on someone. Right now they were sub-orbital and were relying on the engine to finalize the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen everything read nominal Ipdel ramped the engine slowly up to the maximum one hundred percent on the throttle and the flight computer adjusted course to stabilize the already high apoapsis. They\u0027d purposely aimed for the boosters to kick the ship high, rather than adding more horizontal velocity. That way they gained more time outside atmosphere for the nuclear engine to stabilize the orbit. Now the apoapsis rose beyond a hundred and fifty kilometers as the engines burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIpdel and Machel monitored the systems carefully, Machel checking the subsidiary system computers such as thermal control while Ipdel focused more on navigation and guidance, his speciality anyway. Things seemed to be going well but Ipdel didn\u0027t let himself be lulled into a false sense of security and kept on the readouts right to the end of the burn. With a maximum acceleration of less than a third of a gravity that would take a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AuMHZcD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AuMHZcD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Booster confirmed beginning re-entry.\u0022 Milton said over on Telemetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least this launch wouldn\u0027t add to the already debris-packed orbits in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wvfd5PE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wvfd5PE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK, nearly there.\u0022 Ipdel muttered as the acceleration rose while the mass dropped. They wouldn\u0027t be using all of the fuel by a long shot, but it was enough of a shift to leave the vessel pulling higher gs as it went on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZlNx9gV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZlNx9gV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And.... engine shutdown.\u0022 Ipdel announced and immediately checked the navigation feeds. \u0022Stable orbit at 198 kilometers!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sigh seemed to race around Mission Control as the automated ship settled into orbit, it\u0027s reactor slowing to thirty percent load. Machel was the only one not relaxing and Ipdel\u0027s smile faded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is it?\u0022 he said softly, Gene starting to look in his direction questioningly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a few moments Machel didn\u0027t answer, then she glanced up with an anxious expression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m reading a failure on number four coolant pump.

Unfortunately the restart systems could not be automated. Perhaps they could send someone up to fix it later, then restart it? Maybe. Otherwise this whole project was a bust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OK people!\u0022 Gene said loudly. \u0022I know this is a disappointment, but don\u0027t loose sight of the goals. This was a test vessel. Gather as much data as you can before we shut the rest of the ship down. We need to know why this happened. Get to it people.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control personnel began tapping keyboards again furiously as the attempted to gain as much as possible from the ship before the project was shut down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know what happened.\u0022 Machel muttered, and Ipdel went over to her, laying a hand on her shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It happens, more often when things are rushed like this whole thing was too.\u0022 He said carefully. \u0022It\u0027s not your fault. Just try to find out what happened, OK Machel? We\u0027ll figure it out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a wan smile she knuckled down to her job and Ipdel sat back down to help her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a fun day!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T11:33:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPart link updates\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T06:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Science Base Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy492: Yeah, the whole data stack has been locked down, but I can\u0027t tell who by.

Excercise and drugs could only do so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile he had to deal with minor irritations like this IM with Rodsy back on Kerbin. It was only one of many he was dealing with at present, though most of the others were more interesting. Currently he was talking to Senbo himself on possibilities of extending reusability designs on vessels to the Mun. Two scientists on the continent of Lal that were interested in his theories on Solar ejecta and Electromagnetic resonance with planetary body local magnetic fields. A cartoonist in Barkton wanting to serialize his epic (as he told it) trip to Minmus with death defying feats and close call with Eastern music. Rodsy had chimed in half an hour ago and started talking about the Jool mission and why he couldn\u0027t look at the information from the recorders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanKEclectic: I thought you said you couldn\u0027t find any trace of it on the servers?

Seems something he wouldn\u0027t talk about had made him reluctant to talk about anything to either Jedwig (which Seanbur could understand) or Jeb.

It\u0027s infuriating!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeanbur shouldn\u0027t double post like that. Rodsy never answered the first post when he did that. Now he was more focused on Professor Lehnrick\u0027s theory on a weak plasma envelope, riding the Kerbolar wind and linking the different planetary bodies. Holding five conversations at once was hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Seanbur!\u0022 A hoarse cry from the corridor made him jump. \u0022Satellite\u0027s nearly below the horizon.

Things had seemed so much easier before KSC. He\u0027d been a happy go lucky Kerbal, loving everything life had thrown at him... until Jool. Partly it had been the two \u0027officers\u0027 on the mission. Jeb and Jedwig had either been at each other\u0027s throats or laughing with each other... and usually at the wrong times, as far as Rodsy could see anyway. Partly it had also been the sheer terror of the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d been near death, several times. To be in a dangerous situation was one thing, and just working through it going by your own efforts to see you through... but that Jool mission? He was glad they hadn\u0027t woken him up earlier as they were nearing Kerbin. He\u0027d already been worked up and that would have sent him over the edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rodsy? Hey, long time no see!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy turned, still a little shaky. Probably too much Koffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thomcan? Oh my Kod, since when were you at KSC?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThomcan had been a friend a long time ago, helping him learn to fly at the Kelford Aerodrome. Last he\u0027d heard Thomcan had joined the airforce. He looked well, healthy, though as Rodsy gazed at him Thomcan\u0027s expression seemed to falter, suddenly anxious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um.

Why was Thomcan thinking that? Oh god, they\u0027d done something to him! The mission, some radiation. Were they keeping the med reports from him? \u0022Oh Kod, or am I?

Things were not right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night he\u0027d finally got Thomcan to help him crack the KSC data block. The guy had been a little reticent, talking about \u0027this weird change in you Rodsy\u0027. Rodsy just wanted to know what was going on. He hadn\u0027t like what he found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC was hiding that Bop\u0027s magnetic field made people mad... and it seemed to match certain readings from Minmus, and recently even the Mun, albeit weaker that Bop\u0027s field by a long shot. They thought they could cope, protect against it, but they were planning for what they knew was the case now. Rodsy wondered about that. He\u0027d seen a paper by Seanbur that claimed the current oddities on Minmus weren\u0027t the case in the past, that the moon\u0027s magnetic field had changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly this morning Rodsy had begun relearning what little he knew about planteray magnetism and kerbolar winds, and he was coming to the conclusion that Seanbur may be right, but he didn\u0027t believe it was natural at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s no way, \u003Cem\u003Eno way\u003C/em\u003E this can be caused by the sun.

Spill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilton paused a few seconds, staring at his hands, before answering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think Rodsy may have gone off the deep end. We just caught him trying to claim that aliens were trying to kill our space program by messing with planetary magnetic fields.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022 Gene couldn\u0027t help it, it was just too bizarre. \u0022Y... you\u0027re serious?

We think we intercepted most of them, but... well, you never know. Nothing has shown up in the news yet, but we just can\u0027t afford this!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene sighed. Rodsy was a good kid, but the stress of the Jool mission had been a bit much. Now what could they do? If they publicly did anything to him it would just attract attention, not deflect it. No, they had to keep him busy, but Medical had insisted he wasn\u0027t ready for another off-world flight yet, especially anything to do with hibernation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Can we keep the lid on comms with the Science Rover?\u0022 Gene asked cautiously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... guess so.\u0022 Milton agreed, then seemed to ponder a few moments. \u0022It would have the advantage of keeping him busy, getting him thinking about something else. It\u0027s worth a shot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022See to it, and see if you can get Dunkel to get the mission prepped sooner. The sooner he leaves and is under a comms blanket the better.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s hardly fair to the guy, but I understand. There is no telling what the Council would do to our funding if this became public knowledge! I think at least two council members believe in the Killuminati at least.

Conspiracy theories about alien invasions was all they needed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... what?\u0022 Rodsy said, looking up at his friend who had so rudely burst into his dorm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You got in you dope! You\u0027re on the mission! Hah! We\u0027re going to be bunking together on a field science mission for the next few months!\u0022 Thomcan said, lightly punching his arm. \u0022Come on, lighten up. Looks like my contacts came through!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERodsy couldn\u0027t believe his luck! He was back in business again! True, this wasn\u0027t in space, but the meds said it\u0027d be a while before he recovered from \u0027hibernation sickness\u0027 as they were calling it now. Jeb and Jedwig were both off from missions for a little while too, though curiously Jeb seemed to have recovered better, despite his bad reaction to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I... that\u0027s great news!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, better get things done while you can, they\u0027re talking about getting it going soon, maybe in the next day or so, and the comms will be severely limited. You know, sensitive science stuff an all. Best tell your friends you\u0027ll be incommunicado for a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThomcan slapped him on the back and ran off grinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, incommunicado?

I got it.\u0022 Hengee said, hurriedly cutting off another long science speech.\u0022I just want to be sure things are working in high thrust mode again. OK?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, right. I\u0027ll get on it Hengee.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChecking his course Hengee saw they seemed to be on the line up to Farside Crater. It\u0027d be an almost straight burn in all the way down. Plans early on for this mission had originally intended the ship to stop north of Farside Crater on a Kethane deposit to refuel, but with the success of the VKM Two it was felt repositioning the Science Base was more trouble than calling the VKM in to refuel the ship. Even though at the moment VKM Two had actually been busy refueling the Munar Transporter as it had hopped around, thus right now it too needed to refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETiming sucked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, they were due to ditch their tanks, and there was no-one beneath them on the Munar surface, so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, releasing docking clamps on hydrogen tanks. And... tanks away.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/onhDYr8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022onhDYr8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qA5gxEi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qA5gxEi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a clang they were jettisoned and would eventually collide with the Munar surface fast enough that no debris would be left... so the theory went anyway. They\u0027d even made sure that their touchdown site (and the tank\u0027s touchdown site!) was well clear of the first Munar landing on the east side of Farside Crater. They were scheduled to touchdown more on the North by North West part of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bgio18Y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bgio18Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis maneuver itself was outside the normal. Usually ships came into Munar orbit first, then landed. They were going straight in, mainly as the target was on the retrograte side of the Mun, thus when their orbit intersected it they tended to be on the retrograde side. Some thought to a base being built there more permanently was considered, just for the advantage of being able to lift straight off vertically and give a vector back to Kerbin without orbiting the Mun first. Doubtful the Council would approve yet another Munbase though. Hard enough to get this mobile one approved! At least with this they could claim that they could re-use it on other planetary bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022MSB One, this is KSC.\u0022 Gene cut into Hengee\u0027s thoughts. \u0022I hope things are going smoothly?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm, sure Ge... er, Flight.

Bob has been appraised of your vector, though with the hole in the satellite coverage you won\u0027t have communication with him for another few hours.

I\u0027m engaging drive in.... three, two, one...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a jolt the engine lit once more and the ship shuddered under half a gravity of acceleration. Hengee heard a few muffled \u0027oofs\u0027 coming from pod one. Wait, hadn\u0027t he warned them a couple of minutes ago? Glancing down he saw he still had pod one on \u0027mute\u0027 from the last of Gregson\u0027s bouts of space sickness. Oops!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, you alright there Mac?

Hengee had done this plenty of times in the simulator, but he\u0027d only flown conventional rockets before so this was rather new. Well, it was new to everyone right now. Jeb and Jedwig had flown the LV-Ns before, but these new sectioned engines were a different beast all-together. Designed to be mounted in completely separate sections you could chop and change between reactor\u002Bgenerator and reactor\u002Bengine combinations, even different sized components. A lot of possibilities with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JUAIkp7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JUAIkp7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship had never been designed to just land and then hop around. They were coming in hot and once down wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to get off into orbit again. Even hopping over to that Kethane patch would be problematic, depending on how well Hengee did with the landing. After a couple of minutes they were down below seventy kilometers and things were looking good. He had been a little off on the timing of his burn start. Looks like they wouldn\u0027t be a perfectly efficient landing, but they had some spare fuel on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/khcAxkc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022khcAxkc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother couple of minutes and they\u0027d dropped below twenty kilometers and Hengee was starting to get worried. Fuel was getting alarmingly low in the tanks. He didn\u0027t want to alarm the crew so he did a few spot checks, calculating how much they\u0027d have on touchdown.

But I had to act fast. I vill attempt to be more zercumspect next time. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was getting out of hand! Gene just hoped they could get Rodsy safely isolated on the Rover mission before anything got out. They\u0027d have to make sure Rodsy was busy until then. If the Council, or worse still the media, got wind of this... the repercussions could be drastic! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this was just a temporary measure. He\u0027d have to pull Jedwig from that mission, despite the guy begging for something after his down time. Anyone on that mission would be \u0027compromised\u0027 as far as security went now. And Jedwig just had too high a public recognition to risk something like that.

You there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is Alpha One, yes.\u0022 Bob said tiredly \u0022We\u0027ve got satellite comms for... about thirty minutes by the look of it. What\u0027s up VKM Two?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I\u0027m ready, just letting you know I\u0027m heading over to Hengee... er, MSB One for refueling.\u0022 He paused, then added nervously \u0022Is that OK with you boss?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022*Sigh* Yes, of course it is. I\u0027ll inform them you\u0027re on your way. Be warned we\u0027ve had several Munquakes in the last few hours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Several? What\u0027s up? I thought we barely had them?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Normally, no. The last month or two there have been an increased number. In the last two days however we\u0027ve almost had one every two hours. Seanbur thinks there is some kind of magnetic instability in the Mun\u0027s core causing ripple effects.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf blinked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022S... should we be worried?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s just a cycle, and they are very weak quakes. You\u0027re just lucky you\u0027ve been in orbit so much of late, or you\u0027d have caught a few of them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf did manage a weak laugh, but didn\u0027t really find it very funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right, yeah. Look I\u0027m heading out Bob... uh, Alpha One. Thanks for the help.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good flight VKM Two.\u0022 Bob said tiredly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf shook his head, worrying despite what Bob said. Munquakes? He hadn\u0027t felt anything here. Maybe it happened before he touched down? Or myabe while he was asleep? Twiddling his fingers he worried about that too. He really shouldn\u0027t have taken a cat nap. OK, this was stuff he was used to, easy, but still...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShaking his head he put that kind of thinking out of his mind. Best focus on now. He had a flight to do!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith practised ease he checked the systems and engaged the engine, blasting clear of the ground with a spray of mundust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2jmw1rN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222jmw1rN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m on my way Hengee.\u0022 Lolorf said to no-one in particular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VKM Two sailed over the munar plains in a low arc, Lolorf only accelerating enough to hop over to the MSB One\u0027s location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/304aq9K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022304aq9K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf drifted, litterally and mentally, but managed to not actually fall asleep during his ballistic flight. A buzz on the panel from an alarm he\u0027d set long before warned him that a suicide burn was nearly ready. Tightening his straps he double checked everything, angled a bit to be sure his exhaust wouldn\u0027t blast straight at the base, then engaged his engines once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe munquake problem stuck in his mind as the ship vibrated during it\u0027s descent. Why would there be a cycle of munquakes? Magnetics? Really? Wasn\u0027t Seanbur that guy who made that scare a few years ago about dangerous magnetics around Minmus? Yeah, and he just happens to be here when more magnetic anomolies cause munquakes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what else could cause them? Lolorf was no scientist, but maybe he gould Koogle it when he got back to Alpha later?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re on course VKM Two, cool flying there bud!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf blinked, then realised it was Hengee calling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, thanks. Be there in a bit.\u0022 He said as he fine tuned the thrust a little. \u0022This rust bucket is hardly a fighter but it handles OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, we\u0027ll set a place for you at dinner. Oh, and Mac says if you need help connecting the pipes give him a bell.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUm, right. Like he needs help doing the job he\u0027s been doing these last couple of years?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll keep that in mind Hengee. Er, MSB One I mean.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, I don\u0027t hold with protocol. Call it like I see it man. Do the same eh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Or perhaps the two of you could stick to official protocol?\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice softly cut in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, sure we could do that.\u0022 Hengee said quickly \u0022Is there a pay raise in it for us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How about a lack of a pay cut?\u0022 Gene retaliated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELolorf winced.

Too involved. There were more like four color posters rather than logos, but they were pretty good. I almost posted them last week, but someone else said in someone elses post to keep such entries underwraps until the contest started. *sigh* It was one for the R\u0026amp;D division and one for FLOOYD Dynamics. I still have the pencil sketches so I suppose I could scan them in and send that, but they look pretty rough and ready compared to the computer drawn ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to money, I spent $400 on the new computer (More than I was planning really), an AMD dual core (don\u0027t really need more cores), 3.7GHz Richland which comes with a half way decent onmotherboard GPU. If it isn\u0027t up to scratch I have my old Radeon 5670 that I can put back in. I made sure it had enough power to run that if need be. Some decent 8GB memory (I forget the speed, but on the bottom level of \u0027high performance\u0027). I missed the HD as I said, added in bare basics on everything else. 2.0 USB as the motherboard standard only, basic DVD writer, though I did go for \u0027quiet\u0027 versions of all fans, power fans etc. I know the on-chip \u0027quiet\u0027 fans are pretty much the same decibels as normal fans, but if they don\u0027t need to run as much to cool it down, and also have the same db on the same speed, it\u0027s a winner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if my old 2TB hard drive is salvageable.
