I\u0027ve (hopefully) built something that can actually work and goes up in a single launch; to haul it up to orbit, however, I needed to drain some fuel to save weight, so sending up some refueling ships to LKO will be necessary. I\u0027ll get around to starting the mission in a couple days. Until then I have the following image of the Nitram in the VAB:\n\n![WS96cG0h.png](http://i.imgur.com/WS96cG0h.png)\n\nIt\u0027s got nothing on Whackjob, but it\u0027s the closest I\u0027ve come.\n\nMods used: Heat Management\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T22:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:36:05Z","Content":"Good luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nefrums","CreatedById":145422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T07:14:17Z","Content":"Good luck!\n\nAre there only one lander in there?\n\nWhat engines are you using for the transfer?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T12:08:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Good luck!\n\nThanks!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are there only one lander in there?\n\nThere are 5 landers; my plan\u0027s to leave the mothership in Jool orbit while the landers go off to land. Valentina only needs to get back into a non-impact trajectory, as there\u0027s an ion ferry with plenty of fuel to take her back to the mothership. (Come to think of it, I could have probably used the ion ferry as my Bop/Pol landers, saving a bit of weight. Ah well.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What engines are you using for the transfer?\n\nThe transfer\u0027s going to be done mostly with nukes (hopefully my use of Heat Control will keep things from blowing up), but the last stage of the launch vehicle, after refueling, can be repurposed as a transfer stage with more than 0.1 twr, which is a huge plus over the nukes."},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian","CreatedById":101923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:16:23Z","Content":"Historian acted up and I wasn\u0027t sure how to have good \u0022style\u0022 in toggling it.
