The Suggestion that would take years for me to figure out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCOSMIC\u00A0RADIATION , And More\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noh well , What do i even say , This game doesn\u0027t have any sort of Cosmic radiation , so i came up with this , Going to explain Breifly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Lets say for example i reached space in a Manned Vehicle and my spacecraft has a\u00A0MK1 Cockpit\u00A0which has weak radiation sheilding so basically the Mk1 Pilot is going to get exposed to radiation alot and if that goes on for a long time. Like for example 100 Kerbal days . The Pilot is going to die . Also Side Note: The Radiation mode only triggers in Normal , Hard , Extreme Difficulity\u0027s . so for any new people in the game they can just go on easy mode or on custom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- If i had a Mk3 for example it would keep its crew alive MORE than the Mk1 , For example MK1: 100 Days \u00A0MK3: 300 Days . And if the Cockpit is surrounded or covered by something it would stand more for example a normal MK1 would stand 100 days but a MK1 which is covered by a shield stands for 150 Days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- Space EVA\u0027s: If any Kerbal went for EVA his suit would protect him from radiation for atleast 30 days. Continuesly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- Planetary EVA\u0027s : If a Kerbal went for EVA on Kerbin his suit would protect him for a infinite amount of time since Kerbin is habitable , but if a Kerbal went for EVA on Duna his Suit would Protect him from radiation for 200 Days , Continuesly\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5- Recovering : If a Kerbal went into space for a long time and came back to kerbin , he would recover / Or if a kerbal went into a Hab Module He would recover too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002BAnother Idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSOLAR FLARES\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically ingame Solar flares would have the same effect as radiation. Except for :\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- it would distrupt communications\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- the closer a spacecraft is to the sun ,a solar flare.\u00A0the more vunerable is it to overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- Kerbals Doing EVA inside\u00A0Moho\u0027s orbit to the sun are facing a serious death sentence if any of the solar flares appear\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- 1 Major Solar flare would appear every year\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5- Every atmospheric Planetery body that has a magnetosphere\u00A0is Safe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand That\u0027s all folks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease make this true\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Taco Kerman\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear 201.6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-17T13:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2016 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Space_taco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSPFanatic102","CreatedById":153212,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T13:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw its 2 ideas not 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adelaar","CreatedById":150794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T15:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals are radiation proof, that\u0027s why they\u0027re green.
