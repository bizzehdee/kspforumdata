I\u0027m trying to decide whether to use the stock PLANETARY_RESOURCE way of doing things, or the ORS ATMOSPHERIC_RESOURCE_DEFINITION.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock method has the advantage of being stock, so everyone would have it. As far as I can tell, stock\u0027s MinAbundance/MaxAbundance and ORS\u0027 abundance values would have the same end result: I assume the dll does a calculation taking the % and the atmospheric pressure of the planet to provide a value. So a value of 20% for a gas in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere would be less than 20% for a gas in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, and the rate of recovery would be slower on Kerbin vs Eve. Yes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is not clear to me is how the parts would differ. It seems like using ORS and KSPI, the part could use the ISRUScoop module and be able to automatically recover all the gasses with ATMOSPHERIC_RESOURCE_DEFINITIONs for that planet. If I understand stock\u0027s ModuleResourceHarvester module, I\u0027d have to define a module for each Resource name that has a PLANETARY_RESOURCE. Is that correct? I need to define a PLANETARY_RESOURCE and a ModuleResourceHarvester module for each of those resources?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for Earth, I would need to define planetary_resources and moduleResourceHarvesters for for each of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENitrogen (78.084%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygen (20.95%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater (1%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArgon (0.9340%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarbonDioxide (0.039%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeon (0.001818%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelium (0.000524%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethane (0.0001745%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKrypton (0.000114%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen (0.000055%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the part with all those moduleResourceHarvesters, I would have to activate one at a time to collect them all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs what I said above correct? If so, I am inclined to use the KSPI way of doing things since it would result in fewer buttons for the player, and would be easier to configure at the part level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious what other people have to say, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
