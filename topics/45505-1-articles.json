Were you replacing the imagemaps? I think my problem may have been when I tried to reimport the images into unity. That function doesn\u0027t seem to work and since I wanted to use the same image name I deleted the old copy of it before importing it again as a new asset. I think this might have broken the material. I\u0027m new to unity and don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m doing yet so I may have had a bunch of unneeded components or been adding the images wrong. I used to just drag them into the viewport and it seemed to work till I wanted to change the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve started doing is to import the new texture as a new asset, select the material from the asset window, and then assign the new image in the inspector window. At this point it seems to be safe to delete the old image. The only thing in my hierarchy is the object. The only components in the object are transform and animate that are created for all objects, the mesh renderer, the mesh collider, and the KSP parttools. Not sure if I really need the mesh renderer since it seems to display fine in unity without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I started using just this stuff in Unity I haven\u0027t run into a problem when I edit the textures. Could be just luck if it\u0027s a Unity bug or perhaps I was doing something wrong before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
