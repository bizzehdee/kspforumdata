Sounds are now more Wide so they dont seem like they all are coming from behind. \\*thank you Unity Documentation\\*\n\nSo far the rattles, vibrations and rumble sounds are running good, very responsive as well. doesnt take as much ram anymore, I changed how they are played, instead of playing all at once with Zero Volume, they will only play when a Curtain Velocity is reached (i also did my own math instead of using the default one for Gravity, now it disregards the Constant Gravity).\n\nThrust are now very responsive, they will also ease out when the final expected Velocity is reached by grabbing the difference between the calculated a=f/m and the actual Acceleration (has bigger difference in bodies with atmospheres). they\u0027ll still make your ship rattle a bit even if you reached the final velocity.\n\nAdded angular velocity to the equation as well, so if your ships are spinning it\u0027ll make sounds ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n I still have to figure out how to play sounds during docking success\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T20:04:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ensou04**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T23:06:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thats not supposed to happen, what version are you using?
