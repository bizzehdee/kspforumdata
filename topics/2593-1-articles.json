I tried using the side mounted ullage rockets from the Radial booster pack and modifying the part.cfg file to turn the models around by changing the node_attach Up Y value, but they only turn the modules around up to 90 degrees. Is there another way of rotating the model so it points up? I know I can just change the thrust vector to go upwards, but with the nozzles pointing downward it would just look weird. Is changing the DAE file the only way? Is there a free program that would allow me to do that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if someone would be kind enough to do it for me, that would be awesome as well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (If I may make requests, I\\\u0027d love a rotated model of both the \u0027Side Mounted Ullage Rocket\u0027 from the Radial Booster Pack and the \u0027Vernier radial SAS unit\u0027 from the Wobbly Rockets add-on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if there is a way I can rotate them, please let me know!
