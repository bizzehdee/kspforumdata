For instance, all orbits would be equatorial for a few days of in game time until new contracts generated. For the first few versions I put this in big bold letters every patch: Manually wipe or expect goofiness. However, I still got false bug reports for goofy things, and it was cutting into my development time, tracking down these non-issues. Thus, any time new save data is encountered, I force a contract wipe. Configuration is coming soon, and I can make this a setting that you can disable, but I do not recommend it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt probably will be necessary for about half of the patches, if I had to estimate. There have been a few where it was not necessary. In this particular patch, I had to move the orbit generation up to the contract from the parameter, and pass the data down through the save file, because people requested the ability to see the data in the contract text, thus modifying the save data, and forcing a reset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFair enough, it\u0027s your mod, after all.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI weigh feedback a lot more than my own thoughts.

Sometimes feedback goes both ways. With \u0022geostationary\u0022 I was getting feedback both ways. In these instances, I have to \u0022average\u0022 the feedback, and I got much more feedback in favor of K-Syndrome in this instance.

Your briefing says \u0022A specific orbit\u0022 around Kerbin, which means this was a randomly generated one, but 0 eccentricity, 0 inclination, and 0 LAN? Buy me a lottery ticket if that was randomly generated. If not, something went wrong. Was this orbit typed into the save file manually? The ascending node and descending node are behaving as they should. They mean less on equatorial orbits, and behave oddly, but they are 180 degrees from each other, which is normal behavior. The stock AN and DN nodes show a range from -180 to 180 instead of 0 to 360, so that is what I did with my nodes. I have some questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Those are god-awful. Keosynchronous etc, I can (almost) stand that - I\u0027d prefer Kerbosynchronous (\u0022Geo-\u0022 refers to \u0022land, earth\u0022 etc and is Ancient Greek (from Gaia, the embodiment of Earth)). Unless you\u0027re suggesting Kerbals had a similar language and history to the Greeks, \u0022Keo-\u0022 makes no sense. \u0022Kerbo-\u0022 makes more sense because it at least sounds like it come from the word \u0022Kerbin\u0022, which is where \u0022Geo-\u0022 comes from - Gaia. \u003Cp\u003EI could go on and on about the \u0022K-Syndrome\u0022 and how much I really dislike it, but pls.. no keliostationary.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKolniya is fine, by the way.

In MC2 I have opted for \u0022hard core\u0022 mode which makes all your craft up to 6 times more expensive. This is great for balance against the stock game contracts which pay far far too much and hence would give me no economy management challenge to my career whatsoever. Fine Print by default currently has sensible contract funds payouts compared to the stock contracts but when used in combination with the hard core multiplier I cannot do many of your contracts without making a significant loss.
