Anyway, here is my old post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am about to purchase this game in a couple of days. I have a few questions if you don\u0027t mind helping me out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I have done some research on editing the textures and land masses on Kerbin but I\u0027m unsure of a couple of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I use a gray scale map that I exported from Simcity 4 and use it for Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can use the map from SC4 how hard is it to overlay the pictures of my cities from SC4 on Kerbin? I know it won\u0027t look all that great but I would prefer to see something other than green grass. Plus I have pretty much created my own universe and it would be cool to incorporate it into this awesome game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I saw a MOD on here the adds city lights to Kerbin so it looks like lit up cities on the night side. If I download that can I \u0022paint\u0022 where I want the lights to be or is does it just put lights somewhere random?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Let\u0027s say I create an airplane that I want to test or something. Do I have to take off from KSC or can I place the plane anywhere and fly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Can I rename plantets easily?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Can I remove planets easily? I want to remove the second moon around Kerbin. No real reason but it bothers me lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sorry if these questions are foolish but I am still learning. I know I have more questions but that\u0027s all I can think of right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T12:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.) I don\u0027t know how to edit Kerbin textures either, but you might talk to the creators of planet mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I think they will spawn randomly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Without mods, you must take off from KSC. You can use Kerbal Konstructs to add different launch sites or use HyperEdit to quickly position your plane anywhere you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) and 5.) Talk to the planet mod creators. Alternatively, you can dig for modifiable configurations. I think there are config files for the planets somewhere...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ussoldier2002","CreatedById":149741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T13:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.

This mod uses a .tga texture to paint the lights on the surface. I imagine you can edit this to put lights wherever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
