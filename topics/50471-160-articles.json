When I *just* install RSS without textures, it loads up just fine: The planets are re-sized and in their correct position. However, as soon as I unpack the textures into their appropriate places (I\u0027m using the full suite of 8192.zip textures), I start getting reliable CTDs on startup, right after everything loads but before the main menu comes up. Here are the output files:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EOutput_Log.txt: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://slexy.org/view/s20OnGEt6y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehttp://slexy.org/view/s20OnGEt6y\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EError.txt: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://slexy.org/view/s2HqeF76Xg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehttp://slexy.org/view/s2HqeF76Xg\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EI suspect the problem may be that \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe textures are too large\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E, but I did not think this would manifest itself on startup.

(As indeed your log shows). Basically, you will have to pick and choose what hirez textures you want.

At this point your options are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use very aggressive ATM (perhaps scale \u0026gt; 2) and only one or two planets at 8192, with the rest using 2048s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
