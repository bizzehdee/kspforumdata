Anyway, not entirely sure why this happens. I see plenty of half-decent challenges, and I\u0027ll admit I am a little jealous at times. I thought my last attempt at a challenge (killing ablators as quickly as possible) was actually fairly decent but I dont think anybody actually went for it. What exactly is is that appeals people to attempt a challenge and why is it that other challenges get ignored, except for the very obvious reasons such as being impossible to complete or a clone of something else, etc? Why do a lot of challenges get pushed to this second page of doom that I have heard of, including myself? (And no, not whining or salty or anything along those lines.

A lot of challenges look interesting at first, but as soon as I start thinking about how I might actually build an entry, I realize I\u0027ll run up against my part-count limit long before people with more powerful CPUs and almost immediately lose interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second (not entirely unrelated) is the phrase \u0022No mods allowed.\u0022 While there are exceptions--some challenges obviously only make sense with stock parts, or without MechJeb, or whatever--a lot of challenges just ban part mods when they could be much more inclusive by (for example) having separate stock and modded divisions. The reason this is related is, one of the main things I use part mods for is \u003Cem\u003Ereducing part-count\u003C/em\u003E. Attempting something like Jool-5 without part mods on my system is borderline impossible due to lag, and even worse if I\u0027m not allowed KJR. In general, as soon as I see \u0022no mods\u0022 in the list of rules I instantly hit the \u0022back\u0022 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA third, more minor issue is unnecessary rules. Example: why is the K-Prize limited to horizontal take-off SSTOs? Why exclude SSTO rockets (especially since a number of entrants to the real-life X-Prize were in fact rockets)? Another example: Why can\u0027t I use a rover-and-ferry arrangement in the Elcano challenge? It\u0027s a completely arbitrary limitation that adds nothing to the challenge and requires entrants to use cumbersome amphibians to circumnavigate Kerbin where a ferry would make much more sense. While this sort of thing usually doesn\u0027t cause me to instantly give up on a challenge, it can be discouraging enough that I eventually lose interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, the Elcano challenge is a good example of the right way to do it (neglecting my complaint about the ferry issue). It\u0027s a difficult-but-doable challenge that I probably wouldn\u0027t have tried if it weren\u0027t suggested, with a very inclusive set of rules. Jool-5, with a relatively inclusive list of allowed mods and separate ISRU division, is another good example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T00:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222428390\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132834\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456357581\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135669\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hotaru\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Hotaru said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: why is the K-Prize limited to horizontal take-off SSTOs?

Tailsitter SSTOs are completely different animal. They generally climb to orbit using normal gravity turn trajectory, relying almost entirely on their engine power. This is as opposed to orthodox airbreathing spaceplane SSTOs that fly depressed trajectory using lifting surfaces. As a rule, SSTOs are most useful (read: cheapest cost per ton to orbit) when they take off with as low of a TWR as possible, as evidenced by the leader board from the payload fraction challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo from a practical perspective HTHL spaceplace SSTO is where its at and Tailsitter SSTO is a compromised solution that\u0027s trying to have it both ways. HTHL spaceplane SSTO is harder to make, so it\u0027s no surprise that K-Prize focuses on this. Now the challenge could waste a lot of energy as I did above trying to explain the differences, but people\u0027s eyes will glaze over reading it so it\u0027s easier to just say \u0022HTHL only\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again, K-Prize maintains a separate \u0022gatecrasher\u0022 scoreboard for entries that complete the challenge by bending the rules like VTVL SSTOs.

Take for example a challenge I developed around Vall: it had it all, or so I thought.. Background story, diverse goals, clear and easy rules, and took some time to prepare. But, it got very little interest, perhaps because of the rules, maybe the destination wasn\u0027t interesting enough, maybe too linear with its goals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything Apollo usually gets some interest though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T10:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me that the topics of \u0022hot\u0022 challenges are mainly planes and SSTO, I guess there are two main reasons for that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Aero- and spaceplanes offer a lot of optimization potential. Small design changes can have a huge impact on the performance. This is a huge playground for those optimizers and tweakers out there, who love to scratch even the last m/s of deltav out of a given design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u0022Normal\u0022 space-related challenges need a very catchy special feature to make them popular. To stay on the \u0022first page of awesome\u0022 instead of the \u0022second page of doom\u0022 requires constant posting, which mainly has to come from the most active people in the forums. Let\u0027s face it - the games has been around for quite some time now, and the most active forum people are mostly also very active players. \u0022Normal\u0022 space related challenges without a very unique feature will often just earn you a \u0022been there, done that\u0022 response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious exception are challenges that have been around some time or return regularly, just because they feel \u0022natural\u0022 for everyone playing a while - Returning from Eve or doing Jool-V type missions are appealing to almost anyone who picks up the game and most people want to do it at least once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I do not enjoy optimizing planes as much. It just feels like work to me and not so much like recreation, which is what I look for in a game. I also do not have a lot of time to play anymore, so I will generally not consider the very time consuming challenges like Elcano. Regarding the original post: I thought the burn-down-the-ablator thing was a nice idea, but too much optimization necessary to do well.
