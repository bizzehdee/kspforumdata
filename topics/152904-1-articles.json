I\u0027m using the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro stick, which is still a great, cheap option to flight control that I find works really well with the game, both in Windows and Linux. If you search around the forum you\u0027ll find people successfully using different HOTAS setups as well, but I think the Unity engine starts to have trouble with more advanced joysticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T23:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have set up 2 sticks, one Saitek X52 Pro and one el cheapo 4 axis USB rc simulator controller but curiously enough I am so used to using the keyboard now that I rather keep doing that. Especially during the first few hundred meters on lift off, any cross coupling of axis inputs can lead to some... interesting results and with the keyboard, I\u0027m guarantied no such cross coupling. For space-/airplanes I will probably appreciate the stick a whole lot more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SavageAngel","CreatedById":170442,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-03T00:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys, just got my Joystick working, and lift off is kind of interesting.
