Imagine a line going from your ship, through the orbital body, to the other side of the orbital plane. This is the axial pivot. When you do your burn to correct orbit, this is where your orbit will pivot. First thing to aligning orbits is to wait until this axial pivot point bisects your target orbit plane as well. Once you have this position, it comes down to what direction you are heading in relation to target plane. Keeping yourself parallel to horizon, you want to keep your heading 90 degrees to your current trajectory. IE halfway between prograde and retrograde. Which way depends on the direction you need to bring the orbit. Need to bring the apo/peri you are heading towards northward, then angle the 90 degree to the northward bias side. opposite if you need to bring it south. It is very important to think this way because if you have an extreme angle, such as near polar, just burning north or south will not work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T15:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoDores\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoDores\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a simple way to locate normal and antinormal on the navball?
