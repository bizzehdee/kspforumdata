You can either attach it immediately after the heat shield or you can move it down a little and then attach it. When you do the latter, the decoupler adds a small collar to bridge the gap. Is there any advantage in using one method over the other? Or is it a relic from previous version?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T18:11:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T15:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just an aesthetic thing, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T16:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe closer node was added because everyone and their mother hates the way the fairing looks.
