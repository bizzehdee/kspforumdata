Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to recover that energy in form of electric charge?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this be possible by adapting some settings in the wheel config? Maybe make ModuleWheelBrakes\u00A0consume negative EC? How about ModuleWheelMotor, is there a setting that can achieve energy recuperation, or would that require a new module?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
