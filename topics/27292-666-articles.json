Val picked up the three sun-diving tourists waiting at the station as well as two of the newly hired scientists and decoupled from the station. At this point I need to read up on how to do a sun-dive (i.e. get into a suborbital trajectory around Kerbol) for less than 4000 m/s of delta-V...the ship has just shy of 7,000 delta-V but I have to be sure I can get everybody back before I mash go on the button.

Turns out had those fuel lines been connected, along with lines coming from the station tanks there might have been enough fuel to get the thing up to it\u0027s final parking orbit of 1 thousand km, definately enough fuel to have gotten it into a stable low orbit, provided I work out the stability issues the engines will develop from losing the empty tanks and there support lines. Anyways, here it is up in orbit ready for ships or more station modules to dock with it if this was my career save. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/APK7g7g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022APK7g7g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You can\u0027t really see it clearly, but two of the engine mounts along with 1 set each of tanks and engine attached are still on the station (that\u0027s the extra rockomax hub at the top and bottom)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll have to do one more test prior to setting this up in career as they\u0027re were a few flaws I noticed.
