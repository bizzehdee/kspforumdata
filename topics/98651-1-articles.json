I also got thinking about the ending to the movie \u0022Space Cowboys\u0022 where Clint Eastwood lands an un-landable shuttle using Tommy Lee Jones trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Challenge, you have to land a particularly difficult stock-parts spaceplane. I need some input from you guys....just send some of your more difficult-to-land designs for the rest of us to try and land (or perhaps some spaceplane that was damaged in flight and now needs to make an emergency landing (losing an engine/half a wing or both))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra kudos if you upload a persistent file with the flight conditions where you crashed it most often. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: No craft that are impossible to land....eg a rock or planes that lost all their wings..but then again, nothing too easy either (A craft laden with parachutes) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferably stock only but B9/FAR craft are also welcome. Target landing site at KSC or in a mountain region, whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone recommend additional rules to keep it interesting and avoid compatibility issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinners (per craft) will be judged by maxing out the price of recovery or in cases of full recovery, who landed it faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPOST YOUR DESIGNS!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-03T12:40:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2015 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ron1n1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ron1n1","CreatedById":102346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T12:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh okay....I joked about landing a rock and then I saw this guy 5thhorseman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXzMDkKhO5g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Polar Explorer","CreatedById":119156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T18:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I might upload something.\n"}]}
