I find it difficult to use while still being able to get Kerbals out, because anything placed either side of it seems to block exit, even far down on its sides. Be it fuel tanks, wings, ext. All of them placed lower than where the kerbal normally pops out. It would be nice if it was a little more forgiving. I\u0027ve even had trouble where I build a design, test that a kerbal can exit, but when loading the same craft at a later time, exit is suddenly disabled with all parts in the same placement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
