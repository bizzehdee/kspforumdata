Also, this transition event could be used by plugins for various other events. Another stock game example would be animating enter/exit actions for standard aviation cockpits with raising/lowering canopy and animated Kerbal that enters/exits the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: Even if animating a Kerbal would be too much work (or too complex / prone to bugs) delayed transitions would still provide enhanced gameplay for airlock type hatches where Kerbal enters an intermediate chamber which then closes, hiding him/her so it can just disappear inside without animation. Player won\u0027t notice this and gameplay won\u0027t be broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtension of the above : Animations for kerbals in first person view (via plugins, stock is not a must) and transition enter/exit animations in portraits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-10T19:35:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2016 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fatcargo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
