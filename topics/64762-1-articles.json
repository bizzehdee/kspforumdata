I\u0027m pretty sure though, that it gets better with every update. One thin I\u0027m missing since today is the ability to use small ship parts in large ships. I built a vessel, with quite spacious cabins for a crew of six, but after finishing ship, those cabins seemed so empty, almost like prison cells. I would have loved to build some furniture using the small parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flyin_ruski","CreatedById":60421,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T21:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelp i bought it.

If we in the future succeeds to invent artificial gravity without tricks like using centrifugal force, will that gravity generator/gravity plating emits gravity at all directions or only at one point like a spotlight?

I really like space games. So i usually atleast try games of the genre and especially indie games.
