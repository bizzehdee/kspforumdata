No pictures, unsurprisingly, but it was basically Explorer I. Just a stick with a thermometer and some antennae. A little while later I launched Valiant 2 and 3 to higher orbits, this time with a BAROMETER!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext began the Polaris program, basically Mercury, with Polaris 1, 2, and 3. Jeb, Bill and Stedzon Kerman. made short suborbital hops on top of Minerva ballistic missiles and became the first kerbals in space.

Just small relatively unseen stuff, like outboard fuel tanks surrounding the turbopump, lightening the retropack, y\u0027know. And apparently, I tried my hand at messing with the staging. This had predictable results on Polaris 4, and resulted in Bob getting the 15G ride of his life on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E tower after a very short mission before landing a few hundred yards from the beach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d imagine he wasn\u0027t too happy with this. Sorry Bob. Back to the drawing board.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter fixing the staging, Polaris 5 went up with Agary. The non-staging-related improvements juiced the Hermes booster enough to get an apoapsis of over 300 kilometers. She tested out an early SCANsat scanner before coming back again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this stage, however, I was getting a little bored, and there wasn\u0027t much else I could do with Polaris. So, I decided that Polaris 6 with Bob again (yay compensation) would be the last mission in the program. Bob lifted off from the Tundra Missile Range on a Hermes. Once he was in orbit, he burned the upgraded Hermes core stage again to increase the apoapsis to higher than ever before. He got some high-above-Kerbin science before coming back down again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so ended the Polaris program.
