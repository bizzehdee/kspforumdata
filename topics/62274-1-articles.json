And the camera is shaking at the same speed, I can\u0027t control the camera at all, and it shakes upwards slowly, and in a sudden moment of panic I hyper edited away like 20 m/s of speed so the ship was suborbital, thinking I could send the kraken to its grave, the kraken nomes the ship all the way into the side of the craters eastern rim, and about forty five or so trusses shot off into a suborbital trajectory, and crashed on the other side of the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, can this be another form of the kraken? Or was my ship just extreme kraken bait?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably tasty, tasty Kraken snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real question is, would it work as a base destroyer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it happens only when your orbiting really low, and my best guess is that it has something to do with rendering all the surface rocks quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that structural parts like trusses have physics glitches that amplify over time. To see this effect to its extreme, build a craft that is comprised of a central mass of some sort with 8 long girders sticking out, a single FL-T200 tank at the end of each girder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy ship was mostly a long stick of large trusses with two on each side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
