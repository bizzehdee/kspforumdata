I bought it a week ago and have spent almost every free minute with it since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor years now I\\\u0027ve been complaining about all new games just follow the same few genres, and how sick I am of just shooting an endless succession of monsters, and the way the games never get any smarter or more challenging and yet I have to keep upgrading my graphics hardware just to play the same tired old games under a new name. And I gave up buying new games (I wait to get them on sale as cheapies) because nobody bothers to debug the things properly anymore, and I\\\u0027m tired of paying $50 for the privilege of serving as a game company\\\u0027s unpaid beta tester. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Universe Sandbox (which I also like a lot) directed me here, and I find somebody IS making original game concepts. Somebody IS making a game fun and constructive and not just mindlessly violent (though this newbie does still kill Kerbalnauts at about the same rate most games kill monsters). Those somebodies have also made the game look absolutely gorgeous despite the fact that the whole thing is not much bigger than some game\\\u0027s save files. And in an era when the big companies think that a game crashing every few hours is still good enough to sell to people for $50, I\\\u0027ve encountered fewer bugs in your $15 alpha version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I really love about KSP is that you haven\\\u0027t dumbed it down to appeal to a wide market, but it\\\u0027s still cute as hell. The planet is pretty and I look forward to the day when my little astronauts don\\\u0027t look terrified all the time, but it took me 4 hours to get my first ship to orbit, and then 3 more hours to do it again. Getting my first ship to orbit gave me more satisfaction than most entire other games I\\\u0027ve played, and it\\\u0027s still fun to get there. And I was awed by the intricacy of the game mechanics when I made one of my rockets fly faster and higher by REMOVING a couple of engines. I love little touches, like the way the surfaces of the moons don\\\u0027t reveal their details until you get a ship there to actually look around. That touch was entirely unnecessary, but adds so much to the fun of playing the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might just be the greatest piece of entertainment software I\\\u0027ve ever played with in 21 years of computer gaming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have some newbie issues, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E How much of a factor is air resistence, and do things like nose caps actually improve flight performance? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Why do engines near the centerline burn fuel more quickly than engines on the same stage that are situated farther out? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What causes a ship to flex along its length from a ) shape to a ( shape and back again, and what\\\u0027s the best way to prevent it? I\\\u0027ve seen that it\\\u0027s more of a problem with longer ships, but once it happens, neither SAS, fins, nor gimballed engines do much to reduce it, and I seem to just have to change the layout of the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is there a way to delete my old ship designs? I\\\u0027ve tried clearing out the ships folder, but not all of them are listed there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBugs? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\\\u0027ve found that a spaceplane safely touched down, throttled down, with engine turned off will never slow down to less than about 21 meters/sec. Might this have something to do with the fact that I\\\u0027ve never actually managed to land on the runway? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When right-button rotating the view in the VAB, the screen can hang for a split second if I scroll past the right screen edge, and twice on the map view screen, the same mouse/button action has twice caused the game to lockup so that I had to task manager out, though it ran fine again when I restarted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would like a comment field on my ship design screen so I can write memos to myself on the virtues and vices of my designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Before components begin to cost money and crews die permanently, the game needs a dummy payload so that I can test new designs without sending a flight crew to their deaths. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for a wonderful gaming experience! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I just discovered that I can\\\u0027t find my screenshots taken since I upgraded to 15.1/2.
