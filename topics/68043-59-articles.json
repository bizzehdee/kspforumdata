There is also a .dds loader in the stock game so the textures can be in that format for faster loading times (I\u0027ve already covered all the US stuff to .ddc. Unity 5 has been released but there\u0027s some work to be done before KSP can be ported over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest update the Universal Storage has been the use of module manager to detect what mods you have installed and configuring / creating US parts to match. That means you only have a single pack with the part selection entirely dependent on what mods you have installed. The great thing about that is that we can support ton more life support mods without having hundreds of packs.
