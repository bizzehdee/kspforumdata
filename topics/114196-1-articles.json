I completely redid everything to work with the new 1.0.x RSS, and added some new things, with a lot of the old objects coming later. I also gave it a real name (SSE).\n\nEssentially, this mod adds new real life moons, dwarf planets (coming soon), and asteroids (coming soon) to KSP through Real Solar System.\n\nI decided to make a thread for this release because some users were having installation issues with the last version and helping through Reddit or Youtube is more difficult than a thread that anyone can contribute to.\n\nLICENSE: CC-BY-NC-SA\n\nUses RSS by NathanKell\n\nThe Pack currently includes:\n\n**Moons of Pluto:**\n\nCharon\n\nStyx\n\n\\* Note - I am aware that Hydra, Nix, and Kerberos are missing. I felt that Styx served as an example of a small moon and I am waiting for the New Horizons flyby to add in the rest of them.\n\n**All Outer Moons of Neptune**\n\nNereid\n\nHalimede\n\nLaomedeia\n\nSao\n\nPsamanthe\n\nNeso\n\n**Inner Moons of Neptune**\n\nProteus\n\nExpect many more bodies to be added in coming releases. Note that this pack will use more memory than standard RSS and will take longer to launch due to Color maps being .png instead of .dds.\n\n**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (ALSO PRINTED IN README!)**\n\n1. Install Real Solar System.\n\n2. Copy the Gamedata folder from SSE and paste it over your KSP Gamedata folder. Merge when prompted. Replace config with the SSE config when prompted.\n\n3. Launch KSP. If you have memory issues, try OpenGL mode or Linux 64-bit.\n\nDOWNLOAD LINK (inoperative until a license is shown)\n\n(KerbalStuff is currently broken for me and I can\u0027t upload files. Therefore I can\u0027t upload it there until I figure out how to fix that.)\n\n**Credits:**\n\n**NathanKell for Real Solar System**\n\n**Space Engine for object textures**\n\n[Album of Everything New in Version 1.0](http://imgur.com/a/S0UZ5)\n\nSome Examples of what you might see using SSE:\n\nProteus, 2nd Largest moon of Neptune\n\n![QwYitAK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QwYitAK.jpg)\n\nSTYX, Pluto\u0027s smallest moon, with CHARON, Pluto\u0027s largest moon, in the background\n\n![Eyfzm3A.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Eyfzm3A.jpg)\n\nVideo Tour of the new moons in 1.0 and information on the mod:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8SvdqVCJJo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**STUFF FOR FUTURE VERSIONS:**\n\nCeres, Vesta, Pallas, Lutetia\n\nJupiter and Neptune Trojan Asteroids\n\nALL of Neptune\u0027s moons (Currently, all outer moons are in)\n\nKuiper Belt Objects, Scattered Disc Objects\n\nAll of Pluto\u0027s moons (After New Horizons Flyby)\n\nSedna\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T16:37:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by srbgaming**\n  \nAdded license"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:18:25Z","Content":"Great job.
