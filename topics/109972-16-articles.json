Once it is in the editor on a craft i am making i can open the CLS control panel, or use tweakables etc to set the passability up and then save the craft file.  once the craft is loaded into a live game, if a part does not have atleast 1 passability tag set true then remove the module from the part at that time.  thus preventing any overhead the game engine may have, yet negating the need to constantly track down parts every time I find one in the editor that will not allow passage.\n\njust thinking aloud here as i have no idea what it would take to do all this..  i just know i am frustrated trying to get all my parts to play nice with CLS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-24T12:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2017 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Bit Fiddler**"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T12:41:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so what sould happen with:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     @PART[*,!module[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]]:[NEEDS[ConnectedLivingSpace]:FINAL\n\u003E     {MODULE{\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace}\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E this would add the module to every part, thus enabling the clickies, but leaving all parts defaulted to **passable = false**?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E would this be a bad idea?  does this add overhead to the game to process all these modules for parts that do not really need it?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also what is up with this?  the habitation ring has CLS on it from a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch I made, yet it does not show up on the CLS control panel thing.  did I do the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch incorrectly?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     @PART[SXTRotatingMk2Ring]:Needs[ConnectedLivingSpace]\n\u003E     {\n\u003E         MODULE{\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\tpassable = true}\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![KSP_x64%202017-05-24%2011-37-05-78.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75023494/FRAPS/KSP_x64%202017-05-24%2011-37-05-78.jpg)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75023494/FRAPS/KSP_x64%202017-05-24%2011-37-05-78.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nOn the first: I\u0027d probably add a line saying \u0027passable = false\u0027, just to be sure the module is fully initialized.

To me if you\u0027re just going to make everything passable, why bother installing it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T13:32:19Z","Content":"Well the pico port was not my post.... \n\nbut the way i look at it is this... there is no reason why a 2.5m probe core is not passable.   there is nothing in the 2.5m variety that is not in the .625m variety other than a bigger gyro, and more battery storage.  however the gyro can be a hollow ring, all you need is mass on the rim of the wheel.   and in fact any mass you have in the center of the wheel is detrimental to the performace of a gyro.  so the gyro really takes up next to no room in a probe core, just the very outer edge of the diameter.  that leaves the battery storage and that just does not need 2.5m diameter by .5 meter or so in height.    so yes a 2.5 meter probe core should be passable."},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T13:41:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well the pico port was not my post.... \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E but the way i look at it is this... there is no reason why a 2.5m probe core is not passable.   there is nothing in the 2.5m variety that is not in the .625m variety other than a bigger gyro, and more battery storage.  however the gyro can be a hollow ring, all you need is mass on the rim of the wheel.   and in fact any mass you have in the center of the wheel is detrimental to the performace of a gyro.  so the gyro really takes up next to no room in a probe core, just the very outer edge of the diameter.  that leaves the battery storage and that just does not need 2.5m diameter by .5 meter or so in height.    so yes a 2.5 meter probe core should be passable.\n\u003E \n\nAnd I have at least one mod that includes a passable one.  (Or optionally passable at least: NFC.)  But if it wasn\u0027t designed that way, why should it be?  Sure it \\*could\\* be designed that way - but a lot of things are easier to make if they aren\u0027t designed for that, and there\u0027s no reason why the designers had to build it that way.  (And: It would be \\*safer\\* to not design a crew tube through a spinning gyro...)\n\nFor this type of situation I use a radial probe core - it\u0027s an extra bit of computer, which makes sense to me.\n\nBut anyway, as I said: Different philosophies.  I tend to be fairly conservative about which parts should be passable - and depending on how I\u0027m feeling about it I may even write in full restrictions.  (The \u0027BuffaloCLSHack.cfg\u0027 is an exception: It\u0027s easy to accidentally build a Buffalo rover that\u0027s attached through the frame instead of through the main body, so I made the frame passable just so I don\u0027t have to worry about which attach nodes are being used.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-27T01:14:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/22/2017 at 11:18 PM, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am sure I read somewhere that I can change a setting for CLS that will give me tweakables for every part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to let me decide at construction time what is passable and what Is not.

Was this not supposed to be on \u0022every\u0022 part?  or does it still need some sort of a module on it before this works?\n\u003E \n\nSorry for the late response, but there is such a switch.  open the CLS window and select options.  there you will find a switch.  check \u0022Enable Optional Passable Parts\u0022.\n\nThis setting requires a game restart, as Module Manager needs to reload the parts at startup for it to take effect.\n\nThen, you can go into the Editor, and many more parts will have a CLS description in the right click information window in the Part picker.  Once you select a part to add to your vessel, you can use the tweakable for that part to adjust the passability characteristics.  Note, that it does not make every part passable, (makes no sense for engines for example, I think)\n\nHope that helps.\n\nIn other news, now that Module Manager has been updated, I\u0027m working on the next release of CLS.  It is already working in 1.3, so I\u0027m looking at localization.

For the search - I haven\u0027t done much in Win 10 myself (or Windows in general), but a program like this: [https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack) will help with the search.  (Again, I haven\u0027t used that one specifically, but the general concept is to find a search program that allows recursively searching entire folders, and that was the first I found for Windows.)
