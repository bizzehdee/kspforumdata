The problem is KSP can\u0027t really simulate a plane on a bumpy runway. It\u0027s a little too difficult because the slightest bump makes the plane go everywhere, it\u0027s a little too extreme. What is worse is it is early level which is when beginners theoretically would be learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is simple. Flatten the runway, or at least severely reduce the bumps, but as an incentive to upgrade, add less traction to the wheels on that runway and scale it more traction with each surfacing upgrade. What this would mean is the plane would need more distance to get up to speed because the plane can\u0027t grip the surfacing as well. Loose dirt is slippery, if you were to add a grass runway for the upcoming tier 1, that would be even more slippery. For small planes this would be fine because they have plenty of time, larger planes might have trouble getting up to speed before getting to the end of the runway. (Of course really large planes wouldn\u0027t be able to launch at all due to the other restriction). Furthermore, landing would become more challenging because you wouldn\u0027t be able to stop as quickly, but it wouldn\u0027t be near impossibility like the current dirt runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than the bumps which don\u0027t play nice with the KSP/Keyboard flying, you should consider this for the different levels of runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T15:08:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T15:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea.

Making the \u0022unclipped\u0022 grass have less traction would also be a deterrent for landing on the flat area around the KSC and simply taxiing to the runway. Probably the easiest way to do that would be to apply a traction value to each biome. If I\u0027m not mistaken, the actual traction work has to be handled in the wheel code, so just make them slip a little more based on what biome they are landed at and if the biome is a runway detect it\u0027s tier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could work for rovers too!
