The two theory\u0027s to explain this is one Dark matter, a unknown something that only seems to interact by gravity and does not absorb or release electromagnetic waves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be some yet unknown particle or simply a bunch of hydrogen gas that we are having trouble detecting. The second theory is that our current theory of gravity does not accurately predict the effects of gravity on the galactic scale. Dark energy, something mostly unrelated to dark matter aside from the name. Is used to describe why the expansion of the universe is accelerating, something the big bang theory fails to predict. I don\u0027t see how either of these things can be explained by colliding with an entirely different universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure I got something wrong there, but I am confident k^2 will come by.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
