It sort of looks like the letter T (It is one of two nacelles to be attached to a starship). For the life of me, I could not get the game to recognize it as a vertical craft so I had to make my starting piece horizontal so that it would allow me to attach it vertically to the rocket delivery system that I have pre-made. I know that once I go to launch I can change the point of control to wherever I want, but in the VAB I am having trouble maintaining symmetry and it is very frustrating \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cry.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cry.gif\u003C/a\u003E .
