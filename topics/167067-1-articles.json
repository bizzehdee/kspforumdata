I have FASA and FASA Launchclampscontinued installed. The issue I have is that on the TT-06 launch tower, the base of the tower is halfway up the lower part of the tower. It looks like it could hit the rocket possibly. Its not on the ground like it should be. Does anyone else see that happening? I used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E to do the install. It looks correct in Nathan Kell\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E tutorials.

If you mean moving it up and down like normal adjusting rocket height from surface, ya, I done that. I suppose that maybe by just installing tweakscale it somehow caused an issue. Im not sure I even need tweakscale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYa, I wondered if the 2 Fasa\u0027s might somehow cause a problem. I guess the only way to know is to remove them tweakscale and launch clamps continued one at a time and see if it helps. I seen where it was mentioned that tweakscale might be causing problems in a different thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try that as soon as the Nascar America vid shoot is over.

Its the TT06 launch tower. Guess I wont be using that one on tall rockets. But it worked for Nathan in his video. I hate when I cant figure out what is causing problems.
