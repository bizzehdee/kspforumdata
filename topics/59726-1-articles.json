Of course, KSP isn\u0027t exactly meant to be emulating technology from the \u002760s, but even the Orion MPCV uses RCS for orientation rather than flywheels, as far as I know. I don\u0027t actually know if any crew modules use flywheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add them in, they only need to be small holes. The Mk1-2 pod even has various holes in it already, for whatever purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may be frowned upon though because it would mean the pod by itself would only be able to maneuver using a limited amount of built-in monopropellant, so more casual players might find it annoying. Translation or extended thrust time would be provided by external parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, I think the reaction wheels should be removed from some command pods and instead include RCS thrusters and monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*Why isn\u0027t it just called the Mk2 Command Pod?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxilica","CreatedById":57871,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T07:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m not wrong, the pods do have Monopropellant (as of .23), saving the need to put R.C.S. pods on the ship.
