Crashes usually occur when I load a quicksave, change from vab to launch, revert back to vab (same for SPH) and when I recover vessels or return to the space center. My ksp is running on a 2013 iMac with 8 gb of RAM, and uses 2.1 gb ram on average. I have tried active texture management, and have firespitter, hooliganlabs, toolbar, mechjeb, and a couple other utility mods. It doesn\u0027t seem to be a RAM issue, but I don\u0027t know what else it could be. Any help would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T12:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might try looking at the KSP.LOG logfile, immediately after a crash.
