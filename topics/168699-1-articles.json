Once finished I decided to test it out, I\u0027d rather build a replica instead of simply downloading the craft file. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E slowly rose from the pavement of the airstrip and gained more and more velocity. It worked. I directed it\u0027s path towards to sea to test it\u0027s underwater qualities. It\u0027s noteworthy to mention that I had Portal 2\u0027s soundtrack playing in the background (specifically,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwntb4zcEmw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis song\u003C/a\u003E). Once I was relatively far from the shore I decided to stop my speed and slowly enter the water, yet, despite my best efforts, I was coming in too hot. This was going to be the end of Valentina Kerman (until I pressed the Revert Flight button) so I decided to let it crash. It, obviously, did so but here is where the strange events happen. Once the outer vehicle was destroyed, what only remained was an EAS-1 ECS and sitting on it, Valentina Kerman. She hadn\u0027t died in the crash and was inexplicably sinking. Rather than sinking, though, she was falling. Underwater. She gained more and more speed and I supposed that she would in fact crash into the sea bed so I ejected her from her seat at the last second. She survived the fall and rose from the sea bed, walking as she normally would on the surface, except she was doing it slowly, as if the water actually was slowing her down instead of ignoring her presence. It was night and I had the lights turned on, it instantly reminded me of\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safxuz_jrbs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESOMA\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/https://imgur.com/a/FO8z2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlbum FO8z2 will appear when post is submitted\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nWhat are your opinions of this?
