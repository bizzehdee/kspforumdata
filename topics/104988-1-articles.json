Also, the map view usually has the trajectory to apoapsis as a blue orbit line and when you hover over it, it tells you \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 as well as the altitude. Now the orbit line is white and when I hover over the apoapsis marker it doesn\u0027t show the time. Can\u0027t add maneuvers either. Also all the markers are missing from the left of my navball. Anyone know what is happening? thanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T03:16:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a bug, and so it has been moved to the support subsection.
