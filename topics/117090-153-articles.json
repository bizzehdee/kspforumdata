I see others mentioning that they have 140-150 part stations with no lag at all.  I on the other hand run an extremely large mod load (currently around 160-170) and many of them are graphics mods like Scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E amongst several others.  Because of that, my stations begin to slow down noticeably as I start to approach the 100 part limit.  It\u0027s **\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enowhere\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E** near as bad as it used to be and my slow downs typically entail a frame rate drop from my average around 60ish to down around 25-30ish.  As Nightside mentioned above this is largely a function of whether there\u0027s a planet in my view or not.  If there is, FPS tends to run around 25 for me on a system with 24Gb RAM on an I7 5820 3.2GHz with dual NVidia 770s.  If I remove the graphics mods from my setup that frame jumps drastically up to around 45-50 with a 100 part count station.  I suffer the frame rate drop willingly though because I want my game to look as nice as I can while playing even if I have to occasionally suffer that drop.\n\nSo, this is not really an easy question to answer regarding where the performance line should be drawn.  Those of us on large loads that include things to make it look pretty are going to suffer that drop.  So to me, the ideas of things like welded docking ports is very, very attractive.  Including other parts like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, adapters, antennas, solar panels etc. would only make that experience better.  The important thing to me though is that you find a way to do it that is comfortable for you and how you envision your mod.  I knowingly suffer the issues I do and can clear them up any time I want."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-16T12:26:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Indeed; I will likely be using them in my station investigations over the weekend.

This has almost two years of hab time, and the greenhouse processing provides just about enough supplies for a free return round trip (about a Kerbal year), but more could be added here. Those solar panels should be sufficient for power to Eve or Duna. Obviously the solar panels would be needed as the fuel cells won\u0027t last the duration.  \n\nThis specific design has some minor issues - getting this out of the petal interstage is going to involve rather more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ballet than usual (attachment is on the wrong end), and the above is pretty much limited to a free-return (ish) style flyby, since the third stage would be used to send this away from Kerbin. The ship has more hab time than supplies (2 years to 1 year) right now, but that could be changed easily. There are also no recyclers in the above, and they could be added trivially.\n\nStill, I think this is a fairly practical and minimal way of building a hab module, and is a practical example of some of the limitations that I\u0027ve been running up against, and ones that I\u0027d like to think that a dedicated part could help solve. It fits into something approaching the form factor at least.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T04:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Domfluff**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T15:40:51Z","Content":"Did quite a bit of station building over the weekend; testing out different mods\u0027, trying out different station part concepts, and generally taking stock of what is currently available as far as station construction.  While there are some very nice parts\u0027 packs available for it (Tantares, CxAerospace were tested), they all result in fairly high part count for anything beyond basic stations.\n\nCreating FGB/DOS/TKS styled station modules was quite possible, but they generally came in around 15-20 parts per module, which quickly starts to add up as more modules are added to a station.  The docking hubs are notable sources of high part-count as well, at 6-13 parts each.  These could both be made into single-part affairs, and hubs even potentially combined with the DOS modules, resulting in extremely low part count stations for when using these (think MIR in ~6 parts).\n\nUSOS styled cylindrical parts were a bit lighter on part count at only 3-per module (module\u002B2 docking ports); but that is of course for a barebones module with no accessories.  Could easily combine the docking ports and a few accessories into a single modular part for these, and could potentially include a \u0027hub\u0027/\u0027node\u0027 style for these modules as well.  Not the best target for part-count reduction; but even just integrating the docking ports and some optional adapters would be useful.\n\nThe rest of the initial Station Core parts\u0027 concepts all seem to still be sound ideas so far.  Welding docking ports - definitely useful.  Multi-docking hubs, check (also integrated into the modular parts, see above; though these would be more \u0027truss\u0027 styled).  Inflatables, yep have uses for those as well.  So no real changes in concepts for those parts so far, but I haven\u0027t really tried setting up any stations to use them yet.\n\nAs far as performance is concerned, I had no problems with a ~120 part station, but didn\u0027t get to test it out past there; going to add a few more modules to it and see where the performance limitations are at for my hardware setup... but even at 120, that is at least 50% more than I could handle in 0.90 / 1.0.x.\n\nGot the \u0027Modular Station Core\u0027 module mostly written up over the weekend; mostly just needs a bit of code to handle updating of attach nodes, crew capacity, and IVAs.  The attach node bit is just a matter of getting it written up; mostly just need some proper test model definitions to get the node location/orientation data from.  Will likely start working up some testing configs that use Tantares/Cx models to test out the modular part concept.\n\nDynamic crew capacity doesn\u0027t appear to work while in-game; whatever crew capacity is specified in the prefab part appears to propagate across to the in-editor and in-flight parts.  I -thought- that this was supposedly supported as mentioned in some of the recent patch notes, but cannot figure out how to get it working so far.  Will likely take a look at how RoverDude is doing it for his inflatables as I believe he was the one responsible for that bit of code in stock, and likely knows how it is all supposed to work out.\n\nHave not yet tried/looked into the dynamic IVA swapping; that is waiting until I can figure out the crew-capacity issues (does not good to swap IVAs if I can\u0027t change crew sizes).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 hours ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What do you mean?
