Obviously I would prefer to avoid burning too much fuel for a Duna capture, but I\u0027ve not yet tried such a manoeuvre since the demise of the old atmosphere.\n\nIf I don\u0027t have a heat shield, how deep in the atmosphere can I put my Pe on arrival from Kerbin without breaking my ship? Will this give enough braking to capture, or will I also have to burn the engines to at least get a high elliptical orbit? If I can\u0027t do that without burning up, what is the deepest into the atmosphere I can go without damage? I\u0027ve used aerobraking in 1.0.2 to transfer from Minus to LKO at about 40 km, but obviously that\u0027s starting in a non-escape orbit, so going round for another pass or so is not the same sort of disaster it would be if I was relying on a single pass to capture from solar orbit. Any other advice?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T21:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rcp27**"},{"CreatedByName":"HyperbolicKerbonaut","CreatedById":141355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:11:33Z","Content":"Excuse me if I misunderstand, but you want to know about aerocapture at Duna? I aerocaptured at around 17,000m and there was no overheating, no heat shield required. You may or may not need to burn a little bit, but it\u0027s negligible. I had to try a few different altitudes and it seemed, based on only a few tries, that there is a pretty small margin of error between aerocapture and full reentry.\n\nMy reentry effect is set to 110%.\n\nHow or why would you aerocapture to get from Kerbin to Minimus?"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:14:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How or why would you aerocapture to get from Kerbin to Minimus?\n\nYou don\u0027t, but you can from Minimus to Kerbin, which is what the OP said."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:26:02Z","Content":"I want to know what is a good altitude to set for the Duna Pe as I arrive so that I can get a captured (i.e. not escape) trajectory in Duna, so that I don\u0027t need to burn fuel to arrive (and whether burning up is a problem).\n\nRegarding Minmus, not aerocapture as such, but using aerobraking to bring your Ap down from Minmus orbital height down to LKO. This saves a huge amount of fuel if you want to use a re-suable tug to shift things like space station or surface bases on Mun or Minmus, by using a non-landing tug.\n\nThe point about coming in from Minmus is if you set your Pe too high to get much braking, you are already in a captured orbit, so you can get the braking delta-V from multiple passes. If you are coming through on a hyperbolic orbit, as you will if arriving from interplanetary space, if your Pe is too high, you may just end up in a lower energy hyperbolic orbit rather than capturing into a returning elliptical orbit.\n\nMy objective for Duna is to get a first pass through Duna\u0027s atmosphere that will capture me from a hyperbolic orbit to a high-Ap elliptical orbit. I can then raise my Pe to a higher but still atmospheric altitude and circularise on Duna with several passes. The question I have, therefore, is what altitude should I aim to have my Duna Pe when arriving from Kerbin so that I get enough braking to capture my orbit but not deep enough to either bring my Ap down into the atmosphere on the first pass, or burn up due to heating.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T18:32:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rcp27**"},{"CreatedByName":"1greywind","CreatedById":82369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:44:24Z","Content":"~12 km PA works for me.\n\nEdit: Remember, that aerobraking effectiveness highly depends on craft shape.

You can easily pick a higher than normal (like 5-15km higher) periapsis with aerobrakes because they can increase your drag by 5 to a 100 times depending on how large the surface is that they cover versus the surface area of the craft that is facing into the airstream.

As it was still quite early in career and with few related contracts, I had to keep the designs very minimal. Without thinking, I went with the cheaper solar panels. That became a big issue with my aerobraking maneuvers when the probes finally got to their destinations. \n\nOn that note, I managed a decent aerobraking maneuver through Duna at about 21km without burning off my panels. It didn\u0027t quite capture the probes in Duna orbit, but it still saved me a lot of fuel. With new aerodynamics and heating, aerobraking is much more difficult now. There isn\u0027t a one size fits all number now and if you want to make effective use of aerobraking, you\u0027ll have to account for it in the craft design (ie, use retractable solar panels, stow radial components in a utility bay... perhaps even add brakes or wings)"},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:22:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I tried the usual 13 km aerocapture into polar orbit on Duna last night and everyone died horribly.

I\u0027ve seen well enough around Kerbin how radically the atmosphere has changed, hence I realise that the rules of thumb I used to use for Duna aerocapture are likely to be useless in 1.0.2.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t have to do all your aerocapturing and aerobraking in one pass either, it\u0027s fine to go into a highly elliptical orbit after the first dip.\n\nI completely agree 100% with this. The only objective I have for my first pass is just to go from hyperbolic (non-return) to elliptical (captured) orbit. Bringing the Ap down and getting a nice circular orbit at a low enough altitude is something that can be done with a much higher Pe for less aerodynamic stress on multiple passes once I\u0027m captured, it\u0027s just the initial capture I\u0027m worried about because it\u0027s a one-shot afair.\n\nI guess I\u0027ll go for a 20 km Pe first try and keep a quicksave ready from far enough away to allow for easy adjustment for when it goes horribly wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"SDEngineer","CreatedById":101148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:21:08Z","Content":"rcp27 - yes, the aerocapture to lithocapture window is very small these days, and varies a lot based on each individual craft.

My second Duna satellite, larger, less aerodynamic, and carrying a lander (bound for Ike) aerocaptured between 20.5 and 23km.
