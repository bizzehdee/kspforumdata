The quantity of each you gain appears proportional to the speed you were going at when you started, so by chaining these moves together so far I\u0027ve gained 40m/s and about 200m. Of course I begin bleeding off the speed if I break the combo, but it\u0027s a neat thing all the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think might be going on is that the wings may be doing something weird: they bend alarmingly when you do these climbs. Also there is sufficient power for the ion drives, so it\u0027s not that I\u0027m getting extra exposure on solar panels or anything. So discuss, and help me explain why my mad invention breaks KSP\u0027s physics!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T23:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe speed gain your experiencing when you pull up is the infini-glide glitch, it\u0027s common in light weight planes and gliders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T23:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have discovered the infiniglide \u0022bug\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut enough control surfaces on something, and it can just flap them for extra speed.
