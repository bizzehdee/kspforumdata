Specifically, probe and perhaps manned vehicle design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis goal is complicated by the fact that I\u2019m in South Africa, which is not exactly known for its space based exploits (of which there are only telescopes and dsn antennas) and also by the fact that the only university aerospace engineering course in the country is in Cape Town and is titled: Astrophysics and Space science. It may be worth it for me to look into that, maybe. I\u2019m thinking of studying mechanical or electromechanical engineering. I\u2019m also going to start learning welding from a cousin of mine who welds beer creating pressure vessels, if I can\u2019t design payloads, maybe I can build rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m in high school and going to be in grade 9 this year. I\u2019ve been getting good marks in pretty much everything. We chose specific subjects in grade 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-02T16:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechanical and electrical engineering are both good ways to go. In my university in the USA, there\u0027s a lot of overlap between mechanical and aerospace subjects. Rockets and spacecraft need a bit of every type of engineering, so if you have a degree and a bit of knowledge about how rockets and spacecraft work (through joining a rocket team, or reading about rocket design) you will probably be well equipped to get into the industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-02T16:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad up on math, get a head start on calculus if available, that\u0027s where I stumbled and crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when you get to post-secondary life, partying is overrated.
