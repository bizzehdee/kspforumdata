However, it turns out there was a much bigger problem causing the in flight break up. The first thing I noticed was that the anomalous events would take place at a definitive moment during the vehicle climb out. Somewhere around 15k. The anomalies being, a strange snap/click/buckling sound coming from the vehicle, after which the entire vehicle would pitch steeply and the break up would occur. I noticed that when this strange snap or clicking sound would take place, there was a marked deceleration and the engines seemed to get quieter. I started to wonder if for some reason the main Orbiter engines were the issue. Perhaps the engines were running out of fuel. However, while watching the fuel gauges on left by the stage display, the main engines still showed fuel to be burned. I checked the fuel window that shows all the fuels on board and their status\u0027s and saw again that there was still fuel left to burn. Then I noticed the Oxidizer. 0/2750. I ran the launch again and watched the Oxidizer drain to 0 and all of the anomalous events once again took place. There was fuel enough left to burn alright but, it couldn\u0027t burn anymore. No Oxidizer. Which I learned after looking up rocket engines and SRB\u0027s and learning what I could about fuel/propellant mixtures and how Oxidizer is required. I thought Oxidizer was only needed in space where there\u0027s no atmosphere or oxygen to be had. Apparently it\u0027s needed on the ground as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all of these findings I concluded that, the Oxidizer was running out, the main Orbiter engines could no longer produce thrust, symmetry was gone, the SRB\u0027s thrust took over, overwhelming the SAS stability control and the sudden pitch of the vehicle caused the in-flight break up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext task? Figure out the solution to the loss of Oxidizer. If there is any other solution other than merely carrying more Oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone after reading this sees that my logic or understanding of how these things work is flawed, please let me know what I\u0027m missing.

The need for the creation of checklists, contingency procedures etc... One thing that has stuck out in my mind is how at least in KSP we can slap on SAS and test some things out without having a Kerbal on board, risking his little digital life. Astronauts like John Glenn, Ed White and Alan Shepard weren\u0027t that lucky. And in Ed White\u0027s case, unfortunately we didn\u0027t have automation to test things out even during ground testing.

I probably just used the term incorrectly. What I meant was, when I lost the Orbiter\u0027s main engine due to the lack of oxidizer, I lost thrust on that side of the vehicle when before that happened, I had the thrust from the two SRB\u0027s plus the Orbiter engine. So, it was a bit more equal. Once the Orbiter\u0027s engines seized up, the whole vehicle pitched over. I\u0027m assuming from the sudden loss of thrust from one side.
