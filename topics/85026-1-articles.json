Never tried mods before? Want to know where to begin? Then start here. I offer this project for community input on the various mods, and their composition within the mod pack. The aim of this mod pack is to get you started trying out different mods on your own. I just provide you with a few basic ones I believe in. I encourage you to maintain regular updates of individual mods as necessary and simply treat this pack as a starting point on your journey, and not a regularly maintained release subscription.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETheme:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy KSP Essentials Mod Pack is a non-invasive collection of widely accepted KSP mods that I deem are a must-have.

I am open to discussion on what kind of mods you think are \u0022essential\u0022 and if there is enough participation in this project to help decide such, then the pack will be renamed and my name removed.

This means if it breaks a save game that you\u0027ve spent years building, and you have become financially dependent on it because you produce a long-running Youtube series where you have million dollar sponsors fronting your effort, you are out of luck and most likely could be made fun of at worst or be made a statistic at best, if you didn\u0027t make a back up.

I have probably had my KSP crash once or twice when testing new mods in the process, so always keep your valuable save games backed up from time to time. I recommend this really cool service called backblaze for backing up your computer to the cloud for like only 5 bucks a month for unlimited storage. Try it sometime.

We are providing a service that mod developers can\u0027t (unless they design and test their own mod with all other mods in existence, which is a greater improbability with each new mod released on the market, and in reality not all mod makers test their compatibility with all mods today).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust saying something is offensive without providing detail goes nowhere and only trolls a thread.

Yet isn\u0027t this \u0022issue\u0022 already present in reality with individual gamers who have downloaded mods into their games that already have other old mods installed and are having issues? The universal answer is to download and install the latest mod versions. Except with a mod packer in the market there is now a larger testing footprint for mod compatibility. It is then the responsibility of the mod packer to either test continued compatibility or remove the offending mod from the pack. Its a win win scenario for everyone involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning licensing, I dont see how one could regulate it. Is a mod creator going to sue me simply because I offer a non commercial dowload of his own non commercial mod perhaps a version or more behind his - essentially sharing my GameData folder with others so that we can simply play a multiplayer game together?
