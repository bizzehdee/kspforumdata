This paradigm has governed its development, and that of the software designed to run on it, since the earliest of times. Windows is a system that needs to be able to come pre-installed and just work over an entire computer\u0027s lifetime, no matter what OSes, software or hardware come before or after it, and no matter what terrible tech-illiterate you put in front of it. It\u0027s a ridiculous, impossible expectation, but they try anyway.

And that when Windows XP runs out of support and encounters bugs and malware, people will blame Microsoft instead of themselves, despite years upon years of warnings and multiple support timeframe extension beyond anything Microsoft has ever offered before? Nobody cares about updating or new developments. They just want a one-time fire-and-forget solution. That is the kind of platform Windows is.

A system that expects its users to be able to, if necessary, rebuild the entire system from scratch by hand, starting with the kernel source. It does not have to care about backwards compatibility, because if a piece of software is not running, someone in the community will hack one together, and then the rest of the community will take it and improve it to the point you could never tell it used to be a hackjob born out of necessity. Linux is able to run native 64 bit because its users know what that is and care about having it; and because in many cases, they can upgrade to it for free. Of course, this kind of model means that Linux will always be a niche phenomenon, because the mass market demands a level of compatibility, backwards reliability and ease of access that it just isn\u0027t built for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you have OSX, which is a Unix system stuffed into a consumer bag, trying to straddle both worlds with varying degrees of success while suffering from a level of closed system disease that makes even Windows users laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlatform differences aren\u0027t just in the codebase.
