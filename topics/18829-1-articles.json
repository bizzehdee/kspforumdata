One of the plugin authors here can probably help you get started on that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaxtemp would indeed work, except parts only get heated by engine exhaust currently (they could get heat from environments, but no such heat source exists currently, and of course re-entry heat is still planned down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T06:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETiberion, thank you very much for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had seen breakingForce and breakingTorque in other part files and suspected they where used only to change a hidden default value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll play with the values and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnimation is a long term goal.
