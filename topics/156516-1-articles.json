all.\u00A0 I\u0027ve poked around a bit and I\u0027m having a hard time figuring out something, and I\u0027m quite sure someone\u0027s pulled this off before.\u00A0 It\u0027s particularly about Duna, but it\u0027s a more generic question for roughly all the planets for a career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn career mode, I\u0027ve got a Duna First World\u0027s Contract pop up.\u00A0 They show up eventually, of course, but as usual these usually include a \u0027and return to Kerbin\u0027 clause, so you can\u0027t pick up any more until you\u0027ve swung past X planet, then came home.\u00A0 Now, my plan is to stuff as much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E into a probe as I can get off my level 2 Launchpad and fling it at Duna out of phase for as quick a possible flyby.\u00A0 The idea being when I\u0027m ready to send a serious mission (IE: Land on Duna) I\u0027ll be IN phase (or closer) and the mothership I end up sending for that won\u0027t require over-engineering due to phase positions.\u00A0 That\u0027s not the hard part, it just takes extreme \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and really odd departure angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, where I\u0027m running into trouble is getting \u003Cem\u003Eback \u003C/em\u003Ein a timely manner.\u00A0 My best guesstimate forces me to establish an orbit (which I\u0027m trying NOT to do so I can keep that world\u0027s first banked for a contract later) and then reverse fire myself at Kerbin, again at extreme \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost and odd angles.\u00A0 As far as I can tell, no gravity assists or anything of that nature will significantly help, \u003Cs\u003Eas I\u0027m on the right Solar Periapsis for Kerbin\u003C/s\u003E, I\u0027m just WAY off phase.\u00A0 EDIT: This was misleading.\u00A0 My periapsis may be on Kerbin\u0027s plane, but I\u0027ll be traveling out to Eloo before I come back, which defeats the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really hoping one of you will tell me \u0027Oh, that\u0027s easy, just do this!\u0027, and I\u0027ll have to

possible (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget permitting), it\u0027s no easy feat. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

before you have executed the transfer burn to Duna. Which is why I said \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget permitting\u0022. There\u0027s a chance that you\u0027ll find yourself without enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left for an expedited return after you make your Duna transfer burn, because the cost of return depends 90% on the initial transfer. Therefore, you need to make a best guess at how much to throw at the initial transfer to accelerate it, and how much to keep in hopes of being able to also accelerate the return. There exists no tool for KSP which can precalculate this for you - I recommend a named quicksave for trial and error purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to the how-to, then:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Go to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tool is available as an ingame mod, but you\u0027ll be using the website, because you\u0027re going to need its advanced features later, which the ingame tool doesn\u0027t have. For starters, use it to plan a high energy transfer to Duna suitable for your desired departure date and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget. Make sure your probe is in a circular, equatorial Kerbin orbit, and set the Initial Orbit altitude accordingly. Check the \u0022no insertion burn\u0022 box since you\u0027re planning a flyby, set Earliest Departure to your current ingame date, select \u0022Optimal\u0022 from the transfer type dropdown menu, click on Show Advanced Settings, and enter a Latest Departure to your taste. Setting this latest departure date close by allows you to constrain the result space and keeps the planner from suggesting the next ideal window instead of a suitable near-term solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Let it calculate a solution. In the colorful plot at the bottom, travel time is on the vertical axis, and departure date is on the horizontal one. Mouse over the plot; you\u0027ll see a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost next to your mouse cursor that represents the particular date/traveltime combination you\u0027re hovering over. Find a solution that\u0027s suitable for your needs. If you want, you can adjust your latest departure time and the travel time window in the planner settings and recalculate, to make the plot more focused on specific areas. When you have found your solution, click on it, then press \u0022Refine Transfer\u0022 at the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Now, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150986-transfer-window-planner-precise-nodeprecise-maneuver-editor/#comment-2827151\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emake a maneuver node using the information given\u003C/a\u003E and execute it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Your probe is now on a flyby trajectory past Duna, putting it into a solar orbit afterwards. It is this solar orbit from which you must return to Kerbin. Therefore, you need to configure Transfer Window Planner to recognise this orbit. This is where it gets complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress \u0022Add Body\u0022. Switch body type to Vessel, give it a name. Note down what the solar apopasis and periapsis altitudes will be \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E your Duna flyby. Select the Sun in map mode, pull up its info window, and look for the radius. Add the Sun\u0027s radius to both apoapsis and periapsis, and use only the modified numbers for all further colaculations. Calculate your semimajor axis by adding together your apses and dividing by 2. Also calculate your eccentricity = 2 / ((apoapsis height / periapsis height) \u002B1). Put these numbers into the planner. Mouse over the periapsis, note how much time it takes to arrive there, and add that time to the current ingame date. Try to be precise despite the numbers constantly changing. Enter the date you calculated under \u0022Time of Periapsis Passage\u0022 in the format \u0022year/day hh:mm:ss\u0022 - for example \u00221/235 04:53:18\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInclination is a problem. You can easily determine your current inclination after your departure burn by targeting the Mun, which is perfectly equatorial; but, your Duna flyby will change your inclination. Especially if it\u0027s a close flyby, and \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E especially if Ike is getting in the way (which you know it will). I think you\u0027ll have no other choice than to check your current inclination against the Mun, then eyeball how your post-flyby solar orbit differs from your transfer orbit. I know it\u0027s easier said than done, but try to be precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leaves two fields: the longitude of ascending node, and the argument of periapsis. Duna has an inclination relative to Kerbin, so your orbit does too, so they must be specified. Unfortunately, there is no way for you to find them for your final solar orbit. The best you can do is to use a mod of your choice (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, MechJeb, etc) to display them for your current transfer orbit. They \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E be wrong for the final orbit, especially for close Duna/Ike encounters, but there\u0027s no way around that which I know of. And ideally the error is small enough to not influence your final return trajectory cost by more than a few hundred m/s. It\u0027s because of these two errors that I told you to be as precise as possible with the other values... you want to avoid cumulative errors growing out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Save your custom vessel orbit, and select it as origin. Set destination to Kerbin, and check No Insertion Burn (you don\u0027t have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare). Look at your probe\u0027s trajectory, find the time to encounter Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, add that to your current ingame date, and set that as Earliest Departure. Set Latest Departure a hundred days later. Transfer Type optimal, and calculate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow is the big moment: the planner will have preselected the cheapest possible route in this time window. Is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost within your probe\u0027s remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget? If yes, you can attempt to find the shortest possible transfer your budget allows for, tightening the Latest Departure and Travel Time settings for more precision. If not... well, you can attempt to relax the settings to see if you can return \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E. But most likely, you\u0027ll have to reload and do the whole thing all over again with less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E spent on the initial transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) If you have a result: try to make a node at the appropriate time. Do you get a Kerbin encounter? I\u0027m willing to bet you don\u0027t, because your origin orbit wasn\u0027t set up correctly. The question is, what (and how much) do you have to change to get your encounter? This is left as an exercise to you; I cannot give advice here. You must rely on your skills in maneuver node editing. Once you have your encounter, check again: can you still afford it? Remember, just an encounter alone isn\u0027t good enough, it must also intersect Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere (or leave enough fuel for a later course correction to that effect). If not, try moving the node to earlier or later in the orbit, and see if that makes it cheaper. When all else fails, reload and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-16T11:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I figure it goes like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Hohmann xfer from Kerbin to Duna is an ellipse with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E at Kerbin\u0027s orbit, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E at Duna\u0027s orbit.

Doing such a thing would make the return transfer essentially unplannable, since you have an unpredictable direction change at Duna. But technically, aerobraking at Duna would help. No need for a plane, just aerobraking with a heatshield. It\u0027ll drop solar apoapsis somewhat, which makes the return burn cheaper. However, you then have to wait until after you\u0027ve exited Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E until you can use Transfer Window Planner to plot a course, which loses you all Oberth help. I can\u0027t say if aerobraking would save you more than the Oberth effect.
