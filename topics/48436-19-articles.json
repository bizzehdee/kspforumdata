It became clear that realistic manned mission are impossible to be reproduced in the game the way it is. Maneuver nodes are very limited and any gravity assists slightly more complex (more than two bodies, ore multi-moon gravity assists inside jupiter, for example) are nearly impossible to be planned. Partly because there isn\u0027t currently a tool that lets you plan launch windows with correct planet alignments, and part simply because of the rounding errors of timewarps. Nasa only needs correction burns in the order of couple of dozens m/s. after I timewarped in some parts of my trip to titan, the trajectory was so much different that I needed over 1k d/v of burn corrections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking in Saturn is also impossible since the realistic atmosphere cuts out abruptly, visiting any atmosphere-less moon is a no-no with conventional levels of d/v and chemical rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless i managed to land on Titan (after a final 2k d/v correction witch i needed to activate infinite fuel cheat to do so, nevertheless i managed to be assisted by jupiter\u0027s gravity and a intermediate MHN stage for corrections carrying 3k of d/v could be feasible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is some pics about my mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;iframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ssgqv/embed\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: How do i add those slides from IMGUR anyway?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all stuff related to the Real Solar System Thread, but now I want to discuss an alternate solution to theses serious limitations of the game witch comes in the scope of my previous discussion about the lack of practicality on the NTR here in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore efficient near-future rocket engines: As a more enthusiastic player of kerbal, i was always interested on rockets and interplanetary travel, even before the game, so i obviously read a little about some different types of proposed engine types. After my frustrated mission to Titan revealed so many difficulties on the game mechanics that severely limited the range of Manned missions to Saturn and Jupiter with direct insertion, it became obvious if I still wanted to play RSS \u002B MFS i would have to explore some different experimental and more efficient engine types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I took a look at Starwaster extra mixtures and fuel types, because I also researched by myself different types of NTRs and fuel mixtures to come around the problem of limited storage of low density LH2 for more d/v interplanetary stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed Starwaster didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t add one of the most promissing solutions for more pratical NTR: LANTR; LOX Augmented Afterburner NTRs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy adding a mixture ration of 4:1 of LOX at the exhaust of the H2 from a conventional solid core NTR, the exhaust speed is further increased thus increasing thrust by almost 4 times at the expense of slightly lessened ISP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an interesting solution for more efficient stage-cycled NTR\u0027s design, like the used by russia on the RD0140 witch has naturally a higher ISP but lower thrust, 35KN, 2,5tons, 960isp. The thrust would exceed 120kn with this, extra fuel could be carried and the d/v would only be decreased to about 800ish witch is already what we have with the current setting of MFS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is using liquid and solid mixtures with the standard NTR like Starwaster added. I haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t tested yet, but LOX and Water are much more denser and still delivers higher ISP than high efficiency conventional LH2/LOX chemical rockets. I would have to test witch one is the best option\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also further researched about other engine options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most obviously with we already are tired to know is the VASIMIR. But vasimir is very weak to be effectively used in a larger manned rocket and has problems of being very energy hungry and emitting too much heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is actually a better type of electrical engine witch is actually even more advanced in development being already tested once in the ISS almost 10 years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMPD; MagnetoPlasmaDynamic Thruster. It needs less energy than VASIMIR and gives much more thrust even weighting less: A 200N MPD has already being tested and proved ready for operation and only needs 600kw of energy witch is fairly reasonable for current RTG of large solar panel technologies. It works at over 3000isp and can operate with either argon or xenon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the more interesting option I think is again, back into the NTR reign: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is still haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t being build, but is a fairly mature concept and the favourite studied by NASA out of several subtypes of Nuclear propulsion: The Closed Quartz Gas Cycle, aka \u0022The Lighbulb\u0022. Closed nuclear cores insulated with quartz wall. Differently from Solid core, the radioactive fuel does not enter contact with the LH2. This insulation is due to the core operating at much higher temperatures witch gives higher exhausts speeds than regular SOLID core design and thus, higher ISP. It could operate at efficiency from 1900~3000s however, the problem is that due to the insulation of the cores, it is much heavier, with a TWR barely higher than 1:1. With this weight problem allied with the issue of low density of the LH2, I wonder if they could also be further accelerated with LOX afterbuner like the solid design, or even have different fuel mixtures at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, i\u0027m going to add some fuel mixtures from Starwaster, mine for the LANTR, and I\u0027ll also grab the vasimir from the \u0022near-future\u0022 mod pack (tough i won\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t install all those parts, since my game is already overflowing with too much parts) and the two nice Nuclear engines from Kommit witch I will respec as Gas cycle and MPD\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some testing I\u0027ll report back witch option is the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone has any idea of any other near-futures high efficiency alternative engines that we could use? There is also the ORION, but i\u0027m rather skeptical about that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting site with a huge compilation of different proposed efficient engines most of must already know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Uzj936F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Uzj936F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T13:28:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sephirotic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T13:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESephirotic: KSP interstellar has NTRs with realistic thermal power/mass ratios ~ 900 Isp and up to ~600kN with the largest reactors.

THe game loads but when i go to the action groups, there are no options for customizing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy config is like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//Squad_NTR_modularEngines.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[nuclearEngine]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    @mass = 2.25\u003Cbr\u003E    @maxTemp = 2200\u003Cbr\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleEngines]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E\t@maxThrust = 60\u003Cbr\u003E\t@heatProduction = 300\u003Cbr\u003E\t@PROPELLANT[LiquidFuel]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t@name = LiquidH2\u003Cbr\u003E        \t@ratio = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t@PROPELLANT[Oxidizer]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t@name = nuclearFuel\u003Cbr\u003E        \t@ratio = 0.00000000001\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t@atmosphereCurve\u003Cbr\u003E \t{\u003Cbr\u003E         @key,0 = 0 1000\u003Cbr\u003E  \t @key,1 = 1 430\u003Cbr\u003E \t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E//extra: these are the Lines and the module i added:\u003Cbr\u003E MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E  name = ModuleEngineConfigs\u003Cbr\u003E  origMass = 2.4\u003Cbr\u003E  techLevel = 3\u003Cbr\u003E  origTechLevel = 3\u003Cbr\u003E  engineType = L\u002B\u003Cbr\u003E  configuration = LiquidFuel\u002BLiquidOxygen\u003Cbr\u003E  modded = false \u003Cbr\u003E  CONFIG\u003Cbr\u003E  {\u003Cbr\u003E   name = LiquidH2\u002BLiquidOxygen\u003Cbr\u003E   maxThrust = 225\u003Cbr\u003E   heatProduction = 1000\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E   PROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E   {\u003Cbr\u003E    name = LiquidH2\u003Cbr\u003E    ratio = 0.73\u003Cbr\u003E    DrawGauge = True\u003Cbr\u003E   }\u003Cbr\u003E   PROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E   {\u003Cbr\u003E    name = LiquidOxygen\u003Cbr\u003E    ratio = 0.27\u003Cbr\u003E   }\u003Cbr\u003E   IspSL = 0.45\u003Cbr\u003E   IspV = 0.65\u003Cbr\u003E   }\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E//Extra addition end \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleAlternator\t\u003Cbr\u003E(... etc)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut had no luck, I can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t seen to add different fuel types to it.

When you have approximately the right size tank, go into the tank editor, and remove and re-add your MFS fuel tanks; that will correct the ratios. The way it works internally is this:\u003Cp\u003EMFS normally rounds fuel quantities (to 4 sig figures, or to the nearest integer if \u0026gt; 1000). When you start rescaling a ST, rounding is turned off, but the rounded ratio (not the correct ratio) is the starting point. When you move your cursor off the tank, quantities are rounded again. That means you get rounding errors twice, but it\u0027s the price you pay for nice numbers in MFS. I\u0027m considering turning rounding off entirely, however, since AFAIK most people who use MFS use ST, and does it really matter if your amount of fuel isn\u0027t a nice round number?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can, when you start with a procedurally filled tank and then want to edit it further.
