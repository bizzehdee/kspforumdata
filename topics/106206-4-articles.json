But I like PID tuner better because of its simpler UI. BTW, your SAS tuning fix plugin gave me the inspiration for wanting RSAS values added to PID tuner, so thank you!!\n\n@regex: here is a [patch](https://gist.github.com/pacbard/8009f1bb62e75a2dd48b) that adds the relative SAS information to the UI and uses the new RSAS module to load and save the current PID values. What is the best way to send it your way? I was not able to find your mods on GitHub for a pull request, so I just used the source code bundled in the download.\n\nI was able to compile and use the plugin without major issues, and only one minor issue: the RSAS module seems not to have a clang value. I set it to 1 and then I divide the ki, kp, kd terms before saving. I also had to use floats in the PIDInput class. Somewhere in the code there was a typecasting error and all RSAS values had rounding errors.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T00:45:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pacbard**\n  \nFixed bug!!

It is located in the desert steppe of Kazakhstan, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Aral Sea, north of the Syr Darya river, near Tyuratam railway station, at 90 meters above sea level. It is leased by the Kazakh government to Russia (until 2050) and is managed jointly by the Russian Federal Space Agency and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. The shape of the area leased is an ellipse, measuring 90 kilometres (56 mi) east-west by 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-south, with the cosmodrome at the centre. It was originally built by the Soviet Union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for its space program. Under the current Russian space program, Baikonur remains a busy spaceport, with numerous commercial, military and scientific missions being launched annually.
