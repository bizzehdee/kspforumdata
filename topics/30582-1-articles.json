After he\u0027s done that, any remaining fuel should be spent trying to remove any inclination change in regards to Kerbin(Set Kerbin as a target, as then set up maneuver nodes at the Ascending or Descending nodes. Use the pink triangles on the maneuver node to change inclination.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so once That\u0027s done, Bob\u0027s done all he can do; it\u0027s time for the folks back home to pick up the slack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship below can do this mission with about 1000 m/s dV left over, plus another 350 dV of RCS fuel. I don\u0027t know how experienced you are at rendezvous, so I packed a ton of RCS.(Make sure to put your RCS thrusters with four way symmetry around your Center of Gravity, if they are properly placed it will make translation easier.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I assume that Bob\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship is basically a one man command pod(make this your first part, that way the second, three man command pod will spawn empty so we have room for Bob), on top of a three man command pod, on top of two 1440l fuel tanks and a Skipper engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use four more skippers paired with 2 fuel tanks and three solid boosters each to put it into orbit(not the ideal solution, but it works fine and is fast to orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you want to use your own design, the design objective is to get a pod with an empty seat and parachutes so that Bob can EVA over, get on a Kerbin intercept, and splashdown to safety. You can do this with probe cores, as part of a lander mission, etc\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut 4 radial parachutes on the three man pod, separate it from both the fuel tanks below it AND the capsule above it with decouplers(add struts for stability). What we\u0027re going to do, is fly to the moon, rendezvous with Bob and have him EVA over. Once he\u0027s in the three man pod, we will EVA over our other Kerbal(the one who piloted the ship) to the three man pod as well. Then we will plot a trajectory from the moon back to Kerbin, such that we will be captured by Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and return to \u0022Earth\u0022. Just before entering the atmosphere, we will decouple the three man pod from the rest of the vehicle, and the radial parachutes will take care of our decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you know how to get to the moon, since you\u0027ve done it already. The only thing different about this time, is that once you arrive you\u0027re going to set up your orbit to match Bob\u0027s orbit for a rendezvous. Plop a maneuver node and change the inclination(pink triangles) and pro or retrograde(green circles) until you are aligned with Bob\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoom!

Both require a rendezvous with the stranded ship which can be difficult to set up, particularly with an inclined orbit. I also prefer the EVA method partly as it means that 1; you get all of the Kerbals in one ship thus eliminating the wobble while under throttle from having two docked vessels and the potential for a docking port failing when re-entering the Kerbin atmosphere (if you keep both ships attached) and 2; it also looks really cool if you\u0027re recording it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, a third option... an unmanned fuel truck. Send it up, dock it then transfer the fuel across and have the Kerbal come back under his own steam.
