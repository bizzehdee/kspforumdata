I am also experiencing this now, I have a probe on a polar elliptical orbit around Jool (230,000M x 1,300,000,000M) and when I get near the perigee my craft starts accelerating and my apogee rises.

Maybe the internal forces caused by tidal stress are not correctly balanced out (floating point error?) and the result is that the game gives the ship a net acceleration.\n\nTidal force isn\u0027t simulated to the best of my knowledge. Wouldn\u0027t need that anyhow - if there\u0027s any sort of internal imbalance, acceleration would occur. Keep in mind that all parts are ALWAYS simulated as interacting physical bodies unless you\u0027re on rails (non-phys-warp, or not in the physics bubble/etc). They\u0027re always there, pushing on each other. IF any of the forces aren\u0027t perfectly and exactly cancelling out, you\u0027ve got a net force and therefore accel.\n\nI had a station back in 0.23 or thereabouts where it would accelerate in a given direction (and also turn rather violently); it had a net accel of 0.2m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. That\u0027s pretty crazy.\n\n(the Krakensbane system can help reduce this, but you gotta be going more than 750 m/s for it to kick in :/ )\n\nOne thing that trips up even experienced programmers is that floating point operations are non-associative. They LOOK like real numbers, but are in fact not."}]}
