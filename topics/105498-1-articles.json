I am also experiencing this now, I have a probe on a polar elliptical orbit around Jool (230,000M x 1,300,000,000M) and when I get near the perigee my craft starts accelerating and my apogee rises. Something is causing acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EALIENS, it\u0027s the only explanation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, probably a glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can provide a quicksave persistence file if needed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif it does that and you can\u0027t explain it, it is not a \u0022glitch\u0022. it is a law of physics. this particular law of physics allows your kerbals to reach across the galaxy, which means you should keep it. figure out how to toggle it and use it anywhere in your orbit, and you\u0027ve got warp drive. use it wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-findthepin1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. oh and if you can control the acceleration, you has to give everyone here the knowledge of exactly how the craft is made. we want to go to a(k)lph(k)a ce(k)nt(k)aur(k)i.

Wouldn\u0027t need that anyhow - if there\u0027s any sort of internal imbalance, acceleration would occur. Keep in mind that all parts are ALWAYS simulated as interacting physical bodies unless you\u0027re on rails (non-phys-warp, or not in the physics bubble/etc). They\u0027re always there, pushing on each other. IF any of the forces aren\u0027t perfectly and exactly cancelling out, you\u0027ve got a net force and therefore accel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a station back in 0.23 or thereabouts where it would accelerate in a given direction (and also turn rather violently); it had a net accel of 0.2m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.
