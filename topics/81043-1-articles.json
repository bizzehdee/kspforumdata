If the player deviates from the course, the tutorial will close and the player will be left with the rocket (he paid for it after all) but each successfully accomplished step (such as each staging above 3000 meters) will reward the player with appropriate amount so he is not at (huge) loss if he does not finish the scenario. It will end with a nice sum of money if he accomplishes the ultimate goal of the tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T14:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would make a lot more sense than predefined tutorials.
