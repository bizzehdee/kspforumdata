To that end, IKEA, the International Kerbal Exploration Association, was created. Their first task, supported by the UKS (launching from Kermansburg), the KSR (launching from Roka Cosmodrome), PDSRK (Launching from Orok Spaceport), the Republic of Narf, the Federal Republic of Krutch, and the kingdom of Dongle (all launching from Pleasant Valley). Even the smallest countries contributed as best they could. North Kerea donated some of its substantial hoard of delicious blutonium for snacks (and also NTRs if there\u0027s any left over). Jebediah Kerman and his band of slightly mad engineers and pilots also made major contributions. In recognition of his pioneering role in Kerbal spaceflight it was agreed that Jeb\u0027s Junkyard would be renovated and renamed the Kerbal Space Center, a neutral launch site and the location of the first manned mission to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo accomplish this tall task, engineers concluded that they were, in the words of the father of spaceflight himself, \u0022gonna need a lot more boosters.\u0022 Specifically, enough to launch approximately 100 tons into Kerbin orbit. This new rocket was named Keraloo, after the giant blue lizard that supports the world on its back. Three unmanned test missions were scheduled but after engineers rapidly got bored and it became clear that nobody could possibly afford two more unmanned launches of such a huge rocket, the engineers cleared the crash test dummies out of Keraloo-2 and replaced them with the always smiling Jebediah Kerman (Commander), former president of the UKS and space enthusiast, Robert \u0022Bob\u0022 Kerman (CM Pilot), and Alcal Kerman, the mostly bold two-and-a-half time hero of the Kerbal Socialist Republic (MM Pilot). Rooly Kerman (PDSRK) and the unfortunately named Hanger Kerman (UKS) were chosen to be the capsule communicators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At dawn, Keraloo-2 was rolled onto Pad 1 at KSC and 1000 metric tons of highly energetic propellant was exploded in something vaguely like a controlled fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E********\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERooly: \u0022We\u0027re a bit close to the rocket, don\u0027t you think, Comrade Hanger?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Hanger: \u0022I\u0027m not sure Jeb\u0027s old cinderblock shelter is doing to help us.

A bit singed...and a few fires. But that\u0027s nothing to worry about! I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll handle 12,000 Kilonewtons of RAW POWER just fine. After all, *I* built it! The only reason we didn\u0027t put more mainsails on this baby is because the appropriations people can\u0027t count any higher than eight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERooly: \u0022Yes.
