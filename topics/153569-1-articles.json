In that context scientist designed quantum computers which with two cubits showed creates great promise, theoretically and disregarding the unexplored caveats issue. Adding more cubits revealed that quantum decoherence is progressively more disruptive, which wipes out theory and now places quantum computing back in the situation that they need to explore more caveats to deal with quantum decoherence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn its current state a perfectly acting quantum computer would be very good at calculating an actual probability distribution given a two state outcome p and q, calculating all probabilities, it would not be very good as a your video graphics processor machine and/or single core CPU playing WoW for 3AM 35-man city raids on a 1080p monitor (which, comparably, is what 99% of the planet really needs there new faster computer for). Theoretically, however, some other QM discovery might allow us to make in-line processing faster, allowing you to say run a raid on 75 inch monitor at 2400 DPI resolution, testing the absolute limits of peripheral vision at say 133 frames per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, some of the new atomic isomers can allow flipping states which might make faster memories or registers. Doubtful but proposed. The creation of single molecule transitors built with scanning tunneling technology may allow single electron processing, which decreases the size, voltage and amperage in CPU (although you still have to find a way to wire it). In space were space flight may take generation and were cosmic radiation is really destructive to electrons, and shielding is quite expensive, and power does not last a long time . . .\u00A0 atomic isomers that very long decay life\u0027s are the solution, the problem is that electronics need to operate at critically low temperatures, and to save electricity at very low power usage. So modern low amperage, low voltage devices could provide a solution for the deep space probing.\u00A0 Communication still remains an issue, but provided the ship makes it with some sort of solar panel (again questionable longevity in space) ..\u00A0 of course quantum entanglement allows communication\u00A0 and entangled pairs could be stabilized for say 4000 years (a rather large if and if then) we could have in some future tiny little probes flying out into space radiating back to home the location of habitable planets, which we have no means to ever reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T22:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222890423\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481923838\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n55 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the major point was missed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quantum computer *might* be able to compute ray traced graphics wildly faster than current tech. \u00A0Don\u0027t be too surprised if this doesn\u0027t improve WoW or any other AAA graphics game. \u00A0It probably would improve KSP. \u00A0Unfortunately, I suspect ray-tracing takes a *ton* of qubits, wildly more than imaginable and presumably enough to make cryptography impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quantum computer *might* be able to optimize maneuver nodes in n-body gravity, including gravity assists and likely \u0022fuzzy boundary tricks\u0022. \u00A0This would be nearer and dearer to KSP players, and probably require a lot less qubits (but still enough to do Shor\u0027s algorithm and break computer security as we know it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think the major point that was the punchline at the end. \u00A0Teach your kids about logic and you don\u0027t have to worry that they followed your explanation about Hilbert Space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/quantum-computer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/quantum-computer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[a better use of quantum computers]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-16T22:26:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2016 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by wumpus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Edouble posting would be rude.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
