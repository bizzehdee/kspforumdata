It seems to suggest that you should be building many stations and bases throughout the system, even 5 in LKO. This isn\u0027t what station contracts should be.

Just have a satellite that can support at least one Kerbal and have Y amount of docking ports, and have power and an antenna. This would be a basic core for further expansion. This type of contract would only be given by The Space Program (or the World First Society, as long as it\u0027s not a company). Your station core is now ready for expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Attach X module to Y station\u0022 This would be more complex. This contract could be a corporation, such as Rockomax wanting you to put up a fuel module, or the Space Program wanting to put up a habitation module, or either the Space Program or Zaltronic Electronics might want a large solar array for the station that generates Z power. These modules wouldn\u0027t have to have their own power (unless they are solar arrays or generators) or antenna, all they would need is to dock to Station Y, and be able to be docked to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Send crew to a space station.\u0022 The Space Program wants you to bring crew to a space station if it\u0027s not already full.

Almost exactly the same. The difference is that you don\u0027t have to dock modules, you just have to land them within 1 kilometer of another part of the base. Bases would also have contracts for modules that can mine fuel. This would open up a whole bunch of contracts about replenishing station fuel. If you have empty or nearly-empty fuel tanks in orbit, a company might want you to fix that. Rockomax, Jeb\u0027s Junkyard, [Roverdude\u0027s Mining Company], or The Space Program would have you refuel the station, maybe with a specific modifier to specify if it comes from a base, another station, or if it can be anywhere (launched from Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T18:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETater, go join the dev team, now.

Even if it is minor, like the exact mass, atmospheric height and density, etc being all that varies. Then you need to send a probe or astronauts to orbit FIRST, to gain the science needed for whatever your goals are (your stock lander for that world in the past won\u0027t cut it, because the gravity is now a little higher).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you\u0027re getting your wish - check \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111967-Squadcast-Summary-%282015-02-28%29-Insert-Witty-Edition-Title-Here-Edition?p=1764947\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1764947\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post (link)\u003C/a\u003E for pix \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeh.

Even if I was ready, I don\u0027t see a lone kerbal surviving alone in that cupola for the length of time it will take for my rescue mission to arrive.
