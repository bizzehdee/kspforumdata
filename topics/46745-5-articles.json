Yes the call was in Update but it was limited to doing lcd draws only 5 times per second or so. I\u0027ve been planning to move it to either fixed update or a coroutine with a yield waitforseconds. Thats great that you coded it up. I\u0027ll take a look at your pull request and get it in.

So since I was changing it anyways, it\u0027s now only called every 200ms (or whatever you set wait_active to) or 2s respectively (when not active --\u0026gt; wait_idle). Less overhead on the main thread is always better, as CPU is almost always the limiting factor for this game. And even when it is called and there is nothing to display, it only clears the LCD once now and not every time (since that\u0027s what was causing these jumps for me). All in all it\u0027s a tiny patch, excluding comments it\u0027s maybe 20 lines or something of actual code (so not really counting { and }).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that you were not really doing anything even when the 200ms were up, clearing the LCD is just writing the string to the bitmap and showing it (for every \u0027lcd-screen\u0027? just once? didn\u0027t look into weather a \u0027Device\u0027 was an actual device or a screen, like orbit, target, ...). I\u0027m just as baffled as you are as to why that would cause such hiccups, as the normal code writes to the LCD much more frequently and doesn\u0027t cause this as far as I can tell.

It\u0027s great when a game can use the LCD screen on the G19 keyboard. However, I haven\u0027t been able to get it to work, after carefully following the directions and even trying it on a clean install of .24. I am using Windows 7 Professional 64 bit OS, but running the 32 bit version of KSP. I do not see the \u0022Initializing\u0022 message on the LCD, and the GHud program doesn\u0027t appear in the LCD\u0027s \u0022Switch to Program\u0022 menu. However, it does appear in the Programs list in the Logitec LCD Manager program, where it is check-marked to be Enabled. I even tried disabling all the other programs using the LCD, to avoid conflicts. I\u0027ve tried everything I can think of, and I\u0027m sure the files are in the right locations.

I moved many classes into their own files, renamed a bunch of variables, changed the access levels of several of the raw fields that were being used, and in general modified the code to suit my own tastes and conventions. These changes, while having little functional impact on the plugin, are a radical departure from the original code base that I downloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many of the changes that I made were for my own piece of mine (for example, I renamed all private fields so that the name is proceeded by an underscore), I made still more changes just so that I could get a better handle on the code base to understand what was going on and make it easier to use and expand upon. Now that I have a very basic understanding of how the plugin is composed and how it does its job, I would like to several additional displays that contain various bits of information, and I have done a bit of refactoring that will (hopefully) make the addition of any new displays a bit easier to implement. Having said all of that, I would be far more comfortable merging my changes to the code base with the main source if I were to discuss this with the original developer first. If, after a time, the original developer doesn\u0027t respond that there will be further development on this plugin, I would likely create an independent fork of the repository to continue forward development on my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plugin has a LOT of potential for those players who use a keyboard with an appropriate display, and even without the addition of new features I find it to be extremely useful. There are, however, many situations that I believe this plugin could be put to use that would add to the overall utility of the plugin and to the experience that the user has while using it. Some plugins, such as MechJeb, offer many varied display windows that contain different stats, and in many cases similar displays could instead be sent to the keyboard display (saving a bit of real estate on the screen). I actually just picked up my G19 this month, so I am still a bit unfamiliar with all aspects of developing plugins for it, and working with the GHud plugin has been a good introduction into how to do so. I am also rather unfamiliar with the Kerbal API, so again I find that working with this preexisting source code to be a rather good introduction to the topic. Hopefully as I continue to tinker with it for my own enjoyment I will be able to add a few additional useful features as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I will wind up sharing back any new feature that I do wind up implementing, though as I mentioned earlier I would like to collaborate with the original developer as opposed to simply picking up on their work, though if this plugin is not going to be carried further by the original developer than I would be willing to continue developing it for awhile independently. Still, I don\u0027t like to step on the toes of my fellow code-monkeys. I will spend a little time today looking into using GitHub and Git for making my code changes available, though it may take me a few days to actually get around to posting anything up there. I am simply comfortable using TFS as my personal source code repository (and I use the self-hosted TFS version so that the repository is on my personal machine instead of in the cloud), so making changes to my standard workflow may take a few days to fully integrate into my development activities. I will post here later if and when I do manage to get the code changes I have been making posted online for others to look over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
