You don\u0027t need to do too crazy, but you can expect to achieve an error half than the standard deviation of the disturbance within a couple of tries. Once you\u0027re happy with the number, go to space center and never return to the satellite again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this method, on Kerbin, my network stays at semi-major axis 2Mm\u002B-0.5m.
