It has most of it\u0027s textures revamped atm and I\u0027ve got about 6 objects left to do. Shouldn\u0027t take more then a hour or 3 and after that I have to partially rebuild the CFG files. All the engines (only 3/4) will have glowing elements when they heat up. Almost every object will have a normal channel for added detail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to use Kreuzung\u0027s Energy Plugin in combo with powertech. This combination allows for more stability and a hell lot less chance of stuff breaking down. Also there won\u0027t be a need for a adapter. There will be also a slight gameplay balance, I\u0027m making the Ion Engine weaker again because its almost as powerfull as the small liquid engine. But in return, command pods will have their own small battery source (very small) and you are getting in total 5 totally new solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I will add a new Rover to the pack which will set a new standard beside the 1m/2m cylinder hulls. But don\u0027t worry, you can still use it with cylinder hulls. But it is also a preparation for Kethane pack, where Rovers will get their own little miners and systems to enlarge your kethane experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Satellite Pack will contain: Tosh\u0027s Cart, Electrical energy, Powertech \u0026amp; MuMech and all for their obvious reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upcomming release will be 1.9 because of the major changes. 2.0 will be pack marked \u0022as good as done\u0022 but we will continue to support it and update it to the latest version.

Kethane has gain a big popularity compared to the lack of information that we gave (my fault on that part). But gamers learn fast and in no-time people have been setting up mining bases all over the place and even creating videos about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also no major bugs which is only beneficial because then we can start directly working on the next version which will contain a proper nice interface upgrade and some new features to use along with kethane. So no more pain in the arse map to look at and yes, we will flip it in the right orientation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a couple of weeks you might see no more beta but a proper full release plugin with all the features that we wanted in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPayload Pack\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload Pack had a nice release too, JohnnyD made some great fairings for you to use and they will go nice with the other packs aswell as stock modules.
