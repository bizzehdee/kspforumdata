All I want is to be able to still see the ore deposits even when I\u0027ve switched over to my mining ship. From what I understand you need to keep a satellite in orbit of the planet in order to keep the ore deposites visible, while a second ship goes down to the surface to do the actual ore mining. But when I switch away from the scanner the ore map disappears. I have to try and memorize it and continuously switch between the two crafts to make sure I\u0027m landing on a ore-rich area. It\u0027s very very tedious and I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a way to just leave the overlay on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T08:24:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T08:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can sorta do this, you just need to focus on the body you are orbiting by double-clicking it in the map view.

IOW, don\u0027t send a mining ship directly to a place you spot from the ore overlay. Ore is distributed by biome, not really by specific location, so what the orbital scan shows you is large regions of the planet where most of the surface area is composed of biomes that have relatively high levels (but not necessarily the highest for that planet) of ore. You\u0027re supposed to send ships there with surface scanners and/or NBS to determine which biomes have the better ore levels (which will be FAR less than the cut-off value of the overlay). Once you know which biomes have what ore, then you can pick an actual mining location within one of the better biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T12:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you\u0027ll probably get frustrated after many attempts of trying to switch focus back to your own vessel from focus of the body.
