It is here for ballast and prevents spinning out of control. In the video from the first fight I\u0027ve noticed that few times my plane apparently entered a flatspin for a few seconds which was happening after draining too much fuel from the nosecone. Also, my cocpkit torque might be on. It makes no difference at all (proved by testing) but just for the sake of it it should be off. Thanks and sorry for troubling you.
