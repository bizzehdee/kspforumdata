Anyways here is a proof of concept for my SSTO lifter, in the future I do intend to add/redesign features that will make this reusable and fully functional in orbit for positioning and attaching space station pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat my design is essentially proofing is a way to attach and carry payloads to orbit without needing to fit test every little piece or create a crane to position and link up the pieces. Nothing annoy\u0027s me more than fit testing a piece 20 times to get it to be just the right height to link up with a docking port. My design utilizes landing struts to capture and hold payload as its being transported into orbit. The idea being, after the rocket has landed back at space port, new payloads can then be mounted to a rovers roof and driven to the rocket, centered then captured with the landing struts to avoid having to fit test heights. So if it will fit under the center rocket it will link up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did run into a number of initial problems with this design including a game related bug. However with minor redesigns I was able to fix all but the game related bug. As such you will notice that half way the rocket does change shape slightly by eliminating the large orange center tank in favor of an additional quarter tank on each of the outside stacks. This was done to lower the center of gravity and make the stability better. Of course I still have a slightly annoying game related bug that prevents me from speeding up time because it thinks its traveling over the surface. This bug also prevents me from saving while in effect, however I have figured out that once I achieve a stable orbit, I can release and immediately recapture my payload to fix this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate this is only the first step of a long road. Now to redesign a version that can land and be refueled.

I must admit I was starting to experiment with using a separate positioning tug with my rocket for handling the payload in orbit (the idea being to save monopropellant by not having to maneuver any extra tonnage in orbit), but this concept goes way beyond just having a separate craft for orbital positioning. A very elegant solution, It also makes me wonder if you couldn\u0027t transfer fuel back into the launcher in orbit to land vertically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a few questions for you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: does your plane have the ability to split and recombine while on the ground?

Obviously this carries the advantage of not needing to carry your oxidizer and they seem to produce a good amount of thrust for minor fuel consumption. However I\u0027ve always had issues with using these in vertical situation and maintaining stability when they start to burnout in the transition out of the atmosphere.
