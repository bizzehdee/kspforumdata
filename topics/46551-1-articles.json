I simply used two 6-way intersections and a small tank on top of them. On the 4 open connectors on each intersection, I attached an orange tank with a decoupler, with a few sepratrons (not sure if they are actually needed, but looks cooler). In other words, I had two stacked \u0022plus\u0022 signs of orange tanks, eight tanks in all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I placed, using girders, four nuclear engines (the slightly larger ones from NovaPunch) on the small top tank, so that the engines were in between the tanks. An X on top of the \u002B, so to say. Then it was simply a matter of hooking up all the engines to the top tank, and then connect the orange tanks with fuel lines and arrange staging so that they were dropped two by two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorked nicely, can take you just about anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother benefit is that, since it\u0027s flat and wide, less torque is needed to turn it, and RCS placed at the end of the orange tanks will get better torque from more leverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0027s also fairly short, it\u0027s easy to fit one hell of a lifter under it, and still house it in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
