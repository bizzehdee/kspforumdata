So i figure it\u0027s time to come back. i REALLY miss KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to where i need help... Obviously the old version of the mods i was using aren\u0027t going to work, just for fun, i made a custom install that combined all of my old data, with the 1.6 game files, and when i launched it, it died while loading asset definitions. looked at the crash log, and the culprit was mono.dll. There were no crashes when launching vanilla 1.6, so it\u0027s definitely a problem with mod data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any pointers on how to smoothly put together an updated version with mods? I\u0027m having a hell of a time finding updated versions of my mods, that are compatible with 1.6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must sound like an idiot...but it\u0027s been well over a year, and life\u0027s been kicking me in the ass.... i\u0027ve forgotten how to do most of this stuff. Any help or advice you guys could provide would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-25T18:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223511123\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180869\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221545761943\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Numberyellow\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, Numberyellow said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any pointers on how to smoothly put together an updated version with mods?
