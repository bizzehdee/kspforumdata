They aren\u0027t fun at all and take huge amounts of time forcing you to make things you shouldn\u0027t have to. They are just a frustrating thing that slows down progress the way they are implemented. I hope they go away or get majorly revamped, but for now, is tehre a mod that specifically replaces them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure about mods that replace \u0027em, but if you decline them away, eventually other missions will fill those slots..especially if you have a lot of reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVigorous declining is sometimes needed as they tend to come back with a vengeance at times. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note that some of them are \u0027landed at Kerbin\u0027, which can be done on the launchpad with no fuel to quickly clear a bunch of slots and small amount of free space bucks)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like a method whereby I can simply say \u0022NO PART TESTING CONTRACTS EVER\u0022 and have the game respect that, and generate other contracts instead so I don\u0027t have to spend a ton of time clicking the decline button to rid myself of substandard content.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a way of sorting is a must.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScratch that.

Seems like a mod to autodecline them and refund reputation all behind the scenes would be difficult for a modder. Hopefully the devs will find a better way with missions because I don\u0027t think any of us really like the testing missions. Like you said, the only ones we don\u0027t mind are the \u0022while landed\u0022 ones, and those probably shouldn\u0027t exist either. Some kerbal in a lab could do that for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022milint33w\u0022 data-cite=\u0022milint33w\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYa...

Didn\u0027t know that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t dislike all the part testing contracts - only the ones in the atmosphere which are usually too difficult to be worthwhile. There was a short period of time in my career mode play-through before I had the launch satellite contracts where I was part testing in LKO. In my mind the part test in LKO and launch satellite to x orbit are similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
