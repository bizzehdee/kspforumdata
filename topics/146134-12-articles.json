I think at least a part of the issue (especially if you\u0027ve been gaming since the early Nintendo days) is that the expectation is that console releases are \u0022finished\u0022 games in a fully functional state with little patching needed. However, Microsoft itself is leading the charge to unify\u00A0PC and consoles as much as is possible and the more that happens, the more I expect to see console releases that are buggy in this way. It\u0027s an unfortunate reality that if a company (any company, not just Squad), can pull the trigger on releasing a game and fix it later, while at the same time making a profit, they have to do it sometimes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really do hope the patch is released soon for consoles so that the focus and conversation can change from \u0022Why is the game broken?\u0022 to
