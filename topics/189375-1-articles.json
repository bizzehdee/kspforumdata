I am running only visual mods (Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is what happens: I am adjusting my satellite carrying the Sentinal telescope to the designated orbit and get the expected confirmation (the highlighted target orbit disappears and the contract is showing a green check icon in front of the \u0022reach the designated orbit...\u0022) requirement. All is good and expected until here. However, as soon as I am switching to another vessel or back to Tracking Station the already achived designated orbit of my Sentinel telescope get lost. The highlighted target orbit is back and in my contract the former green checked requirement \u0022\u0022reach the designated orbit\u0022 is grey and not-checked again. When I am switching back to the Sentinel telescope satellite, the requirement is achived again. I can repeat this many times - it\u0027s always the same. I also tried to adjust the orbit slightly, to lower the allowed deviation - but no success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever had such a strange problem and hoping for your help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-29T14:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP version?
