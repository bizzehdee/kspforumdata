I want to play a good game about space colonization.\n\nWhat I really dream about right now would be a game that gave you control of a colony ship and let you colonize and terraform a planet, worrying about the survival of the colonists, about balancing resources, etc. Something \u0022realistic\u0022 (or at least hard sci-fi-ish). Not a combat game where you have to worry about aliens - I\u0027m not looking for a RTS. \n\nDoes anyone know a game like that? Would you reccomend it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T22:25:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone know a game like that?

I knew about Outpost, but not Predestination. It isn\u0027t exactly what I\u0027m looking for, but I did enjoy playing MOO II and some of the Gal Civ games, so I\u0027ll keep an eye on it.\n\nI also knew about RimWorld from some of Scott Manley\u0027s videos. It reminded me of another game, a medieval village management called \u0022Towns\u0022, which I didn\u0027t enjoyed very much - maybe that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t give it a shot.

There are actually five in the series, I\u0027ve played III, IV, and V and I think IV is the best. V is good too but the early 3D graphics mess things up more than the game play enhancements help.\n\nIt\u0027s a solid 4X series with a simple idea of \u0022take over the galaxy\u0022. You are in charge of a race of aliens or humans who have just entered the golden era of their space age. You start on one planet, build scouts and colony ships, explore wormholes and jump points to neighboring systems, and colonize the galaxy. You manage your planets production queues, what buildings to install on them, the population health, natural accidents and freak plagues, things like that. It\u0027s fun. Of course you\u0027re bound to meet other aliens eventually. Multiple win conditions from domination to diplomacy, similar to the Civ games. There is combat but it\u0027s pretty basic and has an auto-calculate function if you don\u0027t want to take time doing battles. Super easy to mod for, too. Like KSP, it\u0027s all stored for the most part in plain-text if you want to make your own custom races and ships."},{"CreatedByName":"Ricovandijk","CreatedById":71535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T18:32:52Z","Content":"Outpost 2 is still my favourite, I still play it now and then on my work laptop (an old I5 with internal graphics). keeping an eye on predestination though, looks promising but waiting for a steam sale. spent to much cash already on pre-release games lately ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI imagine a way to play a game like this inside KsP. the colonisation mods get really close, but lack any opponent other than the kraken or maybe a failures mod. multi-player would be a solution, but it takes a lot of time to build a base on even the mun or minmus, and only seconds to destroy it. an in-situ build of modules is a must addon, a time to build addon and in-situ tech tree. maybe something to develop in the future."}]}
