With the current version this is not an issue but with the listed item to have heat damage count during atmosphere interface I think it will present new design challenges. I have tried to have all my landers that will go through an atmosphere utilize a shield, basically one of the circle adapters attached to a mounting strut and a de-coupler to release it after re-entry and the parachutes deploy. I find the shield adds a design challenge in that it add mass (not a lot usually) and requires some thought on placement and how the craft will enter an atmosphere but also be oriented at launch. You also have to make sure the shield diameter covers everything behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think the bigger challenge will be on larger craft and aero-braking/aero-capture maneuvers. It would be bad if your comms tower burnt off or an exposed fuel tank blew up while trying to aerobrake at Eve or Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gtmattz","CreatedById":15075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T22:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook up Deadly Reentry for a taste of things to come.
