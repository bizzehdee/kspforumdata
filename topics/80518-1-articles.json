I don\u0027t know what the maximum payload is for each, but so far each plane has packed whatever I could fit into the cargo bay. Squirt payload and reach is unknown, this was designed and used specifically for Kerbal rescue contracts (90-115k orbits). I\u0027ve never used it for other cargo, so I\u0027m not sure what it\u0027s capabilities are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent profiles rely on a balanced load. If your load moves COG to much the plane will either fly very sluggishly, or not at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAscent profile for Hawks and Squirt\u003C/strong\u003E, these are recommendations as each plane handles a bit differently based on cargo load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction group 1 toggles engine and air intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETake off:\u003C/strong\u003E SAS on, full throttle, activate turbojet.

At above 25k it\u0027s a balancing act between climb rate and airspeed to keep the engine going. Keep an eye on your turbo jet thrust (right click engine). Let the plane slowly climb and gain airspeed until the engine thrust drops below 60 or flames out, you should be above 30k with airspeed above 1800ms by this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E35k-Ap:\u003C/strong\u003E Once you switch engines bring the nose up above 30 degrees, you can go to 50 degrees safely, not sure above that.

Due to landing gear position (for stability) this plane does not take off until it leaves the end of the runway. Attempting to take off early only results in instability. Also, the nose may hunt left or right. Just keep the nose strait and pull up when it leaves the end of the runway. Be careful not to smack the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClimb out:\u003C/strong\u003E Raise nose between 30 and 50 degrees finding a compromise between climb rate and airspeed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10k:\u003C/strong\u003E lower nose to 35 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E15k:\u003C/strong\u003E lower nose to 20-25 degrees (again depends on cargo weight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E20k:\u003C/strong\u003E Lower nose for slow climb rate (keep Pro-grade marker just above horizon line), usually nose pointed between 10 and 15 degrees. Keeping the climb rate slow, the Rapiers should stay in air breathing mode up to about 25k. As the Rapiers get close to switchig, you may experience some yaw left or right, but as long as your climb rate is still low it should be managable. Keep low climb rate, and give small yaw corrections until Rapiers switch to closed cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E25k-AP:\u003C/strong\u003E Once engines switch to closed cycle bring nose up above 30 degrees. If your load is balanced you should be safe up to 50 degrees. Climb to your desired AP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote:\u003C/strong\u003E If your only deliverig cargo to orbit (up to 150k) you\u0027ll have plenty of fuel. However, if you are rendezvousing and docking with a ship/station in 150k orbit be careful about fuel use during rendezvous (unless you can refuel after docking). The more fuel you use during rendezvous, the less you\u0027ll have for deorbit and landing. Also the RCS isn\u0027t balanced so small corrections and patience is recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDecent profile for all.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHawk MK1/Squirt balance:\u003C/strong\u003E Before your deorbit burn, balance your plane by moving fuel from rear tank to front tank. With equal amounts in each tank your plane will have neutral balance (COG right on COL). Moving more to the front tank will increase stability for reentry if you chose. However, with neutral balance both planes are very stable so long as you keep the nose at or near your prograde marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHawk fuel/Cargo MK2:\u003C/strong\u003E These planes are harder to balance with multiple tanks. I recommend moving most of your fuel to the forward tanks. This produces a nose heavy airplane that will be sluggish but stable during reentry. You can further balance for better handling after most of your speed has been bled off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeorbit burn:\u003C/strong\u003E I like to do my deorbit burn when my plane is about 90 degrees relative to KSC. Burn until orbit line comes down and is about level with the island NE of KSC, this will usually result in a bit of undershoot and you\u0027ll probably need to fly a bit to reach the runway. I usually prefer to undershoot a bit rather than overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReentry:\u003C/strong\u003E Keeping your nose pointed at or near your prograde marker should result in an uneventful reentry. The only time I\u0027ve lost control during reentry with these planes was when I started to maneuver in 4x time accel (forgot I was in time accel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EApproach and landing:\u003C/strong\u003E Most of these planes have quite a bit of tail behind the back landing gear. A shallow approach and landing is the best way to avoid damaging your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy my designs.
