other way as its not an analog, there is only full turning or no turning) but i just wanna make a tiny, few degrees\u00A0initial turn around 6-7000 and it makes the rocket tripping over unstoppable. now with nearly every rockets that are not just a single line of fuel tanks and pod on top with some big winglets on the bottom this happens so i just have to fly straight up until that stage is over or reach\u00A0the space and then\u00A0i can navigate. and the sad is that most people just swallow this like his own fault and say, ohh well, i have to learn to fly in ksp, tho\u0027 its really ksp\u0027s flaw, those rockets should fly like arrows just because of their huge momentum... i still manage to go to anywhere in ksp, this is not that challenging game some wanna claim, this is a very intuitive game so with pure logic everything can be flown (just like panzer1b said) but these problems can turn down quickly those who cant accept every flawed solutions. after 400 hours, at least for me, these are flaws i cant look over, thats why in the op post i was asking to get this fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso landed crafts on wheel, fully braked, keep sliding even uphill in

one with front winglets.\u00A0take off, keep flying straight, when its stable just touch the down pitch, then the up pitch (obviously with keyboard, i dont have joy but it should work with keyboards too) simulating like doing little corrections in elevation. what should happen is that when you pitch up or down, the plane slightly change direction up or down. instead in ksp its like hitting the top or bottom of the plane with a huge hammer, it raise its nose suddenly then dropping back and if its a big enough plane it will start swinging up and down... i dont even need to make a video of this, im 100% sure it works like this for
