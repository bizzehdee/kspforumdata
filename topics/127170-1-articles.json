So then I did the \u0022I forgot my password\u0022 thing with sending an email to yourself to prove your you but the forums said \u00A0there\u0027s no user with my address. I looked myself up and didn\u0027t find anything suspicious on my account. I\u0027m just so annoyed. I suppose i could start over on this new account i made, but I\u0027d really not like having to do everything over again. Has anyone else had this problem? I\u0027d really appreciate any feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely Planetfall (maybe I should start writing 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
