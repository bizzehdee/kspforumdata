It really wasn\u0027t easy to land the showcased base on minmus.\n\nTo your points:\n\n1. That might be a good idea. Though this won\u0027t be possible with the Science Lab since it has its \u0022telescope\u0022 in the exact center of the top.\n2. This idea sounds good too. This would make landing these things much easier. Also it might look cool having such a thing on top. In some tests i attached the Rover-Body to one of the sides of the modules and it looked like a huge air control unit.\n3. You are right, i have to scale down the collision meshes a bit, this applies to all other parts as well. Forgot that they have to be a bit smaller than the model due to the way the physics-engine handles collisions. *Doh!*\n4. Hmm...This would result in many different sized heatshields for all modules...maybe i find a way to solve this without spamming parts. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n5.
