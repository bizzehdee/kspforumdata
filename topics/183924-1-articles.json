I made a flag for my new corporation, and I would love help/advice on what to do with it. Mostly it has to do with improving readability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VxvNi9b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VxvNi9b.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the design, but its kind of blurry at a distance.
