One is placed directly at the end of the suspension strut and this governs the movement of the strut via a gameobject called (by convention) SuspensionTraverse.\u003Cp\u003EThere is a second wheelcollider that\u0027s placed behind the first, with double the suspension travel and above by half that travel. This has a SuspensionTraverse2 object that\u0027s moved by the code as usual, except this one moves no mesh directly. It moves the swingarm via a lookat to SuspensionTraverse2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first collider governs the rotation of the front wheels mesh, the second the rear. The rear collider has much lighter springing than the primary, as the weight should be carried by the central collider, which is simulating all the wheels being on the ground, and thus compressing the suspension proper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/omXEJuW.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/omXEJuW.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured if we both attack it from different angles the least we gain is a better understanding. Code is in my dev repo (did I give you access already?), though being updated fast with wheel rotation, steering, animation etc. and I\u0027ll pass back rigged models when I\u0027ve finished messing about. I\u0027ve learned a lot doing this, I have piles of notes to put in my advanced rigging tutorial, as well as some stuff I can use to improve my existing modules \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed most of the superfluous mesh for clarity, will bung back in when I\u0027m done testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: to answer your question about what\u0027s different with the colliders: Nothing, except I have no transforms below them. Testing with your module revealed a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colliders calculate rotation, even if it\u0027s not them holding the model off the ground (or they\u0027re not actually enabled). The clues are: Brakes. Call the braketorque to the log and you\u0027ll see the brakes are not being applied even when the model seems glued to the runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotating the wheelcolliders away from the floor leaves the part firmly planted on the floor (though now appearing to float). This is a dead give-away, which lead me to messing with transform placement in the model. I can get the colliders to do their job \u003Cem\u003Ecorrectly\u003C/em\u003E so long as there are no transforms below their level in the part and they are enabled. I came to the firm conclusion that it\u0027s not a collider issue, but a topology issue I\u0027m afraid. At very least, the tranform position of the master parts needs fixing (this is easy), but your CONTACT object also causes the issue and this seemed instrumental to your simulation working as it stands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m puzzled why you\u0027ve got a separate raycast when you can use the racast from the collider, though? This might be a potential solution as (I think) you could do away with your CONTACT object and all will be good in the world. I could well be missing something fundamental, though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow I understand how you did this.

I\u0027ve created a stand-alone plugin that detects which side of the vessel a part is placed and activates a left or right handed mesh appropriately. I\u0027m fed up with seeing people struggle with what they think is \u0027mirror\u0027 symmetry, when, in actual fact, it\u0027s rotational symmetry. Will be very easy to use - all you need to do is bundle both the left and right handed meshes into one part, each within a named GameObject (left and right seem most appropriate, though I\u0027l leave it to the modeller to choose) and the plugin will work its magic activating one side or the other as appropriate. \u0027Symmetry\u0027 clones automatically get the opposite mesh activated, so asymmetric parts are now possible without actually having two separate parts (that then aren\u0027t placeable with symmetry mode). I believe I mentioned I had this idea while I was chatting in the last livestream. This should be particularly helpful with landing gear \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A dedicated Dev thread will appear shortly and code will be completely permissively licensed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T15:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI forgot to mention:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe axle beam on that gear is symmetrical.
