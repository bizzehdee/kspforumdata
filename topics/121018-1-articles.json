Both were sent to Duna, with contracts to run seismic scans on both Duna and Ike. \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E did a landing on Ike and completed the contract as planned with a rover, then returned to Duna\u0027s orbit and transferred some fuel (and Sidbal, and the rover) to \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E, which then landed ... about two hundred kilometers short of the south pole, where it was supposed to touch down. Worse, the ship then did a belly flop and I couldn\u0027t stand it up to take off again. So three Kerbals were stranded on the surface, on the other side of the planet from where they were supposed to be. And neither ship had enough life support to last until a rescue mission could arrive from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eventually decided to make their sacrifice count for something, and sent Burbles off in the rover to make the trip to the south pole. Which he pulled off with forty minutes of oxygen left, out of a supply for eighteen hours. So the contract was complete, but now Burbles was dead and Chadwig and Sidbal were still stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E was supposed to make its way back to Kerbin at the next window, but instead Will and Haddas elected to go back for their friends. They managed to land very close to \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E, and brought Chadwig and Sidbal aboard with a load of life support supplies. They then took off and managed to crawl back into orbit, completely out of fuel but with just enough life support to await rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a bit ambitious at this point, and decided to attempt to rescue \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E herself from Duna\u0027s surface. In addition to a big tank of life support, the rescue craft (christened K.S.V. \u003Cem\u003EBurbles\u003C/em\u003E, of course) was designed to land on Duna and allow Haddas to strap some 24/77s onto \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E and lift her back into the correct orientation. From there Haddas took the battered cruiser back into orbit and docked with \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E again. The five Kerbals now had plenty of life support and the resources of two cruisers, as well as just enough fuel to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey made the transfer as planned, but I unfortunately aimed too shallow for the aerocapture and I didn\u0027t get the ships into the planned LKO. Instead, it stuck them into a Mun encounter which then dumped my Kerbin perigee below 500km. And I had 24m/s to counter it and save the ships (still docked together).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no other alternative, I launched a tanker to rendezvous and deliver fuel. Which it did exactly ten minutes before impact, and it wasn\u0027t enough.

Second stage came online shortly after, only to notice I\u0027m at about 1/3 my usual fuel capacity. Now is when I start to remember that thought I had back about 30 minutes before I launched the ship: \u0022This crew pod is about 6 tons heavier than my usual fuel-tank-probe with docking hardware. I should probably add some solid boosters to this, chuck the main two stages higher up and increase overall delta-V before I launch, but everything\u0027s saying I have the delta-V to make it to orbit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, one thing I knew was that if I attempted to land with a load in the payload bay, I\u0027d kill everyone because A: the ship isn\u0027t glide-safe with a payload, B: even if it was glide-safe, the emergency chutes can\u0027t take the extra weight, and C: even if the chutes could take the weight, there was no way the ship would stay intact on landing, not with that kind of weight in the bay.

Lose 8 Kerbals in the Crew Pod/Science Bay/Monoprop Supply Can, or lose all 16 Kerbals onboard the ship (was planning on using the onboard spare four to do a crew rotation at the same time, so I had the XL version of my plane up there.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI opened the payload bay, rolled the plane so gravity would assist unloading, and staged. The sacrifice of 8 saved 8 others, rather than writing off 16 and the ship (I play by a simple rule: if it crashes, it cannot be flown again. It must be rebuilt and flown as a new ship.) With an empty payload bay, I was able to make the glide to land instead of falling short, deployed emergency chutes (because it wasn\u0027t a runway landing or near KSC), and came to a sudden, gentle stop on the ground. One of the crew, Valentina Kerman, exited the craft to plant the flag honoring the 8 Kerbals who lost their lives to save everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot, perhaps, my proudest moment, but it\u0027s guaranteed that I don\u0027t load crew cans down with Kerbals until I\u0027ve gotten them to space. The spaceplanes have been redesigned to have higher weight capacities, and more crew capacity so I can load an 8-Kerbal Crew Can, eject it, and then dock it neatly onto my station without ever putting 8 Kerbals at risk if I have to abort and eject the payload. Crew-Can payloads also now carry parachutes, just in case they are actually loaded by accident on take-off. I\u0027ve learned from the experience, and I\u0027ve also redesigned the spaceplanes to be able to land fully loaded with both fuel and heavy payload, just in case disaster happens with the primary launch stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T01:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never think of stranding Kerbals as a \u0022sacrifice\u0022... it\u0027s an opportunity for an extended mission!
