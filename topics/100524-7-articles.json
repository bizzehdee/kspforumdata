You basically have a manned missile. The wings are really not that affective at their thickness, they should be wider at the root to generate more lift at lower speeds. This is why you are running into so many problems on re-entry and landing. Your wings are not generating enough lift to keep your craft in the air at those points. \n\nTake this craft for example, it is a fair bit smaller but it can go to an orbit of 100km and back and land at the KSC. \n\n![9qW2xpd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9qW2xpd.jpg)\n\nNotice this is a delta wing design this gives it a GREAT deal of lift at low speeds and at supersonic speeds. \n\nBut this light duty SSTO that I use currently is also a delta wing design but laid out a bit differently.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But at first stick to the basics of getting an aircraft to fly. I started small, I built my SSTO program to where it is today by starting with simple planes then building supersonic aircraft then craft that could achieve near orbital velocities then finally aircraft that could achieve space interface then last a true SSTO space plane.

I\u0027ve paid full attention to principles of supersonic design, tried to keep as much of the craft inside the shock cone as I could ( although mach angle at mach 5 is 11 degrees and that\u0027s nearly impossible with what we have ) ... and then built gigantic forward sweep aircraft that look more like subsonic transports and had them work just as well. You don\u0027t have to worry about vortex issues because there aren\u0027t any, and so on. What you have to do is give the craft enough wing, which means a low enough wing loading. The next thing you have to do is give it enough control leverage, which is just control surface area \\* distance from fulcrums, and anything else is just dressing or tuning. \n\nYou\u0027re building a spaceplane though, and it has to be a viable if limited envelope aircraft or you should just dump the wings and make it a rocket. First thing you need to do when you think you\u0027ve built something is to take off, fly until just over mach 1, slow down, turn round and land it.

But it depends greatly on the designs job and mission. Currently I am in the process of redesigning my whole spaceplane SSTO cargo hauling fleet. But not as actively as I once was. I only recently got around to finishing three SSTO cargo planes that I plan on using for missions. And I cant say I have messed with the new larger 2.5m stock aircraft parts.

And it was still quite capable of reaching my test orbit of 100km x 100km.\n\n![uKDUioO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uKDUioO.jpg)\n\nAgain it comes down to the design.\n\nI personally find no point in ever going to anything less than 100km orbit my lowest space stations sit at 100km. But I also am a bit odd in some of my thinking. I tend to over-engineer most of my designs.\n\n![wu6fyh0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wu6fyh0.jpg)\n\nThat was a sustained turn of 13.5Gs!"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T23:51:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good related question then - what is the Isp of Turbojets and RAPIERs in FAR? Are they any different than what they are in stock?\n\nI normally budget around 60-65 units of LF per turbojet per 10 minutes of flight time (fuel usage per engine at full throttle sits between 0.08 and 0.11 units per second IIRC, with the most efficient altitude being 5200). Rockets to orbit/deorbit I normally pack around 1000-1200 m/s of dv (typically transitioning at 1400-1450m/s and 25km) depending on rocket TWR and planned ascent profile (some craft can\u0027t pitch up very hard so you get hit with a bit more drag)."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T02:23:56Z","Content":"Up where you spend most of the jet part of the flight the stock engines have 1230ish ISP for me, although I run KIDS in ISP fix mode.
