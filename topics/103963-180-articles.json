The sky should get darker, not brighter. If I look down, the clouds are properly colored. But looking to the east horizon (right of the picture), the sky becomes bright and collides with the black clouds. If I disable PostProcessing, it looks \u0022fine\u0022. Both day and night look ok, the problem is only near the terminator, ~~where the shader applies \u0022white\u0022 in all direction instead of only towards the sun.~~ \n\nEdit: Actually scratch that... The shader itself is ok and realistic, the actual problem seems to be that the post processing effect doesn\u0027t get added on top of the clouds. Above the last layer all looks amazing (\u003E160km) and if I copy most of the settings from the last layer to the previous 2, it looks quite nice actually.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-13T16:17:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2016 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Proot","CreatedById":98932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T18:04:17Z","Content":"[@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) This game is beauty, but thanks to people like you or [@rbray89](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/48847-rbray89/) became art.\n\n![0LszS9e.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0LszS9e.jpg)\n\n***Thanks!***   ***Thanks!***  ***Thanks!***  ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif \u0022:kiss:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Willbl3pic","CreatedById":12468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T18:07:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Proot said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\u003E \n\nWow!

I think a better idea would be to keep the scaling but make it non-linear or change how much it scales by distance to the sun and make the gradient configurable. What do you think?\n\nFor the second one, maybe adjust the extinction?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/13/2016 at 8:44 AM, daniel l. said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That would be nice but all i really need to do is use the normal sun, Then change it into a black hole and surround it with stars, Then put all the planets around one of the stars.\n\u003E \n\nI see what you\u0027re trying to make but the sunflare system isn\u0027t really appropriate for this, what you need is to render a mesh around the sun in the scaledSpace layer so it looks coherent and gets occluded correctly by objects, while the sunflare system renders on top of everything in the nearest camera."},{"CreatedByName":"ammarasyad","CreatedById":163684,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T14:19:23Z","Content":"Scatterer latest version (version 0.0246) tested working fine on DirectX 11 with KSP 1.1.2 x64.\n\nJust some terrain shadow glitches, but I think its from the game since I already tested DirectX 11 before using scatterer.
