Read the top comment of the video! xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the failures, you have to realize that spacecraft are much more complicated systems than cars xD Lot more systems, lot more things that could go wrong.. It\u0027s really strange when you hear causes of failure like \u0022sensors were placed up-side down\u0022 (like on recent Proton GLONASS crash), or \u0022the software had a wrong date\u0022 (like on the Cygnus orbital maneuvers these days), you get struck by the fact that these sound like simple things, but actually are easily overlooked in such a huge and complicated systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow both the Shuttle and Soyuz had a benefit of being experienced (lets not use the word \u0022old\u0022), so the most common failures were getting known and checks were improved over time. The inspection after Challenger said there was a 1 in 9 chance of total failure, it was pure luck for the STS to last 25 missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the foam tearing off the orange tank of the Shuttle was a well known thing but NASA did the \u0022lets cross our fingers and pray\u0022, until Columbia happened.
