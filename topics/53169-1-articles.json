My first step was putting 3 geostationary satellites in orbit, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m doing it right. The satellite closest to the KSC is connected to it by an omnidirectional antenna, then has directed antennas to the two other satellites. Those two are also connected to each other, but mainly just so it looks awesome in the map screen. Each has an unused dish on the top for actual connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question comes when I want control elsewhere. Let\u0027s say I build another network around the mun, is there some way to make the closest satellites connect automatically? Or if I want 24/7 coverage, do I need an antenna from all my earth ones always pointed at the mun and an antenna from all my mun ones always pointed at the earth?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T05:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use omnidirectional antenna for the whole \u0022Automatic connection thing\u0022 and only use dishes for munar communications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PK6F9on.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PK6F9on.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it a lot easier to work with orbits much lower than geostat so I can simply use the 3Mm omni antenna to connect sats to one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you have 3 geostationary sats with dishes and you want a permanent link with the mun, you\u0027ll only need to point 2 at the mun.

Then, to space them exactly 90 degrees apart (regardless of orbit altitude), modify your vessel\u0027s orbit so that its period is now a fourth longer. For example, if your orbital period is four hours (which incidentally would be the orbital period of the final satellites), increase your orbit so that it is now 4 \u002B 4/4 = 5 hours. Then, go around your orbit, and whenever you come to periapsis, you release one of the satellites. Go around once more, which takes you 5 hours, and the last satellite will be ahead 90 degrees, which is what you want. Release another satellite. And so on until all are released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T12:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor timing single satellite launches into synchronous orbits, I used a Hohmann transfer from a mid orbit point. The detail on the target apoapsis includes the time it will reach that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei.e. I was launching three satellites and used an orbit (iirc, it was ~ 500 km) which would result in reaching the apoapsis 2 hours after the insertion burn. Timing the burn for the second and third satellites to coincide with the target satellite crossing the intended apoapsis allowed a fairly accurate placement. (Each satellite wound up about 2 hours behind the target satellite.) For four satellites, you would want to find a mid orbit that would give you a 1.5 hour travel time. Use the first satellite launch to step up your orbit until you find an insertion orbit that allows a 1.5 hour travel time from burn to apo. Set up subsequent transfer burns from this altitude and use the previously placed satellites as targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This was one of the more fulfilling missions I accomplished.
