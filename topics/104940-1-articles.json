Disabling \u0022hibernate\u0022/\u0022fast boot\u0022 (which, despite the claims, is pointless) removes this issue... but ntfs-3g (the linux ntfs driver) should stop you if you\u0027re doing this.\n\nScrewing with the EFI partition in linux CAN make the partition unreadable from anything but linux. I confirmed this across several independent platforms that gParted does some screwed up thing with fat32. I never tested it with mkfs.vfat so I don\u0027t know if it is unique to gParted or linux in general.\n\nOf course, most linux installations will install their own bootmanager, which, if it doesn\u0027t install right will not recognize the windows efi. Removing this is likely to cause more problems and hence you end up in what I suspect is safemode.\n\nI personally, would find out what went wrong before just reinstalling everything; \n\n\\*can you screw up your system worse? The method above SHOULD just add entries into the efi-boot list; \u0022if you know what you\u0027re doing\u0022 you can check things out and see if everything is all right with the partitions with diskpart (look, don\u0027t delete or modify)\n\nBut.... yeah.... don\u0027t do anything other than what was specified about the bootmanager because if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing and aren\u0027t prepared to fix worse problems.... I mean, if you did screw up the efi partition (they really make them far too big, 64MB is plenty) then it will need to be reformatted, but things can go very south very fast if you lose access to safemode.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**And no that isnt the safemode screen.
