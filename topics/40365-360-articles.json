You missed a bit. IIRC 1 MW = 1 MJ/sec, essentially 1000 EC/sec. Many of the larger fusion reactor require a decent chunk of MW to heat plasma or run the laser. The exact numbers can be found in the.part details section of the wiki...and probably also in-game in the VAB/SPH tooltips. In most vases, initial power up of the reactor only requires a second or less of the energy required to run the laser/heat plasma. It\u0027s always a good idea to ensure you can power that for at least one second. I also have a backup power supply in the form of a capacitor from Near Future Propulsion in the.event I run out of EC. The 12k battery pack is also useful... Might also be worthwhile having a small fission reactor to generate some MJ for starting the fusion. It does not need to be powerful enough to continuously run the fusion as the two generators you\u0027ll have (one for the fission, one for the fusion) should have enough MJ storage to jumpstart the fusion.when filled enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artforz","CreatedById":108793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T13:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can actually calculate how many EC you need for guaranteed startup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need enough EC to run the laser/field for 0.04 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 3.75m tokamak running D/T needs 184.69MW (even says so in the tooltip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E184.69MW * 0.04s = 7.3876MJ\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1EC = 1kJ, so you need at least 7387.6 EC on the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt *may* work with half that, but that is in \u0022generator has to tick before reactor\u0022 territory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T13:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce again I truly thank you for taking the time to look into this.

Can you describe how this on startup stuff works and where it can be found in the logs. I can swear I searched the log txt file and turned on f2 and did a f12 debug thing but there is so much crap that flies by and off screen that you can\u0027t possibly catch anything useful unless you already know exactly what you are looking for.

It turns out for the two ship designs that are working that is the parts setup I had. But honestly it was by shear dumb *** luck because the requirements are no where to be found other then the two quotes I pulled from the wiki which clearly imply 1MJ is all that is required to start the damn reactor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even did the kinda flaky math when I rebuilt the new ship and was thinking (1MJ to start the reactor, 1MJ for the computer core)x2 is 4MJ == 4000Ec. Bingo I just reduce the weight of my ship and still have two times the power I need to start the reactor and run the computer core long enough for the generator to kick in. Well 48 sleepless hours and just seconds from beating the bejesus out of my computer with a baseball bat later I find 7200Ec is enough. What is to say the next ship will need more?
