I have to invert the controls but aside from that every thing works great in external view, but when I switch to internal view the controls are inverted.\u00A0If I turn off invert controls in the settings, internal view works but the external view is inverted. I looked around in the settings some and I don\u0027t see a separate setting for internal view camera controls. Is there any way for me to make it so both cameras are the same?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joghert","CreatedById":176262,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-25T23:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside view is 3rd person view and inside is 1st person view, so technically the situation you describe seems correct (and is the same with mouse if I remember correctly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
