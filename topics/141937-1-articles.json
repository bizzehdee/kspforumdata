That kind of horserace would create lots of attention. People would compete for it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a lot of people here have similar sentiments, but let\u0027s not forget that space prizes have a spotty history- Bigelow\u0027s Space Crew Transportation prize fell flat, the Google Lunar X-Prize has constantly been delayed, and a similar prize is unlikely to be repeated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, a more \u0022CCdev\u0022 solution is probably better (Bezos apparently didn\u0027t like it tho, they felt NASA had too much involvement in it), with there being less of a prize, than a contract for spacecraft based off that design. This would likely limit that program to Orbiters (and possibly asteroid sample return missions/ asteroid probes in general, since asteroids and comets have huge amounts of variety, and a similar design can be used for each.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore specialized things like Mars Sample Return, and rovers could then instead be placed into NASA\u0027s Discovery, New Frontiers, and Flagship Programs- thus, allowing for more \u0027experimental\u0027 missions in those programs that can\u0027t use a common design, and putting less pressure on (esp. Discovery Program).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, only \u0022big\u0022 companies like LockMart, OrbitalATK, SpaceX, etc. would be able to compete, and similar things, like Mariner, using the same baseline design, were a success (though did it actually save $$$?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly problem is Mars Sample Return ends up in the Flagship Program anyways. Probably not a huge deal, considering it\u0027s nearly a HUGE NASA priority (right next to Titan/Enceledus, and Uranus) and we already have the caching rover in development, and the orbiter being pitched to Congress. The pickup rover can be derived off MER, and a Pheonix-based lander carrying a rocket to rendezvous with the orbiter. \u003Cstrong\u003EThat section only may just fit in the New Frontiers budget.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conjunction with large prizes, Bezos suggested NASA also pursue ambitious technology development efforts. \u201CI would also advise that NASA needs to go after gigantic, hard technology goals,\u201D he said, that would be too difficult for private industry to do on its own.

Space tourism can work, and it is a little. Satellites at this point are also useful, but the market isn\u0027t growing fast enough to grow the space industry. Once it becomes a fully-fledged industry, it will quickly become much cheaper. Now, the problem is to create demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T08:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222634244\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141937\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466121112\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 06/17/2016 at 0:51 AM, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I think hypersonic planes is a terrible NASA goal, if we recall it was Britian and France that pushed the Concorde, I think that hypersonic woukd fair wirse than Concorde.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little orthogonal to the thread topic, but it should be pointed out that Concorde begat Airbus in a very real sense ( technology as well as politics ). In American terms it\u0027d be more like Boeing and Bombardier collaborating with respective government backing than a NASA-lead project, though. Tangible commercial product doesn\u0027t seem like NASA\u0027s thing. Researching large hypersonic airframes in general does sound fruitful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
