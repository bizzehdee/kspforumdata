Took me hundreds of attempts to get two pieces of my space station to finally meet up!\n\nI\u0027ve been planning a few attempts at some of the challenges, so I will probably be posting a few logs about them.\n\nThank you for your time, and I\u0027ll hopefully see you around the forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:27:44Z","Content":"Congratulations on your first station!
