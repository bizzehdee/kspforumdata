Funding is used to launch craft to attempt the mission. Once the mission is completed any left-over funding is released to the general fund which can be used for mission-less flight or overflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA proposal is a series of objectives that comprise a contract. The player decides what objectives each mission should try to attain, with objectives available for each SOI. For instance, \u0022Place orbiter around Duna\u0022 could be an objective as could something as simple as \u0022Perform a suborbital Kerbin flight\u0022. Although a contract could have many stacking objectives care would have to be taken to prevent gaming the system; orbiting Kerbin should be assumed when the overall objective is landing on Eeloo. This could be handled by specific objectives preventing lesser objectives from being added. This system would allow the player to define missions as simple as a Mun landing or as complex as a grand tour of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce all of the objectives are chosen and the proposal created it would be submitted for approval. Approval should be based on past performance, perhaps with the dev-mentioned reputation stat. You would gain rep by completing contracts and certain objectives should have no rep requirement in order to allow the player to build it back up (or maybe have a rep requirement very low that would still allow for end-game failure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn approved contract would have a budget which would be used to complete the mission. This budget would be based on the player\u0027s rep and the planned objectives, and the calculation would be as complex as required. It probably wouldn\u0027t be an easy task to balance such a system. Either way, any craft built to complete the objectives (you would specify this before launch/flight) would be bought using the budget for the contract. Once the objectives were completed any left-over money would be added to the player\u0027s general budget, which could be used for personal projects, maintenance, philantropy, hiring Kerbals, whatever. Partial completion should also have some rewards, especially early on. Repeating objectives from past contracts should have diminishing returns; this might require other methods for the player to gain money and rep in order to continue playing past a certain point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERep, and possibly money, should also be rewarded for achievements outside of contract play. For instance, if the player manages to land on Ike during their first launch, without even bothering to create a proposal (honestly, who\u0027s going to fund a first launch to Ike?), that should count for something within the contract system. It should also be included in the calculations for diminishing returns on future proposals. Players would naturally start a career mode game with a modicum of funds in their general budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T09:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s surprising to hear that from you, as I though you didn\u0027t want to be \u0022obligated\u0022 to justify yourself with past performance/reputation to get the funding you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to give you a constructive analysis : I liked the idea at first.

Scale the funding for a objective downwards the further its reputation is from the player\u0027s current reputation. This means that you can propose a mission consisting of achieving Kerbin orbit and Eve sample return for your first mission. The Kerbin orbit would receive a high level of funding due to having a high confidence in success, whereas the Eve sample return would be considered impossible at this level and be given almost none. Achieving the objective should give a cash reward. The funding and the reward should come from the same pool. For example, if you propose a Kerbin orbit, 75% of the pool could be offered as funding, with the remaining 25% on successful completion. A high confidence level reduces the reward offered because of the perceived simplicity in achieving the task.

I\u0027d like to see a more flexible balance system used for it: Rank each objective with an appropriate reputation, giving a low ranking to more simple manoeuvres such as achieving Kerbin orbit and a high reputation to more difficult ones such as Eve sample return. Scale the funding for a objective downwards the further its reputation is from the player\u0027s current reputation. This means that you can propose a mission consisting of achieving Kerbin orbit and Eve sample return for your first mission. The Kerbin orbit would receive a high level of funding due to having a high confidence in success, whereas the Eve sample return would be considered impossible at this level and be given almost none. Achieving the objective should give a cash reward. The funding and the reward should come from the same pool. For example, if you propose a Kerbin orbit, 75% of the pool could be offered as funding, with the remaining 25% on successful completion. A high confidence level reduces the reward offered because of the perceived simplicity in achieving the task. The pool would be regenerated with diminishing returns after being exhausted.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a great balancing idea.
