Since mods interact differently with eachother, the element of randomness is a factor, true, but I just wanted to make sure that time spent building a base that could potentially blow up as a result of bad juju between old KAS and other mods might not be better spent doing other things while waiting for the official update. I understand the sensitivity of folks on behalf of the modders. I even chided someone else in another thread for another mod about asking about updates.
