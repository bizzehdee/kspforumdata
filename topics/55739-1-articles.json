I have probably driven my rover about 15% of the time I am in KSP, so I have covered hundreds of kilometers all around the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I am on a body, I would like a few more things that would aid me in navigation and site selection. Here is what I would like to suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like the rovers to leave persistent tracks. These tracks serve the same purpose as on earth. They show you where you\u0027ve been, the exact route you took, and how to get back the same way you came. (Ever drive around the tunnels of Moho? Its a tough place to find a clear way to drive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had one hell of a time on Tylo, trying to drive my rover to where my launch vehicle was. I would look at map mode and determine that I need to travel in a certain direction. But when you go to the planet surface view, the orientation does not seem to be the same, and you can end up driving a long ways in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads into two other suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy in the world would the devs make the text of a far off ship on the surface of Tylo have nearly the same color as the background? Gray/white text on a gray surface makes it impossible to navigate this way. I have been asking since 0.20 to put these text notes in a \u0022cartoon bubble\u0022 that has its own background rendering the text visible no matter what the surface/background color is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would like a F key to turn on and off a surface grid showing lines of Lat \u0026amp; Lon as well as the equator. I should be able to do this from space and while on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I would like a way to easily determine the rotation of any given body. For the grid I suggested above, it could just be little arrowhead tick marks on the equator. When I am coming into a SOI, I would like the predicted orbital path to show me somehow whether I am in a prograde orbit or a retrograde orbit - perhaps just by using two different colors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if any of this has been discussed before.

I should be able to see the target name (Tylo ascent vehicle) and the distance to it while on the ground, but it is invisible to my eyes with the lack of contrast compared to the surface background. IMHO they did a lot of great visuals throughout the game, and have completely ignored this problem that others have also brought up. If they can do great graphics in most areas of the game, they should also be able to do it in this one area (text).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the Nav-ball for a second. The delta-v remaining to be burned has the cartoon bubble behind it and it is ALWAYS legible. But just below that is the time to burn and it is not in a cartoon bubble. This is totally inconsistent and easy enough to fix. The same bubble should be used throughout the game where text is used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even if the text contrast issue is finally addressed, I still think the nav-grid and rover tracks would be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T19:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree a 2D map option would be good to have for planes and rovers.
