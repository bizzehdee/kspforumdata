I was wasteful on my landing, so I ran out of fuel returning to Kerbin. No problem! At my AP, I did an EVA and had Bill Kerman push retrograde until I got a 20k PE!

Have you tried that yet? Also, if you have probe cores and solar panels, you can send one-way missions on fly-bys of the sun and other planets. And if you have parachutes and landing legs as well, you can send probes to land on the other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T03:09:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Vanamonde said.
