Concerning my earlier post I was less interested in the actual maneuvers of the Space Shuttle per se than I am in the simple application of kinematics to a recreated shuttle in KSP, specifically the cant of the SSMEs, which is what the original poster was talking about. As I mentioned earlier, there is no \u0022max q\u0022, nor tracking stations in KSP, so here the main practical reasons for the Shuttle roll program don\u0027t really apply. Pitching is an angular displacement, torque is a moment of force, I didn\u0027t confuse these terms, but if you read it that I way I apologize. Reading back I agree, the post was rather jumbled. The negative, positive torque distinction only refers to the directions of the vectors, although I notice now that by the normal convention the directions I gave earlier were backwards. IRC the SSME\u0027s produce much less thrust than the SRB\u0027s so the gimballing of the SRB\u0027s are what do most of the steering until separation. Also I realize that the torque caused by gravity is small for the shuttle, still I think it is an interesting consideration.
