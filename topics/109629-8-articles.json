The Center of lift of the craft file is of to the left. This is why you need a lot of roll and yaw input during launch (or SAS does).

When this occurs with the Shuttle, the camera seems to detach itself from the Shuttle and the Shuttle begins to roll and yaw out of control slowly. The problem gets progressively worse each time the launch clamps are spawn, to the point where the Shuttle spins itself out of control and with no possibility for recovery.
