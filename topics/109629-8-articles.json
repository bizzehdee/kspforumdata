I don\u0027t know if you fly IVA but when you do you sure must agree that even the stock pits look way, way better.\n\nAbout the spin. I am onto something. The Center of lift of the craft file is of to the left. This is why you need a lot of roll and yaw input during launch (or SAS does). The reason for this is the origing of the left control surface is off. You can see this in the config, it needs different node coordinates. I am working on fixing this right now. There also seems to be the same problem with the tail piece. Im going to take a look at this next."},{"CreatedByName":"cheech420now","CreatedById":32124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T08:02:05Z","Content":"Well i cant argue with that! lol Also i agree with your findings with the CoL being off center."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T09:15:35Z","Content":"@Jest. thanks HEAPS. your officially part of the DEV team!\n\nalthough it wont be applied to this exciting new work I have been doing:\n\none piece shuttle coming together complete with functioning and built in landing gear:\n\n![v0IrtM3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v0IrtM3.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nalso with the cords, notice one has nodes all at zero and the other to specific numbers...

The model origing is off indeed so they offsetted the placement node. I countered this with the CoM and CoL offset.\n\nThe shuttle still rolls and yaws during launch so it seems the launch vehicle has some drag that makes it rotate."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:45:04Z","Content":"@jeast. would you say that because the tank is heavy and wings lift, the tank wants to roll under and the wings lift the orbiter around and above the tank.\n\nyou could set the COM closer to the orbiter. but the direction of thrust may pitch it around....\n\nor put a big amount of reaction wheel power in the tank\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nUpdate: cargobay doors now open one at a time..."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:28:05Z","Content":"No I dont think so. When launching you have to use minor roll and yaw to keep the shuttle going straight. You can see it in the down left corner when SAS is engaged. Not a real problem as long as you use SAS but without it or when flying with a joystick the launch itself is pretty hard.\n\nIm still working on the configs to get the reentry right. I think it has to do with the mass/drag relation. Probably that of the wings. Ill keep you posted. Maybe we have to end up increasing the reaction wheel torque."},{"CreatedByName":"Drj3199","CreatedById":143663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:57:03Z","Content":"This is all grown up talk to me.

The ascent goes normally until about 8000 meters. Around that time, the highly annoying and sometimes destructive bug occurs where the launch clamps you used (stock or FASA) are spawned and released behind you. When this occurs with the Shuttle, the camera seems to detach itself from the Shuttle and the Shuttle begins to roll and yaw out of control slowly. The problem gets progressively worse each time the launch clamps are spawn, to the point where the Shuttle spins itself out of control and with no possibility for recovery. I\u0027m not sure why this happens and if this happens to anyone else. I use the stock aerodynamics.

Remove them from your shuttle in the VAB. Then save, exit, and remove the FASA folder from gamedata in your ksp directory. See if that fixes it. If not then try rebuild your ship instead of loading it in the VAB. Also this has happened in a clean install but ive only experienced it with fasa clamps\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n@jeast. The mass drag issue could be part of it. I think I did raise it a lol in the rear to keep the front facing forward. or else its the wings trying to gwt above COM or the thrust pitches it a bit and it pivots on a diagonal angale.\n\nI have the wheel release today and im hoping also for the one piece orbiter too.
