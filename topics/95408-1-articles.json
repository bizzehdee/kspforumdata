I am doing the training mission \u0022To the mun, Part 1\u0022 but I am unable to complete as my thrusters stop working once I am in Mun orbit and I can\u0027t obtain a circular orbit. I assume I have not run out of fuel (still says there is fuel on the top right drop-down menu, in the cornor). Am I missing something here? This was really frustrating me last night, as the training text wasn\u0027t helping me at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.

What the resource tab is showing you is the TOTAL on board your craft. If you are out of fuel in that stage, then your outa gas buddy. Its entirely possible your trans-munar stage has run out of fuel. My advice then is tap the lander fuel a bit and do a direct de-orbit at apoapsis. Be careful though that your orbit isn\u0027t too eliptical, otherwise you\u0027ll have to burn so much fuel on landing you may not have enough for a return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gman4499","CreatedById":134290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can ditto that.
