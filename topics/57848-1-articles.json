I\u0027ve used GIMP for years, so no issue there, but what I\u0027m running into is the unwrap is not coming out scaled. The height of a cylinder is stretched, which then skews text/etc added as part of the .PNG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas how to force Blender to keep the UV unwrap scaled relative to the part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T08:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the Unwrap methods have a \u0022Correct Aspect\u0022 toggle once you select them, using that and the \u0022fill\u0022 toggles determines how the unwrapped islands appear in the grid. If you start scaling things make sure you are scaling both axis at once\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarge18","CreatedById":95408,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T15:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh hah! Thank you, Tiberion. I knew there was some small nugget I was missing in this process. My frustration had been that my first attempt had unwrapped correctly, but had fallen prey to the differing orientation when brought into Unity, which I figured out and corrected. I log my steps, and although I\u0027d repeated the same things, had come into the frustration of the unwrap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thank you. Sometimes it\u0027s hard to see the forest for the trees, and that tidbit makes the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJed\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
