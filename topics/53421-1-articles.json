You can have flame graphics touching parts provided the exact centerline of the exhaust stream doesn\u0027t impinge. NOTE: test this before flying it; it\u0027s not always the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: In real life, heat transfers by 3 processes: conduction, convention, and radiation. Radiation is the primary means of heating up the surrounding area--it\u0027s why standing next to a campfire warms you up. KSP, however, only models conduction, so the only things to feel heat in KSP are those parts directly attached to the heat source. Thus, in real life, close-in radial engines would radiate beaucoup heat into the adjacent tank wall, but you don\u0027t have to worry about this in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
