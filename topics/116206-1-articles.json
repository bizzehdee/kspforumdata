For example, even the very first survey missions you ever get will sometimes ask you to produce a crew report in flight over one waypoint and then an EVA report while landed at a different, nearby waypoint. It\u0027s the same concept: not every waypoint has the same task, or requires the same experiment. The waypoint icons are intentionally different to better help identify which experiment you need to take where."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T11:25:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The waypoint icons are intentionally different to better help identify which experiment you need to take where.\n\nBut they could be a little more obvious, in a lot of cases. I don\u0027t know what the above icons mean, for example. And for some reason I can never get straight in my mind if the boot print is an EVA report on the surface or a surface sample. And he Gravity reading always makes me think it wants me to take the reading below it.\n\nIn any case I think this is a good example of KSP not giving enough information to the player.

So It\u0027s a different icon... what does each icon mean? No idea, and I haven\u0027t seen any kind of \u0022guide\u0022 to explain it to me.\n\nThis game desperately needs a manual.
