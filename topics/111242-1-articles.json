And better one in the future.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T13:54:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lime**"},{"CreatedByName":"BriXman","CreatedById":89391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:36:59Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a big fan of rockets (I like planes more, so if I want a challenge in space I use SSTOs), but I might acctually try this out.
