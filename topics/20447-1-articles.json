You could also probably gain some efficiency replacing the LVs in the 4th stage for aerospikes ( \u002B/- same weight, more thrust and better fuel efficiency ( same for the 1st stage small LVs... with the add that aerospikes work better in dense atmospheres than LVs ). But the general staging is quite ok and it shows quite a bunch of work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the video ... well you lost a LOT of fuel by going straight up to the 200 km. Injection burns, as a matter of principle , should always be done in the lowest orbit possible, due to the Oberth effect ( I know that controlling a mammoth of that size in the atmosphere is hard, but starting to turn at 10-15 km would had saved you a lot of fuel ). And your landing on the Mun, as you say yourself , was far from optimal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Anyway, you landed in one piece and that is all it counts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
