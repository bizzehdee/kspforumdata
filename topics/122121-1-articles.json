If the game insists on putting it there, it must be a reasonable setting, no? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it work to have specialized crafts? A few stock crafts which are good designs for some use case, and their descriptions clearly state what they are good at. But an average player can still do better because most of his use cases ask for something different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
