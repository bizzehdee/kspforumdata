Have had a blast (pun not intended) so far!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I read/watched any \u0022getting started\u0022 things and after a few test-flights, I managed to successfully send a Kerbal into orbit (you -don\u0027t- want to see the rocket that did it! I hadn\u0027t yet realised what the struts were for and the sticky-taped together contraption was anything but stable; in fact, the orbit ended up being almost polar!) - but without enough fuel to deorbit. Luckily just enough to dip his trajectory into the very upper reaches of the atmosphere though! 20 odd orbits later he was safely home. Or at least, back on Kerbin. Home was half a planet away as he landed quite close to the north pole..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then spent a bit of time watching Scott Manley\u0027s very excellent \u0022Intro to Career Mode\u0022 videos (and am now thoroughly enjoying his \u0022Interstellar Quest\u0022 series) and am better for it. Even to the point of getting pen-and-paper out to calculate required d-v, and engineering rockets, instead of just sticking enough fuel-tanks and solid-rocket boosters on until it makes it to something resembling orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately that was too late for poor old Jebediah, who I had managed to get safely onto Mun in the meantime. Unfortunately again, without enough fuel left for the return journey. Needless to say, he needed a rescue ship, which I built and managed to get within a couple of km of his landing site. After a long munar trudge, he\u0027s safely back home. With all the samples to boot! What a trooper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward how the adventures progress!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Micha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. Does anybody know of a mod to log all flights? I\u0027d love a way to keep a history of every single launch with all the relevant statistics, similar to what is shown on the F3 screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T17:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome from due South of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the \u0027breadcrumbs\u0027 mod will record your flight details for you, \u0027Telemachus\u0027 might also be of interest. While you\u0027re at it put away the pen and paper - unless you love them - and install KER, VOID or MJ, which are informational mods that will tell you your deltaV as you make changes in the VAB/SPH, and a whole host of other information that isn\u0027t displayed by stock KSP. Another pair of mods that make docking much easier - and you seem to be doing everything else already - are Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator or the more-minimalist NavballDockingAlignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version is coming out \u0022Soon\u0022, with big changes to career mode, so you might want to just practice in sandbox for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T21:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready using KER - it\u0027s essential for building, and very useful in-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions though; I\u0027ll check \u0022breadcrumbs\u0022 out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to a more balanced career mode. Doesn\u0027t seem to make so much sense to unlock probe tech so much later than manned (Kerballed?) flight. Especially with the reduced science when transmitting. Would make more sense (IMHO) to send probes first, transmitting what they find, then either a sample-return mission, and finally a Kerbal for eyeballs-on-ground.
