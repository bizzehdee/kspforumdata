This will make piloting the plane very difficult in space. Is it possible to specify a prograde direction of a command pod part whilst still keeping the geometry aligned to global axes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure. Would rotating the geometry slightly away from global axis not be an option? You\u0027d just need to define the attach node with it properly. The part would probably spawn slightly rotated in SPH but would attach straight to other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that would be the best way to do that. Have your geometry slightly rotated, and define the attach node\u0027s vector such that things will still stick on it \u0022straight\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatVacuum","CreatedById":72754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T22:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkylon has an orbital maneouvering system seperate from the Sabre engines that it would be using for most of it\u0027s time in space. If those align better with the nose direction then I don\u0027 t think you have a big problem with the Sabre thrust being slightly skewed. Of course since the OMS and Sabres don\u0027t align that means one or the other would always be a problem. Other than putting in two differently aligned probe bodies I don\u0027t see how to fix this and that doesn\u0027t seem ideal either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T13:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EatVacuum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T21:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo worries, I\u0027ve already modelled two separate cores.
