If you cant move the payload you can still move the adv canards, preferrably below the center of mass.\n\nAlso since the center of mass is above the vector of thrust this also produces back flip torque, you could try angling the connectors carrying the outer nacelles so that the outer nacelles are raised up and are closer to the center of mass, that should reduce the torque but the bottom nacelle will still produce some."}]}
