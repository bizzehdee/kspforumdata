I came up with one working approach, and then figured out there may be another way. Both return almost the same results. ***ALMOST*** ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nm - some mass,\n\nv(t) velocity change after t-seconds burn,\n\nVe - exhaust velocity,\n\nmDot - fuel-mass used per second,\n\nm0 - total mass at t=0\n\nF - force,\n\na - acceleration\n\nThe naive approach would be by a\\*t=v, where a is assumed to be constant. So this doesn\u0027t work obviously.\n\nI\u0027d really like to use LATEX or something similar here, but i don\u0027t think this forum allows it.\n\nI started with **F=m(t)\\*a(t)**. Note that nor m(t) or a(t) are constant. I rearranged it to be:\n\n**a(t) = F/m(t)**\n\nI replace m(t), knowing that m(t)=m0-mDot\\*t. mDot is the mass-loss per second, which is equal to = F/Ve. Ve is the exaust-velocity.\n\nSo i end up with: **a(t) = F / (m0-t\\*F/Ve)**\n\nNow all i need to do to figure out how much the *velocity has increased* in t seconds is to calculate the integral (lower bound 0, upper t) of this function with regards to t.\n\nSo: **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v(t) =** **\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C2\u00AB****a(t) dt** (upper bound is t, lower bound is 0),\n\nwhich turns out to be (i wont bother typing the hole calculation out, will only lead to a mess without more tools to write proper equations):\n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC** **v(t) = Ve\\*ln( (m0\\*Ve) / (m0\\*Ve - F\\*t) ),** where ln is the natural logarithm.\n\nThis is all fine and works, BUT:\n\nI thought \u0022*Why don\u0027t you just calculate the momentum the engine developes in t seconds and apply it to the craft?*\u0022 Sure, why not? The \u0022force\u0022 is just momentum per second for an engine.\n\nSo, gain in momentum: F\\*t, change in velocity: **F\\*t/(m0-t\\*F/Ve)** . Looks much easier.\n\nI tried it out, difference is neglitible. Plottet both functions to compare, resulst are almost the same (but get bigger for large values of t). But for low values... difference is neglitible.\n\n(first approach returns larger values for positive values of t than the second approach)\n\nWhat do you guys think? I think the problem with the second approach is that it doesn\u0027t take into account that momentum is transferred gradually, which actually is the case, but how is this a problem? I\u0027m almost certain it is because momentum is, like velocity, relative. Which would mean that from an inertial frame where the observer is in the middle and rests, the exhaust gasses blown out earlier have a higher momentum than those which where blown out later. It would be the other way round for the rocket, resulting in a higher change in velocity compared to the second approach (which is actually the case).\n\nAny thoughts or ideas, or found an error?
