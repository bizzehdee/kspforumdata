My idea was to put a station with several Jumbo-64s in orbit so I could launch lighter vehicles, have them dock with the fuel tanks, undock the tanks from the station and then use that to fuel the journey. It\u0027d also require replacement tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to tell me that my idea is incredibly stupid and pointless and overly ambitious.

Altogether, it brings 70.9t to a 75km orbit. But the thing is that with lighter payloads, a heavy launcher can be extremely overshoot and spam the part count for nothing. So the second one is designed to take lighter 20t payloads to orbit with it\u0027s tug, for a total of 36.8t to a 75km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to, I can give you a download link.
