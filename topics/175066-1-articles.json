I\u0027ve built my lander along with a rover to take \u0027ole Jebs around the surface, but I\u0027ve run into a problem. While testing my lander/rover combo on Kerbin, everything works great with a simple booster (i.e. one that gets me just high enough to test parachutes, etc.), but when I started doing full-up tests with the booster that\u0027ll take me to orbit, all hell broke loose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rover is supposed to split off the main lander, and parachute down by itself at ~4m/s. This works perfectly with a simple booster, the rover floats down at ~4m/s for a soft landing. But with the complex booster, when the rover lands, it bounces all over the place breaking itself apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander works perfectly, with the simple booster. But with the complex booster, all the lander legs explode when I touch down, sometimes taking the rest of the lander with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing at all changed with the rover or lander - the only thing different from one test to another was the size/complexity of the booster strapped to the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pulling my hair out over this one! been trying for two days to get it to work, if I can\u0027t, I\u0027m limited to really simple designs that barely get me past Minmus...
