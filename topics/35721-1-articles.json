I\u0027ve kind of been doing stuff I probably shouldn\u0027t be doing with Hyper Edit, and I was going at speeds so high in my spacecraft that I actually ended up reaching the Ps and eventually 16309E before my game crashed. But before it crashed, as my ship was cruising along I started to hear this high pitched creepy beeping sound that got faster and faster very quickly and constantly changed tones. This is not a complaint, I was just wondering, was that programed into the game to tell people to back the !@#$ off if they screwed around too much, or am I breaking the game? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T08:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are either making up a story or you broke your game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfield","CreatedById":66177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T08:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not broken...yet...I tried closing it and opening it again and it all works fine, though I\u0027m sure trying it again would be a bad idea.
