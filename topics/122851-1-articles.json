For a short duration mission like this, a full scale farming operation is a massive overkill, since my Hermes had supplies for several decades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tricky part seemed to be getting the tree important parts (Hab, DAV and a rover there at the same time) landed at the same place and time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of regret not getting more images of the DAV when it was landed, but it\u0027s in the foreground of the surface pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hermes interplanetary ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Surface Hab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Manually assembled external solar array\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Duna Ascent Vehicle, the return ticket to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mapping and coms probes x2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it more challenging, I\u0027ve launched them all in one vehicle, and detached them as I went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn reflection I was almost 1500 DV remaining when I returned to Kerbin, so I may have been able to skip some of the drop tanks in the transit vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rAtOd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
