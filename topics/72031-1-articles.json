Hoping and praying to Sunstar and Terra that the main engine won\u0027t have a failure, like in Bob Kerman\u0027s suborbital flight.

The first signals from Prometheus kicked to a start, and the individuals at mission control started getting the first scientific signals and data from Prometheus. The Kerbals that watched the launch, were having a feast, inviting their neighbors over, and all that jazz. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/241rqya.png\u0022 alt=\u0022241rqya.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew, that took me a long time to write!
