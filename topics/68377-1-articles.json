Inside is one Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only chance of a rescue would be to either rendezvous with it and pass the Kerbal over into a spare pod or to use the Advanced Grabbing Unit. Obviously the latter is the more appropriate given the recent update and its introduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0027s only a to-orbit-and-back mission I figured I\u0027d use a 1m craft, and make use of the Mk1 Lander Can because the flat top (if you don\u0027t know the name, it\u0027s the 1m octagonal grey thing) is a nice place to put the AGU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI threw something together fairly quickly, put it on the pad and warped forward a couple of hours to give the orbit of the stranded Kerbal time to pass over KSC; I could then launch northwest and save on a plane change later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter warping something weird happened. I fired up the engines and the rocket disintegrated for no apparent reason, leaving only the Lander Can suspended about 40 metres above the launchpad. This can be reproduced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PGNWn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of this I decided to forgo the waiting and do the plane change in orbit. I launched into a west-facing equatorial orbit and warped forward to circularize. When the timewarp stopped, a similar thing to what happened in the first picture in the imgur album happened; the pod remained stationary and the rest of the rocket bent round it - The second stage 3.75m tank ended up destroying the pod as it collided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter modifying the rocket to use the mk1 pod (black circular thing) instead this does not happen, and I can\u0027t reproduce it with any other pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mod part involved is the Kerbal Engineering System \u0026amp; Flight Engineer, but the issue still happens with that removed and I\u0027ve had that on every rocket I\u0027ve launched since I downloaded .23.5 on release day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn summary: If I warp with a Mk1 Lander Can attached to my rocket, it appears to fix in position and stay there.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s going on?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
