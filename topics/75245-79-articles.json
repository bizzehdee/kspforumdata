Would it be possible to dis-able fast switching vessels if a vessel is disconnected? Just a rough idea. I\u0027m thinking about how if you are trying to dock, you are probably on the radio back and forth between vessels during the manoeuvres. We don\u0027t have to do that at all, but we can jump from one ship to the other instantly. You should still be able to assume control of the other vessel via the tracking station, but if it cannot cannot talk to anyone, then you have to get into the tracking station view view the space centre to fly it, motivating people to stay connected while performing docking manoeuvres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I think might be a challenge (I\u0027m no a programmers, so this is a wild guess) is when there are two vessels that can be connected but there is no connection to the KSC or a remote station or what ever.
