Not even all standard parts report charge use correctly - reaction wheels for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could add more but 2) is the big showstopper really.

I\u0027m having to produce 4 different linked versions of my dll just to cope with a \u0027normal\u0027 set of mods, can you see MJ wanting to do that? I have the MJ source and I could splice the Fusebox functionality in but it\u0027d be a right swine to maintain.
