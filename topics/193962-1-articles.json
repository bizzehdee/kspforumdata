and the parts lacked any gravitational response and just drifted off into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - researching, I determined the problem was likely focused on the MPL, and at first I was trying to analyze it to figure out what went wrong - but then ended up scrapping the whole thing and building a new MPL\u0026amp; lander from scratch.\u00A0 The problem did not repeat itself, and I have a functioning MPL on the Mun.\u00A0 (Again, this thread started out with me asking for strategies to avoid the problem in the future).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night, I discovered there\u0027s still a problem with the Klaw.\u00A0 Upon releasing it from the attached ship, the robotic arm it is attached to breaks off... and several parts break off the ship it had been attached to.\u00A0 So there\u0027s still something weird going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRover has the Klaw on a robotic piece (an arm made from hinges and a telescoping bar).\u00A0 Works fine and will attach.\u00A0 Once attached, I can transfer fuel.\u00A0 Trying to release is the problem.\u00A0 First go-round (I saved just before attaching the Klaw), releasing the Grabber broke the arm off the rover (klaw and arm floated off into space), and the newly released ship just fell apart into 3 pieces, meanwhile the nearby MPL (Not attached during the klaw use during this save) acted funny; it began sliding down the crater as if the landing gear were on ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reloaded, managed to attach the klaw to a different part (a fuel tank connected to the lander with a radial decoupler), transferred fuel and then detached the fuel tank via the decoupler before releasing the klaw.\u00A0 This time, my lander remained intact\u00A0 -- but the arm still broke off the rover, and again the klaw, arm and attached fuel tank floated up into space... and the MPL decided to start sliding down the hill again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - and now when I try to select the ship again from the space station / tracking station... I get the black loading screen (with the turning doohickey in the lower right of the screen), hear exploding parts... but the lander never loads and I can\u0027t play the game.\u00A0 (It looks like my MPL with crew may have disappeared from the list of selectable craft as well).\u00A0 Oddly I can fly stuff on the far side of the mun - but the two craft I had in the Northwest Crater are unplayable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the problem - the worst problem - is that somehow using the Klaw broke my game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a Win 10 64bit machine, playing a STEAM version of the game (which I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s 64 bit or 32 bit), have 16gb of RAM, a Ryzen 2700x processor, and a\u00A0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAppreciate any help - no mods ever installed (besides the two I bought, Breaking Ground and Making History)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 I\u0027ve played around with the lander and claw from a way previous save.\u00A0 They work fine.\u00A0 I can pick up, move, transfer fuel, drop, re pick up, drop (via both Release and Disarm)\u2026 and cannot recreate the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s some conflict with having 3 ships together on the Northwest crater.\u00A0 Guess I will keep trying to find an unbroken previous save.\u00A0 The glitch has to be in the other two ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-21T00:42:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2020 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by JoeSchmuckatelli\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
