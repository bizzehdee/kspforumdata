I would have liked a small graphic boost before the final release, but the real challenge for SQUAD is to continue expanding, completing and perfecting the Kerbin system. Maybe even grow to new systems, far beyond Kerbol. Because this game actually never ends, only (after literally years of play) suffers the lack of new targets. New adventures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, KSP is not dying at all. Hundreds of features can be added yet.

I used to post alot more when i first got the game, but now, most questions are already answered that i know, theres so many youtube videos, that everything could be accused of being a copy by now. Just become saturated with media, that all that is left is to play the game. Look at the threads, u will not got to space today, and how big they are. May be people buying ksp and playing it, but not on the forums, there is a lack of what to do on the forums, is there a question that has not already been asked yet? I think its just saturation.

Once you grasp the mechanics of landing on the Mun, doing so again is less challenging so you move on to bigger and more complex ideas. Once you conquer those, there\u0027s nothing to do until you come up with yet another idea.

Now that I\u0027ve finished, there\u0027s no further use for that vehicle. Eve is an amazing planet, but let\u0027s face it, it doesn\u0027t even have an anomaly. Other than conquering it\u0027s atmosphere, gravity and in my case, size, there\u0027s no reason to go there again and even less of a reason to go to any one particular place on Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo look at the challenges forum. It\u0027s a collection of ideas to be conquered. Once you accept a challenge and conquer it, there\u0027s no reason to do it again unless you want to improve your performance. And those ideas have restrictions. In it\u0027s present form, KSP is a game of creation. While building a small colony on the Mun is within it\u0027s reach, building a Dyson Sphere is not. Because the game is limited by part count, in-game physics and what your machine can handle, there is a limit to the ideas you can come up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn it\u0027s latest incarnation, career mode did increase KSP\u0027s staying power for a while.

Only one thing keeps veteran KSP players going and that\u0027s their imagination. Once the mechanics are conquered, they have to pretend this or pretend that in order to create a reason for playing KSP. One look at the mission reports forum and you\u0027ll see what it takes to keep playing KSP. While many KSP players have very vivid imaginations, let\u0027s face a fact here.
