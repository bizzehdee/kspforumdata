Nothing particularly noteworthy about that flight; they\u0027ll arrive in the Mun\u0027s SOI in another hour\u0027s flight time. Meantime, Ludine, Pepe and Valberta arrived at the Minmusport space station aboard \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E and transferred to the station\u0027s Mun Buggy for a surface excursion.

The original idea was for \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E to return with its current crew of three as well as Kacella, Diissa and Bob, three Kerbals that were manning the Minmusport station. Six kerbals total...but \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E crew capacity is five. I\u0027ma thinking what will be required is for me to return the crew to Kerbin aboard the Mun Buggy - which can handle six Kerbals, has the necessary delta-V for the journey and automated controls available for a return flight - and then return it to Minmusport later. Minmusport does have a fuel supply available to refuel the buggy once it returns, so the big trick will be figuring out which Kerbal I want to take to bring \u003Cem\u003EStraight Flush\u003C/em\u003E back home.

I want to be able to use the station as a staging point for a final flight into Kerbol\u0027s orbit in order to bring thirteen Kerbals - over 75% of my current KSC staff - to three-star ratings. By my calculations, though, when Necessary Evil and the Mun Buggy return, I\u0027m going to be out of docking berths - unless I run a KIS/KAS spacewalk or two to add another couple of Clamp-O-Trons to the existing station.

I hoped for one more 200 day mission before deorbiting the station, but... well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou all probably noted the service bay, and some of you I understand have already experienced Kraken attacks thanks to it. I\u0027d been fortunate to avoid it so far, though every time I\u0027d focus on the station, I\u0027d notice the service bay start to jostle about as if trying to break free. Opening and closing the service bay seemed to fix it each time. But when I prepared to undock Orbiter 17 from the station, the Kraken had its long-deferred revenge, and the station broke apart. Luckily, experienced scientists Milina and Kaca, as well as rookie pilot Sidcas were already in Orbiter 17\u0027s capsule when the Kraken hit, so all they had to do was undock from what remained of the station and de-orbit safely. But there were still 88 points of data yet to be converted to science still aboard. A true setback for Kerbal science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of KerbalLab also coincided with the decision to end my current batch of Mun and Minmus landings. I\u0027d put Kerbals on both moons 3 times, but it was increasingly clear that the existing spacecraft were not cost effective. Mun 8 was my last \u0022Phase 1\u0022 Mun landing, with Jebidiah finally fulfilling his dream of walking on the Mun\u0027s surface: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p8712Am.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022p8712Am.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Minmus 5 was the last to visit the minty moon.
