This would allow one to land on a significantly sloped surface and correct one\u0027s pitch to point as is deemed appropriate.\n\nThe intent is to assist a situation such as this:\n\n![images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSygR0jj3aezieMaz-0osxfrL3lK3KbFVYFUhh6xrSlS6wk-TzZ](https://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSygR0jj3aezieMaz-0osxfrL3lK3KbFVYFUhh6xrSlS6wk-TzZ)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOops.
