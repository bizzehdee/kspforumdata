The dominant powers are, Junior, Sampa, Xannari, Trainengie, and Vinster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey each claimed a portion of the galaxy. They started with petty attacks, bacon feasts, and gravity messing-around-with. The first major event occurred at the center of the galaxy, where Vinster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s colony, located inside an asteroid, went critical. After much effort, Vinster\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s people scattered around the blast radius and resettled in the void in the middle of the galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESampa and Xannari made a truce, and the galaxy was at peace as they settled into an era of no conflict. It ended as soon as Sampa began raiding small enemy targets that had settled. Then Xannari became suspicious. Xannari stole blueprints for a massive ship. Xannari was nearly arrested by Sampa but Xannari responded with a threat to destroy the flagship of Sampa\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fleet. Xannari escaped. Xannari eventually surrendered and rejoined Sampa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJunior joined Sampa, and they traded technology and formed an alliance. Soon, Xannari began to show odd symptoms, such as speaking of the Great attractor, the most powerful gravitational force known to man, where she had made a colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange things began to happen: The Great Attractor showed signs of meeting the same fate as the center of the galaxy; Junior completed his signature particle shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXannari accuses Vinster of causing the near collapse. From then on, Xannari became a warmonger. The center of the galaxy nearly exploded again, but Junior saved everyone. Junior, while investigating the disturbance, which Sampa later identifies as a wormhole, is ambushed. Junior and the ship barely survive the attack. Xannari snaps at this point and threatens everyone with missiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJunior recovers and Sampa and Xannari break their alliance. Sampa takes aggressive action against Xannari, who armed her missiles. Xannari attempted to assassinate Junior and his planet with an irradiating space ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA massive battle ensues after Junior recovers and saves the fleet from radiation death. The combined forces of Sampa and Junior fought against and eventually imprisoned Xannari. At this point, Junior and Sampa found the Galactic Alliance and make plans to build a central station: the Citadel. This heavily defended station is created and promptly destroyed by an unknown 3rd faction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the Battle for the Citadel, Junior is nearly killed when shot in the back, spending a week recovering. Shortly thereafter, Sampa cracks and sets out on a personal suicide mission to put an end to Xannari\u0027s insolence. Arriving at her base, Sampa wages a brief cyber war with Xannari and then confronts her one final time. Sampa fist-fights with Xannari, ending with Sampa shooting himself in the head (If Fallout New Vegas taught us anything, you can survive a bullet in the brain.) He eventually recovers with the help of Dark_Junior, Laythe_Dweller, and Xannari (who disappears shortly thereafter). After, the fleet constructs Citadel 2, a replacement. The Alliance welcomes a new era of peace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dark Junior","CreatedById":102999,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI awake from my coma, and request an update for what the heck happened while I was gone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESampa, I leave for ONE WEEKEND!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seriously, how could so much happen?
