Mods depending upon the CTT can simply include that dependency in their metadata. That means we don\u0027t end up with everyone bundling the same resources, and it means it can be kept up-to-date without releasing new versions of the mods that require it. Mods which support (but do not require) the CTT can state they recommend, suggest or support the CTT, which means the user has the option of installing it, but it\u0027s not required.

We, as modders, are simply picking which tech tree to tie our horse to. And given I have a huge overlap with NFT, having myself and Nertea use the same tree is going to rock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be config files... for the people who just want to be compatible and take advantage of this tree *if* it\u0027s there (or use a stock tree or a custom tree if it\u0027s not). But that\u0027s not the default case as relevant to this thread. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I fully expect you will see MM configs pop up to shuffle things around, but that\u0027s going to be something the community will do on their own - for example, I can pretty much guarantee that if Fractal_UK does not include his own config with Interstellar to support CTT, someone is going to make a KSPI version that fits in this tree within a week of launch, just because we have a lot of overlap in users (and making them switch trees back and forth in the R\u0026amp;D center is a sub-optimal solution)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFolks are kinda overcomplicating what is in effect a very simple solution. We have a set of nodes, no different than stock. The entire point of which is that as a player, I select my tree, and everything just works.

Counter to that, I add and move parts around every week or two for my mods (I have half a dozen new parts in this week\u0027s release alone, plus part deprecation, etc.).
