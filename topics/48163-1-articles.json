As in, not just to the combatants but also to normal people sitting around watching the fight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen the video about the ultimate superman punch (\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-fL8zopddI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E) but that\u0027s a very extreme scenario. I\u0027m thinking more along the lines of... at what point would the shockwave render you deaf, or at what point would the flash of ionizing air blind you. Rather than going all the way and basically vaporizing the surrounding peeps. For the sound I\u0027d need an equation that converts forces (in Joules) to the sound pressure we usually use to measure the force of a sound (in decibels). For the blindness I\u0027ll need to determine how much of the energy in a kinetic impactor gets converted into visible light (and when it starts to happen). I found some hints that sound damage can start at around 80 - 120 dB, but that\u0027s obviously over long term exposures. These punches would be short quick blasts. Some guns produce 170 dB, and the people using them don\u0027t immediately go deaf.\u003Cp\u003EI just think it\u0027d be funny if in one of these superhero movies the hero turned to the stunned civilians and went,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cover your ears and brace yourselves!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m about to punch this guy REALLY hard!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWiki sources\u003C/span\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure_and_sound_pressure_levels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure_and_sound_pressure_levels\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise-induced_hearing_loss\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise-induced_hearing_loss\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-12T23:08:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2013 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T21:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery rough estimates on some numbers I remember.

The same applies with two forces. In theory: If the punchers are tough enough there will be consequenses to the surroundings and/or to their physical structure. Matter is only that strong however... Thus, there is a theoretical upper limit, based on the materials of which the two are made, then their fists break apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery rough estimates on some numbers I remember.
