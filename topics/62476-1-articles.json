If your only goal is high/low science you can use an ion powered probe (which will have tons of dV) and then put your ship into a parking orbit around lay the to drop your lander to the surface and back. Don\u0027t forget you can use parachutes and aerobraking on Laythe. The issue is getting back to Kerb in again, in which case dump all the weight you can (like that lander) and use gravity assists off of lay the and tylo to help you get out of Jool\u0027s gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T21:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DSM92\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DSM92\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo My first Jool transfer window is coming up.

Taking off from Laythe requires about 3500m/s all by itself. And unless you\u0027ve got the patience to play Gravity Ping-Pong between all the various moons and Jool, so you can get fly-bys for little delta-V, expect to spend anywhere from 1000-1500 per trip between moons, more for Pol and even more for Bop due to their inclinations. But note that Gravity Ping-Pong is all luck of the draw, depending on where the moons are when you get there, and it\u0027s only really good for Laythe, Vall, and Tylo. Pol\u0027s a bit too far out and is inclined enough that you probably won\u0027t hit it. You almost certainly won\u0027t hit highly inclined Bop this way. And note that hitting either one will probably screw you up for all the others due to putting you in an inclined orbit yourself. So either way, expect to spend a lot on travels between moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of all this, it\u0027s pretty difficult to do all the above with a single vehicle. Going between all the moons, Ping-Pong or not, is probably best down with an ion ship as mentioned above, due to all the delta-V you need in space. But this ion probe won\u0027t do for landing on Laythe, and a Laythe lander will be too heavy for ions to push. So what I\u0027d do instead is make a dedicated Laythe lander, then either 1 ion probe for everything else or separate probes for each moon. And throw in another for a Jool lander \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T21:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough realize the OP never said anything about returning to Kerbin.

So deduct 3500m/s for the Laythe take-off.

Otherwise you\u0027ll need this hulking monster of a ship. So landing on Laythe almost forces you to have 2 probes. Now, you can land with ions on Bop, maybe even Pol.

My first mistake was to get myself into a retrograde orbit, which pretty much eliminated my chance of landing on Laythe (I wasn\u0027t particularly good at accurately setting up intercepts at that point. I also struggled with encountering Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, a prograde orbit is pretty important. It lengthens the duration of encounters, and makes a Laythe landing much easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt the Delta-V requirements will be anything remotely like 1000 between moons if you only plan to encounter, rather than orbit... more like 1000 for the combined manoeuvres if you make them at a low Jool Periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at a delta-V map, the Delta-V requirements between moons are equal to the difference in delta-V required to intercept from a low Jool orbit, so between Pol and Bop it is 2500-2430 = 70m/s. This assumes you have a Jool periapsis at ~150km and apoapsis at Pol\u0027s orbit at the start of the manoeuvre. As long as you can get to an eccentric, prograde Jool orbit with about 4 tons of fuel, a nuclear engine and a total mass \u0026lt; 10 tonnes (plenty of spare mass for a light landing set up for Laythe) you\u0027ll be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best order, by far, to do this in is the way you have outlined, outermost \u0026gt; innermost, in order. You would be wasting 100\u0027s of m/s of delta-V to do it any other way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing I would consider is how close you get to Tylo, you don\u0027t want to end up getting a massive gravity assist and ending up leaving Jool\u0027s SOI. I can\u0027t say I am too sure about how gravity assists work, though so I\u0027m not sure how to approach it to ensure a close encounter without it affecting your orbit too badly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
