My gut feeling is no, but you never know...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Destructive surges can be hundreds of thousands of joules. How many joules does the UPS claim to absorb? Almost anything can be recommended without numbers. View its numbers (hundreds) to discover the UPS is near zero protection. But it is 100% protection when thinking subjectively.\u003Cp\u003ELightning can find a destructive path from cloud to earth via the structure. So we earth a lightning rod. Lightning can find a destructive path from cloud to earth via appliances. So we earth every incoming utility wire (either directly or via a \u0027whole house\u0027 protector). Protection is always about the path that a surge takes to earth. Nothing stops that current - especially not a near zero UPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027whole house\u0027 protector is obviously and completely different from ineffective (magic box) plug-in protectors. Plug-in protectors claim to absorb that surge energy. How many joules does it really absorb? Plug-in protectors will somehow block what three miles of sky could not? Of course not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA direct ligthning strike to AC mains far down the street is incoming to every appliance. All need that protection. One typically destructive path is incoming via AC mains. Outgoing via the ethernet port. Then to earth ground via the fiber optic interface box. Damage means that current is other incoming on one wire and outgoing on another wire. Then much later, something in that path fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll ethernet already have robust protection (ie 2000 volts). Your concern is the rare transient that can overwhelm protection inside any and every appliance. That means you earth the surge BEFORE it can enter the building. Either either via a hardwire (ie cable TV, antenna) or via a \u0027whole house\u0027 protector (AC electric, telephone). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat must have almost all of your attention? Not even the \u0027whole house\u0027 protector. Protection is always about where hundreds of thousandes of joules harmlessly dissipate.

A maybe 5000 volt surge approaching on the black (hot) AC wire is simply \u0027leveled out\u0027. So 4670 volts is also on the white (neutral) wire and green (safety ground) wire.

For example, lightning is typically 20,000 amps. So a minimal \u0027whole house\u0027 protector is 50,000 amps. Because effective protectors are for direct lightning strikes. Because effective protectors must never fail during a surge.
