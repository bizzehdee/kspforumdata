I think the trusses might be slowing things down, but I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027ve learned a lot about Unity since making those trusses, things like mesh colliders take a higher performance hit than box colliders. It may take some redesigning to fix. That leads me to my question: For the trusses, how many people use more than two sides to attach stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the inflating centrifuge rings, I suspect you\u0027ll be able to do that with no problems. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The reason I know this is that BobCat has had an inflating AND rotating habitat in his MPSS Nautilus pack for years, and I still use them all the time. The only thing I don\u0027t care for about them is that their cosmetic appearance is a bit dated, that\u0027s all. Well, that and it\u0027s only available in 1.25 meter size, although I did clone the part into a 2.5 meter version for myself, with double the crew capacity. Anyway, I\u0027d love to see a new version of such a part!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with the trusses, absolutely YES, I definitely use more than just 2 sides, that\u0027s what I like about the Hex trusses specifically, they allow TRI-lateral symmetry if I so desire! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Everything else currently available (or, at least, USEABLE) in the game is either just cylinders or squares or other boring shapes like that. There was THSS a while ago, and there have been a few attempts to redo that system recently, but with limited success and support. One thing I think might be causing the lag is the mesh switching feature, but I\u0027m just spitballing about that. Is it really necessary to have that feature on the trusses? I mean, I know why you\u0027re doing it, so that one can attach to the surface of the truss if desired, or one can get the collider \u0027out of the way\u0027 so as to attach something to a tank or piece of equipment that\u0027s been placed inside the truss. Here\u0027s an alternate idea: Could you maybe create a narrow strip of collider down the middle of each face on which to attach something, and also of course on the corners where the metal structure would be, but leave areas to either side through which we could thread something into the middle? Again, just an idea, don\u0027t know how practical or even doable such a thing would be. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, keep up the great work on everything, and as always I look forward to whatever future developments are coming from DSEV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T06:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Angel-125/DSEV/releases/tag/v1.0.5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet the latest here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug Fixes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Supernova now recognizes that off means off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Updated to KSP 1.0.5\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wreckreation","CreatedById":114933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T12:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the DR-375 Dock-O-Trons intended for permanent docking?

Both the stock modular girders and the octagonal trusses from Near Future Construction are geared for two- or fourfold symmetry. I think each of the three truss systems has its niche.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLove the centrifuge parts, too. An artificial gravity system feels very appropriate for any interplanetary cruiser, given the typical flight times.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich brings me to one question: how is torque determined in KSP? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0026#39;m trying to do is to determine the optimal rotation speed for the counter-torque ring for a given configuration. If there is to be no net rotation, the total angular momentum must cancel out: L = sum I[SUB]j[/SUB] omega[SUB]j[/SUB] = 0, where I is the moment of inertia, omega is the speed of rotation, and j indexes the parts of the craft. (All parts that are not rotating in the centrifuge can be ignored.) The moment of inertia I is the integral of r[SUP]2[/SUP] dm, but how is the mass distributed in the rings? The radii for the two ring types are the same. Can the mass distributions be considered to have identical shapes, which would make the moment of inertia simply linearly proportional to the total mass of each ring?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf so, then in the case of no payload, the rotation speed that exactly cancels the torque should be omega[SUB]2[/SUB] = -(m[SUB]1[/SUB]/m[SUB]2[/SUB])*omega[SUB]1[/SUB], where m is mass, omega is rotation speed, subscript 1 refers to the spin hub and 2 to the counter-torque ring, and the minus sign indicates the opposite direction of rotation. Then, if there is payload attached to the spin hub, we assume that each attached part is a point mass located at its center. The distances from the axis of rotation should be rather easy to approximate visually. This would give a ballpark estimate for the needed rotation speed for the counter-torque ring, which can then be fine-tuned once the craft is in orbit (without causing the craft to spin wildly when the centrifuge is first activated). This also allows skimping out on ballast unless the estimated speed is ridiculously high, saving payload mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat really won me over to installing DSEV - aside from the stockalike look - is its modular nature. As a craft builder, I prefer flexibility over replication of minute details of actual real (or concept) spacecraft. Right now I\u0026#39;m building a ship for a manned (kerbaled?) trip to Duna, for which the DSEV parts (along with Near Future and MRS) come in very handy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for the great mod!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T17:52:10Z","Content":"\nGlad you like the mod. :) I strive to make my artwork look stock, and aim for quality similar work by PorkJet or Neartea- I admire their art.

Glad you figured out that the hex trusses are hallow. Nice idea with the procedural tanks. As an alternative, those FLM-450, 900, and 1800 tanks fit nicely inside the trusses, as does the compact ISRU and WB-2 fusion reactor. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking that if the hex trusses are causing issues, I will redesign them, deprecating the old parts. I\u0027d start by replacing the \u0022chicken wire\u0022 equipment rack meshes with transparent textures to cut down on rendering (assuming that helps), do away with the tripple-length truss, and resize them to be slightly larger than the FLM-450, 900, and 1800 tanks. That way, no vestibule would be needed. Then I might make variants with the fuel tanks inside, and ditch the 1.875m tanks (they\u0027d make a return with MOLE most likely). So you\u0027d have quarter, half, full, and double trusses that are hollow, and quarter, half, and full trusses that are closed but have integrated fuel tanks. You\u0027d have six sides to attach things to with the fuel tank trusses and a variable number of sides to attach stuff to with the hollow trusses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the FLM-450, 900, and 1800 tanks have style options for 1.25m and 0.625m. Does anybody use those sizes? I might do away with them as style options but put them into an optional fuel tank addon pack as separate parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T17:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try those out.
