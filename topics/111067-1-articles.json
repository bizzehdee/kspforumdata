W and S does nothing but A or D turns it. It doesn\u0027t bother me much but I\u0027d like to fix it. Is this a control issue?

I\u0027ve never seen the ship actually move under it\u0027s own power once I was out of it. To confirm that there\u0027s actual control inputs in the ship while you\u0027re outside of it, try adding RCS jets to the ship and leave them active when you EVA. Since the jets are easily visible it should be easy to tell if the ship is receiving control inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a bug, it\u0027s one I haven\u0027t encountered yet.
