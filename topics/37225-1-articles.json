What better place to share the grueling process but on the KSP forums? Consider this thread a progress thread where everything that can and will be shared about this project. Those with 3D modeling experience feel free to chime in and give any advice you can.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStep 1: Modeling the Rocket\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step I decided to take on was modeling the rocket/lander that was going to be used in the video. While I wanted to design my own awesome lander, I figured that it would be better to take the lander right from the game (with slight modifications). Since I wanted to make this video fit the trailer/advertisement theme I figured having a vehicle that\u0027s modeled off of one people can fly in-game would be a nice touch. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RYLzp9I.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E the lander I will be using for those who haven\u0027t explored the stock craft included in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as a side note, I do not know what Squad\u0027s policy on taking 3D models right from the game and using them in animation and I could not find any concrete statement that said yes so I will be recreating all these parts from scratch (with some creative license taken) so I don\u0027t violate any of their IP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep one was modeling the Mk. 2 Lander Can, which is possibly one of the most complex parts of this whole lander, either way here\u0027s what I settled on. It\u0027s not perfect and there are things that I would change but otherwise, for the purposes of this video it will do.
