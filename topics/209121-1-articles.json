I have now docked multiple pieces together in space, but the game doesn\u0027t recognise the vessel to be a Space Station in the tracking centre (it falls under \u0027ships\u0027). The station can accommodate 7 Kerbals and has batteries, solar panels, Science devices and lights. Can anyone help me to understand why the vessel is not recognised as a station in the tracking centre? Are there any particular requirements (in terms of structures, functions, etc.) for it to be considered a space station?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-26T20:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno, there aren\u0027t any special requirements. the tracking station assignment is done according to some parameters that I don\u0027t know, but they are quite random. my last ship was dubbed a plane just because it had a Mk3 crew cabin, even though it had no wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway, it makes zero difference. if it\u0027s to fulfill a contract, then as long as it has the crew capacity and the parts specified, you are fine. if you just want to see \u0022space station\u0022 in the tracking station, you just have to manually set your station as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngo to your station, select any crew pod or probe core, right click on it, \u0022configure vehicle name\u0022. there you can also decide if your vessel is a station, plane or whatever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
