Remember the heavier the rocket, the later your gravity turn has to be. Make sure you do not go past the blue AP marker or your now kerbin-bound to the ground. Once your predicted AP is 100\u002BKM only then you can think about chasing the prograde marker. Go prograde untill the blue arch is more circular . THen cut off engines ad make a orbital manevure node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found in my experiments if your potential AP is below 100km and you have a large rocket and you go prograde too early, youll find yourself falling to rapidly to kerbin below the 70km mark , and when that happens you can no longer progade your way to an orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T07:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, alright.
