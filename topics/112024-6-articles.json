The reason we switched to including KJR in 1.0.2 is that the latest KSP has a springy force on some parts that you can\u0027t overcome with node size. Overcoming that would require struts and raised parts count etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the next version of KSP fixes this issue we will be able to drop KJR entirely, because all the craft are perfectly rigid enough without it other than the new spring issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Well\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Well\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith the inflatable shield on top, it\u0027s good to go !\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2010/10/exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit/10280621-2-eng-GB/Exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit_node_full_image_2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2010/10/exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit/10280621-2-eng-GB/Exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit_node_full_image_2.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut where is the rentry capsule ? may be on the node... and with a eva hatch on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nssfrance.free.fr/news/HMM04.JPG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nssfrance.free.fr/news/HMM04.JPG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look at that diagram I see the Monkey Transfer Vehicle if you had to break it down into Ariane V - launchable bites ( mass, fairing diameter constraints )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:41:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat happened to vulkan? you posted pictures and there are some parts that are labeled for vulkan but not a complete set and no .craft files. were they not ready for release?.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T22:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat happened to vulkan? you posted pictures and there are some parts that are labeled for vulkan but not a complete set and no .craft files. were they not ready for release?.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it doesn\u0027t fit neatly into this pack.
