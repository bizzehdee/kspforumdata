I\u0027m not saying that pointing a new player toward a mod is bad, I\u0027m saying that it\u0027s not an excuse for not having *x* feature in game. IMO, when somebody suggests something that has been done *partially* by a mod, and somebody points them towards a mod, it lessens the demand for a well done stock version. People settle for a mod instead of being persistent in their request(s).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T23:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Robotengineer**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T18:23:29Z","Content":"This has been going on ever since mods were being made for this game.
