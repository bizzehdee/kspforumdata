Otherwise, you can set up a maneuvre node to burn prograde until you meet that point, and then move the node around until it shows an encounter. This second method works for just about anything.

Most of the time he\u0027d get killed on impact. But about 1 time in 20 he\u0027d actually hit the ground and somehow survive. And then, sometimes he\u0027d bounce into a suborbital flight of just him.

Retrograde will do the exact opposite. So launch firing rockets till you get your orbit apoapsis to 100k (watching the map). Once you do that, Cut your engines. Then once you are at your apoapsis (highest point in orbit) turn pro-grade (the direction you are moving) and fire them again until the other side of your orbit is also at 100k.. Remember pressing x will cut your engines instantly. If you pull up your nav ball in map mode, you can control your ship while looking at the map. After you achieve a stable orbit (100k or so) click on your blue orbit line in map mode around 70 degrees before the moon and use the delta-V slider and add Delta-v till the hypothetical shows you encounter the mun.. This will add a burn node and a target reticle to your Nav ball.. once your (time to node) is 1/2 of your calculated burn time, Start your burn facing the reticle on your navball, and cut it off when the Yellow DV indicator is empty. Now you wait a bit.... Once you are halfway to the moon click on the moon in map view and focus on it. Check where your orbit is. If it\u0027s colliding with the moon, then fire your ship facing (right) of your orbit path. It will only take a slight amount to move your orbit to a different path, so go easy. Get it to where you are just passing the moon instead of crashing into it.. Once you enter the moons Sphere of influence and are at the muns Pe (periapsis node) , Turn your ship retrograde (Facing away from teh direction you are moving) and fire your engines until you achieve orbit around the moon.
