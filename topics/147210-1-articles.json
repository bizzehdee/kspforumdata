Ive built a small refueling station with a shuttle replica which was challenging but awesome. Ive now reached out and landed my first rover on the mun, and landed my first kerbals on the mun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was the first to walk on the mun of course. If you have any suggestions on mods that you like and help the game run smoother let me know please! Also suggestions please on where I should go from here! thanks!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso how do you post pictures on here?

My first landing on Mun was a crash landing, but the CM and Valentina survived. The second attempt was the rescue mission\u00A0to retrieve her.
