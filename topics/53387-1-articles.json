I have explored via manned craft moho, eve and duna, however never could figure out how to get such a large craft off the ground and to jool without building a ship out of the atmosphere. I always added more fuel, more power, and ended up with the same result... never quite making it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooo... I didn\u0027t exactly explore jool with any kerbal... I had this great Idea of launching a MapSat... Turns out, a MapSat can\u0027t ma out a gaseous planet... Darn. trip wasted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH well, I am just glad I finally did it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was done using 2,5m rockets from KW Rocketry. Two liquid fuel boosters that cross feed to the main. 2x Bearcat 2,5 engines with a 4x800 main. This launched an interplanetary rocket consisting of a 1620:1980 tank and a nuclear thermal rocket. This lasted the entire trip, all but circulating my orbit around Jool. I got down to a split of about 8 million meters. The rest of it I used an Ion/xenon engine mounted on my sat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I learned a lot from the mission and will soon be launching at least a 2 kerbal team next...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk16/Jwmbike14/screenshot0_zps80f15832.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zps80f15832.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk16/Jwmbike14/screenshot1_zpsa19c25c5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zpsa19c25c5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow did YOU do it?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-17T04:07:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2013 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jwmflying14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaryulenko","CreatedById":76874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T04:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! i did to jool for first time a few weeks ago using a rocket from biggest to smallest (3.75 to 0.625 diameter) i learned how to get a lower escape orbit in the process of the 3 jool missions i have done.
