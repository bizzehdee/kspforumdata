It\u0027s a simple but hard technique that requires some intuition involving trig and vector algebra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, you want to keep more horizontal velocity than normal for the final suicide burn. Then you can start your suicide burn as normal except earlier than your velocity dictates and incorporate a pitch-down below retrograde into the burn instead of following retrograde. Your horizontal thrust is related to the sine of you AoA to the horizon and vertical thrust is related to the cosine. The vertical component is used to control decent, and you use a high initial horizontal velocity so that the horizontal thrust takes you closer to zero. At 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 your vertical component is still 50% of the total thrust! Due to the need to follow a non-prograde course, this technique only works without an atmosphere.
