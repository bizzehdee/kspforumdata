I\u0027ve managed to take a lander to the surface and am about to do the return trip which, hopefully, will also be a success... My problem is my ship is rather big (a total of 436 parts) and I can\u0027t help but think it\u0027s massively inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst some information: I use Deadly Reentry and TAC Life Support which creates a couple of necessities (food, water, ablative shields, etc) that need some attention. Also I wanted to make this a 4 Kerbal mission. 2 to stay in orbit and 2 to land on Duna. The ship in turn is comprised of the following modules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEngine module: 8 LV-N Nuclear Rocket Engines;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECargo module: Life support systems, solar panels and batteries, scientific instruments, and a cargo bay with emergency supplies (strut points, pipes, etc.);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELanding module: Lander can, backup engine for descent (apparently it was useful as I didn\u0027t pack enough chutes), ascent stage, etc;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETwo return capsules: MK1-2 pods with 0-10 monopropellant engines with enough fuel to break orbit;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA \u0022living\u0022 module: Partially because I needed to stabilize the center of mass after adding the LM and partially because I think such a long trip on small capsules would suck.

Both up and down you have the two return pods and just in front of them you get the small return ship. You might also notice that both Bob and Bill are on the LM while Jebediah is on the Command module. I know the command traditionally goes down but Jeb felt he was having all the fun so he decided to pass the honor down to his crew. What can I say?

The fact you can strut in space is a huge boon. I have never found that mod nor have I convinced myself on if I want to use it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t bother with escape ships since if something goes wrong, I just build another ship to go get them. However, I am not using life support, so there is no reason to just go rescue a crew 5 years out. It also means I don\u0027t bring supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I have a thin scaffold with docking ports on it and a large one up front and at the back. I then ship up dual engine pods to put on them (I prefer pullers to pushers as it avoids the inverted pendulum problem of control). You have to imagine where the center of mass is and keep it generally in the center or you will begin to spin. I also find docking port connectors are rather rubbery and appear to only connect at a single point rather than around the ring. That means they flop. The advanced wheel is also apparently made of rubber, those flop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can kind of guess the center of mass as the camera apparently focuses on that center when viewing the ship. Zoom way in and if you are in between your engines, you are likely to be ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tricks I\u0027ve learned in moving unwieldy ships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Since you are using mechjeb. Turn on smooth throttle and I use limit throttle to 10% if I have a construct that is particularly wobbly. It means longer burns, but plan for that. I also limit to 40m/s and terminal velocity. It saves mucho fuel. You aren\u0027t likely to run into those limits with heavy craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I used to try to put RCS on things. I have moved away from that. It is only really useful for docking. So any ship you want to dock with, go ahead and put on the RCS. I\u0027d love if mechjeb would only use RCS for the forward/backward movements and leave turning to the wheels, I haven\u0027t found a way to make it do that yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The one exception to #2 is my little tugs. They are all RCS only fueled. That is because they are made to haul around the parts once they are near each other. Which I guess is a sort of secondary docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Turning large ships takes a long time. RCS can help but I find it makes the ship wobble, badly sometimes. So I stick to just well placed wheels now. It is a lot slower, but a lot less wobbly. Not going to do quick turns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broax","CreatedById":109333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T16:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely useful regarding the maneuverability specially since I never game much thought to putting the engines on the front...

It really good \u0027cause it not only lets you build struts but allows you to do lots of stuff like installing pipe ends to allow resource transfers between parts that aren\u0027t connected or don\u0027t have crossfeed. It also has fully functioning towing parts like winches or magnets, it allows to add small parts to ships like small photovoltaic panels or small batteries (it\u0027s a life saver if you forget to deploy the panels until the ship runs out of power) and it has small containers to store parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only it expands what you can do in the game it also gives you something to do while on EVA.

I see 2 Rockomax MK 55 radial engines on your lander. These engines are TERRIBLE. They only get 320 ISP in vacuum and they have mediocre TWR.

Also, since you only have 4 Kerbals, you don\u0027t need two Mk1-2 command pods to bring them home. 1 return pod consisting of a Mk1-2 pod and a Mk1 pod would work better. Also if you want to take the return pod approach, I think it would be better to have just have 1 return pod and have 1 of your NERVA engines undocked-able so you can dock it to your return pod.

Get lined up and speed matched, then close the distance. A good rule of thumb is 1/100th your distance until you are about 1km away, then it should be 1/10th your distance, docking should be no more than 1 m/s. RCS is used mainly for lateral translation as you make your approach. Also, don\u0027t be afraid to move your target port to face your incoming ship, it works both ways.

I see 2 Rockomax MK 55 radial engines on your lander. These engines are TERRIBLE. They only get 320 ISP in vacuum and they have mediocre TWR. Get rid of them and replace them with something more efficient like a few Rockomax 48-7S or an aerospike. With a more efficient engine, you\u0027ll need less mass in fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I see a lot of radial mono prop tanks and a large mono prop tank on your transfer stage. This mono prop is really weighing your ship down; the mass of all the containers I see on your transfer stage is 7.9 tons! You do not need this much mono prop for docking, remove the large tank and reduce the amount of radial tanks (2 radial tanks should be plenty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I see you have two Rockomax HubMaxs. These two modules have a mass of 3 tons! Replace them with something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. There might be a problem with you return pods. A Duna-\u0026gt;Kerbin transfer takes more than 100 days and I don\u0027t see enough life support on your return pods (unless you have it clipped inside the ship somewhere) to survive the journey. If you want life support for 3 kerbals to survive the return trip then you would have to add at least 3 tons of life support (which means you have to add more fuel to move that extra mass). Also, since you only have 4 Kerbals, you don\u0027t need two Mk1-2 command pods to bring them home. 1 return pod consisting of a Mk1-2 pod and a Mk1 pod would work better. Also if you want to take the return pod approach, I think it would be better to have just have 1 return pod and have 1 of your NERVA engines undocked-able so you can dock it to your return pod. As it stands, your two current pods are adding 18 tons of mass to your ship. (which is a lot!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Consider removing the cupola. I know the view is pretty, but that view costs 4.5 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Also consider removing some of the NERVA engines. I know the burn will take longer but its worth it in the mass you get to save. (if the burn is too long, use \u0022periapsis kicks\u0022 to split it into multiple burns.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this is what you do to make your ship more efficient. Look at every part on your ship and determine if you can use a better part or whether you even need it at all. By removing unnecessary mass you can reduce the size of your transfer stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you find my advice somewhat useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally agree with Stratzenblitz75. But in particular, I wanted to underscore how many NERVA engines you have and how much they weigh. At 2.25 tons each, you have 18 tons of NERVA engines. For interplanetary transfer stages, you really only need one engine, not 8, since you don\u0027t need to have a high thrust to weight ratio. That will save you a huge amount of mass. See if you can design a configuration that just has a single NERVA engine with drop tanks that you can dispose as the fuel gets used up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted having only one NERVA will lead to some tediously long burns. Your Kerbin escape burn will probably be too long to be feasible to complete in only one orbit, so you\u0027ll have to do it over the course of two or more orbits, boosting a little each time as you come around to the optimal point in the orbit, until finally you escape.
