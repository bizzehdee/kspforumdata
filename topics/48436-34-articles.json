I had the same problem with a Mun lander using (I think) only stock parts \u002B mechjeb. It\u0027s interesting, because I\u0027d already landed the Mun lander once and taken off again to a new site, and done this with the same design before with no problem. Happens exactly as you describe: get a certain distance from where I was parked (about 3 km I think?), and I get the three symmetry attached tanks teleporting back, and fuel lines stretching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m landed near the south pole of the Mun, and the flags I try to plant are also showing weird behavior: I can plant them, and they look fine, but if I quickload the flag isn\u0027t visible (it is in the map view), and it claims it\u0027s under acceleration if I try to switch away. It\u0027s happened every time I\u0027ve tried it with this specific craft, but I\u0027ve used identical craft before in different areas with no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
