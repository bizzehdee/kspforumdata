However, you cannot overclock it, so the motherboard is a little bit over the top. It is way too expensive anyway ($100-125 should be plenty), but when you are not overclocking it just does not make any sense. You could probably do with a $80 motherboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The CPU-cooler you added is no better than the stock cooler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your hard drive is quite slow, it will really slow your computer down. Go for something modern that does at least 7200 rpm, or better, dish out the cash for a SSD. A system with a high-end Intel chip deserves a decent hard drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The GPU of your choice is not the quickest. It could be fine, but it is a bit unbalanced compared to the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your PSU is probably not the best quality. Going with a cheap PSU is just asking for trouble. This is not about the watts (you are quite right there), but about build quality. Go for a decent brand, because you will regret it if you don\u0027t. Cheap PSU\u0027s can not provide the watts indicated. They will only supply something like that for a couple of milliseconds before burning out, as they are rated for peak load. Proper brand PSU\u0027s will on the other hand provide a stable power source over a sustained period of time without trouble, as those are rated for sustained load. Using cheap ones puts all the other hardware at risk, as a dying PSU can damage pretty much any and every other part in your computer. If it manages not to break it can still cause all kinds of weird trouble, like instability due to ripple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would seriously advise to reconsider your choices and maybe read up a little more, as I think you could do a lot more with the same money and, even better, build something that has a lot more balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T12:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewait what are you useing that for?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethough why are you getting a xeon but only 8gb ram?

You insist on a Z77-chipset, which is unnecessarily expensive when not overclocking. Choosing something like a H77 or Q75 will save you money that is better spent elsewhere.

The only downside of using 2 x 4 GB instead of 1 x 8 GB is that you are slightly less flexible when upgrading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I will say exactly the same thing about the hard drive as I said before.

The i5 is often chosen for gaming builds, as games traditionally have little use for hyper threading. They offer a lot of power for a reasonable price. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Please note that neither of the two chosen processors can be overclocked. As such, you will not need a motherboard that is overclock capable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A BIOS update is not a very good reason to choose another CPU. They can often update the BIOS at the store at request and there are other solutions too. It is good to take into account, but it should not be the deciding factor unless there truly is no option to update it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Like I said before, the motherboard is way too expensive. You insist on a Z77-chipset, which is unnecessarily expensive when not overclocking. Choosing something like a H77 or Q75 will save you money that is better spent elsewhere. Also, no socket 1155 motherboards have a built in GPU, as those are incorporated in the CPU with Ivy bridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Is there a specific reason why you are choosing Ivy Bridge (1155) and not the newer Haswell (1150)?

Please note that your memory is single channel, as it is only one memory bank. This will mean it is slightly slower than when picking dual channel memory. For dual channel memory you will need identical memory banks in sets of two. The only downside of using 2 x 4 GB instead of 1 x 8 GB is that you are slightly less flexible when upgrading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. I will say exactly the same thing about the hard drive as I said before. It is really too slow for such a quick system. It will work, but you will not get the most out of your expensive hardware. Get at least something sporty that does 7200 rpm, or for the maximum performance \u003Cem\u003Ea decent\u003C/em\u003E SSD (so no OCZ Vertex or other SSD with Sandforce controller).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Since your rig is intended as a gamer rig, the video card is a little underpowered. KSP will run fine, but a lot of modern games will not run smoothly at high resolutions (1920x1080 or higher) at decent settings.
