On takeoff, the plane went up, did a crazy loop and flew into the ground. The motor burnt the tail to a crisp and left burn marks on the wings. My other failure was a small Estes model rocket (mini motor), the igniter kept falling out before it would start the motor. So I held it in place with: A dab of hot-glue. Big mistake. On ignition, the rocket went up about 2 meters before the motor exploded. I mean EXPLODED. The blast blew the nose-cone off and sent fire balls of burning rocket motor in every direction. Fortunately the rocket was a small E2X with a plastic engine mount, so besides charring the inside, it survived. My other failures include a 2-stage rocket that when I launched, it toppled over when the second stage ignited and flew about a quarter mile horizontally then the parachute refused to open, landing it in a parking lot, another twin stage whose parachute didn\u0027tt open and it ended up sticking out of the ground like a arrow(it still has mud streaks all over the front), then finally two other rockets whose parachutes failed to open before hitting the ground. One dug a hole in the ground and the other split down the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-vsully\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T01:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh the good ol\u0027 days.
