I used the dead-weight rule, i.e. I only used the LLL mod to add aesthetic parts to my ship. The exception was the Kethane Miner which used the linear aerospike engines, and the rovers which used LLL body parts and cabs just because they looked better and again fitted in with the aesthetic of my ship.

Before heat as you will see in my challenge entry I just used a bunch of structural panels, but using 8 heat shields seems a bit sad when Mullet Dyne Advanced Operations are capable of up scaling a heat shield specifically (not engines or fuel tanks for some strange reason) to proportions suitable for reentering a bungalow from plaid speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Tweakscale etc can be allowed in these aesthetic instances, but strictly not for power or fuel parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be interested to read your thoughts on the above.

Go ahead with your mods if you can prove they were strictly aesthetic, but improving the ship\u0027s performance or taking away an essential part of the challenge (aerobraking difficulty for the heat shield) would not be allowed. For example, don\u0027t use IR for making a lander fold into a smaller space when you couldn\u0027t do the same with stock. You could try to use a wide short fairing for your heat shield, since those can expand to much larger sizes and are fairly air-resistant.
