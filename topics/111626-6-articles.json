It involves a triple Sr Docking port for a sturdy attachment. \n\u003E Only 2 of the pairs are properly attaching and I\u0027m not sure how to get the other 2 pairs to work properly. You can see the situation [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5?p=2089028#post2089028).\n\nIf you\u0027re going with a puller design, two ports might be enough unless your payload is very heavy. Your last picture looks good though. Often the magnetic force of the third port will help keep it in place even if it\u0027s not fully docked together.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is B9 Procedural Wing : [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966-1-0-2-B9-Aerospace-Procedural-Parts-0-40-Updated-09-06-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104966-1-0-2-B9-Aerospace-Procedural-Parts-0-40-Updated-09-06-15) allowed?\n\nI can\u0027t test it right now, but if it\u0027s not lighter weight or better fuel-mass ratio than a stock wing, it would be allowed. Looking at the config file two things that confuse me are that it has 4 times the lift of the stock Wing Strake for the same mass, and its base mass for the fuel tank module is -1. Since it\u0027s procedural these values are probably not the same as what would show up in game."},{"CreatedByName":"Halo_003","CreatedById":76050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T03:48:33Z","Content":"I see you have allowed Procedural parts and stock fuel switch, does that mean that [Interstellar Fuel Switcher](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932-1-0-4-Interstellar-Fuel-Switch-1-15-%28released-2-7-2015%29) is also okay?

A shame since your mission would probably stand as a competitive low mass entry too.\n\u003E That would be very impressive, to do it in 30 tons. You\u0027re right that the nerf of jets and the new aerodynamics killed the viability of those sub 10 ton entries.\n\nHi sdj64 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s ok, as I said, I didn\u0027t remember clipping was not allowed...
