But now, when i try to rendez-vous with it with my fourth and last part, as soon as it approaches my craft (within the 2.5 km, or i think 1200meters), the amount of lag is very high, with the space station just dotting around, instead of making a dynamic movement on the screen. Ofcourse this hugely obstructs docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering, are there any settings i could adjust to prevent this problem, because now, docking became mostly impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much in advance.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T13:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T13:22:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 01:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dr_jt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iBoesen","CreatedById":44165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T13:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to limit the lag by far is to keep the part count low. Try and add larger parts as opposed to a bunch of small ones. Also I\u0027ve noticed it helps the lag if you point the camera away from kerbin. Looking at the planet makes the game have to render it. If you are facing away from kerbin or wherever you are the game will play a lot more smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Queue","CreatedById":62262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T13:47:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehopefully with the next update lag will not be as bad. I know Squad has been working on optimization. I know the feeling though. I have been building smaller rockets and stations for now.
