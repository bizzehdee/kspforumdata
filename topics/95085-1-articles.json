Basically if the mod supports the stock toolbar it will be listed more than once. When this happens my game stutters, locks the staging and camera, and screws around with my zoom, and worse, resets all contract. The contracts bug is a known bug for alot of you. Also this toolbar bug im getting might be a root cause. I have just started experiencing this problem today and havnt installed a new mod since last week.
