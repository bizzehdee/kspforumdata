In this orbit the engine should be tested on the moons night side so it needs a decent battery as well as a RTG, with smallish side mounted solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Test 1 should be to maintain course - Increasing energy to the drive in the smallest of increments, will it produce thrust along the drives axis, and if not how much thrust needs to be applied from the smaller devices to keep it strait. To do this the device needs a very precise set of minature thrusters, capable of producing uN of thrust themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Test 2 does the course change or performance increase depending on its orientation toward any celestial body (For example if its discontinuous thrust axis intercepts earths surface). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Test 3 does a performance test assuming that #1 it produces thrust along its axis and 2nd avoiding any celestial interactions, does a continuous high thrust result in a rapid decline of performance, does the axis of thrust shift either with power or time, does energy ultilization migrate from thrust production to device heating over time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eend two-cents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T23:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly legal issue might be patented technology, however not sure that even applies as the satellite would be an prototype. \u003Cp\u003EHowever the main reason why em-drive goes on an low budget is that it probably don\u0027t work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes using more money would probably answer the work / don\u0027t work question faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell just because the public helps float the bill doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re part owner of it.

I presume that he is talking about distances within plank\u0027s length, but what he is suggesting is exactly what the Cannae drive is observing but over a much smaller length scale, or maybe not. (Note I drafted this video into this topic, he does not mention Cannae).\u00A0 Again transfers could be happening on the surface of the chamber or with air molecules in non-vacuum apparatus (but it should not work in a complete vacuum of space where distances are many magnitudes greater). An alternative is that the transfer of hv is happening on loose molecules on the surface that are accelerated to high velocities (such as copper ablation). He also suggests that there should be an upper limit, that as you increase power the direction of output would become more chaotic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what is key here is that the excitation and wobble frequencies of molecules are discrete, including copper, so it should be possible to know if rf used matches that of copper or some other molecules.Therefore if we replace the surface metal on the cone of the chamber with one type that had a particular wobble frequency and then use copper on the plate, by shifting wavelength between two frequencies one should be able to kill or even reverse acceleration, if the metals are oblating at their surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does not get rid of the other problems that I mentioned, that this device would take tremendous amount of power relative to Newton produced and we still do not have an onboard power supply that is weight efficient enough to produce enough thrust to overcome the weight of that powersupply and its cooling elements (or 2-D layout as in the case of solar panels) that would render the acceleration cost effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T22:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can totally buy momentum transfer at short, but not microscopic range, resulting in thrust from whatever ions are still floating in the chamber, something evaporated from the chamber, or perhaps even from the equipment used to measure the thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I don\u0027t buy is virtual particle transfer of momentum over \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E scale.

Their last report ruled out a bunch of possibilities. I would actually have to see what the clearances are in the vacuum chamber. I wish we would stop calling this an EMDrive, its not, in terms of its principle the rf is tossed into a resonance chambers in which electrons oscillate in confined areas, the output thrust is a magnitude higher than the EM and therefore there has to be a push off mass. A thrust in the micronewton range they literally could be pushing of a thread or some sensor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanks length is a factor that is rooted in space-time (rising the split between quantum gravity and relativistic gravity), as I understand it quantum distance can be less rooted, although I cannot imagine a circumstance at STP or ST vacuum in which that might be the case. Even a centimeter jump is well outside plank\u0027s length, which I suspect is just an average of distribution. Maybe these folks need to do a fall-off study to see how far the transfer has signal to noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could imagine circumstances in which this quantum transfer distance is a skewed distribution of lengths with the lowest probability of transfer several times longer than planck\u0027s length (i believe is ~10\u003Csup\u003E-8\u003C/sup\u003E meters). You could have a selection process within the drive which basically builds \u0027fairy\u0027 energy up until such a quantum transfer path becomes available, it then jumps and transfers momentum. That\u0027s all fine but the machine would have to be doing something very powerful or very clever, because twisting the distribution should take very high energy densities, and if those energy densities don\u0027t exist then the resonance has to be creating the brief (say planck\u0027s time) appearance of very high energy density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gedanken question here is when they talk about a singularity universe and infinite energy density, dissolution of space-time, that quantum space allows unlimited density, but of course was unstable and spread possibly as a consequence of acute distortion of quantum properties that spread into space-time. When the universe is the size of say a greatfruit is it still a singularity or is it transiting, and when does that singularity cease. Is it necessarily an assumption that energy itself created inflation or are energy and inflation a manifestation of some other process. If spatial distortions are the sole manifestation of energy, meaning nothing else can operate QFD to alter the fate of virtual particles, then nope its not going to be effective even at 0.01 mm, but if something else is there that can spatially distort the length, then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn intelligent processing they deal with sort of phenomena all the time, the video was about information and information transfer. What if we think about the rf resonance thruster is an information processing unit instead of a thruster, something like a microprocessor. Decisions are made to transfer momentum we have a tetrahedrod and the transfers on oneside off each face can occur. The decission on three faces is to allow transfer lengths of say 1nM and a skewed distribution from 0 to 10 nM, on the back facing side opposed from the electron resonance tube the transfer lengths are from 0 nM to a meter but the distribution mean has only stretched to say 10000nm. In this skewed distribution a specific sort of energy builds up along one direction, sort of like electrons traveling across a chain of 4n\u002B2 orbitals, that then perturbs a field, lets call it the quantum length determinant, which is most of the time randomly pointed in all directions and oscilates around its average value at any point in space. Theoretically a transfer could occur across that meter, just like the probability that a set of diodes and transisters when placed into a circuit could form a processor that could add two numbers. The electron resonance then begins a process of selection suppressing fields that appear that whose lengths are too short and favoring the longer ones, it could even undergo concatenations were virtual particles are handed to new pairs as they arrive carrying the energy to some target molecule. Once the energy arrives at the target the field determinants vanish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T10:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222450085\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457571649\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150339\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022insert_name\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, insert_name said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou realize most of the ions in the van allen belt come from deep space right? that kinda reminds me of a buzzard ramjet style propulsion system, using\u00A0particles in space to provide thrust\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake typical interplanetary ion densities.
