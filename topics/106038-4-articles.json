Spotting a bug, or something that doesn\u0027t look right, is the easy part. To be of any real value to the developers you need to analyse what you were doing when it occurred, then taking time to try and recreate the issue, and then document it as fully as possible so that the developers themselves have as much detail as possible so that they can recreate it to analyse and find and fix the causes (not an easy task for volunteers to achieve in free time under time presdure to get it done). \n\nThat is why a relatively small group of testers, with the time and ability to report effectively, is of far more value than a community wide \u0027play and tell us what doesn\u0027t work\u0027. Don\u0027t get me wrong \u0027throwing it to the monkeys\u0027 is a good way of pointing out lots of issues quickly (especially obscure ones), but unless they are at least reported sensibly they can be of little value, and sometimes a distraction, to the fixing process. \n\nOverall a good job on v1.0, thanks to the whole team that made this awesome game."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:37:25Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried to be sensibly and constructively critical of any output and or manner where decisions and processes are perceived to be faulty - this has never been about people from my perspective and comments.

There is likely little time to spend documenting processes or improving delivery quality, measures, tracking and reporting, etc. All the while knowing that delivering quality software is a complex endeavour that boggles even large global organisations (Microsoft anyone?). Doing it successfully as an Idie team is close to freaking miraculous. (I help improve programs and organisations that deliver tech and SW as a profession - nobody does everything perfect - Nobody!)\n\nAs a community we all should consider re-thanking our Squadies for this incredible road they have traveled, recommit ourselves to being a bit more focused in our criticism of product and process, and staple notes to our foreheads that remind us to absolutely refrain from personal attacks.\n\nAs for Squad, you all might take learnings from this overall 1.0 event as well. How you communicate (when and where) matters a lot. Squandering trust is easier than building it. Thankfully, you still have a strong committed core of supporters (AKA critics) that can still contribute more than just comments - they might even feel that have a stake in the final design from years of input and support. Further opening up your design decisioning processes for comment prior to releasing features might be something to consider - but as always, it\u0027s your decision to make. (For Example: creating a carefully selected cross sectional group of key users to act as an external design review board - confidential NDA, non-binding decisions of course - maybe you already have that - would be nice to know about it).\n\nSo from me...

As a member of the QA test team I feel pretty privileged to be able to see the work that goes on in both QA and Exp testing and did want to comment on this thread, hopefully in a way that doesnt breach the NDA I\u0027m under and get me in trouble.\n\nThe members of the test teams we have are all volunteers, all working whatever hours they can spare from their day job to help make KSP the best game it can be. And when I say whatever hours they can spare I reckon I\u0027d be scared if they were paid employees and HR came a knocking about work hours/conditions, some of these guys put in a lot of time. They do this for the same reason that people raise concerns about 1.0 naming and about release quality, they really love KSP and want it to be the best game it can be. Re: the size of the teams, you can easily see that QA team size in the credits (15 names) and the Exp team is considerably larger (not sure if I can give that number away). The number that always blows me away is 6. Why? because there are only 6 devs working on this game, and not just on the game itself. The amount of content in the features that is worked on, along with the volume of information that the testers create, that is triaged and handled by such a small team is to my mind pretty impressive. Not every bug may have been caught, but some pretty impressive adjustments/fixes are made in each release. Increasing the size of the test teams would help to bring in more information, but could it be of a high enough quality so as not to drown the dev\u0027s, and thats one of the balancing acts that needs to be handled.\n\nIn every test period I have been involved in I think I have thought at one point or another - wow, thats a lot of stuff to work through - and this one was no exception. Tiberions maths about how many moving parts there are is an interesting thought as I have seen a lot of the feedback, issues, testing, resolution, discussions, etc that have been covered during testing, and making assumptions about how/why specific things make it to a release build (there were 125 builds this time round by my count) isnt going to help anyone. This includes processes to check the quality of an item is up to scratch for inclusion, or the evaluation of criticality for a bug to be remediated now or later and other processes. Rest assured that Ted, the Devs and all the testers are constantly thinking about better ways to improve the testing process, provide better feedback, and help identify things that are bugs, could be tweaked, could be improved. For those people who do want to understand more about the way Ted transformed the testing experience he wrote this article a while ago: [A Peek Behind the Kerosene Curtain: All About QA and Experimentals](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/303-A-Peak-Behind-the-Kerosene-Curtain-All-About-QA-and-Experimentals) . And of course if you do want to be involved read up on Kaspers links and keep an eye out for any tester application invites.\n\nPersonally I wasn\u0027t happy with the \u00221.0\u0022 badging, and feel that if versioning simply used a number and version 27 was the one that was not Early Access then it would be less of a discussion both before and after the fact. That said, if calling it 1.0 gets KSP more noticed, more sales and therefore more \u0022fuel\u0022 for Squad to develop it further maybe we are the ones hung up on the 1.0 name. We, the people involved in the forum, should be telling people about how many times Squad have quickly fixed things from feedback, listened to the community and report things as well as we can to help out.\n\nLastly I\u0027d say this - we have a community that is pretty darn fine IMO - I dont know anywhere else that brings together people of such disparity who are happy to talk/help each other with topics ranging across - How does orbital mechanics work? What is DeltaV? Why does this fly upside down? and my personal favorite \u0022How can I make this explosion more insane?\u0022 - the strong attachment people have to this game is awesome, and remember that the people we are talking about/to also have that strong attachment, so before you hit that post button take a second and think \u0022How will the person I am talking to/about take this?\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonnyp","CreatedById":117994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:44:51Z","Content":"QA team are the mutts nuts!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Squad does not communicate well regarding bugs.\n\nThey have a public tracker, which the Devs, QA team and Exp team are active on, as well as an active support forum, What more do you want?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:08:42Z","Content":"A fair number of off-topic posts have been removed from this thread.

Is definitely an idea that has been batted around before too, but I assume it didnt get legs previously or thats what we would see.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...The QA team is a small group internal to Squad with high knowledge of the game\u0027s inner workings. ...\n\nJust to be specific here, we are volunteers too, not internal to Squad.

Bugs that might have been found and fixed with either a longer experimentals phase or even better a release between .90 and 1.0.\n\nNone of us want the full release of KSP to be reviewed as bugged and I suspect that is where the frustration is coming from.\n\nPersonally I think the new functionality of 1.0 is excellent, but that Squad missed the opportunity for the large and loyal KSP community the help bug hunt a 0.95 release in preparation for highly polished 1.0."}]}
