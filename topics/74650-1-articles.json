In 18th september 2013, to be more exact. No updates whatsoever, even the \u0022latest articles\u0022 tab is stuck with the last update being september 17 2013. I can still post though! I can create new threads and reply to other threads, but it\u0027s like I\u0027m all alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo things make this issue extremely strange. First: it seems I\u0027m not the only one. There\u0027s another user by the name of ahappydude that created a topic titled \u0022no thread since 18 sep? wth?\u0022 on october 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow am I posting this and you\u0027re reading? that\u0027s the second strange thing about this issue. The problem only exists on my desktop pc, I\u0027m on a laptop (the same network, btw) and I can access the forums normally. Funny thing is I can\u0027t find that thread ahappydude created and I replied, it\u0027s like it exists in a different dimension! And my profile, if accessed through my laptop, mentione nothing about the topics I\u0027m creating and replying, but if accessed on my desktop pc it does appears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the problem must be on my end, but I have no idea where to look at! I tried cleaning cache, cookies, using different browsers, running a DNSFLUSH command... nothing works. Do I call a priest to make an exorcism on my pc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link of the ghost topic (I can only access it through my desktop)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/50375-No-new-thread-since-18-sep-wth\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/50375-No-new-thread-since-18-sep-wth\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-10T08:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2014 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UbioZur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerged double post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T07:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esounds like the April Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T08:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI moved the thread on to the Kerbal Network (forum about the forum and other squad site).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA search on the forum (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/search.php?search_type=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadvanced search\u003C/a\u003E of the post you have done) seems to show that you haven\u0027t posted for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you screenshot the forum you access on your desktop (incl the address bar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you also (with your desktop), try to log off, log in and see if it change. and access the forum through the link in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eksp main site\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diegzumillo","CreatedById":4869,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T08:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for moving.
