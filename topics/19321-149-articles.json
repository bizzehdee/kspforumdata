The awesome of this plugin can\u0027t be exaggerated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only complaint is I would like the interface to look as sexy as MJ panels do. But I never really use it when flying anyway so that is minor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays my only use for rockets is to accelerate from \u002B/- 1700m/s to orbital velocities and for orbital maneuver.
