A new addition to my not-so-peaceful skunkworks thread. I have been toying with this concept for a while, and this is the first ship that fully applies the idea: A durable warship that can take damage and keep on fighting. First of all, here she is, all 107 tons of gloriousness:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/3jq8BM4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3jq8BM4.png\u0022 alt=\u00223jq8BM4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is she more durable than any other ship, you say? Well, my solutions are varied. First, of course, it\u0027s armored. The armor is placed in small chunks with a slight inclination so there is some shock absorbing capability without jumping the part count unreasonably high (it\u0027s high enough as it is, 550 parts on the pad), and you don\u0027t lose it all if it is shaken off. But we all know with a big enough torpedo all armor is useless. So what do you do when a SRB has just riped through your hull like it\u0027s tissue paper? Well, you literally pick up the pieces and move on. Every pod in the ship is actually an independent craft with RCS subsystem and docking ports, so you can re-dock them to the biggest fuel tank you find in the debris filed. Then you grab the engines, which are mounted on similarly independent pods, and figure out a symmetric stable-ish arrangement for your new drive system. Then you grab some of the weapons still floating around out there, and go deliver some rightful vengeance on the guys that just made you do all that salvaging work. Enjoy blowing it up bit by bit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/wXaWMcm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wXaWMcm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wXaWMcm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to teeth, you have two SRB heavy unguided torpedoes, 4 medium guided ones (can be launched unguided), and 4 small smart missiles (RCS-powered probes, you\u0027d better hit at more than 100m/s to do any damage with those). Of course, it comes with a launch system, that will leave no debris since you need to finish orbital insertion with the ship itself. Don\u0027t worry about mileage, though, you have about 4.5km/s in the tanks, which is enough for all the usual deployments in a single stage (Laythe, Duna, Eve), return trip included. Oh, and the only modded part is kerbal engineer redux, but since this is going to my mod thread, I figured I wouldn\u0027t take it out, but less than 1% of the ship is non-stock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FHyWX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
