It also works with stock version of the game but you will likely explode and die even before take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft is fairly stable with critical AoA about 20 degrees. In case of stall apply full throttle and use the navball to correct your attitude. If you have enough altitude you should be able to recover easily. If you do not have enough altitude hit staging to decouple the cockpit and deploy parachutes to save the brave [insert name here] Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel flight top speed @ seal level M=0.95\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel flight top speed @ 12 km and higher is about M=2.5 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuverability is quite good especially at low altitudes. The aircraft has a very high TWR so acceleration is excellent. During take off it should be safe pulling on the stick the whole time without risk of striking the runway with your tail. Landings can be tricky if you are coming in fast and perfectly straight as the narrow wheel track can cause you to do a little dance followed by a flip over and fiery death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages of an earlier iteration wit differently positioned landing gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46478498/KPS/KSP_2013_06_09_10_08_01_380.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_2013_06_09_10_08_01_380.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46478498/KPS/KSP_2013_06_09_10_49_09_062.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_2013_06_09_10_49_09_062.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to make it look as a real life plane but given the selection of parts in the stock game it still looks a bit silly especially the intakes and engine attachment to the airframe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46478498/KPS/Fighter.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46478498/KPS/Fighter.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mobius","CreatedById":57484,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T18:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you do that thing with the air intakes in front?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"reptile2001","CreatedById":58415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T20:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean how he got them partially inside the fuselage, that\u0027s done with the part-clipping option turned on in the debugging menu.
