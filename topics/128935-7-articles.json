Oh...the good old times... I recall the feeling of joy and accomplishment when I did my first mun landing and returned. The game was of course not as interesting and today (no EVA\u0027s, only part mods, only Kerbin and Mun, no docking, only a single vessel) but somehow more fun. I would call that \u0022classic KSP\u0022.\u00A0By the way, several versions of KSP ranging from 0.7.2 to 0.13 (because KSP was free at that time)\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131906-the-earliest-versions-of-kerbal-space-program/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eare avaliable for download\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for anybody who is nostalgic. At that time,\u00A0Kerbonauts were real men (only the Original Tree at that time; Jeb, Bill and Bob) and not some randomly-generated clones who wear silver suits and there was no such thing as MechJeb which let you fly to Eeloo with the click of a single button (wait...Eeloo didn\u0027t exist back there) but when you needed some physics and maths knowledge and most importantly, a bit of luck, to fly to the Mun (which was one of the only opportiunities for more or less complex missions at that time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, there should also be some part mods from that time lying around. Prior to 0.15 or so (I think) the main part mods were Silisko Edition (by the former member and admin NovaSilisko) and SundayPunch. Today, these two parts packs are united in the pack \u0022NovaPunch\u0022.
