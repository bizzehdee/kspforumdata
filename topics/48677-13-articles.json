Very nice work! I\u0027ve been raving about it on Twitter, so I\u0027ll just summarize here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the method of the science works well with the fundamental focus of KSP. KSP is about travel - building and using rockets. Therefore, you get science by traveling. It works well with the fundamental idea of the game. I wouldn\u0027t mind reasons to have satellites, but I can see leaving for later, or for a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very impressed by the new feel that science gives the game. The energy-heavy trickle of broadcast really gives a lot more weight to every mission I go on, which is great. Rather than decay by a set percentage with each broadcast, I might prefer something similarly trickly - like you can perform experiments that take a long time and dedicated kerbals, or something. That would increase the usefulness of astronauts and further extend missions. Well, that can be a mod, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the downside, you did kill all my precious 4x-physics rovers: your new SAS algorithm seems screwed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T03:37:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by craigp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doc Anderson","CreatedById":59918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T03:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, for one, love the update ... not because any one feature is spectacular (spoiler: they\u0027re not done yet), but because for the first time I got a tangible glimpse at what the game might look like when it\u0027s finished ... and THAT looks pretty awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are three things to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, remember this is an \u0022Early Access\u0022 ALPHA we are being allowed to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, consider that in .22, Squad just changed the fundamental structure of the game WITHOUT BREAKING IT (too much), all so we could all still play with it ... while they continue to work on it.

Science output from crew, EVA reports shouldn\u0027t decrease so drastically, as logically they\u0027re always going to be doing something different inside, as well as different things happening outside. It would seem that scientific output becomes \u0027used up\u0027 fairly quickly, requiring you to do things like go to the Mun \u0027prematurely\u0027 while you still only have the one-seater command pods. It just doesn\u0027t feel right to land on Mun without having the Big Three there to mark the triumphant journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also very much agree with most of what Mr. Scruffy has said -- and upgrading from, say, a bar downtown to a Crew Complex would be pretty funny \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, this update is great, and the technologies demonstrated in the new release have tons of potential. Can\u0027t wait to see what\u0027s in store next.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mach1","CreatedById":60211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T11:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eto my opinion this is not even a beta. O.22 means we are in a pre-alpha mode, and to be at that stage the game is awesome, better than game sold at double the price and fully finished. So every time a new version come out i dont pretend it to be already perfect, i just wanna see the potential of what is added in that version and personally science is what i was waiting from the beginning. So im totally ok with 0.22, i know there are balance issue, it could be usefull to introduce difficulty level so a newbie could start with the actual science request and a skilled player could start with higher. I would move many pieces from one slot to another, i would change the science needed for the unlock and things like that but if i was a newbie this would be awesome as a skilled player, even if not skilled as much as most of you, i rate it ok anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TUFOM","CreatedById":83820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T11:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome update. First thing that was bothering me with ksp wast I couldn\u0027t save different parts of ship and assemble them together -\u0026gt; FIXd. Second thing was 3-6s load times every time changing scene, now its ~1s =FIXd. Huge plus now there is goal to bring crew back safely (besides own goals) at least to the point when everything is unlocked. And even Mun \u0026amp; Minmus missions are interesting again. Awesome work from SQUAD! =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T11:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELoving it so far. I\u0027m having fun with the science and I\u0027m enjoying having to make the most of a reduced part set at the start. I\u0027m probably more of a roleplayer anyway when it comes to KSP, so starting small and working through the tech tree fits my play style very well! I\u0027ve already seen some interesting posts about the tech tree with different people taking different routes through the tree to suit their own building styles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
