Pressed T key to activate the stability control. When pressing W, A, S, Q or E to pitch/yaw/roll the rocket the yellow \u0022moving\u0022 icon appears and also changes back normally once I release the button. When pressing the D key and releasing it, it\u0027s stuck at moving mode and the stability control doesn\u0027t kick in unless I press another moving key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially frustrating if you try to stay on the retrograde marker on the navball when descending at high speeds, because the rocket doesn\u0027t stop moving once I release the D key and it flips over if I don\u0027t press another button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid anyone else experience this behaviour?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
