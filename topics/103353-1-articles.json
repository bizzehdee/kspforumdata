Volatile means easily turning into gas by rapid evaporation.\n\nHelium tank will explode only if you heat it so much that the tank lining breaks up, or if you smash the tank. Otherwise no. Not on its own, not with anything else. It\u0027s probably the most inert chemical we know.\n\nOxygen can\u0027t explode. Hydrogen can\u0027t chemically explode. **Mixtures** can because explosion is a reaction. If you have only one gaseous element, there can be no chemical reactions.\n\nSo if a mixture capable of detonating is formed in a lunar surface dwelling, and you activate it, and the module breaks apart, there will be a very weak (in some cases no) flame front lasting for a very short time, followed by a visible weak plume of water vapor precipitated because of sudden drop of pressure to zero. Debris will be ejected at ballistic trajectories. No sound will be heard except very close. That\u0027s about it.\n\nAnd yeah, explosive decompression of the whole structure.\n\n\u0022Gravity\u0022 did it very correctly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T20:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T21:22:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Seeing that NASA plan to begin sending a modular base on the moon by 2020.\n\u003E From what I briefly read on the net, oxygen explosion is a possibility, so the explosion of helium or other volatil gas is probable.\n\u003E \n\u003E If a pocket is perforated and a technical incident(e.g: drilling machine, robot, life systeme) caused the gas to ignite, what could be the consequences according to you?\n\u003E \n\u003E I prefer giving my answer later, so I don\u0027t kill your imagination ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E * * *\n\u003E \n\u003E note: this post was translated from a french thread in the international forum.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you want to see the original thread, click [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82701-Hors-Sujet-Explosion-de-gaz-dans-l-espace-%28-le-vide-%29?p=1206319\u0026viewfull=1#post1206319)\n\u003E \n\u003E not 2: do not take this as a perfect translation, in case of doubt, check the original thread please.\n\nIf I understand you correctly you think of an gas pocket below the surface on moon, then drilling for oil this is pretty common, but rarely an issue unless you also get an fire or oil under pressure.\n\nNot sure how plausible this is on moon, also you get no fire risk and as the gas will enter vacuum then exiting the hole the only danger is small rocks propelled out by the gas.\n\nYou will not drill inside an dome, drill will probably be put on the back of an rover to drill multiple places. \n\nNow an gas pocket on an asteroid is more plausible here its also an real risk since the drill rig will have to be anchored to the asteroid to push down an gas leak might shoot the rig away from the asteroid. the bore hole would act like an gun barrel and push it out, in this case it would be very practical if the rig was an independent probe with rcs so it could get back.\n\nIf you had to do an eva to get it it might get too far away. \n\nagain no danger outside the rig itself."}]}
