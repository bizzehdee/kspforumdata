It certainly causes some limitations while designing. But along the way I got the following situation:  \n\n[url]https://docs.google.com/document/d/10P7jx3FySCUxW3tne66Xqvy6tbjs8qmyvUASnMbH2Yc/edit?usp=sharing[/url]  \n\nWhat you see here are Hitchhikers that are attached by radial attachment points, but because I have offset the hitchhikers, they wouldn\u0027t be accessible though them. In the middle you see structural fuselage parts, with the outside hatch of the hitchhikers facing into the structural fuselage.  \n\nI know this was not your intention, but I want to ask if for this part, you could make it so that a crew-able part cuts a hole in this IVA, even if it\u0027s not aligned properly or attached radially.[/QUOTE]  \n\nThat\u0027s an interesting suggestion. Allowing attachment to external hatches like a vacuum-capable [url=http://kkcdn-static.kaskus.co.id/images/2013/02/11/1422659\\_20130211075719.jpg]airbridge[/url] would provide lots of interesting building opportunities. Having parts specifically designed for procedual IVAs, like your hub that the hitchhikers are attached around, would be an interesting concept to play around with. You\u0027re not cutting holes through equipment, you\u0027re designing a tunnel specifically for a craft, with IVA hatches automatically being placed inside when you attach parts outside. It\u0027s a great idea and I\u0027d like to see what I can do with it in future.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027ronnie4444\u0027]I know we all want to ask, but fear of ban because bumps, so I\u0027ll go ahead and ask.
