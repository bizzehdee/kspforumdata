So, they were correctly treated as an invasion fleet with estimated time of arrival T\u002B200years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHumans built a near-Sun fleet of (sun-powered?) lasers and a fleet of missiles equipped with sails, going to intercept them in Kuiper Belt when they arrive.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut soon realized that sneaky aliens, before begin braking, released 100-kg kinetic shells made of carbon, moving to the Earth with 0.5 c. So, a century before the alien fleet arrival, the Earth was eliminated with kinetic bombardment, only occasional spacebases and .tribes survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the alien fleet speed dropped down and the ion flow had gotten weak, they disabled the magnetochutes and continued braking with what you\u0027ve described: either Annie or Hollie engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn such manner they happily arrived to the Kuiper Belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut human survivors engaged the laser transmitters and launched laser/sail shells in two waves. Shells were invisible to aliens due to the alienships torch radiation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst wave was homing into the alien engines, but missed. Alien realized that they\u0027re under attack and disengaged engines getting invisible for the second wave.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the first wave measured and transmitted to the second wave their exact coordinates, so the second range successfully hit the alienships with kiloton-range direct kinetical hits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut sneaky aliens were sneaky, and later the humans realized that they not just disengaged engines, but decoupled the ships (or maybe emergency capsules) themselves from the engine modules.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the missiles hit the engines, but aliens were not destroyed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey colonized near-Jupiter asteroids and began producing invasion bots mining the asteroid matter. But this was giveb up to humans by thin comet tails appearing due to gas wastes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe book describes how it then was going in this setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T05:29:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy123","CreatedById":154263,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T16:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222767139\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022111882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474435585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the sci-fi book which I\u0027m currently reading (Robert Ibatullin, \u0022Rose and worm\u0022) (I\u0027m spoilering it because anyway yet haven\u0027t found if it\u0027s translated into English, otherwise just would give a link).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it. \u00A0It\u0027s a very grim and depressing setting - but it also would make an awesome setting for a video game. \u00A0Maybe right after the primary fighting has stopped. \u00A0The reason is that video games need a setting where the amount of total art and assets needed is feasible for a studio of a practical size. \u00A0That\u0027s why the whole Earth, undamaged, with all the people and all the cities can\u0027t be in a feasible game - it would take too long and too much money just to model all that stuff statically. \u00A0Much less try to predict how geopolitical politics would go once the game starts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E feasible is if the earth has been pounded into a smoking crater oozing magma. \u00A0A few successful alien attacks have eliminated all the mega-group of survivors, leaving tiny outposts with a few hundred people in each scattered throughout the asteroid belt. \u00A0Something you could actually practically model, about the size of Diamond City in FO4. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a derivative of KSP - you\u0027d start out somewhere and have access to various scrap parts and have to device a spacecraft to get around in the asteroid belt. \u00A0Instead of science to unlock stuff you\u0027d go find wrecked equipment leftover from the fighting and have to scavenge for components...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally in the plot of the game there\u0027s a surviving group of aliens, and they are willing to talk, and your character gets a choice to either wipe them out or work with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T16:49:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T16:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222767793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022111882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474476519\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154263\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SomeGuy123\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, SomeGuy123 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it. \u00A0It\u0027s a very grim and depressing setting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E The book is quite optimistic, though.
