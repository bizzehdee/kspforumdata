And there\u0027s the question of how fuel tanks will even work in 0.20, since we\u0027ve heard that we won\u0027t need dedicated tanks for each fuel type and can instead just adjust the existing tanks for whichever resources we need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo expect a full wipe, and you\u0027ll probably have to make major adjustments to your existing designs.

The 0.20 resource system will be more complex than Kethane\u0027s one-size-fits-all approach, but the basic concept remains the same, and it\u0027s a good way to fine-tune designs for these refueling vessels. Once 0.20 is out, I\u0027ll just swap the Kethane tanks, drills, etc. for the new resource-specific versions, and I\u0027ll be done with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SwagBoiFresh","CreatedById":57140,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T21:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hugix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hugix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m in the process of building a spacecraft that can land on the top docking port, fill up with fuel and take it to a interplanetary ship in orbit to refuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must warn you, it will be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every\u003C/span\u003E difficult, nearly impossible, to properly land a heavy fuel tanker on top of those top docking ports.
