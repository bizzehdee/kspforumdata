The grind is real. Science is incredibly hard to come by until you can make a heavy SRB rocket that can break orbit / return (though this resulted in me making a almost entirely SRB rocket to get a munar flyby).

Since money isn\u0027t a problem, try upgrading your astronaut complex ASAP to be able to do EVA reports, this wil help science gathering considerable. Secondly, focus on unlocking more science equipment in the tech tree and milk all possible spots/biomes for as much science as possible (EVA reports, goo and mat bay in flight, upper atmosphere, space and space high over kerbin for example. That stuff alone is worth a ton of science). also don\u0027t forget that EVA reports near Kerbin vary depending on which biome you are over and give a respectable amount of science points. Get a ton of them in one mission by going out, taking a report, storing it in the pod, rinse, repeat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing these techniques I got into orbit after about 1 hour, mun flyby after 2-3.

The fun challenge is to get to the Mun with no manouver nods. That is hard, and its not grindy. Then, I found in 0.90 you hit a (dead end?)/wall when starting to go to other planets. With no dV calculator and no mods (since were talking stock here) it is just dead (too) hard to design a good enough rocket to take you to for example Eve, and if I somehow still manages to do that, it is too hard to aerobrake successfully around another planet. One little design flaw, or a periapsis a touch too low, and you lost a bunch of money with no way of reverting. I have a good solution for that problem, but this post is too long already.

Well, for me, I have played this game over 700 hours while it was still in alpha/beta (mostly alpha). For me, KSP was getting TOO easy. I could make a trip to the Mun look like going out to check my mailbox on the road. It was starting to get kind of boring, actually. I pretty much conquered every planet including Eve. This is a different challenge; being forced to use certain, lower-tier parts without maneuver nodes or flight engineer to try to get to some of these planets. I am enjoying the challenge so far. Once you get past the grind of the beginning and have the launch pad upgrade, things start to go more smoothly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just made my second trip to the Mun without the maneuver nodes including flying over a specific location, had to point the ship radial and figured it out on my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/73x47txlj/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s15.postimg.org/73x47txlj/2015_04_28_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015_04_28_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maolagin","CreatedById":129708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, put me down as another \u0022hard\u0022 mode fan.

The initial rush of automatic contracts from the worlds-first crew provides a nice cushion at the very beginning, after playing for an hour or so I\u0027ve got the first tech tier unlocked and could upgrade the launchpad if I wanted. But after that it\u0027s all payouts in the low thousands, so if I want to head into deep space I have some hard choices. E.g. a Minmus-first strategy might be doable with only 30 parts, but I kind of doubt I can bullseye Minmus without conics in the tracking center. Or do I grind out enough biomes on Kerbin to unlock the Stayputnik and start with robotic Mun landers?
