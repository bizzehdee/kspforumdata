I\u0027ll defer to wiser folk.  You do have multiple versions of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E in the install so I recommend removing all but the latest, but I believe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E detects and runs only the most recent version in your install.\n\nAm I correct that you\u0027re running on Linux?  Can you run KSP on DirectX instead of OpenGL?\n\nHow did you install your mods - manually or through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E?  Unless someone else has an easier solution, all I can recommend is that you start with a clean install (see below) and start adding mods in small groups until the problem reappears.\n\nI do have a suggestion for you:  Never run KSP directly from the Steam install.  Instead, download and keep the Steam KSP directory pristine, then copy it to another folder.  Mod and play the copy.  This prevents Steam from updating your current game when you don\u0027t want it to.  This is less important now than when KSP was being updated frequently but it also reduces multiple, excessive Steam downloads.  If you\u0027re on a limited or a metered connection, this will save time and money.\n\nThis copying is legal to do.  You can have as many versions of KSP as you want as you play different KSP versions, mod combinations or game experience experiments without compromising your favorite saves.\n\n[@ThatBattleCow](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/222095-thatbattlecow/)please read the posts above yours for some initial steps you need to take so that others can help you sort that out."},{"CreatedByName":"tilliepops","CreatedById":222034,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T07:43:56Z","Content":"[@Brigadier](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147109-brigadier/) im useing a windows computer"},{"CreatedByName":"JeyJeyKing","CreatedById":194026,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T12:00:44Z","Content":"Is it possible to enable the sunflare in flight, but disable it in the map?"},{"CreatedByName":"tilliepops","CreatedById":222034,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T16:53:56Z","Content":"[@Brigadier](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147109-brigadier/)ok so i uninstalled all my mods but it still looks like this:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qYud4r0WJMVMyFrDmKAsHr6QvX0dkP6/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qYud4r0WJMVMyFrDmKAsHr6QvX0dkP6/view?usp=sharing) has this ever happend to anyone? and does anyone know how to fix this? my log is here:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BL5-aCD0atOJRzKQyRm1gfoxyTAaaA8/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BL5-aCD0atOJRzKQyRm1gfoxyTAaaA8/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-11T17:39:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2022 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by tilliepops**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Benzo Kerman","CreatedById":218403,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T19:09:37Z","Content":"[@tilliepops](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/222034-tilliepops/) it looks like you still have Kopernicus installed, try removing that.
