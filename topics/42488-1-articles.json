But no matter what I try, the rocket will either continue flying upwards, or be pushed into the ground by the downward rockets... I can\u0027t seem to balance it out. I tried wings for a bit but they didn\u0027t improve much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there any trick to this, has anyone else tried to do this and got it to work? Would adding some more wings, or something help? Is there any way to calculate how many rockets I would need to counter each other out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E( If Pictures would help, I can try to post them)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T17:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo much thrust. Perhaps you should go for a traditional hover design with lifting engines only? If there\u0027s any need for downwards-pushing engines, it\u0027s only to compensate for too much thrust from the lifting engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T17:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, I don\u0027t see the need for down-thrusting engines. Just fine-tune your throttle till it\u0027s moving as little as possible.. and have some RCS fuel and thrusters to give yourself lateral velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T17:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy way, no. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifficult way, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve done it is downward facing engine(s) and then throttle control. The lighter your craft becomes, the more you have to throttle down, like a regular lander. I built a hoverbike of sorts where I also added rocket engines forward and back, then toggled what direction I wanted to fly by switching on/off action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more engines you add the harder it becomes to fly though, VTOL aircraft as such are easy enough since you\u0027re either taking/off landing, hovering, or flying forward, where only the latter uses horizontal thrust. But trying to multitask a lander/hoverbike where you have to focus on craft attitude, speeds, altitude and toggle engines on and off is quite difficult. Been there, done that, sticking with simple landers and VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T21:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a stock VTOL flying bedstead thingy you can load up and try out, it hovers fairly well, maybe giving that a try and lookies will give you some ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T22:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would ask what engines you are using and how big is your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently tried making something a bit like that. Tried various forms of jet engines to hover but I found their changes in thrust to be hard to keep steady with , they also seemed to require larger crafts (mostly because of the size of their smallest tank). Rockets however the little orange ones did the trick for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t expect the four little rockets to shoot up so fast so I got kinda high but landed, re took off and was flying around sub 50m until I ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qRqLmzZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qRqLmzZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
