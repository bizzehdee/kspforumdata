I don\u0027t think it worked. Your framerate is visibly stuttering (getting what, maybe 12fps there?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the shots looked gorgeous, but as a video it\u0027s just dull - nothing going on but watching a satellite orbit from different angles. Nothing terribly dynamic going on with the camera work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMusic\u0027s alright, but it doesn\u0027t \u0022sell\u0022 the video to any real degree, it\u0027s just background music.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Downscale. 4k is pretty, but barely a handful of your potential viewers are going to have that capability. I was watching in 480, personally, and my monitor only hits 1080p \u003Cem\u003Emax\u003C/em\u003E - but my internet would choke and die before allowing that level of streaming from Youtube anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mind your framerates. For LP\u0027s and how-to videos, you can get away with a choppy framerate, but for cinematics, it\u0027s essential for things to flow smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Consider the purpose of your video, and plan your shots accordingly. There was no theme or emphasis going on at all here that I could see, which made the whole thing feel rather pointless. Pretty, but without meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you find some of that helpful, and good luck with your next vid! \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/PWI/tigers/mustache.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022mustache.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
