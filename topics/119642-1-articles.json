Every part could have an right click menu option \u0022Add to staging\u0022 which would add appropriate icon to staging thingy, like currently engines, decouplers and fairings have. Additionally, it might be interesting to be able to add action groups to staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could improve mission planing during vehicle design and avoid silly little mishaps like forgetting to deploy solar panels. Additionally, this would extend staging beyond current \u0022vehicle\u0022 stage into \u0022mission\u0022 stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T11:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes please.

I wouldn\u0027t want to hit action groups through staging though, I\u0027d rather that the staging could DIRECTLY issue commands to the parts. Like nothingSpecial\u0027s comment about closing panels - being able to add the \u0022retract panels\u0022 right click command directly to staging would be cool. Having to waste an action group on that would not be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this brings up another problem: many parts don\u0027t have absolute commands, they\u0027re mostly toggles. All parts with commands should always have an \u0022enable\u0022 and \u0022disable\u0022 command.

Even the stock parts are not consistent in their commands, one set has an Enable/Disable set of separate commands, where the other has a Toggle command that does not change if you trigger it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, a consistent, and clearly documented set of available commands would be important if you want to do more with staging, or with other \u0027standard\u0027 interactions such as IVA, EVA or docking. Most of those command sets are now just discovered through reverse engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, having a specific action group that triggers on a specific stage (as opposed to the \u0022Stage\u0022 action group) would be a useful workaround.
