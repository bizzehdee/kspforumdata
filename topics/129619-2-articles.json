Leaks aren\u0027t a problem, since hydrogen leaking from the buoyancy modules would simply rise even higher. I am not picturing any hab modules, with oxygenated environment, located above any buoyancy modules. There would be a need for all sorts of serviceable systems up top, like the landing decks, solar farms, etc, but it would be far safer just to send people in hazmats with air tanks up there than actually filling any of these walkways with breathable air. Fire is the last thing you want in a place like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the ascent crew capsule, I see two options. Once we have heavy traffic between LVO and cloud city or cities, a reusable entry vehicle might be desirable. In that case, that would have to be the crew capsule for ascent ride as well. In orbit, it\u0027d dock with an orbital station, where crew would transfer on, with fresh crews using the same vehicle for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, for early operation, this is a lot of extra weight and resources. Instead, the entry vehicle would be brought from Earth, it would land at the city, and have its aerodynamic and heat shielding parts stripped and recycled, leaving just the bare crew capsule. That crew capsule would be mated to the ascent rocket, saving dramatically on weight, while still reusing the life support, avionics, and docking components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn either case, yes, this is a pretty large rocket to air-launch. It might be a good idea to deploy it on its own balloons first, letting it drift away from the station before firing the engines. Won\u0027t be cheap. But that\u0027s just more reason to try and keep the city as self-sufficient as possible, to require minimum rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T05:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would an incoming crew rendezvous and dock their crew capsules to a cloud base?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T06:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222356779\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129619\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452489833\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, fredinno said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would an incoming crew rendezFantasys and dock their crew capsules to a cloud \u00A0csase?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres a silly thought... a really big firemans net held aloft by baloons... the pod lands un the middle, IS caught and made mostly boyant, and IS towed to base by airships practically straight from Final FanTasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore realistically, it would just do a SpaceX propulsive landing on the base itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T06:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222356674\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129619\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452482937\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258968\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, AngelLestat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of experience.. those are the first flying machines we mastered.. 1910 tech. \u00A0They don\u0027t have bad records, in their time they traveler a lot of km carrying\u00A0thousands of people without problem, they had very bad fame for few cases, even with the highest accident hindenburg, only 1/3 of the passengers die.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey crashed just because they had something against which to collide (land), you don\u0027t have that problem in venus, neither winds.
