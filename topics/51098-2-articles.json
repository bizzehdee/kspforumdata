Other countries either didn\u0027t care for such a reactor, or didn\u0027t have the will to invest the huge effort and money required to make it a reality.\u003Cp\u003EBut the thorium reactor has a lot of advantages over PWR, producing much less waste, burning waste from other reactors, using a very common resource. The best advantage is that they don\u0027t use pressurized water as a coolant, which means no need for a pressurized vessel that can explode. If the chosen coolant is a molten salt, waste cannot burn and be carried by the wind as it binds to the salt that solidifies when the reactor stops.

Instead of recycling \u0022spent\u0022 fuel we waste it by pulling it out and holding it in big pools of water and have a criminally wasteful on-again off-again plan to permanently discard it under Yucca Mountain (or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter to the \u0022greens\u0022 that there\u0027s no water for thousands of feet beneath that mountain, and the tunnels have been carved into a layer of solid rock. The material might somehow, possibly escape, sometime, maybe in a few thousand years. I\u0027d like to think that long before then (if the facility ever gets used) that sanity would return to this and the nuclear material would be recovered for use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere already is a perfectly safe, non-explodable, type of nuclear reactor. The \u0022pebble bed\u0022. The \u0022pebbles\u0022 are about the size of softballs and have many small spheres of enriched uranium embedded in a graphite sphere. Around that sphere is a layer of ceramic and another layer of graphite - repeated to seven layers. There\u0027s not enough uranium in one sphere to be able to reach melting temperature and the shells are thick enough so that no matter how many are packed together, melting temperature cannot be reached. The heat transfer medium is Helium gas. If there should be a leak, it goes *up*. \u0022But what about cracks?!\u0022 \u0022There\u0027s no such thing as a nuclear pebble without cracks!\u0022. Yup. There\u0027s not. That\u0027s why the seven alternating layers. The odds of even one pebble getting a crack straight through all its layers to the center is very tiny. That\u0027s why pebble bed reactors have a system that pulls pebbles from the bottom, tests them for radiation leaks and if none is found the pebble goes back into the top of the reactor. If one is found to be leaking radiation (has one ever?) it\u0027s shunted to a shielded storage area. One of these reactors in Europe did have a problem with that system. IIRC a pebble got stuck but instead of calling in the people who knew what to do, the people on site decided they could fix it but instead damaged the pebble extraction system. Big stupid anti-nuke, media fueled broughaha followed and the reactor was shut down instead of being repaired. There was no radiation leak, nobody was in danger. The only people who should\u0027ve had any problems with it were the ones who didn\u0027t follow the procedures they were told to. \u0022This is your job. If something happens with anything not your job, you call in the people whose job it is.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Fukushima, if you\u0027ve seen some of the pre-tsunami file footage of the control room, you may have noted that it looks like it\u0027s technology from 40 years ago. That\u0027s because it *is* technology from 40 years ago. These plants were built then the anti-nukes have beset them ever since with lawsuits and regulations that have blocked any progress and technology updates. The damage caused by the tsunami and the results must\u0027ve been like a ******* ****** to some of the \u0022greens\u0022 so they could say \u0022See? I told you it was a disaster in waiting!\u0022. They care more about being \u0022right\u0022 in their wrongheadedness than actually improving people\u0027s lives. Some have wised up over the years, look up what the two guys who founded Greenpeace got into after they quit their own organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem Three Mile Island had was due to the even then aging technology. The control room had walls encrusted with controls, gauges and indicators. The lamp indicating the stuck open vent valve was on a different wall from where everyone was clustered, trying to figure out why stuffing more and more water into the thing wasn\u0027t working. When someone noticed the light and hit the manual override to force the valve closed, problem over but the reactor core was trashed. Only a small amount of radioactive steam escaped the buildings. The radioactive water was all contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, nuclear plants have taken so long to wend their way through the process of being allowed to be built that they\u0027re technically obsolete the day they first start generating electricity. The designs had to be \u0022locked in\u0022 years before construction could start. Looking at San Onofre and its premature steam generator tube wear, I\u0027d bet it was an issue some engineers were concerned about before the first shovel turned dirt on the site - but nothing could be done to change the design without delaying it for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA modern system, as seen in many newer power plants and factories, puts everything in view of the operators on computer screens. If there\u0027s an alert, it doesn\u0027t depend on a tech making a circuit of a huge spread of gauges, the alert comes to the tech on his or her monitor. If TMI had had even the (what would now be primitive) best technology available at the time, someone sitting in front of a screen of green or amber text would\u0027ve been flashed an alert about the stuck valve and there would have been no incident at all. Great idea but just try and get it added to an old nuclear power plant. Humans still have walk around and observe lots of separate and disparate things and make lots of notes. The 1977 TV series \u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022 likely had more advanced technology on its Galactica bridge set than TMI had in its control room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an analogy, compare the original flight deck of the first Boeing 747 with the flight deck of a Boeing 787. The old nuclear plants are still at first 747 level when they should have received complete control upgrades at least once a decade or even closer together. Big airliners get upgrades, ships get upgrades, the Space Shuttles got upgrades. But not nuclear power plants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0022can\u0027t change a thing\u0022 craziness doesn\u0027t just affect nuclear power plants. In the 80\u0027s a company with a furnace they used to burn their waste to generate electricity for their plant needed to replace the refractory burner grates. The furnace manufacturer was long out of business. New more efficient burners could have been retrofitted but nope, wasn\u0027t allowed. either the system had to be restored to the same condition as it was when installed or the entire thing had to be replaced with an all new system. I don\u0027t how they came to talk to my father about their problem but he was able to take one of the old grates, made some forms from sheet metal and cast some new burner grates that passed muster with the regulators.
