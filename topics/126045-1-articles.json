Came here to read up on some better designs and found out you all do some pretty cool stuff with challenges and all that. Admittedly I like the design and exploration aspects more than actual piloting so I rely on mechjeb fairly heavily (I get the mechanics required but suck at doing things manually). My biggest regret is that I have not moved on from minmus and the mun yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking forward to posting and hopefully contributing to this community, preferably without killing too many more kerbals.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T13:38:39Z","Content":"\nDuna requires very little extra dV compared to Mun/Minmus so you\u0026#39;re existing designs for there will need very little modification when you feel like venturing out. The most important thing about interplanetary though is getting a good transfer window ([url]http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/[/url]), you can\u0026#39;t just go whenever you like. The actual process of matching planes and doing a Hohmann transfer are more or less the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said, apart from the achievement of it - and particular challenges if you\u0026#39;re into them - I think a lot of us spend most of our time in Kerbin SOI as you can do all the cool \u0026#39;space\u0026#39; stuff there without having to do huge timewarps all the time (KAC mod is your friend when you have several missions on the go at the same time).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nETA: Oh yeah, and I use MJ all the time. Doing the same launches and manoeuvres can get tedious after a while but it\u0026#39;s worth learning how to do them yourself too. You know, just in case of equipment malfunctions.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T16:07:49Z","Content":"\nHello baronderpington, and welcome to the forum!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike Pecan said you don\u0026#39;t need too much more to get to Duna than you do to get to the Mun. It\u0026#39;s mostly just a matter of leaving Kerbin at the right time. I use [URL=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022]this web page tool[/URL] for that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI look forward to your contribution to the community.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The troubled by ram guy","CreatedById":153934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T16:54:49Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;ve spent around just 4000h in the game but just joined today. As an advice, go and see the \u0022To the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u201CN\u0022 tutorial and there the KERBAL will explain that the process to transferring to other planets is same as going to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u201CN but just on a larger scale. I also agree with Pecan that you should have MechJeb. It is by far helpful and user friendly. Another thing is you want to install MechJeb and MechJeb embedded. This removes the hastle to attach a MechJeb part to every ship or probe.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs everyone, happy KSP!!! \u003Cbr\u003E\nSoon you will discover what\u0026#39;s it\u0026#39;s worth and see that you get attached to ksp really quickly.(hopefully lol)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T17:08:54Z","Content":"\nHello The troubled by ram guy, and welcome to the forum!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGlad to have you aboard.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n"}]}
