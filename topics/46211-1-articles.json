After some probes and a succesful manned return mission I now want to set up a permanent colony on Layhte and explore from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, during the manned return mission I barely managed getting back into orbit around Laythe. I was really confident that I over-enginered the ascent stage so that was quite a surprise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat made me wonder if my launch profile could have been more efficient. I just winged it during the last mission, starting the gravity turn at 8km where I went to an 45 degree angle. So was this a wrong move? Or did I just underestimate the requirements of getting into orbit around Laythe? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T15:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was testing my lander for Laythe, it was actually made for Tylo with Laythe as an afterthought, simply with the addition of parachutes. (Granted, it was a rocket-assisted parachute landing...) The benchmark of those two landing-takeoff requirements is having enough delta-v to be able to be used as an SSTO from Kerbin. If you can launch your Laythe lander from the Launchpad into LKO without havnig to stage anything, it has enough power to get into Laythe orbit with fuel to spare, or land on Tylo if you \u0027don\u0027t spare the horses\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027d be horribly botching the math for this rough approximation, but in my playing, I do my gravity turns to 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 10km on Kerbin, 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 20km and 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 45km. With Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere terminating at ~70km, scaling these values down according to Laythe\u0027s atmosphere terminating at 55km, you\u0027d begin your gravity turn at 8km to 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 16km to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and to 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 35km. Then again, the counterpoint to all of this would be the fact that I am one of those who actually will trial-and-error savebomb rather than actually planning an ascent and such with math.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
