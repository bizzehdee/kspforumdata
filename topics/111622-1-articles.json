Your ascent profile needs a lot of work, but that\u0027s the least of your worries. \n\nThere is a major bug occurring it seems upon which I\u0027ve never seen before. It\u0027s almost as if your crafts center of mass gets ejected 50 meters from the craft. The camera goes nuts and the rocket seems to spin around your new remote CoM. \n\nNot sure how to troubleshoot that. Never seen it before. For starters get rid of all those extra module managers. Then work your way down that list removing mods until that stops. Give the debug menu a look too and post logs if something is a miss or is throwing null reference exceptions.\n\nSo get that straightened out then fix your ascent profile because you will flip. You are waiting WAY too long to begin your turn. You need to start turning around 500 meters max.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:32:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"}]}
