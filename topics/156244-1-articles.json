ESA wants to start a moon colony with much of the rest of the world. They want it to be a joint operation somewhat like the ISS but NASA has other plans. They want to go to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if we play how NASA wants to play, I think they should start with the moon. Go along with ESA. But if we play like SpaceX, then we\u0027re definitely going to Mars. NASA won\u0027t get us to Mars with their billion dollar expendable rockets, SpaceX will with their Gigantic re-useable Mars colonial transporters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes. I believe ESA has the right idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
