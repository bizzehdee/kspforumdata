That would be much more usable than what i tried; I was going off of theorized real world stats, so activation at ~1750m/s, TWR ~2, ISP of ~1000, which meant I found myself needing to use ESTOCs on rocket mode to get up to speed, and at that point, why not just continue to use the ESTOCs?\n\u003E With the emissives constantly emitting, are you trying to stick more than one particle emitter in your FX? I discovered that things like shock diamonds have to be their own FX, and then you use a FXMultiparticle module to combine them when the engine is running.\n\u003E \n\u003E @Cuky; Yeah, I figured it would be something like that, considering the size of mk2 wings. Heh, now I\u0027m going to have to throw in some mk3 wing segments as well...\n\nI basically copied the ESTOC part file and have been modifying it. Why bother building a whole new file, after all?
