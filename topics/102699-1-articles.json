Out of the choices presented, Eagle is the only one worthy, but even that sounds like too much of a Falcon rip-off. Besides, it would take away from the immortal words, \u0022The Eagle has landed.\u0022 One of the suggestions in the comments is Thunderbird, which I quite like and would be very appropriate. But I have to think that \u0022Delta-V\u0022 would be a very punny name for a rocket, but maybe that\u0027s why they wanted to stay away from that.\n\nAny other suggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:19:10Z","Content":"Given that this is sort of replacing the Delta 4, I have to agree with you.
