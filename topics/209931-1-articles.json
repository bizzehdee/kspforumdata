(In fact since the question was about visual uniformity by \u0022nonstandard cladding\u0022 he probably means things like the experiment parts that have their own unique part texture that doesn\u0027t appear on any other part.) It\u0027s not confirmed that you can custom \u0027paint\u0027 heat-shielding where you want it. The latest spaceplanes we\u0027ve seen were in the interstellar video and you can see that the MK2 parts have that visible heat shielding underneath but its not clear to me whether the procedural wings have heat-shielded variants. I think it could be very cool to have half-shielded variants of lots of parts including cylindrical fuselages, and it would just be reflected in the mass and max temp.

All you need is enough heat shield sizes to be useful with the various reentry-capable crew capsules, and maybe some more to cover the larger cylindrical fuel tank diameters. The space plane parts can, as I mentioned, just have a fancy paint job and a normally high heat tolerance, because most space planes IRL don\u0027t even use an ablative heat shield in the first place (well, neither the Shuttle nor Buran did anyways, and the X-34\u0027s heat shield isn\u0027t \u0022supposed\u0022 to ablate, but it \u0022can\u0022 if the temperatures get too high, and that\u0027s also how Starship\u0027s heat shield is probably going to work (as in it will also be an \u0022optionally ablative\u0022 heat shield)).\u003Cbr\u003E\nEND EDIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust me, I\u0027m not trying to be a pessimist here, but at the same time, KSP 2 isn\u0027t \u0022the ultimate accurate space flight simulator\u0022 and never was intended to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 2 is a Capital G \u0022Game\u0022, and a \u003Cem\u003Every much\u003C/em\u003E lower-case s \u0022simulator\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom that, not everything needs to be simulated super realistically.
