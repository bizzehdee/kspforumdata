But, I\u0027d like to be able to turn off the satellites for clarity\u0027s sake without turning off useful unmanned probes. I think they should have two separate categories."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:22:11Z","Content":"People have been asking for spaceplanes too, custom categories would be nice also."},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T08:56:18Z","Content":"I agree with both of you on that. The only option right now is to reclassify unwanted satellites as debris."},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrazine_Soup","CreatedById":91100,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T20:52:38Z","Content":"Or what about having the satellite automatically made \u0022uncontrollable\u0022 by the player once its in place? I mean, IRL launch contractors are done with the deal after the second stage has reached MECO, thats why It\u0027s a comercial launch, they pay you to put their satellite up there, not to put yours and after that make whatever you want with it.\n\nIt could even be toogled the same way rescue mission targets and asteroids are set before you aproach them, completelly uncontrollable, maybe add refuel, retrieve or repair missions, even a destroy satellite contract would be pretty cool"}]}
