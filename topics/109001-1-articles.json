But, I\u0027d like to be able to turn off the satellites for clarity\u0027s sake without turning off useful unmanned probes. I think they should have two separate categories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople have been asking for spaceplanes too, custom categories would be nice also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T08:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with both of you on that.

I mean, IRL launch contractors are done with the deal after the second stage has reached MECO, thats why It\u0027s a comercial launch, they pay you to put their satellite up there, not to put yours and after that make whatever you want with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could even be toogled the same way rescue mission targets and asteroids are set before you aproach them, completelly uncontrollable, maybe add refuel, retrieve or repair missions, even a destroy satellite contract would be pretty cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
