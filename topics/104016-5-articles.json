(Stephan Biesty and/or Richard Platt; I\u0027m not sure which book this illustration came from. And I doubt either of them has released it under CC or to the public domain.)\n\nHow much do you trust it? At a quick glance, I see that it claims the Saturn V first stage ran on paraffin (rather than kerosene) and oxygen. The paragraph labelled 1 for the first stage is a rather mangled description of the separation of the interstage on the bottom of the second stage (not usually considered part of the first stage at all). Seeing those right off the bat makes me think it\u0027s not useful except for very general illustrative purposes."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T04:43:37Z","Content":"Rokker\u0027s taken some really nice photos from his last trip to the museum, and has added descriptions to all of them:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135838-Some-reference-photos](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135838-Some-reference-photos)\n\nI\u0027m thinking of either adding a link to the entire galley as part of a new subsection, or individually curating each image into the existing subsections.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T15:20:06Z","Content":"IMO As a collection it would be better placed in the dev sticky along with all the other reference material.\n\nAlternatively I could move all the reference material from the dev sticky to the engi sticky, and just add the link to the album.\n\nPersonally I would prefer to see the images added individually with labels and arrows.\n\nOr both.

(The answer is still unclear but I\u0027m leaning toward no.) \n\nAnyway, my whole desire to do mods was that I thought it would be cool to make mods that had cool moving bits. Well, since I know more about cool moving bits than how to make mods, I figured I\u0027d offer to help make some.
