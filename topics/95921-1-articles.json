It handles great, takes off before the end of the runway, and is as light coming back to it as you would expect of a plane that shed 2/3rds of its mass without the CoM moving in the slightest. And you know, the compact shape is still kind of interesting, I especially like how the winglets came out, makes for a good-looking profile no matter the angle.

Only now that the engines arebunched together on the back, the flameout is even less of a thing to worry about, you can perfectly well time your engine switches by waiting for the sparks of total cutoff to come out of the engines (remember, first you switch the RAPIERs to rocket mode at about 1,500m/s somewhere between 25-30kms, then later you cut the turbojets when you are reaching orbital velocity). Note in the album how the \u0022performance proof\u0022 picture shows a rendezvous with a station at 100kms circular with all of 10m/s left in the tanks without tapping the payload\u0027s fuel, or much of the monopropellant.

I mean, it will handle perfectly fine at maximum payload, of course, capable of locking on to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angles of attack without issues and taking off well before you reach the SPH (at about 70m/s); but when you go with lighter payloads (it will put up anything you can fit in the bay, BTW)... \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E it maneuvers like a freaking jet fighter! While gliding like a feather. Seriously, incredibly noob friendly for 25mT payloads and smaller. In case you didn\u0027t know, the standard red tank payload is about 36mT (slightly more because of all the docking ports). Oh, and note how the tank payload I provide is not secured by struts and instead does a double-dock when you load it: that means you can bring full red tanks down to a surface without them moving around like spaghetti and protruding form the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and speaking of payloads, I took the liberty of coming up with one set myself: the Exploration Package. 25mT of go-where-you-please modular ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/EK955kl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EK955kl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EK955kl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/IFy4ESN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IFy4ESN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IFy4ESN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, a can lander with 3.5km/s in its tanks and TWR \u0026gt;0.90, and a nuke transfer stage that will give said lander another 3km/s without tapping its fuel at a decent 0.25 TWR. Do you guys like? It should look like this in space, though it\u0027s mostly untested other than fuel flow (it is simple enough that I feel confident it\u0027ll work, though). Duna-class missions should be a breeze, and I bet this could visit a lot of other places, Eelo included, if you know your navigation stuff. Maybe even Laythe, though I am not sure 3.5km/s is enough to make the ascent there after falling on chutes. Certainly any other sane place (No, Eve, I\u0027m not talking about landing on you and ever coming back).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just in case you manage to screw things up still (we all do), or for roleplaying purposes (and really, mostly because I was two parts shy of a round 175), I added and escape system (decoupler and chute) that ended up prettyfying the cockpit-hull interface. Check the last pics (or even better, the craft file) to see exactly how that looks, and remember to check the action groups before flying to see how everything works!

Continue until your heading is 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Listen to the music. Go get coffee, browse the web a bit. This part takes about five minutes with no player input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- At about 20,000m, start paying attention to your vertical speed indicator (next to the altimeter on a stock install, but a clearer one is the main reason I use KER). Don\u0027t let it go much over 100m/s, and remember the stock one is logarithmic: \u0027only a bit\u0027 to the right of 100m/s can perfectly be 180m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Start dropping the nose as appropriate so you bring vertical velocity under 50m/s at about 25kms. No need to completely level off. I find I stay at about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA over the horizon to do this part, but YMMV depending on how fast you got to this altitude. This is the part were you should get to almost or above 1,500m/s (surface) before the first flameout, and after some practice you also want to let your vertical velocity rise slowly so you get to the end of this stage moving quickly upwards. The faster you can make it here, the better, but once you start seeing sparks on the lower right engine and control becomes weird, you should press \u00273\u0027 to switch the RAPIERs to closed cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- If you waited till control was hard (greedy!), control will immediately return once you switch the RAPIERS. Keep at a 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle thrusting at full throttle and watch you vertical velocity rise. It is important that it rises quickly, having it over 100m/s at this point greatly diminishes aerodynamic drag and saves rocket fuel. At about 30kms and with the indicator either at 1800-1900 (surface) or ~2000 (orbit), you will get the second flameout. It is even more benign that the first, since airbreathing thrust at this point is only a small fraciton of the total. The main thing about catching it quickly is that you can save on drag by closing intakes with the action group \u00270\u0027, and save a few drops of fuel by cutting the non-functioning turbojets with \u00272\u0027. \u003Cem\u003ENote: as B.O.B. points out in the very next post, I failed to find out over the five or so test flights that if you don\u0027t drop throttle a tiny bit the RAPIERs can overheat in this mode if they are working together with the turbojets. Sorry!\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7- As you can imagine, form there it is a short push to the desired orbital altitude (I usually shoot for 75kms so drag takes it to the bare minimum, high efficiency 70kms circular). Circularize at apoapsis, deploy solar panels, from now on you have all the time in the world to remember to do things and take pictures. Hope you had a great flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will note that the vertical velocity method I describe here is basically applicable to \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E SSTO. The only design-related variables are the altitude at which you start the speed run, and the maximum velocity on airbreathers you design can handle, adn those are kind of fixed once you pick an intake-to-jet ratio and maybe vary a tiny bit with TWR (hint: I always use the same ratio, so all my SSTOs fly mostly the same). This just adds the extra twist of switching half my powerplants to rocket power while still using the others for a little (not so little, actually, saves me hundreds of m/s in rocket delta v) extra push, and no crazy flameout spins of death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you will notice that I was putting stupid obvious stuff in there to get to a decent number of points: this is dirt simple, and can be summed up as: get quick to 25kms in altitude and do the speed run there, and the order of action group usage is \u00271\u0027,\u00272\u0027, then \u00273\u0027 (at flameout), and then optionally \u00270\u0027 and \u00271\u0027 (at second flameout).

Very nice craft.\u003Cp\u003EI found, pulling the shielded docking port a bit into the capsule gives you a much more pleasing look. It is awesome how elegant and cleaned up KSP craft can look now with the new translation tools. No more z-fighting of to narrow attached parts and so... simply awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! It is a shame I took almost all the pics before coming up with that sinked decoupler as both the escape system and a very smooth finish between the cockpit and the crew module. I will try and update them as I fly this in my save. And I will also look into tthe docking port thing you mention... I move it around a lot since I usually build the payloads there, nice and clear, but it may be worth fiddling around with it afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. See?
