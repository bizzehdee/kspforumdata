This discussion is no longer relevant.\n\nI expect this may be nerfed in a future version, and correct me if I\u0027m mistaken, but with the release of 1.0:\n\nThe new ore tanks are overpowered. Not because you can refill them by mining (that\u0027s the idea, right?), but because they have a higher fuel fraction than other fuel tanks. This means that it is cheaper (dV-wise) to carry ore than it is LFO (liquid fuel/oxidizer).\n\nOre masses 10kg/unit and LFO masses 5kg per unit. The ISRU converts 1 Ore to 2 LFO, so the mass conversion ratio is 1:1. LFO tanks have a dry fraction of 1/9 (they hold 8kg of fuel for every 1kg of tank), or less for some parts. However, the ore holding tanks have a mass fraction of 1/12 for the small tank and 1/15 for the large tank. In other words, using large tanks you can store ore 67% more efficiently than you can store LFO. The mass of the ISRU and solar panels (or fuel cells), lets round that up to 5t (assuming you didn\u0027t have them already), offsets this a bit. But by the time you want around 200k LFO (100t, along with 12.5t of tank) or more, it is actually lighter to carry that mass in ore along with an ISRU and convert it along the way (carrying just enough of the heavier LFO tanks to hold the fuel before it is burned).\n\nNow this has some issues. One requires 1.7 ISRU\u0027s to continuously feed a single LV-N engine. To make the break-even point your \\*average\\* (see the next paragraph) acceleration will be around 0.3m/s at best (though it will improve as fuel is spent), or a TWR of 0.03, meaning it will take close to an hour of burning (over 20\u002B orbits, most likely) to transfer to Mun from Kerbin.\n\nThis can be offset by having a slightly larger reserve of LFO so that you can convert it slowly and spend it in bursts. Most maneuvers in LKO last 5 minutes or less (beyond this you can\u0027t make Oberth-efficient maneuvers), so stocking ~400 fuel per LV-N should allow this and cost only 0.1t extra per LV-N (you were already paying 0.15t for 200 units of ore tank, so you just pay the difference for the LFO tank). A single ISRU provides enough fuel for at least 18 engine-minutes of LV-N thrust per orbit of Kerbin (and much more at longer, higher orbits), so now you can use 4 (or more) LV-N\u0027s to achieve a modest (but playable, for the patient) burst TWR of 0.2. But remember that you\u0027ll be in shadow for half that time (when in low orbits) so you\u0027ll need extra solar power to compensate (or just use fuel cells, or expect shorter burns until you get to high enough orbits to have enough time to fuel longer ones).\n\nShould you do this for every large ship? Not unless you are willing to make long burns. But for fueling stations (or ships that already carry an ISRU), you should store as much fuel as ore possible. Suppose a 200t LFO-only ship has mass ratios 160:20:20 for fuel:tank:misc (where misc is engines, capsules, payload, etc) and a 200t ore-based ship has a ratio of 168:12:25 for ore:tank:misc (misc now includes an ISRU). The ore ship will have 9% more dV for the same payload and TWR while possessing an ISRU (or one could remove fuel to have equal dV while being 12% lighter, offering easier launching and higher TWR).\n\n--------------\n\nAs an added bonus, the ore tanks have a smaller form-factor (the 1500 unit large holding tank holds almost as much fuel as the 3200 unit LFO tank yet is half the size) and ore is basically free (500kg/cred vs 11kg/cred for LFO), though the size and cost of the ISRU and extra power offsets some of this. Also, by cost it is cheaper to convert all your LFO on the pad and recover the ISRU than to buy the fuel in the VAB.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T22:27:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arq**\n  \n1.0.1 update"},{"CreatedByName":"Khobai","CreatedById":83366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:07:54Z","Content":"I noticed this too.
