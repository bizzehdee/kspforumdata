They\u0027re very important to the workflow in SP, being one of the primary parameters controlling the procedural materials and you need to understand them so you\u0027ll know what to use when and why. Otherwise you\u0027ll beat your head against some problem and then go ask a question in the forums and have some guy say like, why didn\u0027t you just use a decal and set it to multiply? And then you\u0027d feel really stupid, not that I know anything about that, just saying it could theoretically happen.\n\u003E \n\nAlso you need to pay considerable, and I mean considerable, attention to the tutorials on properly setting up models for easy SP texturing. First, doesn\u0027t matter what material you assign to the model in the modeler, it will get blown away, so I just use flat standard materials roughly in the colors they\u0027ll be just for visual purposes in the modeler. And you want to minimize the number of materials, each one will turn into a big stack of RAM-eating layers. And in some cases as long as you\u0027re not under a tight poly budget, it makes sense to actually cut your model into separate elements based on your color pattern, it makes applying said basic pattern very quick to do and also allows individual control of those colors so you can churn out lots of color combinations as mentioned above.\n\nAnd when you bake your maps in SP, remember to bake a materialID map, it gives you another tool to quickly select what you want and mask things for your color patterns."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-09T13:20:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did it not work?

But there is an actual logic to the UI and workflow, and once you do get it you can do work very quickly. I remember flailing around working on it daily for a couple weeks before I started to get it, and by the third model I was able to do the work in a tiny fraction of the time the first one took. Best thing to do is just bury yourself in the tutorials and watch the key ones more than once.\n\nFor unwrapping, the best option is to not do it by hand- SP doesn\u0027t work well at all with unwraps where the sizes of objects are not normalized - i.e. you can\u0027t have one piece relatively larger than another, at least as far as I remember- I\u0027ve not been using it for last several months so the info is out of the hot and warm DBs and is in cold storage, so I need to go run through it again to de-archive the knowledge. There are many tools, most are standalone, in the $40-$80 range now that could easily handle unwrapping models destined for KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-10T18:57:43Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) So I am kinda new when it comes to working GitHub, is there a way to download a specific folder from a repository?

If you want to switch variants, you have to do it individually to each one. Not sure what the intent is there as there\u0027s only one variant and it at least appears to just be shorter. A useful thing for that control to do would be to give you heavy, medium, and light versions; no change to the rocket other than setting the various settable controls to give the player a max power version, one in the middle, and something close to as small/light as it can be. That would let the player quickly get within the ballpark of what they want and have only minor tweaks to do.\n\nAlso my game died last night when the UI locked up in the editor trying to use the MFT-BDB Bluedog tank.

I can always adjust the shaders to some degree, but regardless I will need SP to output textures that could be recolored.\n\u003E \n\nThere ya go.\n\nYes, SP is in essence a procedural texturing system, all materials are procedural to some degree, and usually to a great degree as you see from the number of controls available on simple materials and smart materials get even more complex. And you probably haven\u0027t fiddled with the filters yet, that\u0027s a whole other way to procedurally generate effects.\n\nA good way to get the basics of materials and surfaces is to just cover something in the basic paint material, and then start playing with the surface parameters and the metal/roughness, especially the scale on your generators, you can get wildly different results by controlling the scale of the effects. The paint material has all those basic controls and not much else, and it\u0027s really easy to see the changes as you mess around with the controls, and you\u0027ll very quickly begin to understand how to get anything from a smooth, shiny, slightly rippled surface to rough paint to dead flat very rough surface. \n\nHowever, SP is a tool where although it\u0027s fun messing around with materials, you can get much more done by downloading free ones and there are also people selling material collections, some of which are very much worth the money. The fact is they rapidly get super-complex and you\u0027re never going to understand enough to be effective unless you\u0027re willing to spend lots of time learning how their models work and messing around in Substance Designer. So you flesh out your material library until you have multiple options for all the types you\u0027re going to use, and at the same time make lots of alphas of the kind of surface details you need, things like interstage ribs can just be alphas you stamp into the normal map with a few clicks. I don\u0027t like bleeping over something like that but I spent some time with Designer and the people making materials are just uber geeks and you need to be very close to a physicist specializing in EM radiation to even follow the discussions. Once upon a time we did everything, now the field has started to develop a number of specialties where the complexities rule out learning much more than one."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-11T19:08:36Z","Content":"Hmm....\n\nLeft = SSTU-PBR Shader (using reflection probes and most of the Unity Standard Shader pipeline; going to rework to use cubemap for reflections)  \n\nCenter = Unity 5 Standard Shader  \n\nRight = Unity 4 / Legacy Reflective Shader\n\n![7l6Kbcs.png](https://i.imgur.com/7l6Kbcs.png)\n\nYes, I\u0027ve started working on a proper reflection-enabled shader setup.

As for the shaders, little bit of a difference between 5 and your PBR, primarily in the glossiness, otherwise very close. How does the recoloring work? One way I\u0027ve seen that done is the actual maps applied to the objects have only a series of pure color values applied, and the recolor logic knows (e.g.) for material 1 it alters any pixel with a hue of 255,0,0."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-11T22:07:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That sounds like you\u0027ve almost worked out a new workflow with SP?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve learned enough to know that the program will be usable for my purposes (and quite good for it too).

Next up will be adapting it to use standard/legacy lighting (non-global-illumination) alongside a cube-map for reflections.  The end result will likely have quite a few visual differences as compared to the Unity Standard/PBR shaders -- mostly due to the lack of GI and the use of cubemaps rather than reflection probes (I\u0027ll have to hack around the lack of GI somehow).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How does the recoloring work?\n\u003E \n\nUnder the current system -- the diffuse and specular textures have a base of flat gray (128,128,128), with details being either highlights or shadows (so basically grayscale), which is then used in the shader as an offset-additive-detail channel on top of a user-selected color.  So essentially the existing diffuse/specular textures are \u0027detail\u0027 textures, with the base color of the material set by the user.

Really glad you think it\u0027s going to work for you, I think with a bit more learning and some fleshing out of your material library, you\u0027re going to wonder how you ever managed without it, it hopefully will accelerate your process quite a bit and that means more cool parts for KSP with more cool functions and textures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 35 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Under the current system -- the diffuse and specular textures have a base of flat gray (128,128,128), with details being either highlights or shadows (so basically grayscale), which is then used in the shader as an offset-additive-detail channel on top of a user-selected color.

Your base maps sound like basically high-res AO maps, if you haven\u0027t already look up the function that allows you to isolate a map on the model, so you can see each of the maps you\u0027ve baked standalone. First it\u0027s a useful way to check your baked textures and to also see certain things about the model, one of them should be Ambient Occlusion. I have to think the AO map has to be real close to what you need for you base maps, or at least the process of creating those maps would involve blending down the AO map into it. Start with a simple flat drawing of the details, burn the AO map into it, should have grayscale version of your drawing with all the correct lighting highlights and shadows."},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-11T23:28:22Z","Content":"Also, a request that should be quick to do - can you put an arrow or some other indicator on your probe core that shows which way it\u0027s facing?

You can remove the RESOURCESET -- those are simply to make it easier to add lots of resources to a container at one time.\n\nThe bit you are missing would be (add this config node to a new file / as a root node in an existing file):\n\n    SSTU_FUELTYPE\n    {name = MethaloxRESOURCE{\tresource = LqdMethane\tratio = 9}RESOURCE{\tresource = Oxidizer\tratio = 11}\n    }\n\nThat is what adds it to the fuel-type slider.

Set up the ratios properly (7:2 as you listed in your post), and it should be good to go (must be an integer ratio; decimal values are unsupported).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, a request that should be quick to do - can you put an arrow or some other indicator on your probe core that shows which way it\u0027s facing?
