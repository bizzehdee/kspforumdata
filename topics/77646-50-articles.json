As soon as we have a mockup growth chamber (sealed environment, dark, IR lighting, etc) he can provide me (for free) samples to begin growing in the controlled environment here on Earth for test purposes. The moment we begin performing tests like this, he can take that data to his contacts at NASA and believes strongly that he would be able to obtain funding to have at least one grad student working full time on engineering specific strains of the mosses in question for our experiment specifically. So we would be able to launch with multiple strains of heavily selected gravitometric responses (up, down, doesn\u0027t care). These strains would also have a measured history of how they normally perform in an Earth based gravity environment. These strains, the dishes, and other plant gear (phytoagar, sucrose, etc) would likely be able to be provided to the project free or at heavily discounted rates.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent.

It is a hack I\u0027ve done before that makes for an interesting set of night vision cameras) as the infrared light is largely ignored by the plants, or we can turn on normal light whenever taking images.

However, with the samples in question (they are quite small) with the volume that he showed me in the enclosed petri dishes (think maybe 1.5-2.0 times as long as a quarter and 5-10 mm thick) the sample has enough air to live and grow for 2-3 weeks. Given that our flight window is a somewhat unreliable 1-6 weeks and that we may have the sample dishes open to a common atmosphere of \u0022large\u0022, we probably don\u0027t actually need to care about providing a system for controlling the air quality unless we really want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, that sounds promising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Additionally through the use of a mesh netting referred to as a phytoagar keeping the samples moist will likely not be a problem as well. The phytoagar allows the free flow of air, but effectively prevents the passage of moisture. If the moss samples were to start with some water and the phytoagar started wet, we likely would not need to worry about watering the moss over our mission time. Providing sucrose to the moss in the required amounts for our mission time is similarly easy (just a matter of how much we stick on any dish). So really all we have to worry about for the most part is keeping the temperature stable to something roughly approximating room temperature.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, OK, the moss is sounding a lot more viable than I had expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-20T22:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2014 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NERVAfan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremove extra quoted text, added comments on conditions; survival time in the dark\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAwer","CreatedById":91122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T22:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis wouldn\u0027t be a cubesat, but it\u0027s certainly another possibility.
