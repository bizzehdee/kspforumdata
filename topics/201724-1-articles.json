How cool would it be if new planets started out as wobbly smudges of light or even just \u0022we know this star gets dim in association with a 2:3:5 orbital resonance.\u0022 instead of being able to see the most minute details already in the map screen. You wouldn\u0027t know what you\u0027re getting into until you\u0027re already 90 percent of the way there. It certainly would add to the feeling of discovery. Imagine going to a star that was assumed to only have two planets and it turned out there were twelve smaller ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-15T09:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSection 2 paragraph 5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4851603115\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199981-kerbal-space-program-2-knowledge-repository/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing more is currently known\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-15T22:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t there a KSP mod like this?
