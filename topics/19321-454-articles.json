It\u0027s not breaking anything, so no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe menu you are talking about is only to set it to act as a flap. It will automatically deploy to the 2nd flap setting (takeoff), however flaps deploy slower than regular control surfaces to make deploying / undeploying flaps less severe on the vehicle\u0027s flight characteristics, especially considering the large deflections they will often move to. However, due to errors on my part if the control surface is changed from being a flap while it is still deployed it will not return to 0, which I will fix.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh... ok, the slow deploy makes sense then. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ETwo questions: does the newest version have the fix for that issue? And would adjusting the setting involve action groups then?\u003C/span\u003E Guessing it\u0027s fixed with the deploy more/less buttons now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T12:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs there an in-depth video tutorial for the graphs and numbers btw.?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the Physics \u0026amp; Realism section of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1310-KSP-Mod-Installation-Log-Low-memory-usage-through-batch-files\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy mod list\u003C/a\u003E and you\u0027ll see a whole set of reference links that should help under FAR\u0027s entry\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T15:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust ruling things out - is FAR responsible for stock airbrakes not deploying in water?

Small technical question: I\u0027ve heard you\u0027re working on wing and control surface overhaul. Will you keep control surface actuator code untouched?
