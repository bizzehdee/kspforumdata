Since I am not using the default flag, this is slightly immersion-disrupting and quite annoying/disappointing. I understand this is likely a bug or simple oversight, but what I\u0027m wondering is if there\u0027s a way to fix it in the interim.

I do seem to have gotten my Flagpole displaying the correct flag, but the Launchpad is still a no-go.
