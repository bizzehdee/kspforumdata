No, they really don\u0027t satisfy me. As somebody who has spent a decent amount of time learning about art theory, it really doesn\u0027t feel like the new buildings have been thought out in a way that allows them to both be consistent throughout tiers and visually striking and memorable within the tier itself.

Secondly, the buildings themselves are markedly lower quality in terms of both pure technique and concept than what we had before - a lot of previously iconic buildings are made up almost entirely of primitives in a not particularly aesthetically pleasing way.
