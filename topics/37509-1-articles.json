It can be disabled through the advanced settings menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe opacity of all gauges can be adjusted using the slider in the main menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Settings Menu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Advanced Settings menu allows users to fine tune the gauges to their liking. Each gauge has a Scale slider that can increase or decrease the size of the gauge. Several gauges have additional options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Radar Altimeter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Green Light - Below this altitude and above the Yellow Light altitude, the green light illuminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Yellow Light - Below this altitude and above the Red Light altitude, the yellow light illuminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Red Light - Below this altitude, the red light illuminates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fuel Gauge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Fuel Lights R, Y, G - The red, yellow, and green lights on the fuel gauge light up below these values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Mono Lights R, Y, G - The red, yellow, and green lights on the mono propellant gauge light up below these values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Orbital Gauge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Safe Altitude - The green light illuminates from the top of the atmosphere up to this altitude above the atmosphere. For Kerbin, a value of 1.2 means the green light is on from 70,000m to 84,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Circularization Threshold - The AP and PE lights illuminate blue when they are within this percent of each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Burn Window - The burn lights illuminate this many seconds before and after the associated node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Rendezvous Gauge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Distance Lights R,Y,G - The red, yellow, and green lights illuminate as the target closes past the given distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuver Node Gauge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Throttle Delay: Additional burn time (in seconds) due to delay in throttling up the engines to 100%. Default value is 2 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen enabled, mouse input can be done by dragging the mouse over the center area of the HUD. Window positions obviously must be locked, otherwise it will move the HUD window instead.

This mode is available even where full HUD is not accessible because of career limitations or being in Map mode etc, and the hud toggle button also cycles through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Input is calculated from the distance between the mouse cursor and the center mark of the HUD.
