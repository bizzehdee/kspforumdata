Also reentry will damage a rocket leading to substantial maintenance costs. (Which is the reason why NASA phased out the space shuttle in favour of non reusable conventional rockets). So I am wondering: can I change the settings file somewhere to make those two changes: make fuel price around 5 times as high, and change it so that each vehicle is damaged by like 25% simply upon launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I\u0027m not sure if I posted this is the correct section - but I\u0027m not looking for a mod, just a manual edit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T10:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can definitely do most of the things you mentioned or even more.
