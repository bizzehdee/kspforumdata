In a rough description, I would say they handle almost like rockets - during a turn, they seem to maintain speed in the direction they were previously heading in, instead of maintaining forward speed but relocating it to the new direction of flight, among other oddities. I\u0027ve seen a few videos of people flying with modified aerodynamics like FAR and those aircraft appear to operate roughly as I would expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was testing a new plane earlier today and flew it up a few thousand metres high, then glided it back to KSC. Even during steep dives the plane lost speed without thrust, and sometimes appeared to gain speed when pitching up. My expectation was that one could trade altitude for speed when gliding, but this did not seem to occur, with speed loss remaining constant. I tried another test prior to making this post, this time using a different design, and placing it into a vertical dive with engines powered down. Again, it didn\u0027t gain speed and proved unable to pull up before crashing despite remaining fast enough to fly. (Contrary to expectations.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat specific example is possibly an oddity of the speed indicator rather than aerodynamics, but it lead me to wonder. \u003Cem\u003EHow do stock aerodynamics actually work? \u003C/em\u003EWhat are the general rules?

In reality, the formula for calculating the amount of drag force an object experiences is dependent upon the cross-sectional area of that object. More cross-section means more drag acts on the object. In KSP, this cross-sectional area relationship is replaced with the object\u0027s mass - i.e. more mass means more drag on the object. This simple change has some pretty substantial effects - for example, with stock aero, an plane that has a sleek nose will generate \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E drag than one with a blunt nose, because the nosecone is a separate part and adds mass to the craft.

With that out of the way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drag on a part that isn\u0027t a wing, air intake, or control surface is dead simple. It is directly proportional to the mass of the part, including any fuel or other resources in it, and the atmospheric density, and proportional to the square of speed. Orientation makes no difference, whether it\u0027s in a cargo bay makes no difference, a nosecone on a booster doesn\u0027t reduce the drag of the booster and does add the drag of the nosecone. There is a drag coefficient that\u0027s multiplied in but almost all parts have that as the same value, except for deployed parachutes that have a drag coefficient thousands of times higher to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is behind most of the unrealism in the aerodynamics model. For example almost all craft have the same rather low terminal velocity, the fuselage on a plane or body of a rocket will contribute nothing to stability, and the centre of mass and centre of drag will almost always coincide. It explains why picking up speed in a dive doesn\u0027t really work - the plane\u0027s \u0022streamlined\u0022 fuselage offers no advantage compared to a block of fuel tanks, and the overall drag level is so high it robs the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is better. Wings behave largely as you\u0027d expect, giving maximum lift at a certain angle of attack, though they don\u0027t really stall beyond that. Nearby wings don\u0027t interact at all, so don\u0027t worry about that. If you want more lift from the same wing span just slap two copies of the wing right on top of each other! Control surfaces, on the other hand, gain maximum lift at 90 degree angle of attack and can create thrust when deflected - the so called \u0022infiniglide\u0022 bug. This especially affects lightweight and/or low-powered craft, but it might account for your unexpected speedups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite all the issues people do fly planes in stock, but if you want a more realistic experience get FAR.

Hopefully jets will be nerfed to something realistic, since realism\u0027s what air-lovers seem to want, but as they are you need a different launch approach to getting them near orbit before switching to rockets.
