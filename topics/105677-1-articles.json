The probe in question must have the survey machine, which is located in the Science tab. An antenna to transmit data, and a lot of power.\n\nIf all goes well, you should see color overlapping the celestial body. Different colors mean different density of ores. \n\nAfter that, you need a craft with at least these 3 things.\n\nThe Drill, a Holding Tank (2 variants of it) and the ISRU converter.\n\nFind a suitable place (anywhere, even in the launchpad itself) and activate the drill. If all goes well, you see a new button appearing in the right-click menu. It might be start Surface drill or something along that line.\n\nThe drill automatically \u0022pump\u0022 ore into the holding tank, ready to be converted. Right click the converter and you see 4 (correct me on this) buttons. Convert to LFO, LF, O, Monoprop should be those buttons. Again, it maybe something along those lines.\n\nOne more thing, you can drill anywhere, but you will harvest more ore which are in more denser packets.\n\nTell me how it goes.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:04:08Z","Content":"Thanks for your answer.\n\nOne more question: If I converted to fuel, for example, I guess I also need to put a tank to my mining craft into which the ISRU can dump it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:17:03Z","Content":"That is correct.

I was able to run it producing monopropellant for nearly an hour (compressed) before it began to finally heat up. It took a while for it to cool back down. \n\nKeep it out of the sun and it will produce fuel longer. \n\nSolar panels can function as radiators, but I\u0027ve only found them to work like that while they\u0027re shaded. I put four XL Arrays spaced around the MK3 fuselage and rolled the ship around to shade them and they tended to cool off the ISRU faster than when they were fully exposed. \n\nAfter having played 0.23 and 0.91 for so long this new realistic heat engine is taking some getting used to."},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:17:44Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably producing so much heat because it is inside of a cargo bay. In my tests, I was able to convert 150units of ore into lf\u002Box in approximately 1/4 kerbin day. Using this metric it will take me apx 1 full day to produce 600 units, which means approximately a week to convert enough ore to fill an orange jumbo.\n\nOn kerbin, My solar components produced ~5-8 units of electricity per second optimally, using 10 1x6 solar panels\n\nthe ISRU drew something like 30.\n\nBecause of this, I could only sustain the converter for a few minutes before having to turn it off and wait for battery charge to accumulate. The drill is much less intensive on resources. Testing has also shown that the ISRU does not need to be directly connected to the processed fuel tank, so it works somewhat like monoprop\n\nMy design uses 2 cubes (-) to keep the engines and ox/lf [] tanks physically separated from the ISRU \n\n*[]-[o]-[]*\n\n*\\/*  *\\/*\n\n*Either i\u0027ve gotten lucky or my tests haven\u0027t revealed the same overheating issue as you guys have been experiencing - only electrical. I am wondering if your shut-offs are due to losing electric power. I have also experienced the issue where I can warp so long as i\u0027m not out of electrical power, and the ship will fill/convert infinitely, while my available charge does not change during this time (day or night).*\n\n*I will be launching this mining rig from kerbin to the mun this evening so I will come back and share my findings.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:40:05Z","Content":"Also, for scanning to find ore:\n\n1) Use the big dish scanner ina polar orbit to get the basic planet overlay\n\n2) Use the surface scanner in a high-density area to \u0027map\u0027 that biome (I think it does the whole biome)\n\n3) Use the narrow band scanner to get a map of the area showing where the percentage of ore in the ground around you"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:46:23Z","Content":"Does it still run hot?
