Start out with Scott Manley\u0027s first tutorial. You can fly unmanned vessels, but you\u0027ll need a probe core (same place as the capsules, under \u0022Command\u0022 and some form of power generation (under \u0022Utility\u0022)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T11:43:55Z","Content":"Welcome, cain546! The KSP learning curve is rather steep (some have called it a learning wall) and enormous fun. Docking is possible once the docking port parts are unlocked in the tech tree. There are many tutorials in the [Tutorial section](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/54-Tutorials) of the forums and in the [Tutorial section](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorials) of the wiki.\n\nGetting to orbit is the first step. Once you take that step, you can slowly learn to walk, and even run. Some videos assume a fairly high level of knowledge, but others start off slowly and introduce the concepts for the new player.\n\nFurther, there are several in-game tutorials that can significantly aid a new player who is getting started. If you have a specific question you want answered, ask it in a thread in the [Gameplay Questions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials) section.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:13:49Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP community!
