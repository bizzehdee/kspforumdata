You have been warned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s how Firespitters prop spinning basically works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you have two meshes on the part, one is the propeller stopped and the other is a representation of the prop rapidly spinning. The way the theory works is, you start the first mesh spinning. Once it reaches a certain point, you switch to the second mesh. The first mesh spins up to a high speed, say 250 revolutions. The second one, which is intended to be a blurry representation of the spinning prop, you spin at much lower speeds, say 30. The whole purpose of this is to have a nice, detailed model of the prop when it\u0027s stopped but also have a much less detailed, slower spinning representation of the prop at high speeds. The benefit is, you switch to a prop with a lot fewer polygons and a slower rotation in order to improve performance. Well, as with everything in KSP, it doesn\u0027t work in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to make a realistic representation, the second mesh, the one that represents the prop at high speed, needs to be somewhat transparent. If you look at a real propeller spinning, you see through the area where it is spinning and see the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would appear that water in KSP is also semi-transparent, which makes sense. The problem is, as I am discovering, when you take one transparent object and bury it within another transparent object, one of them vanishes. Here\u0027s an image showing the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/Props.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Props.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you see the problem.

After reading Ferram\u0027s reply to me bringing up the issue I\u0027ve been basically told that it\u0027s my fault (That or he tells me to try the dev build but doesn\u0027t bother to point out where to find it). Therefore, even though Ferram makes a popular atmospheric mod, IMHO he should have kept his paws in the atmosphere. Simply because he can\u0027t safely crash land a plane on water is no excuse for changing the physics of the entire universe (as we know it) and claiming it an improvement... and using the popularity of FAR to convince people it\u0027s how things should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027ll be testing some of Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy routines and see if that improves the flotation in Better Buoyancy.

Specifically about landing aircraft on ships. Since KSP is mostly a sandbox game about aviation and rocketry, it only seems prudent that a maritime pack support both of these. What I am bouncing around in the brain is a series of \u0027add-on\u0027 packs that add a collection of new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shall explain. Early in my KSP experience I fell in love with the B9 pack. It was great. At some point, B9 became hugely popular and it\u0027s dev\u0027s just kept adding more and more parts to the pack. IMHO, B9 is now to the point that it\u0027s so bloated with things I\u0027d never use (like the HX parts) that I uninstalled it many months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the ultimate solution would be a basic part pack, much like what Maritime is now. You get everything you need to have ships. Then, create add-on\u0027s, which also remain independent, like a carrier pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this idea, you\u0027d have a Maritime Pack folder under GameData with the basic parts. If you added on the Carrier Pack, for example, it would duplicate some parts in the Maritime Pack folder, but not all, and add it\u0027s own CarrierPack folder. That way, each could remain independent, yet, if the user chose to install both, they wouldn\u0027t end up with duplicate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy doing this, if you, the end user decided they wanted carriers but not yachts, you wouldn\u0027t have to install the entire collection of parts. But, if you did want yachts, you could install both. This is what I think B9 should have done a long time ago. Let me choose what to install and not just dump hundreds of parts on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the theory. So, reverting back to this being an aviation and rocketry game, I think carriers and... floating landing pads (ala SpaceX\u0027s barge) should be pretty high on the priority list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I have conveniently created a connection node on top of the basic hull, the current theory is to first, create a wide-body ship design and second, to create snap-on carrier decks that essentially bolt to the top of wide body deck. You\u0027d end up with something much like the old carriers, which did just that... bolted a flight deck to a normal ship hull.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T16:47:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Columbia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Columbia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMEIN GOTT!
