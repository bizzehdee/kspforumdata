This test was conducted by launching the pod unmanned, rendezvous-ing with a stranded kerbal and returning him to Kerbin. This was done from a 150x149km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a 4-kerbal version that I may upload later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-22T12:29:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2014 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sargent890\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OTehNoes","CreatedById":76153,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T14:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove that design Sargent, very efficient use of space!

It\u0027s suitable for typical space stations orbiting up to 150 km (although the reentry vehicle may be capable of deorbiting from higher orbits). It seats 2 kerbals, and has only the minimal set of heat shields to protect them. It has an attachment point on its bottom part, where it can be connected to other vehicles via docking ports or decouplers (used in my test).
