The only issue with that is then KCT would work properly, but a bunch of other mods would still be broken. The error popup was actually implemented to catch errors usually caused by other mods (like, 9 times out of 10) that then visibly break KCT but may not visibly break other mods, that are often reported as KCT errors. If I fixed KCT when other mods cause it to break, the player would still be playing with broken mods and might not even know, which undoubtedly would cause additional problems. Might not be worth it. /End Ramble/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddressing other issues: I\u0027ll take a look at the issues with buying more time and \u0022Warp To\u0022 causing trajectory changes. The first one isn\u0027t terribly surprising because it pauses the game instantly (except, so does pressing Esc and they work the same way). I don\u0027t recall if it resumes your last warp state or not if you purchase more time. If it does, I\u0027ll try resetting the warp to 1x. Warp To actually does ramp up/down time. It\u0027s just a very fast ramp up (one step a frame). I can try slowing it down, but there\u0027s a chance that it won\u0027t stop in time for short warps. I don\u0027t generally use it during flight, almost always at the Space Center or Tracking Station (if it\u0027s gonna be a few days and I don\u0027t want to watch the sun rise and set a bunch of times really fast), so I haven\u0027t noticed the problem myself yet.
