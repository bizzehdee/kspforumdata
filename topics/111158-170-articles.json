That way, next time you visit or reload the forums, you can see anything new that has been posted.  Some people just like having a clean slate when they log in.   It\u0027s standard in the forum software package, and enough people use it, there\u0027s no reason to remove it.    Other forums have a set time limit, so after that time (say 60 minutes) It assumes you\u0027ve read everything you are going to read, and marks everything as read.  \n\nI prefer the way we have it, because I can clear the board if I need to, or just leave it alone and ignore the button completely."},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-13T11:13:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, The\\_Cat\\_In\\_Space said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What do you each love about the forum?\n\u003E \n\nI love the atmosphere of mutual respect and the clean environment that is enforced by the forum rules. Without rules like we have it seems that every online discussion devolves into constant bickering, flame wars and insulting matches.

Here in this little corner of the internet, we have a generally peaceful place, which attracts a whole different crowd.

That is not, alas, the case in a pretty broad swath of the Internet-- it\u0027s why I generally don\u0027t participate in any other online forums but here.  Even though most people are basically decent-- even in those other forums I avoid-- the fact remains that the Internet is a highly effective \u0022jerk amplifier\u0022.  The result that the few toxic trolls and abusive nasty types who invariably show up, end up determining the tone of conversation.  No thanks; hanging out in an environment like that just leaves me dispirited and drained.\n\nWhich is why I love it so much here.  This is an amazing community-- partly because KSP is a fairly cerebral game that tends to attract the sort of thoughtful people I\u0027m likely to relate to, but also because *\u003Cu\u003Eit\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Enice\u003C/strong\u003E here and the moderation policies are set up to keep it that way\u003C/u\u003E*.\n\nI expect a solution like that doesn\u0027t scale.  It requires a dedicated team of hands-on moderators who firmly correct matters that go \u0022off the rails\u0022, which only works if there are sufficient moderators per capita to stay on top of things.  If this forum had millions, or tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of users... there\u0027s simply no way we could stay on top of it, which means the feast of reason and flow of soul would subside to the usual tone of the Internet.\n\nFortunately for those of us who enjoy it here, though, the forums are reasonably \u0022compact\u0022 and have a user base that seems to hit the \u0022Goldilocks zone\u0022:  enough people to make for interesting conversation, but few enough for it to be moderatable.\n\nOne thing that struck me, when I first became a moderator here:  I was expecting to see the \u0022seamy underbelly\u0022 of the forum, all the nasty stuff that the mods keep safely out of public view.  And yeah... there\u0027s a certain amount of that.  But what surprised me was how *\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E* of it there is.  I mean, sure, there\u0027s nastiness that crops up here from time to time, but on the whole, there\u0027s considerably less than I might have expected.  People here really *\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E* nice, mostly.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to sort out cause-and-effect.  Maybe the niceness is because nice, interesting people are just naturally attracted to this game.  Or maybe the fact that we\u0027re so vigilant about toxic trolls and abusive jerks means that those types quickly lose interest when they see that they can\u0027t call the shots, and wander away-- giving the basic default \u0022niceness\u0022 of people more opportunity to shine through.\n\nWhatever it is... I like it, a lot.  Which is why I\u0027m still here and still actively reading the forums after all these years."},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T03:04:34Z","Content":"Stupid question...(kinda)\n\nWhat\u0027s a \u0022Profanity\u0022 ???"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T05:25:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, GRS said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Stupid question...(kinda)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s a \u0022Profanity\u0022 ???\n\u003E \n\nCuss words."},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T05:53:22Z","Content":"Thanks mate."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T09:57:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Cuss words.\n\u003E \n\nOn that topic, I\u0027ve noticed four different recent instances of people posting variations of \u0022god damn\u0022.
