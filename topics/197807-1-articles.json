No matter what engine I use no matter what rocket I use every time I launch there is a terrible cracking noise and it\u0027s annoying the heck out of me and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a setting in the audio normalizer that I need to fix because right now I\u0027m running at threshold of 1.0 and responsiveness is 16. I have literally adjusted every slider I can trying to figure out which one is making that noise and I can\u0027t figure it out can someone help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HUG","CreatedById":149279,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-10T21:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only have this noise at certain engines, also on the one X. The big launch stage engines \u0022Twin Boar\u0022 and \u0022Mammoth\u0022 to be precise. I also find it a bit of a bother but since it\u00B4s only those two engines it wasn\u00B4t a big deal. For certain it isn\u00B4t at all engines. If you say you have it with all engines I\u00B4d maybe suggest to check your xbox audio settings?! Maybe you want to try to simply set all xbox video and audio settings back to default and have a look if this solves the issue and if not...idk...reinstall? But I reinstalled the game more than once when I experienced something weird and it never helped so don\u00B4t put too high hopes in it. But I had problems with some xbox settings I once changed and forgot about it and these actuallly always turned out causing problems with something. I\u00B4d place my bet on this one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
