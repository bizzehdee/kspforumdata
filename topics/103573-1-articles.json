I\u0027ll have my landing gear be one degree off (according to B9\u0027s alignment tool) but be unable to adjust the one degree out. This inevitable leads to my aircraft and spaceplanes flipping over on the runway. I would like to see landing gear that auto-align themselves with the longitudinal axis (i.e. nose to tale axis) when I place them. I\u0027ve spent over five hours trying to get my landing gear aligned for an otherwise exceptional SSTO. I shouldn\u0027t have to launch it on top of a rocket to test fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T02:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a simple solution to this, you will love it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace the landing gear however you wish, then select the rotation gizmo and click on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, press F to put the gizmo on \u0022Absolute\u0022 mode, and turn on angle snap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to rotate the gear and it will snap to angles relative to the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply snap it to be perfectly straight relative to the SPH and it will be always right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also do that to fix any other angle or part you place on your craft, it\u0027s very easy to use \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was too unclear please ask and I will try to explain in some other way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
