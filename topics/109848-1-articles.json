I gave Jeb the simple task of taking 4 tourists on a little trip around Kerbin, and around the Mun! Bill made objections, saying that while we with the Hitchhiker could take the 4 eager wannabe explorers on the trip, our still very limited technology would be a problem. Naturally Jeb been to the junkyard and taken off way before such concerned could be addressed.\n\nAnyway after leaving the Mun, Jeb accidentally ended up with too little fuel to actually encounter the atmosphere. With no system capable of tracking orbits, and no RCS progress beyond the compressed air can tapped to a cardboard model, rescue seem unlikely. However Valentina, clearly no stranger to having to clean up Jeb\u0027s messes, volunteered to try and get our ace pilot and his flock back safely.\n\nLess then 30 mins after, Valentina had located, and pushed Jeb into a suborbital trajectory with Kerbin. A total success! (Even though the hitchhiker module didn\u0027t survive reentry.. but hey its an achievement!)\n\nAnyway I find it very fulfilling to see myself navigate space to another craft, with a very eccentric orbit, with no orbital information, and manage to reliably pushed it for 450 m/s stably with no RCS system. I remember when docking was almost impossible for me (took me 6 hours of trying, AFTER getting in range, the first time I did it). This truly showed me that having played this game, has taught me a lot about orbits, while I had fun doing it. I wish more games were like this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
