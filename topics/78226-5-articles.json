I\u0027m assuming your concern is with the amount of funds you get on recovery (since it\u0027s based on distance to the launch site). Assuming that RSS doesn\u0027t manually override the stock recovery code, it should work the same (this calculates the distance from the Space Center, so if RSS sets the Space Center location then it would work perfectly. If RSS overrides the stock code to check for a custom location instead of changing the Space Center location, then there will be issues). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be to try it for yourself by launching something straight up and dropping a stage along the way. When it gets destroyed for being on rails you should be alerted to it (check the SR GUI) and you can check the recovery percentage (separated into speed and distance on the Info tab). If the distance percentage is about 98% then it is working fine (98% is the maximum for stock, except for the launchpad or runway which net 100%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t know the height at which things will be destroyed in atmosphere with RSS. The code here requires an altitude of less than 35 km (why? It\u0027s stupid and I should change that. It was something I added waaay back in KCT and then never changed). If it gets destroyed (not the same as being dropped. Stock altitude for destruction is about 23km) above that it won\u0027t try to recover it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Pink Ranger","CreatedById":116650,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T20:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlrighty.

Any stages made up entirely of parts in the ignore list won\u0027t attempt to be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reworked the flight-GUI a bit. Made it smaller, draggable, and minimizes to just the list until a stage is selected. Hopefully even less intrusive now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Found a general solution to the fuel use problem for powered recovery. Can now handle engines that require any fuel amounts without being CPU intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Forced no checking on scene change. Should fix erroneous messages appearing on scene change for some users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ignore list can be edited in-game in the space center scene. If a stage is ENTIRELY made up of ignored items then it will be completely ignored by SR. It just matches the names of the parts to the names on the list, and only a partial match is required. By default, \u0022fairing\u0022 and \u0022escape system\u0022 are on the list, but you may want to add \u0022decoupler\u0022 or things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight GUI has been tweaked a bit too. It\u0027s draggable now and a bit smaller. It\u0027s also just the list until you click on a stage, then it shows the full info. Hopefully this is a nice change and less intrusive than the previous version (which is still WAY less annoying than constantly getting messages. I still recommend disabling them unless you really like the messages)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
