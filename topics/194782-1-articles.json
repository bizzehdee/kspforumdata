The mission actually went pretty well I didn\u2019t the Jool encounter time. And I didn\u2019t land in the water on Laythe. So I reached the Jool system after 3 in game years. I got into a orbit around Jool stayed there for a few minutes then went to Laythe. During landing though the heat shield started spinning but it wasn\u2019t enough to flip the probe upside down. Once that was done I jettisoned the heat shield and deployed the parachutes. I ended up reaching the surface but ended up landing on the hill and flipping over. I had no things to flip me back up so I loaded my last quicksave. During reentry I forgot to retract my antenna and it broke. I loaded the quicksave again the heat shield did the sane thing. But I landed upright and immediately realized I should send Jebediah here. And it was two hours later when I realized I got no pictures.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-16T07:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations!
