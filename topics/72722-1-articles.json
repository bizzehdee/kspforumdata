There\u0027s not a whole lot that can be done to \u0022tone down\u0022 Grand Theft Auto. Like, at all. If it weren\u0027t at the level of maturity that it is now, sales would plummet, and besides that, it wouldn\u0027t be much fun. It would be much simpler to invest time in advertising some of the newer, less mature games like Trials: Fusion.
