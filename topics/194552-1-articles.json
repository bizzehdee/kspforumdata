I\u0027m going to ask a dumb question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d there a mod\u00A0that sits in the middle between say Smart Parts and KOS?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in the beginning of a new career game and would like to add some simple automation. For example, with RemoteTech , automatically switching antennae when I lose connection, or automatically running certain\u00A0experiments when the conditions are right. I hope you get the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel KOs\u00A0 can do this, but not to sound dumb or lazy, but when I read the documentation, it feels like I should go to college to learn programming. Also that I should be smart enough to get into college. Neither of those are happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been searching with no luck, so I figured I\u0027d ask, is there a mod that allows simpler scripting for basic tasks than KOs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailing that, I\u0027ll have to start learning programming... I learned Basic in elementary school several decades ago , lol ... Can\u0027t be that bad, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
