Until today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m involved with a couple of major Facebook KSP groups and I often poke at mods and models in progress and see if I can lend a hand to testing them, particularly if it\u0027s someone learning to model for the first time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt so happened the modeller I\u0027m testing parts for right now shares a common interest in \u0022planes that never flew\u0022 so I decided to screw common sense and construct a circular-winged spaceplane. Oh wait, I\u0027m up to my usual sheninigans again after dreaming about intergalactic sheep, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there actually is some sense behind wanting to use a closed wing design (i.e., annular or circular wing). You see, A Mark 3 spaceplane is not small. A normal delta planform usually has large issues with CoM shifting on the ascent phase due to fuel burn, mach effects, whatever. It also tends to have a very long takeoff roll. It\u0027s probably solvable by just throwing more control authority, thrust and wing area at the problem but I thought, why not halve the wingspan and double the wing area using a circular wing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe result:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FDHKmkm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FDHKmkm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHX-1 \u0022Artemis\u0022 hypersonic airliner concept\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HX-1 flew on its first try, and exceeded the sound barrier by several times. While CoM shifts are still present, they can be easily compensated for using manual flaps and/or trim. Insane as it sounds, it\u0027s possible to turn off SAS and let physics do its thing, as the circular wing proved to be extremely stable at both subsonic, and supersonic speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially intending to construct something like the Normandy SR-1, I was soon dissuaded from the task by issues related to its extreme dihedral and the obvious thrust issues from placing the engines so far under the fuselage.

I can develop in two areas - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne, I can simply make the main hull larger and add a Mk3 cargo bay, with more fuel (possibly extend the ramjet nacelles, add more \u0027wet\u0027 wing sections) and see how much she can bring into orbit. A larger (and possibly fatter, with conformal fuel tanks) ship of course wouldn\u0027t look as sleek but she will be more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, I can retain the present hull configuration to serve as a baseline, 32 passenger tourist craft. I have the option of replacing the passenger modules with a cargo bay, or I can develop an aeroydnamic \u0027mission pod\u0027 to piggyback on top of the airframe, taking hints from the historical B-58 Hustler supersonic bomber which carried fuel and ordnance in an external pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/bomber/b58/b58_08.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b58_08.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe piggyback method is interesting as I can use the craft to loft a payload assist module into orbit or send a parasite spacecraft or two into space.
