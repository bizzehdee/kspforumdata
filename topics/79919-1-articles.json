When the closed yellow is on the open pink circle burn on that to speed up or flip 180 degrees and burn to slow down. This is all you need to know to get a rendezvous AND to dock. Once you get used to this mechanic then you can refine the process to take into account your angular velocity to increase fuel efficiency throughout the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T06:55:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by O-Doc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algomeysa","CreatedById":110934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T23:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks for the tips on docking, all. After a lot of effort, I did manage to dock. I got within 2 kilometers, killed my velocity. Closed the gap with the RCS H key, mostly. Sometimes with a little regular thrust. Then I kept killing my velocity. I\u0027m sure I was doing it pretty inefficiently, and I was running on fumes. So I switched to the fuel tanker, turned on its auto-grabber, and did the same from that end. Eventually, I did manage to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferring fuel is amazingly satisfying.

I\u0027ve had a few ships which would develop wobble (space station too) with SAS left on. There\u0027s a few posts here on the forums about that.
