I just went to boot up from Steam and I got a message warning me of broken mods that aren\u0027t compatible. I could be wrong, but my understanding was that one of the things modders were looking forward to about 1.0 was that from here on mod compatibility would be less of an issue going forward. But it\u0027s not even been a week and already my Career file is now botched. Is this just how it\u0027s always going to be? Because honestly I\u0027m no longer interested in the career mode at all after this. For the first time I was actually having a whole tone of fun in career, but what\u0027s the point if every time I start to make an inch of progress I need to go back to waiting for mods to update due to incremental bug fixes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could just be seeing things wrong but I\u0027ve not had to keep updating mods on a weekly basis in any other version number so this has kind of came out of nowhere to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich ones?
