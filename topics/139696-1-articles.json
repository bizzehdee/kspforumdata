So just as the title says the pitch will only turn one way for so long and then when I reach a certain point it turns around and goes the other way. Its as if I have ASS turned on for Mech jeb and its staying on. But I don\u0027t have mech jeb on the ship! I do have it installed but its not on the ship. Please help!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
