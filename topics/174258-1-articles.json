Mods can completely change the game to a new experience. Also, 1.4.x will eventually become stable and people will share ships as they did before(if they aren\u0027t already). There will be ships you might not be able to have because the builder had the DLC, but this is no different than needing a certain mod for a certain craft. When 1.3 came out, I remember quite a number of people staying with 1.2. I don\u0027t see 1.4 as anything different and besides, you get 1.4 for free, it\u0027s just the mission builder and some minor things in the paid DLC.
