I have the demo (want to buy the full game soon) and I want to land on the mun, and I\u0027ve gotten pretty close, but never quite landed there. The demo rockets I found online all have parts that I don\u0027t have on the demo.\u00A0Does anyone have a demo mun rocket they can show? I would appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Djslime6764","CreatedById":140412,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T01:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lastest Demo i think that came out has less parts then the other released demo therefore. So, try watching videos and experimenting with your ships.. Good Luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Djslime6764\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
