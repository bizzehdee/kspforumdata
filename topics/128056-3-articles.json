If all the tanks in the tech tree have the same 1/10th of the tank volume, the progression of the tech tree then aims for a bigger solution or a cheaper one, as the ratio between tanks is the same (and hence is not better). If the tanks between tiers change between a 15% at the start\u00A0\u00A0and a 5% at the end then the discussion is different as then you are looking for efficiency ( may not be too relevant for a first stage but it will impact greatly on the last one, giving you a fairly boost on DV).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have some ideas that could help in this matter but before throwing a block of text I would rather hear yours \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T16:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree about dry mass.

Since it seems that squad has determined that 1.25m tanks, 2.5m tanks, etc are balanced differently, it would probably be best to balance tanks according to their diameter. 2.5m tanks would have 2.5m fuel amounts etc. Intermediate sizes from mods (such as the growing 1.875m) would maybe be an average of 1.25m and 2.5m.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut to get started someone would have to sit down and run the numbers.

To remind you so you don\u0027t need to read whole wall of text again, I will highlight some guidelines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings that were good contract wise(in my opinion) is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ntest part X on Y speed at Z altitude - good only for noob players in KSP as general and until player is capable to reach orbit, after that point of gameplay this kind of contracts become tedious. Should not be excluded completely from gameplay, but should be limited until player establish first orbit. Testing part in orbit around Kerbin is pretty much the same as on the Mun orbit. Testing part on runway/launchpad - that is pretty much a \u0022gift\u0022 rather than any chalange.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInstead of having test part X on runway/launchpad, you could get a contract where some Kerbin company left you a \u0022gift\u0022 (container filled with ore or similar luxury value) because of data revealed trough scaning Kerbin from space. You can recover that part/debris at once for small buks or have oportunity to create a craft and haull it somehow much closer to KSC, where you can recover it for much larger amount of bucks. That is one of contract where aircraft will have some more purpose\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlacing/recovering satellite probes at certain orbits around various celestial bodies are quite fun and player can learn a lot trough that kind of contracts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nrescue missions - should be limited for orbit around Kerbin. This is good type of contracts where player must learn about rendezvous/docking procedure - essential part of whole gameplay before continue to progress further trough gameplay. But like I mentioned, it is slight immersion breaker since you are a pioneer of Kerbal space travels. That could be \u0022explained\u0022 by some degree that those stranded Kerbals were kerbonauts from some other rival company and their mission failed. Even more, once you accept such mission, it should have limited time to finish - inside 2-3 kerbal days, to bring more chalange. Maybe rescue missions around Mun and Minimus could be included too, but to rescue someone from orbit around Eve or some other planet that require good transfer window, etc. - that is quite of immersion breaker for whole game. Also, rendezvous/docking procedure in orbit around Eve is pretty much the same as rendezvous/docking in orbit around Kerbin, so there is no special need for those as learning helper trough contracts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThing that I didn\u0027t mentioned in previous post is orbital/celestial base building. After player have learned how to reach orbit, place satellites in desired orbits, find out how to reach Mun/Minimus and learned rendezvous/docking maneuver, first larger orbital construction is fuel station in LKO - to make all other missions for distant planets feasible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPuting fuel station in orbit and refueling it is also fun to do first 2-3 times. But when you want to focus on missons around distant celestial bodies it can also become tedious thing to do in mid to later part of playtrough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is maybe already covered trough various mods, like extraplanetary launchpads or USI mod, I must admit that I didn\u0027t investigated this for each detail. But, I was thinking about contract offered to player to build a craft that is capable to refuel station in orbit. After player create such craft, refuel station in LKO, get back from space to KSC and recover as much as possible of his craft. Then player is able to \u0022sell\u0022 blueprint of such craft to some other company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter such contract is complete, player could get a chance to buy fuel for station in orbit. The amount of fuel that could be delivered per contract and how often such contract is available to player could be based on that \u0022blueprint\u0022 of craft that player created for first time. Oportunity to refuel stations by some other company should not be possible each day, it should be something like one refuel contract per kerbal week, or one contract in two week, or one contract per month available. Again, how often and how many fuel is available trough such contract could based on success of first initial contract to create capable craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater on, as game progress, player might get oportunity to improve \u0022blueprint\u0022 of such craft that could bring fuel more often and/or in larger amount. That will be interesting mini chalange in early career, but also can relief player from tedious tasks in mid to late playtrough when someone is more focused to build ground base on Mun or Eve or some other planet. In mid to late game player would probably have more than enough money to pay refueling rather than do that by himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen speaking of ground bases, that is other part of this post that I want to cover. When KSP 1.1 is released, remote control will be part of stock gameplay. So, besides setting up satellite relay stations, player should probably need to have some ground bases too, for such purposes. Furthermore, mods like USI MKS/OKS could be too complex for some players to fully enjoy it. It might require a lot of internet/forum/manuals reading to learn how to proper set/build efficient ground base that have cababilities for half closed or full closed self sustained base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings up one more type of contract for GAP. I have seen that Inigma already working on something like that. My idea is that trough contract player learn what is needed to build closed loop self sustained base. Meaning, player need to deploy various type of ground base parts on certain spot on Kerbal. Polar caps are good choice for such contracts and good for overall game immersion. It does not need to be full closed self sufficient base, it might be missing some type of resources that need to be hauled there from time to time trough another contract type. But player should get info somewhere what else is needed for self sufficient base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat type of contract could teach player what is needed for ground base without need to search for info elsewhere, outside of game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother problem is game engine and infamous KSP kraken that can hit when you expect least. Numerous base parts along with parts from player craft can pop up undesired results when you reach range between ground base parts and your own craft when game engine physic start to act. Furthermore, especially for players that use a lot of mods, parts used for base creation might be changed between KSP version and patches/upgrades of moded parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid undesired situations where part changes might broke your whole career I suggest something else. Once player fulfill contract for base creation, instead of leaving various parts on the ground, those parts could be removed and whole base can be replaced with prefabricated mesh. Some buildings similar to KSC, or even better like building/bases used for KerbineSide mod. For such meshes physics is not calculated, so there is much less chance to awake kraken. Also if some parts/meshes were changed between updates of mods/KSP, it will have much less chance that it will break your saved game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI again ended with wall of text, but that will be last one for this year. I wish you all happy new year and get away from computer and KSP at leat for a while to celebrate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T01:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery nice suggestions!

I\u0027m glad that Probus accepted chalange and joined this project, so we got starting point to work on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy initial thoughts about CFF and basic set of standards is that is similar to C# \u0022interface\u0022 method. C# programmers are probably familiar with it, interface just describe some object what kind of methods, properties and events such object must have without desribing each method how it should look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor people that are not familiar with programming and C#, I will try to explain idea with hopefuly simple words in comparison with car industry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet\u0027s say that we need to describe a car as object. CFF set of rules should define that each car must have:chasis, wheels,engine, fuel tank and steering controler as minimum.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt does not describe how large chasis must be, how powerful engine should be, what will be inside chasis, color of chasis etc. But if someone create car as object and respect CFF rules we will know gor sure that car will have chasis, wheels,engine, fuel tank and steering controler for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, CFF should give some \u0022interface\u0022 for tech three how it should look like, without puting restrictions how some tech tree will lay out specific nodes, should be expanded from left to right, up or down or expand on all sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefining branches for a tree is a good starting point to define CFF standards without puting too much restrictions for any kind of tech tree layout.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently I\u0027m playing trough SETIctt, tracking down notes with pros/cons of some decisions. I will write down more about it later on, so you can use that info to establish those CFF standards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently my free time is very limited, so I can\u0027t promise to work more on CFF, but I can provide some feedback and partly some pseudo codes and algorithm that hopefuly make life easier for folks that will actualy work on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T19:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve scimmed over the thread and since I have some experience with the SETI BalanceMod family, these are some quick remarks which come to mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI m not completely sure I understand the scope of the project.
