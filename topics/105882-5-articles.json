As far as I\u0027m concerned we are still using 0.9 parts that are not optimized to fly in 1.0 aero. None of the parts are able to deal with the new aero and this is comparing a Skylon airframe running RAPIER engines barely able to cruise 1000m/s in KSP with it\u0027s real life counterpart that can easily cruise at mach 5.5 (1,823m/s). Ive considered that perhaps this is a scaling thing with Kerbin being smaller, but it isn\u0027t the case. It\u0027s also likely that the engine pre-coolers does diddly squat at improving an engine\u0027s operating altitude (due to increasing heat at high altitudes) while the Skylon SABRE has an in built engine pre-cooler that works as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I don\u0027t think SQUAD has given us the tools to build (at least practical) SSTOs.

They also have a appearance factor, certain people (such as myself) find aircraft like things much more pleasing to look at then giant cylinders with a nose cone atop. The last one is a personal preference but the 1st 2, especially how overpowered and overly efficient jet engines were (i could SSTO a 12t craft to laythe and bakc using 150 LF ONLY), made them very very popular, and it wasnt exactly difficult to make one fly provided you had the CoG and CoL properly alligned, that was the only real requirement for SSTOing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you get a MUCH tougher engineering challenge, rapiers die completely around 30km, and above that it is just IMPOSSIBLE to use them in jet mode. The other 2 jet engines are inferior to the rapiers for high altitude and speed so im not even gonna talk about those. Point is, that to get a SSTO to orbit, you need WAY more fuel, and you also actually need some dedicated space engines too, which arent exactly very fuel efficient unless you stuck ions into the thing (and somehow have enough TWR to get yourself up to 2000m/s before dropping back down). This usually means that you simply do not have enough fuel to go interplanetary on just rapiers\u002Bwhatever rocket engines you chose to use (even the nuke).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs are far from dead, but i actually believe that 100% legit non-exploity SSTOs to other planets for the most part are done. There is no way to get large enough fuel quantities up there, and with the nerfs to every single rocket engine ISP wise, and ions only being feaseable through exploits (such as what i did when i crammed 15 ion engines and 27 xenon fuel tanks and 300 massless batteries all into a service bay 1.25m). I just dont see hwo you are going to make a SSTO to the farther reaches of space 100% legit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exclipse","CreatedById":45977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T16:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only problem with SSTOs right now is how broken the heating system is right now.
