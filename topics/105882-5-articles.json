If the aero model can\u0027t see that I\u0027ve made an aerodynamic shape/shell out of the wings on the ship then the aero model in itself is inherently unrealistic.\n\nThen there\u0027s the weird issue where unless a part is connected to an attachment point, it will accumulate drag and overheat regardless of an ablative shield placed on top of it. \n\nFrom what I\u0027m currently seeing is that the new aero is somewhat an improvement over the old one, but SQUAD hasn\u0027t given us any new tools or parts that can handle it. As far as I\u0027m concerned we are still using 0.9 parts that are not optimized to fly in 1.0 aero. None of the parts are able to deal with the new aero and this is comparing a Skylon airframe running RAPIER engines barely able to cruise 1000m/s in KSP with it\u0027s real life counterpart that can easily cruise at mach 5.5 (1,823m/s). Ive considered that perhaps this is a scaling thing with Kerbin being smaller, but it isn\u0027t the case. It\u0027s also likely that the engine pre-coolers does diddly squat at improving an engine\u0027s operating altitude (due to increasing heat at high altitudes) while the Skylon SABRE has an in built engine pre-cooler that works as intended.\n\nAll in all, I don\u0027t think SQUAD has given us the tools to build (at least practical) SSTOs. Building real life counterparts of SSTOs doesn\u0027t seem to work and I still have weird fantastical designs fly in the new aero, so it is still hardly that much realistic even though people claim it is. It\u0027s a step in the right direction though, but I think it still needs a lot of work."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:10:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If the aero model can\u0027t see that I\u0027ve made an aerodynamic shape/shell out of the wings on the ship then the aero model in itself is inherently unrealistic.\n\nExactly what I\u0027m going for.

A rocket that only needs 1,100 vacuum dV can have a pretty darn good payload fraction.\n\nIts not as ridiculous as before... but its close...\n\nBTW, somehow I think having a large payload helps... that monster I posted on the last page was actually the fastest spaceplane I managed to make (or rather, it got the fastest on jet power), despite not being able to accelerate past mach 1 in a climb/level flight (a dive was needed to get past mach 1, and into the good part of the engine/s power curve)... normally my planes would fry up at that point... but I think it was so large, with so much payload acting as a heat sink, that it didn\u0027t overheat because of that.\n\nIt clearly had absorbed a lot of heat, because OX-stats in the utility bay behind the cockpit started cooking off when coasting at 64 km prior to the final orbital insertion burn.\n\nSo the parts had to be pretty darn hot to be able to transfer enough heat to adjacent parts, into the utlity bay, through 3 large reaction wheels, and onto the ox-stats on those reaction wheels.\n\nI attribute its survival at those speeds to a large heat-sink."},{"CreatedByName":"qromodynmc","CreatedById":87139,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:10:04Z","Content":"I think sstos are more realistic than they were in 0.90. \n\nI mean look at to real life,Who stays in the atmosphere to get enough speed?\n\nMy recommendation; instead of jets,use rockets more,build bigger planes."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:47:38Z","Content":"My initial experiments suggest that 75 m/s equivalent airspeed is the magic number for reliably surviving reentry. Faster than 75 m/s EAS and you risk exploding various internal bits, like batteries. So the trick to designing a spaceplane that can reenter safely is to give it enough lift and pitch authority to maintain altitude at that airspeed. Realistically, it should glide a good deal slower if you want some margin of error.\n\nI\u0027m having trouble getting an authentic-ish looking space shuttle to glide and maintain altitude that slow.

People are now faced with a taste, however small, of why we humans have never built an SSTO that takes off from a runway. New ascent profiles require much more rocket fuel than before, meaning the craft have to change shape.\nPeople don\u0027t like change, especially when the change results in a tougher time getting what they want. Pre-1.0 you could build purely for aesthetics and do silly things like stack tens of wings. Now you have to at least try for an aerodynamic shape. Is it perfect? No. Go talk to ferram4 about compromises in oldFAR for the purpose of trying to figure out the shape of whatever crazy contraption the user made because KSP let them. KSP uses some of those same techniques, as I understand it. And if you\u0027re still mad about it, check out nuFAR, which voxelizes the vessel into a single shape.

They also have a appearance factor, certain people (such as myself) find aircraft like things much more pleasing to look at then giant cylinders with a nose cone atop. The last one is a personal preference but the 1st 2, especially how overpowered and overly efficient jet engines were (i could SSTO a 12t craft to laythe and bakc using 150 LF ONLY), made them very very popular, and it wasnt exactly difficult to make one fly provided you had the CoG and CoL properly alligned, that was the only real requirement for SSTOing.\n\nNow, you get a MUCH tougher engineering challenge, rapiers die completely around 30km, and above that it is just IMPOSSIBLE to use them in jet mode. The other 2 jet engines are inferior to the rapiers for high altitude and speed so im not even gonna talk about those. Point is, that to get a SSTO to orbit, you need WAY more fuel, and you also actually need some dedicated space engines too, which arent exactly very fuel efficient unless you stuck ions into the thing (and somehow have enough TWR to get yourself up to 2000m/s before dropping back down). This usually means that you simply do not have enough fuel to go interplanetary on just rapiers\u002Bwhatever rocket engines you chose to use (even the nuke).\n\nSSTOs are far from dead, but i actually believe that 100% legit non-exploity SSTOs to other planets for the most part are done. There is no way to get large enough fuel quantities up there, and with the nerfs to every single rocket engine ISP wise, and ions only being feaseable through exploits (such as what i did when i crammed 15 ion engines and 27 xenon fuel tanks and 300 massless batteries all into a service bay 1.25m).
