Theoretically, you could get up to ~17000m, based on an extrapolation of the change in height between each dive \u0026 return. I was going to try to just get to my prior record of over 15km in this plane (which I had done previously, before knowing about this thread, mostly to see how broken the glitch was: it could have gone further, but I got bored), but my keyboard jammed and I lost control and fell back down to 10000m before regaining control. I didn\\\u0027t want to go through the process of going back up again... so I just decided to settle for the 13330m as posted here (among jets, it would land in 3rd place, by a tiny margin); it was a sufficient altitude to prove my point.\n\nSo why is this plane so annoying to get beyond 10000m? It is powered by glitchy control surface physics, not engines. In fact, it has no engines or fuel what-so-ever. Yet it manages to remain competitive with the standard jet engine.
