Several aborts have been postponing his launch to the New Kerman Space Station Liophis. Getting a bit anzy waiting Jeb squawks in and checks with the weather reports. Infinity to Control. Infinity to Control. Jeb waits for the reply. Control here. Nothing has changed Jeb the window will approach in t-minus 4 hours. Said Donald. Jeb glad to hear that reply\u0027s Roger that. Any cha- Jeb gets interrupted by someone screaming. WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING MY NAME! Shouts Roger into the headset. Everyone in the Command Center just stares at Roger. He stares back and slinks back into his chair. ~Silence~ .....Okay then... Command any chance of you guys delivering me some pizza I\u0027m getting hungry. Jeb asks with his stomach rumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe asks. Um, Sure thing Jeb. Any specific toppings? Hmm they have so many toppings its hard to decide... Lets go with their Superduperrocketmanoverlycoveredineverytoppingbutanchovies Pizza! Jeb says with a gluttonous expression. Felipe didn\u0027t catch any of that and asks. Um ... can you repeat that? Jeb happy to reply says. Sure I said order the Superduperrocketmanoverlycoveredineverytoppingbutanchovies Pizza!Felipe is completely confused asks. Um .. how do you spell that... Jeb tells Felipe, Just ask for Jeb\u0027s usual. Roger that.,Felipe tells Jeb. Frustrated by that, Roger shouts Thats it! He flips his desk and storms out of the room. Everyone just stares and goes back to work..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb thinks to himself. Mmmm pizza.... Felipe feels for his wallet and pulls it out. he searches for his Kerbal Speedy Pizza Discount card. He doesn\u0027t see it. Alright where did my Kerbal Speedy Pizza Discount Card go he asks the room. Jeb Looking around outside spots something on hte edge of his helmet. After struggling around with his harness he grabs it. When he looks at it he notices its Felipe\u0027s Discount card. Jeb tells Felipe Uhm.... Found it. Felipe dumb founded by what Jeb just said asks. What, when... How did it get into the rocket ship? Felipe looks around the room. Alex Kerman looks a bit suspicious... Felipe agitated shouts at Alex. Alex why does Jeb have my ID!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStartled and stuttering for words. I-I-I didn\u0027t do it! I-I-I-It was Chad! Alex points to Chad. Felipe looks in the direction and only see\u0027s a empty chair spinning in circles. Jeb asks. Uh... So how am I suppose to get this to you... Felipe thinks to himself for a minute and says. I\u0027ll send out the ground crew to extend the platform to you and grab it from you. Alright... Jeb replys, Want me to read the card info to you so you can call in the pizza? Felipe calmed down now reply\u0027s. Sure let me grab some paper. Felipe looks around for some paper. He grabs it off of Adrian\u0027s desk who\u0027s out on sick leave cause he got the Klu. Jeb reads the info off the card. Felipe Kerman, ID:1328-0KPO. Felipe jots it down onto the paper. He motions for the ground crew to go retrieve it while he orders the pizza. He then proceeds to call the pizza parlor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe phone rings for a minute and gets picked up. A teenage voice answers. Kerbal Speedy Pizza, where the pizza is just finished cooking when we deliver it to you. My name is Jordan, how can I help you? Yes I would like to place an order for 12 orders of hot and spicy chicken wings, 4 orders of Barbecue wings, 2 Large Cheese Pizza\u0027s 4 Large Meat lover\u0027s, 1 large vegetarian lover pizza and 1 order of Jeb\u0027s usual. Felipe reply\u0027s with a pause after each order. The phone is silent for a little bit then Jordan reply\u0027s back, Did you say 1 order of Jeb\u0027s usual? Felipe confirms what Jordan hears. Yes, Is their a problem? Sir do you know how much it costs? Asks Jordan. Felipe Sighing asks, how much? Jordan reply\u0027s, Jeb\u0027s pizza is a 1 meter pizza.... It costs $630 and takes 3 hours to cook.... Felipe\u0027s jaw drops. Can you hold on a minute? Felipe asks. Yeah I can hold. Jordan replys Felipe puts down the phone and puts on his headset. Jeb, he asks. Yes? Did you order my pizza? Jeb reply\u0027s. You do realize it takes 3 hours to make and costs $630 right? Yes? He reply\u0027s wondering why Felipe is even asked that. then he realizes what he just said and asks. Oh do you need the money? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s in my pants in my locker. Feel free to take out them money to pay for my pizza. Surprised on what Jeb just said Felipe Reply\u0027s. Oh no you can pay me back on return. Just wondering how you planned to fit a 1 meter pizza on the rocket... Theres silence for a few seconds and Jeb answers quickly. I\u0027ll find a way. Felipe is more concerned on how logn it will take to make and deliver. Jeb... He asks with a stern tone. The window is in 3 hours and 40 minutes... you would have less than 10 minutes to eat it, are you sure about this? Jeb chuckles, Yes I know. It will be fine trust me. Alright... Felipe replys with hesitation. He puts down his headset and picks up the phone. Jordan are you still there? Yes I am still here sir. Would you like to finalize the order? asks Jordan. Felipe replys. Yes I would please, I also have my KSP Id card here. Jordan answers. That\u0027s fine, but to warn you the cards discount doesn\u0027t cover Jebs usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s fine. The info is Felipe Kerman, ID:1328-0KPO. Felipe Reply\u0027s reading the card information. Alright Sir. you want the pizza\u0027s delivered to the Cafeteria? Yup, can you ask your driver to rush here? We have a launch in 3 hours 40 minutes. Jordan asks, A rush fee will cost an extra $60. The total comes to $870.19, Are you paying with cash or credit? Felipe answers with, Credit. Alright the driver will bring the receipt for you to sign. May I please have the card info. Asks Jordan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFelipe reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. taking out the credit card. Felipe begins to tell Jordan the Info. The numbers are -INFO RETRACTED TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD INFO- (Gotta prevent that identify theft!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few minutes goes by Jordan answers. Okay then the pizza will be their in about 3 hours give or take 20 mins\u0027s. Thank you sir for your business Well thank you for making great food. Felipe answers back. Jordan answers to the complement. Well thank you guys for ordering so much from us all the time! Felipe answers to the complement of the complement. Well Thank you for being polite! Jordan answers to the complement of the complement of that complement. You are welcome! Have a nice day and hope for the best with the launch! Felipe says thank you a few more times and hangs up the phone. 3 hours and 10 minutes later the pizza comes over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn announcement goes out over the loud speakers. Pizza has been delivered to the cafeteria. Ground crew please deliver Jeb\u0027s pizza to him before you go eat. Kerman at different times go and get their food. Having a good time. The ground crew having trouble loading the large pizza onto their golf cart strap it onto a wooden pallet and then to the roof of the cart. They travel slowly so they don\u0027t topple over. and minutes later they finally get there. They load the pizza onto the lift and raise up to the capsule. They open up the hatch and see Jeb standing there eagerly waiting for his pizza. Oh yeah my pizza! jeb claims out excitedly. Daniel looking worried about the size of the pizza asks Jeb. Um... How do wee get this in there? Jeb looks at the box and then inside the capsule and gets an idea. he moves things around in the capsule. Jeb then grabs the pizza box and starts to twist it and yank on it and wiggle it through the door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally after much effort and one last tug he pulls it through. Like that. Jeb reply\u0027s. Daniel and Ezequiel look dumb founded that he manged to get the box into their. Since the delivered the pizza they close the hatch and seal it shut. Jeb mutters something after they close the door. Ezequiel thought it was a thank you but wasn\u0027t sure. They both head back to the cafeteria for their food. Seven minutes to flight time Jeb is done with his pizza. He opens the hatch and throws the box outside so the ground crew doesn\u0027t have to come up to grab the box. He then seals the door shut. Everyone has enjoyed their pizza. The general checks his account balances and notices his credit card has a charge of $1044.23 on it from Kerbal Speedy Pizza. He quickly checks his wallet and notices his credit card missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general starts to take off to the control room that\u0027s on the opposite side of the complex. The loud speaker squawks T-Minus 1 minute to launch time Begin final checks. The General scared he won\u0027t make it in time. Runs into the VAB and gets into Daniel\u0027s golf cart and speeds off to the command room. The loud speaker squawks again T-Minus 40 seconds. The general sees the command room door! He honks the horn to get some Kermen out of his way! The loud speaker exclaims, T-Minus 20 seconds! The general slams into the door getting ejected through the doorway, tumbling end over end and smacking against a desk. Everyone scared by the noise thought the rocket exploded and looked at their screens to see Jeb still with us. Felipe runs over to the General to see if he is alright The General starts to pick himself up. A little rattled but he seems fine. Gentlemen! The General exclaims hastily , is the launch still on schedule The Loudspeaker Chimes in. T-Minus 10 seconds and counting Yes sir answers Felipe. Were still A-GO. The loud speaker announces, 9, 8 ,7 stopping the fuel transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral speaks under hurried breath, Good, now tell me who just charged $1044.23 to my Credit card? The General stands up. Caught off guard by the question Felipe starts to mutter. I um it uh was uh. The general barks, Out with it man! Loud Speaker announces, 6, 5, 4, 3 Initial Sequence start. Felipe scared shouts, It was Jeb sir! Surprised the general looks around the room and asks, What, where is Jeb? He is on the rocket sir! Felipe says in a hurry. Surprised by this The General runs over to his desk and grabs his radio. The general try\u0027s to get in contact with Jeb but his radio systems offline. He looks at the box and it has a sticky note on it saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Broken cause of Hot Coffee incident.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarn it! Exclaimed The General. Loud Speaker announces, 2, 1. As the timer hits 1 the rockets engines roar into life. The Loud Speaker announces Liftoff of Kelta 4 with payload SpaceLab Mark 1. Jeb is slammed to his seat. The pizza box outside on the ground catches on fire and flys away. The rocket starts to pull away from the launch pad. The Command center starts to cheer as the rocket lifts off. Soon they get back to monitoring the ships status. Though as the cheer begins to die down The General is getting annoyed. Felipe! He yells. Who is gonna pay me back for the pizza? Felipe staring at the monitors turns and faces The general. Well sir Jeb said he would pay me back when he returned in 7 days. Unless I needed the money then he gave permission for me to go into his locker and pull the money out of his wallet. He explains to The General. Well when radio contact is established come get me from my office. The General says angry. The General storms off, slamming the door behind him. The door falls off the hinges. Everyone just stares at The General. He just sighs under his breath and continues to storm off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket is 3000 meters in the air now. Felipe sighs in relief that The General is gone for now. Felipe looks around the room snapping his fingers to get attention. He asks Marco, Status? Marco quickly looks at Felipe and back to his monitors and tells Felipe. All Green across the board Sir. Jens is fixing the radio antenna and we expect it done shortly. Felipe lets out a sigh of relief. Good, Lets hope for Jeb\u0027s sake we stay out of radio contact a little bit longer. He replays. Time feels like it goes so much slower for Jeb as he sits in the cockpit pressed up into his chair. The clouds just wiz on by. He loses himself in them for a little bit but then the computer chimes in. The on-board navigation computer crackles into life. It begins its routine and says. Begin rollover in T-minus 3 seconds. Jeb reaches for the controls. Grabbing them firmly. ready to begin. NaVi starts to count down, 3, 2, 1, Execute rollover. Jeb starts to yank the stick and begins the rollover. Soon he is in position. He looks at all his instruments. Everything is in the green except.... Jeb looks and notices the light is off on the Strut monitor for the orbiting rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe try\u0027s to radio the KCC but remembers their radio is in repairs. He taps on the glass and the light flickers on and off. Must be a blown bulb. Jeb says to himself. He pays no mind to it. The altimeter starts to spin faster and faster has he blows through the atmosphere. 24000 meters then in a blink of an eye hes at 29000 meters. Soon enough Jeb is at 80,000 meters and begins to circularize the orbit. Mid way through the orbit the radio crackles to life. KCC to Kelta 4, KCC to Kelta 4. The radio chimes. Jeb reaches and flips the radio on. When he flips the switch the lights flicker on and off in the cabin. Jeb looks around for a sec. Then he speaks back. Kelta 4 to KCC, How was the pizza? Felipe puts on his headset and says. It was great Jeb though the general didn\u0027t like us using his card. Jeb chuckles to himself. Yeah I\u0027ll pay him back for the pizza when I return. By the way I\u0027ve been having some instrument glitches and power fluctuations here. Anything off down their? Felipe can hear that Jeb is concerned over this in his tone of voice. Felipe looks around the room and everyone is giving a thumbs up except Donald. Felipe shouts to Donald. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, Donald whats wrong. Donald turns around and says. I have multiple sensor failures on the strut monitors for the orbiting engine and a power drain of 7%. Felipe looks back at the main screen. How do you feel up th- Before Felipe is able to finish his sentence. sensor alarms start to ring out in the pod and in the Command room. Donald alarmed by what he says screams. THE STRUTS ARE FAILING. Before Donald is able to finish their is a large bang noise that comes through the radio. All the instruments in the command room go silent. Jeb being the one who is in the ship. Is very scared at what he just heard and felt, he expects the worst is happening. He looks at the instruments for clues but they are dark. They are no longer showing anything. The only light source is from Kerbol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh.... this is not good. He mutters to himself. Jeb attempts to get the radio back on but its no good. The radio is out of power. He thinks to himself about what to do next. He remembers that in the event of total power loss that it will get pretty cold in the ship soon. He unstraps himself from the seat and wanders over to the storage box in the corner. He pulls out a flash light and grabs a Battery from the box. He also pulls out a small toolbox. His face is determined now. He heads over to the radio and takes off the covers. After fiddling around with the wires he connects the battery to the radio. The radio cracks on. All he hears though is static. He try\u0027s to reach KCC but its no good. The radio must have been hit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe thinks to himself and stares at the airlock. Looks like its time for a walk, he says under heavy breath. Jeb closes the radio up and turns it off. He turns the flash light off and puts it in his utility pouch. He ties the tool box to his belt too. He looks around the room to make sure there is nothing else that could get sucked out. He see\u0027s nothing else so he precedes to release the airlock. As the ships air gets sucked out Jeb thinks if everything will be alright. He wasn\u0027t in a stable orbit when the accident happened. Meanwhile in the KCC the crew is in a panic. They have no idea if Jeb is alive or dead, they\u0027ve got no eyes on him at the moment. Felipe makes an announcement on the Loud speaker. Alert to all personnel Felipe chokes up a little bit as he begins to speak. An accident has accrued upon Kelta 4. It is unknown on Jeb\u0027s condition at this time. As is procedure the KCC doors will be locked and only key personnel will be able to enter. The General is in the can when he hears this. He quickly finishes up and pulling up his pants while running out of the bathroom. A toilet paper trail following him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe people that were enjoying their pizza in the cafeteria Shocked by what they hear they loss their appetite The general reaches the KCC doors and uses his keycard to get in. Whats the situation people. The General says. We are 2 minutes without contact Sir. Nearest satellite will be in visual range within 20 minutes. Felipe says with a heavy heart. Well what went wrong? The General asks the room. Donald stands up and says. Their was a strut failure on the orbital engine. When it was lost we speculate the engine started to swing and then slammed into the hull causing the loud thud that we heard. This swinging caused to much stress on the hull causing everything to shear off. The air now fully drained from the pod open the hatch the rest of the way and climbs out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he does he see\u0027s debris every where. He looks towards the rear of the ship and ducking just in time to doge a chunk of metal whizzing by his head. As he gets back up and closes the hatch behind him. He just sees the scrap metal that was his engine. Jeb turns his helmets light on and heads to the front of the craft to get to the antennae. As he shuffles through debris, he wonders what happened. He thinks to back just before launch. when he threw the pizza box out the hatch... he wonders if the box whacked something on its way down. I thought I gave it a good throw, mumbles Jeb. As Jeb reaches the antennas he notice that the wires were severed. He cuts the bad wires off and puts on some new ones. making sure the splice will hold for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then starts to head back. As he reaches the hatch he feels a shudder, Jeb looks up to notice some more debris heading his way. Quickly Jeb lets go of the ship as the debris wiz by inches from his face. Phew, That was a close one! Jeb lets out a sigh of relief. He then proceeds to reach for the door but hes just out of reach. He grabs his jetpack controls and gives himself a little nudge towards the door. As he reaches the door he wonders if their is anything to salvage from the debris and heads towards the rear of the ship. As he pushes through the debris he notices that a storage compartment is intact! he pries it open to reveal a small solar panel just big enough to charge the radio and a few other spare parts. He puts them into his toolbox and continues onward. He notices that the RCS tank is leaking out. He reaches it and shuts off the valves. Gotta save what I can. Jeb says.He goes to see if any of the batteries are intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he reaches to where they are he sees mostly a mess. He shoves away the broken stuff and finds two batteries that are damaged but Jeb thinks he can make at least one working one out of it. Jeb puts them into a bag on his side. Looking around the debris field he sees nothing of interest so he decides to head back. Jeb climbs out of the debris carefully so he doesn\u0027t lose any of his prizes. It feels like forever when he finally reaches the hatch. Before jeb enter he thinks it would be a good idea to check the heat shield. He turns around dodging a few more scraps of metal. He inspects the heat shield He cant see to far in though since the pod is still bolted to the ship. Seeing everything he cares to see he heads back to the hatch again. Jeb opens the hatch and climbs in. he pulls in his bag and toolbox. He closes the hatch and watches as a few more pieces of debris whiz pass the door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb peals out the solar panel and sticks it into the window where the sun is. Taping it in place. He drapes the wires across the console and to the radio where he plugs it into the battery. Jeb turns on the radio. Fiddling with the tuner he starts to hear stuff beside static. It\u0027s the KCC! KCC to Kelta 4, Come in Delta 4, Over. Jeb happy to hear their voice plugs into the radio and with a happiness he hasn\u0027t felt since his delicious pizza earlier. Jeb Speaks. Kelta 4 here, over. The KCC roars with happiness as they hear jeb speak. feeling the worse had happen. Felipe tells Jeb. Oh thank God your alive. Jeb chuckles to himself. Yeah, Well you can\u0027t get rid of me that easily. The General gets on the radio and says. Jeb, my boy what is the situation up their? As The General finishes to say this Felipe Announces on the Loud speaker that Jeb has made contact and is currently Okay. The entire complex now roars into life. Jeb turns to look out the hatches window and sighs heavily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not good sir. The ship is gone. I\u0027ve managed to salvage a few pieces here and their but most of the ship is gone. Jeb says heavy breath and all. I see, do you have any idea if you completed your orbit or not? The General says with a bit of sadness in his voice. After all this rocket was to test a new orbiting engine. Um, I am unsure of that Sir. The last I knew I was in a 80/66 kilometer orbit. Jeb says with a calm voice. Jeb begins to work on the batteries he salvaged. hoping that they will have enough power to boot the Navigation equipment long enough to give him useful information. We have a satellite nearing visual range of you. it will be their in about 3 minutes. How is your air reserves handling? The General still sounds concern. Jeb looks at his suits monitor and it says hes at 97% air left and his suits battery is reading at 96% charged. After some thinking Jeb says, I\u0027ve got about 8 hours left in reserve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KCC crew are all concern now. 8 hours is out of their range for a rescue attempt if Jeb is in a stable orbit. Jeb feels the pod shake around him. the radio goes out again. He attempts to talk to The General but its no use. He shuts off the power and unjacks his radio from it. he puts the cord away. He finishes up the battery. Hmm... Its working... though it only has about half of its charge left... Hope it will be enough. Jeb detaches the solar panel wires from the radio and hooks them into the battery. He straps the battery to his seat. I\u0027m a let you charge while I go for a little stroll quips Jeb. Jeb seals up his tool box and puts away his bag. he then looks around the cabin to make sure nothing is floating around. He turns on his helmet light and proceeds to the hatch. Opening it ever so slightly so the small amount of air that is in it gets pulled out. He looks out of the hatch to see if anything is coming. It seems clear so he climbs out of the hatch and shuts it. He starts to climb to the antennae. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sees the hull has a few new dents in it as he climbs up. He reaches the antennae only to see that it is now gone. Dammit, Debris must of hit it off...Jeb sees a metal rod a few feet into space. Hmm it should work as a replacement, Jeb says to himself. He attaches a safty harness to the ladder and then jumps for the rod. He grabs a hold of it. He attaches it to his utility pouch and then pulls himself back to the ship. He proceeds to attach it to where the old antennae used to be. He sees a small metal box float past him and he reaches out to grab it. He puts it over the antennae and attaches it to the ship too. Hopefully you can help protect this one. Jeb says to the box. Jeb finishes attaching the 2 pieces to the ship. He then heads back inside after he detaches his safety harness from the ladder. As he climbs inside and turns off his helmet he closes the hatch. Proceeding to the Radio he turns it back on and jacks into it. He hears Felipe trying to contact him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKCC to Kelta 4, KCC to Kelta 4 Over. Jeb flips his headset on and says. Heeeeey their good buddy that\u0027s a big ten four. Had a bit of trouble with the misses but we made up. The guys couldn\u0027t help but laugh at the horrible impression that Jeb just tried to do. Felipe motions for them all to calm down. The satellite is gathering information right now. we have the first images. It is not a pretty sight. Said Felipe. I know it isn\u0027t I just had to swim through it again. Jeb said sighing. I just finished repairing a battery. I was planning to hook it up to the NaVi and seeing if I can get my bearings. Whats its charge at right now? Asks Felipe. Um... Let me find out. Jeb says to Felipe while heading over to the battery. It is at about 57% charge. I have it hooked up to a little solar panel at the moment. Jeb puts his hand to his helmet making a attempt at rubbing his chin with no avail.. Felipe gets some paperwork from a Engineer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt show what they all feared. The ship is torn to pieces worse then they thought. The main engine and fuel is gone. the only thing that looks mostly intact is a RCS tank 2 RCS thrusters and the command pod. Jeb, Felipe try\u0027s to get Jebs attention but Jeb is thinking of a song so his mind is else where. JEB! Felipe shouts out. Jeb startled by it snaps out of it and responds yes Felipe? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs everything All right up their? Felipe asks concerned. Yeah everything is fine. Jeb answers back. Was thinking of a song right then. Whats up? We just got the data from the satellite What we can see is that most of the ship is gone except a RCS tank, 2 RCS thrusters on the north and east sides and that battery you salvaged. Also the engineers think the battery will be able to run the NaVi computer long enough to get your relative data at 67% charge and full data at 82%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey want me to remind you to make sure their is no shorts in the computer or you will bleed power. We also recommend once you get your data to use your remaining power to have the RCS thrusters take you out of the Debris cloud. Felipe says all of that in one go. Well that might be a bit of a problem Felipe... Jeb says with a little hesitation in his voice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is that? Felipe asks. Jeb explains, when I went to go repair the Radio the first time I also went and salvaged some parts. The RCS when I found it was leaking out. So a pipe is severed along the line somewhere. Any ideas on how to bypass the Junction? Felipe turns to the engineers. Donald tells the both of them. Well tell you when we have an answer.The General barks out. Well be quick about it we have no idea if Jeb\u0027s orbit is stable or not! Jeb looks at the battery its at 59% charged. Jeb remembers about something in the box and goes over to it. scrounging around he finds a hand crank charger. He checks to see his suits power and its at 26%. Uh, That can\u0027t be good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuys my suits power is at 26%. I should be around 92% charged.. I\u0027m going to attempt to connect a hand-charger to this suit and charge it by hand while I wait for the battery to charge. Jeb said to KCC. The KCC team is even more concerned. IF Jeb\u0027s suit runs out of power he\u0027ll freeze to death. Roger that Jeb. Felipe acknowledging Jebs last message. From a distance Jeb can hear a guy scream ARGH WHY DOES EVERYONE USE MY NAME LIKE THAT. Has to be Roger Jeb thought to himself... Jeb cranks the hand charger while waiting for the battery to get to 88% charged. That way he could have a window for the RCS if he needed to use it. As time goes on he occasional checks his power level and the battery\u0027s. Eventually the battery reaches 88% charged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebs suit is at 32% though so all the time he spent cranking didn\u0027t give much. Jeb goes and checks on the radios battery too and its at 56% charged. Jeb squawks in to tell KCC the good news.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKelta 4 to KCC. The battery is done charging im going to be hooking it up to the NaVi. Felipe glad to hear the news tells Jeb. Good to hear it. The engineers finished mulling over the question about the junction and they say yes you can. There should be some spare hose in the storage box next to the RCS tank. You can use them to bypass the leak. Jeb sighs in relief about that. He pulls off the solar panels wires from the battery and connects them to his suit. He then starts to hand crank a little bit faster. after 5 minutes he checks his suits power level. Its at 42%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb attaches the wires of the solar panel to the radios battery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then tells Felipe that he will be going on a EVA and plans to shut off the radio to let it charge faster. Felipe acknowledges that with a Alright. We\u0027ll be watching. Over and out. Jeb shuts off the radio. Searching around the room for anything floating around. He sees nothing and proceeds for the hatch. He puts away the hand charger. Since his powers low he pulls out the little flashlight he has and straps it to his wrist with tape. As he opens the hatch slowly a small whoosh noise is made by the little bit of air in the pod. Jeb checks to see if theirs any debris coming. There isn\u0027t so he climbs out and shuts the hatch. He starts to climb down the ladder. Jeb sees a glint to his right and he looks that way to see one of the pods parachutes floating away. Oh that can not be good. Jeb says to himself. Jeb readies himself and jumps lightly for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly traveling to it. He reaches out and grabs it. He turns on his RCS and gives himself a small burst to get back to the ship. He turns off his RCS and climbs up to the hatch. He opens the hatch and puts the parachute inside for now. Jeb closes the hatch and heads back to the RCS tank. He gets to the storage compartment, pulls it open and takes out the hoses. he stuffs them into his bag and shuts the door. He then proceeds to the junction box and starts to decouple the pipe fittings. He connects the 2 good RCS fuel lines to the RCS tank and opens the valve. Jeb doesn\u0027t see any leaks anymore. He thinks to himself. Maybe its fixed, but I should hurry back cause I don\u0027t know if it is or not and I could be leaking fuel. Jeb gets back inside the ship and turns off the flashlight on his hand. He turns on the radio and checks its power seeing it says 100%. He unconnects the wires and puts them on his suit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe checks the power on the Battery and its holding at 88%. Jeb radios to KCC. Kelta 4 to KCC, Kelta 4 To KCC. I just finished with the RCS and if you noticed. I found a little friend on my walk. Yeah, we say you grabbing what looked to be a Radial parachute. Is it intact? asks Felipe. The chasing has a few scrapes and a dent but no obvious breaks in the metal. Can you guys see if the other parachute is still their? Jeb asks politely. Felipe motions for the crew to start to see if the other parachute is missing or not. They see it attached to the ship still. Relieved by it too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts still attached Jeb. Jeb sighs with relief. Jeb shuts off all the switches before he starts to attach the battery to the NaVi. Jeb then finishes connecting the wires and flips the switch the switch. The NaVi Starts to come online! Jeb connects the solar panel to the battery to help it out. As the NaVi runs through its start up Jeb checks hsi suits power level. Its at 62%. Finally the NaVi finishes starting up and starts to attempt to find where it is. The guys at the KCC cheer as the NaVi sends them connection messages as it starts to communicate with the KCC to find its information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it gets closer and closer to its Data the power keeps draining away. All of a sudden the alarms start to go off in the cockpit. The sensors on the ship are telling the NaVi theirs problems all over. Jeb flips off the master alarm and starts to take wires off so they wont use up the precious power. The NaVi Finishes its calculations and beeps. Jeb stares at it and sees that his orbit is at 69,730 Meters on the periapsis. relieved as he can be he radios the good news. My orbit is JUST barely stable. The crew cheer to hear that. Jeb looks at his power level. Its at 11% left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe quickly fiddles with the Computer to find out the best time to burn with the RCS. The burn is coming up in about 20 seconds. He needs to burn for 12 seconds. Jeb relays all this info to the ground crew who write it down for him. He then powers down all most all of the NaVi except the RCS controls. He uses the controls and gives a small ammount of thrust to get the ship out of the debris cloud. As 20 seconds approaches. Jeb hopes it works. He ties down the parachute real quick and the battery for the computer too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then straps himself in. He grabs the controls and starts to fire the RCS. He burns and burns. Felipe counts down for when Jeb should stop his burn. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Jeb stops his burn and shuts off the remaining power to the computer. Jeb tells Felipe that the computer says it will take 6 minutes for reentry to acquire. Jeb disconnects the battery and the solar panel from the computer and connects it to himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then waits a minute for it to charge up. He looks at his power gauge and it reads 82%. Jeb takes everything off and puts the solar panel and the hand crank in the storage box. closing the lid afterwords. Jeb tells Felipe that he is going for one last space walk. So he can attach the parachute to the ship. Jeb turns on his wrist light and heads outside. He looks around and sees hes drifted a good 30 meters from the debris field. He goes over to the side that lost its parachute. Its just a bare spot on the metal of where it was. a noticeable gouge can be seen though of where the parachute got hit. Jeb reattaches the parachute to the ship and rewiring it too. using the last of the mini welder fuel he has left. Finished with the weld, He puts his equipment away and grabs a hold of the ladder. Jeb turns on his jetpack and starts to rotate the ships nose upwards. Since the ship has no power to do it on it\u0027s own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then proceeds to the decoupler. he holds onto the ladder and pulls on the explosive bolts manual release. Jeb gets away from the panels and 5 seconds after the decoupler bolts fire releasing the pod from the ship. Jeb uses his jetpack to push the pod away from the wreckage. he checks his RCS fuel. He has only 8% left. He shuts off his jetpack and his light then he quickly hurrys back inside. There is less than 2 minutes to reentry Jeb makes sure everything is secure in the pod. Jeb turns on the controls to just the parachutes. Soon the descent begins. Jeb says to the guys back home. Be back soon. The radio goes silent. As Jeb plunges into the atmosphere he prays that the pod hold together After all his hard work. TO be done in by the reentry really would suck after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb watches the Altimeter. It springs to life at 67,000 Meters. he\u0027s going down at 1200 meters per second. Soon hes at 52,000 meters and the ships starting to decelerate quickly. Jeb hits 32,000 meters. the ships going at 600 Meters per second. Then the ship hits 22,000 Meters. Jeb fire the broken parachute to help slow the decent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14,000 meters the ship has decelerated to 300 meters per second. When the ship finally reaches 3000 meters Jeb opens the other parachute. The pod\u0027s speed starts to drop very quickly. Eventually the pod reaches 600 meters and Jeb hears a loud BANG as the broken parachute rips off the pod. a few seconds later Jeb feels a hard tug. His altimeter says hes at 300 Meters and he is going down at roughly 7 meters per second. Then the pod touches down!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was a success The KCC roars in to excitement as they watched the entire thing unfold. Felipe and The General. get on board of a plane and take off to get to Jeb. almost and hour goes by when they arrive. The capsules hatch still in place. Felipe looks through some binoculars and see\u0027s the antennae melted off in the plunge. He sees a flashing glint in the window. It\u0027s Morse Code! Felipe reads it out loud for all to hear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hungry. I am hungry. Can we order another Pizza?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
