I searched it up on steam, because it has a steam page, but it apparently was taken off of the store. I know some people were able to play it, due to there being reviews and screenshots that players have posted. I really wanted to try and play it but why did it get removed?\u00A0 And where can I find it now? If it was development difficulties or lack of motivation, I am sorry. The steam page also said that they were targeting a 2021 release, but the pandemic probably pushed that back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-13T23:18:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2023 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by munman19\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T22:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this is pretty interesting but never heard about the game, you have that insane helicopter designed to capture Saturn 5 first stages.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI say that the most effective disposable launcher is an\u00A0 2.5 stage setup with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E or mostly less optimal with liquid fueled boosters,\u00A0 core stage and an second stage, this works well both RL and in KSP.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP the second stage tend to be the payload you put into orbit.
