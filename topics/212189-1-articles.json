For KSP 1, I (and I know of others) would make a basic mod just to add custom flags.

Have it open the file chooser tool, so that you can find your image. When you find you image, it is displayed in game, and you can edit its aspect ratio. Aspect ratios\u00A0 that aren\u0027t default are achieved by making the flags upper pole a different length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T07:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you just do it like in ksp1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T11:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 was literally \u0022put the png image into the flag folder\u0022.
