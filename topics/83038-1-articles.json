In some viewing angles, the plane selected is completely wacky. If you don\u0027t remember how exactly was your camera oriented when you moved the craft there (you can move it back along the same plane using the same viewing angle) the safest bet is to move it to the center of the wall first, then move it to the center of the building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rotate the camera so it looks along the floor and directly against one of walls or out the door. You need to have the plane in your view. If you can\u0027t get it into the view while looking in such straight direction, pan the camera (e.g. hold middle button and move the mouse) to get the plane in view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move the plane to the center of the wall at which you\u0027re looking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rotate the camera 90 degrees to look straight into another wall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Again, pan the camera to have the plane in view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move the plane back to the center\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T08:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, this happens more often that you\u0027d think.
