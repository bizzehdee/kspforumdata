KJR just autostruts every part in your craft to its grandparent part -- so if you\u0027ve used it, you should know. An autostrut is just a regular strut with no mass and no drag, that only goes to particular places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRigid attachment sets the flexibility of the joint between the current part and the parent part to zero. Rigidity\u00A0can help your craft fly, but it also makes the joints more brittle -- so they snap off more easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the only way to turn either one on is one part at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-22T12:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you it\u0027s crystal water clear!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-22T22:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what can I do when my plane explodes on launch du to \u0022structural failure on linkage between extra large gear and fuselage\u0022 ???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding gear is always strutted to heaviest part and whatever is set the rigid setting, on or off, same result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis plane was fine with KJR in\u00A01.1.3 and now it\u0027s impossible to launch.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T00:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need a posted craft file to test.
