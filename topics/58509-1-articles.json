Its gravity is only 0.275g, less than twice that of Mun.

Likewise, matching Moho\u0027s orbital inclination is best done out at your solar apoapsis, instead of waiting until you\u0027re inside Moho\u0027s intercept window (which\u0027d be at your solar periapsis), and that can save you quite a bit of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, burn just before the window.
