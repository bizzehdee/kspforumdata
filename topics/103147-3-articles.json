So to make them fly high I needed high altitude engines. But RAPIER engines don\u0027t look scale enough. So I clipped them inside B9 Turbo Fans using Tweakscale a Structural Mount and the Offset Tool. This way when flying at extremely high altitudes the plane will maintain speed and controllability in thin air using 8 engines 4 of which switchable to rocket mode. I also clipped large B9 air scoops into the top of the side fuselages to add to the shape as well as supply a tremendous amount of air. The other hurdle to overcome was flex. With such a large wingspan it would flex like crazy. So I used about 12 of the invisible struts from B9 as to not mess with the ships aesthetics.\n\nVery nice!
