I\u0027ve found that a couple of small heat control panels (\u0022Thermal Control Systems\u0022) \u002B a couple of 6-panel solar panels on the adjacent part isn\u0027t quite enough to stop an ISRU going over its max operating efficiency. However, it takes a significant amount of time to exceed maximum-efficiency temperature meaningfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there is any need to worry about too much cooling for either of them: the thermal control system shouldn\u0027t try to cool the operating \u0022core\u0022 directly, but rather the \u0022core\u0022 heats up independently and that hot core then heats the part and adjacent parts, and it is the latter that is cooled by the thermal control system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for efficiency and power usage: the stated temperature-dependent \u0022efficiency\u0022 of the drill and ISRU appears to be merely a question of operating speed. So taking the ISRU, for example, a 100%-efficiency (1000\u00B0) core will consume vast amounts of electricity and convert ore correspondingly quickly, while a 10%-efficiency core (can\u0027t remember what sort of temperature that corresponds to - maybe 500\u00B0?) will consume much less electricity and convert ore slowly. The actual efficiency of the conversion is unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineer affects drill output over time, but the drill operating speed and energy consumption depends on its temperature. \u003Cs\u003ETherefore it seems that the one place that you don\u0027t want to drill without an engineer is\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cu\u003EThe place where the percentage operating efficiency is most significant is when drilling \u003C/u\u003Ean asteroid, since it will lose mass \u003Cu\u003Eas you drill, but this mass will only be converted to ore on your ship at a 1:1 ratio when you\u0027re at 100% thermal efficiency. If you run out of ore storage space, the drill simply does nothing at all. Therefore the best way to drill out an asteroid while preserving the maximum amount of mass would probably be to prohibit use of your ore tanks until the drill is up to 100% efficiency, then allow the tanks to be filled. This also means you can happily leave ISRU and drills running together (provided you have sufficient cooling) and be sure that you are obtaining the most efficient output.\u003C/u\u003E \u003Cs\u003Eat the same speed* with or without an engineer, but ore output will vary greatly depending on the presence and level of the engineer.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E* (at least this is what it looked like to me the last time I did it.

Thus, as temperature rises the % efficiency rises very slowly at first, speeds up in the middle range of 30-70% then slows on approaching 100%. Since the part has a 2000\u00B0K heat tolerance, I would guess that exact same efficiency function continues above 1000\u00B0K (i.e. slow decrease in efficiency in the 1000-1200\u00B0 range, speeding

means, in a moment).\u00A0 If they\u0027re at any other temperature-- either hotter \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eor\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E colder-- then they\u0027re operating at lower

and become more efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to have some radiators on your ship to keep them from heating past their max-efficiency temperature.\u00A0 The good news is that the radiators are intelligent enough that they won\u0027t \u0022overcool\u0022-- that is, suppose you have more radiator capacity than you actually need, they won\u0027t shoot you in the foot by keeping your drills chilled and running inefficiently.\u00A0 The radiators are smart enough to say, \u0022I\u0027m not going to cool this drill at all until it gets up to 500K, but then I\u0027ll cool it to keep it from getting any hotter than that at all.\u0022\u00A0 So as long as you have enough radiator capacity to do that, you don\u0027t have to worry about having \u0022too much\u0022-- it won\u0027t

pulling ore at the fastest rate it possibly can.\u00A0 An ISRU at 100% efficiency is converting ore to propellant at the fastest rate it possibly can.\u00A0 When the efficiency is, say, 50%, that

That is, if your drill is running at 10% thermal efficiency, then you\u0027re getting ore at only 1/10th the rate, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand you\u0027re only using 1/10th the electricity.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 In other words, a mining operation spends a certain amount of electricity per ore unit mined, regardless of the thermal efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means in practice is that you start up all your drills, they have really crappy thermal efficiency (\u0027coz they\u0027re all cold), and you\u0027re using very little electric power.\u00A0 As they warm up, they start pulling ore faster, and they also start drinking electricity faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, the

empty ore tank space available, pulls 15 EC/second of electricity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt does this regardless of the ore concentration and the engineer skill level.\u00A0 If the ore is lower, or the engineer level is lower, this means it pulls less ore/second, but it\u0027s still pulling the full amount of electricity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThus, higher ore concentration

only pay electricity if some conversion is actually taking place.\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EIf your ore tanks fill up and you\u0027re not draining them via ISRU, then your drills stop drawing power.\u00A0 If your LFO tanks fill up so your ISRU can\u0027t convert any more, it stops drawing power.\u00A0 If you\u0027re ISRU-converting and ore-drilling at the same time, and you have ore in your tanks but its level is dropping because the ISRU is converting faster than the drills can drill, then the ISRU power consumption will drop a lot when the ore tank reaches zero, because then the ISRU will be throttled to the paltry incomng ore rate from the drills, which is a lower rate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOre mining is really really slow, so you want your ore drills running at 100% thermal efficiency.\u00A0 To do that, all you need to do is 1. make sure you have radiators on the ship, and 2. wait.\u00A0 The drills will naturally warm up as they operate until they reach optimum operating temperature, and the radiators will then stop the drills from getting too hotter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as ISRU is concerned, it\u0027s not worth worrying about, it\u0027ll generally take care of itself.\u00A0 Besides, ISRU capacity is so much higher than drill capacity that it\u0027s never a bottleneck-- one ISRU can cheerfully keep up with the output from a dozen drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s the practical

happily forever, and one that keeps running out of power.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFuel cells are of particular interest.\u00A0 A mining/ISRU ship turns electricity into LFO.\u00A0 A fuel cell turns LFO into electricity.\u00A0 There\u0027s a certain break-even point, above which fuel cells generate more electricity than the LFO they consume, and below which they don\u0027t.\u00A0 You really

The point in mining is to get the exact heat needs and then keep the electricity going while trying to get max out put(This only reduce via fuel cells).
