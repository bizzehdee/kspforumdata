The solar panels generate enough electricity to fly when the sun is high enough - most of the daylight, however - when the sun is near the equator at dawn and dusk the angle is too great on the panels to get enough and it runs off batteries. My aim for the Condor here, is to store enough charge to run over-night, and so be a genuine perpetual aircraft. \n\nVal did the honours in this landmark (for me) test flight, proving the basic technology.
