Using my imagination I think (because I want it to be an alien spacecraft) an alien spacecraft came into orbit around Earth and dropped off another craft which it then rapidly accelerated off to either its home world or an outpost. So a possible answer to this video would be enlightening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
