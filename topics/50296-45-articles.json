Looking at the logs now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I was a bit rushed on my last message, so a bit of clarification about that error for anyone who\u0027s curious. So far as I know, it\u0027s harmless and it\u0027s caused by plugins that add PartModules directly in their code rather than through part configuration files or through ModuleManager. It creates what KSP sees as a discrepency because the code that\u0027s responsible for the error only knows about modules that were loaded from the PART{} node for that part. This part is strictly speculation on my part but it\u0027s probably because it builds a list when processing configs and throws that error if there are more PartModules than what it loaded from configs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, plugins like DREC or FAR will cause errors like that but I\u0027ve never known it to lead to actual errors. Everyone that uses plugins that do that will have those errors whether they are aware of it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(uninstalling plugins can also cause that error in craft that already exist in a save file prior to uninstallation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And when it says something like \u0027module #1\u0027, that\u0027s actually module #2 because module #0 is the first module.

Since FAR represent realistic aerodynamics aerobraking became less efficient when craft shape is aerodynac. So in order to get the same amount of aerobraking as stock game you need to go deeper into the atmosphere and there you get you ship destroyed with g forces by DR.
