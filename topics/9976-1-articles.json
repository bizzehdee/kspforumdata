So the faster the ship is pitching, yawing, or rolling, the harder the S.A.S. module tries to stop the turn. This is supposed to dampen the action of the S.A.S module, preventing overshoot, as well as dampening any fast turn or roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Integral means the S.A.S. module increases the corrective force the longer the ship is off-target.
