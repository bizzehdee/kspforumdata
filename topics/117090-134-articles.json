all the usual fairing options apply for textures, diameter set through MCB module).\u00A0 Will have internal front, back, and dorsal attach nodes (as well as the standard external top/bottom nodes); the proper way to attach drop-tanks for these saddle-trusses would be using surface attach against the internal dorsal node with a decoupler (may come with integrated decoupler for dorsal node... undecided).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore MCB parts will be available in the future with different models, including fully enclosed cargo bays (circular), with various options for door mechanics (folding, rotating, hinged).\u00A0 Also planning on having a couple of extensible/deploy-able cargo ramp setups that can be used for end-caps/adapters.\u00A0 Haven\u0027t quite worked out how the dynamic-animation stuff is going to work out....but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll figure it out (my current animation handling module is pretty generic, robust, and configurable;

ignoring all other sources of EC input or consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is -way- more effort than I\u0027m willing to go through for this, not to mention less than optimal from a performance standpoint (especially if every mod is doing its own simulations), nor is it a \u0027complete\u0027 implementation as it ignores generators aside stock energy sources, and ignores consumers aside from Kerbalism.\u00A0 This is where there needs to be a stock system in place for out-of-focus vessel updates; something a mod can subscribe to (or preferably at the part-module level) to process these out-of focus updates properly, with every module being able to do its generation/consumption updates properly.\u00A0 The stock system need not run on every \u0027tick\u0027, but could process things in larger discrete chunks to cut down on the overhead of all of those updates (e.g. simulate minutes, hours, etc rather than physics-frame updates).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I have \u0027fixed\u0027 the boiloff code to no longer just drain the EC and then process full boiloff.\u00A0 It will now track the effective percent (average over the last few ticks) from before the vessel is unfocused, and use that value upon vessel re-focus; simulating all elapsed out-of-focus time with that cached \u0027effective percent\u0027.\u00A0 What this means is that as long as you had EC when the vessel was un-focused, it\u0027ll process as if it had EC the entire time;\u00A0 if the battery was empty and the EC generation was only supplying part of what was needed for boil-off prevention, that partial value will be used to simulate for the elapsed un-focused time.\u00A0 Still a bit abusable, but at least it won\u0027t make all your fuel disappear when it shouldn\u0027t (though it may leave you with more than you should have had left... but that is a smaller problem from a gameplay/enjoyability/expectations perspective).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adrianstu98","CreatedById":122278,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T18:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, i am having a problem with the launch abort system of the Ori\u00F3n craft.
