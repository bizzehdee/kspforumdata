This is Raymon Kerman, CEO of Jeb\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co. I have realized instead of contracting to the KSP, we could be better off creating our own space launch vehicles. Therefore we have begun development of a small orbital launch vehicle, codenamed \u0027Swift\u0027. We have no finished renderings of the vehicle, but they will be here soon. This is all we have, and we project that we can launch the first test launch in quite a bit of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERaymon Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCEO of Jeb\u0027s Junkyard Co.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
