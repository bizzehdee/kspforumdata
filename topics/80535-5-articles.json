That secrecy would go out the window as soon as the craft was rolled to the pad and launched, so both rollout and launch were scheduled to occur under the cover of darkness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150129_ksp0187_hawk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150129_ksp0187_hawk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150129_ksp0199_hawk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150129_ksp0199_hawk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJervan, Geneble, and Anny, the three kerbonauts chosen by Gene as the most reliable and trustworthy, were well on their way to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn before anyone further up the chain of command was aware of the launch. Gene had some autonomy in decision making, and this mission had been greenlit and built-out many m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths before. Except that he\u0027d been explicitly told to put it aside until the Duna mission was prepared and underway. And then again until the Eve mission was launched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150129_ksp0218_hawk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150129_ksp0218_hawk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe watched as the crew set about \u0022extracting\u0022 themselves from the launch fairings. The Hawk 2 was a bit different, in that it would use the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar transfer stage to complete the capture and the first parts of the lander\u0027s descent. That would give them enough propellent to work in the highly-inclined orbit required to reach the second landing site. So instead of extracting the MEM from the transfer stage, the command module extracted itself, and spun around to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150129_ksp0225_hawk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150129_ksp0225_hawk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that maneuver complete, Gene retired to his office. He was there when the Senator and his aides burst in unannounced. \u0022You\u0027ve really done it this time!\u0022 The Senator had all but thrown the door open, and moved angrily towards Gene flanked by his ever-present assistants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Senator,\u0022 Gene motioned towards the chairs on the opposite side of his desk. \u0022Please, have a seat.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No! No more seats! And no more kid gloves. Look, we\u0027ve tried everything with you. Memory wipes, ostracization, hard labour, more memory wipes. You name it, it\u0027s been tried. Now for some fool reason the rest of the Council wants you alive. Why? I\u0027ll never understand. But me? I think it\u0027s high time we try something a bit more,\u0022 he glanced back at his aides, \u0022permanent. Boys?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene started to back away from his desk as the two advanced. They reached inside their jackets, pulled out two tasers, grinned, then turned quickly to face the Senator. \u0022What in the name of the Kraken is going on here?\u0022 The aides glanced at each other, one of them shrugged, then they simultaneously zapped him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene was dumbstruck. One of the kerbals was searching the crumpled mass on the floor and looked up to the other. \u0022Think you could\u0027ve waited a bit longer there Pods? Sheesh.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I thought that was your job!\u0022 He kicked the Senator to make sure he was out then turned to Gene. \u0022Gene Kerman? I\u0027m Podoly. This is Lengee. We used to fly for you, back... before.\u0022 He kicked the Senator again to make sure he wasn\u0027t faking. \u0022We\u0027re a bit short on time so I\u0027ll save the rest for later. Please come with us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene grabbed a few things from his desk and stuffed his pockets. \u0022Are you the rebels?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELengee laughed. \u0022Rebels? Dude doesn\u0027t know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene, the rebel nations are all fakes. Just more arms of the Council reaching out to keep Kerbin in its stranglehold. No no, we\u0027re the Resistance. Which, well, I guess, yes. That makes us the rebels.\u0022 Podoly looked at his watch. \u0022We\u0027ve got to go. Now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey ran through the halls of mission control to a specific emergency exit, their escape route seemingly planned in advance. Outside a small cart was waiting and all three climbed aboard. They wheeled towards the hanger as fast as the cart would go, electric motors sparking and whining in a way no electric motors should ever spark or whine. Podoly touched his ear (wherever that is) and spoke into the air. \u0022Copy that Mother, headed your way now.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150208_ksp0007_extract.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150208_ksp0007_extract.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were no planes on the tarmac. Gene had expected to see something. Anything. \u0022Where are we going?\u0022 No response. They squealed onto the runway, the small cart\u0027s tires gripping as best they could, and hauled _it_ eastbound along the center stripe. A rumble and more squeals behind them prompted Gene to look back. \u0022There\u0027s a plane landing!

Gene could hear the screech of the tires and the scraping of metal as it barreled down the runway towards them. \u0022What about Wernher and Carl?\u0022 he screamed. Lengee shook his head and tapped at his ear. The jets behind them were reversed and loudly clawing at the think Kerbin air. A shadow passed over and seconds later they were bouncing violently upwards and backwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150208_ksp0018_extract.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150208_ksp0018_extract.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir \u0022ride\u0022 pitched up quickly, throwing them to the back of the cargo bay with a crash.

Someone had dragged him to a seat at the front of the cargo bay and applied a bandage to the side of his head. He felt it, groaned when the pain flashed through him, then looked around. The cargo bay was empty, save for the wreckage of the cart and the kerbal sitting next to him. Carl Kerman, chief of RATS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I had wondered when you\u0027d come back to us.

The scenes inside of the tunnel to the UFO, for instance, were acted out on December 15th, and I just waited until I felt the time was right to drop that bit in. Much of the \u0022delay\u0022 of Hawk 2 was my own doing, as that mission has always been intended as the end of an Act. I had really planned to do that earlier, but I found flying the Shuttle missions to be more fun than I anticipated. Deorbiting the satellites was mostly planned, but I decided instead to have some fun with the Claw. (All three of my Geostationary communications satellites have already disappeared on their own. GSO is cursed, I tell ya. And I can\u0027t blame Remote Tech this time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things just happened organically. The crash of the Wanderer, for instance, was not planned. Not even really desired. I don\u0027t script accidents like that, but I also don\u0027t revert them. I had every intention of building the Erne mission to Eve, and even have 5 crew members now sitting around KSC twiddling their thumbs. Logically, after an accident such as that, things would have to change. Investigations would be conducted. Design changes would be made. So it didn\u0027t make sense to rush the construction of the Erne with only 150 days or so until the next Eve transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the shuttle out of commission and the three large ships busy with their transfers to Jool and Duna, it made sense to me to bring this part of Ad Lunam to a close. So what\u0027s next? A few updates ago I mentioned we\u0027d get to \u0022play around with the shiny new 0.90 stuff,\u0022 and that\u0027s what\u0027s coming. We\u0027re going to go back to Year 1 Day 1 and go through a few quick history updates. And then we\u0027ll get back to the Duna missions. No matter when KSP 1.0 drops, I\u0027m not upgrading (this save) until after I\u0027ve finished with what I\u0027m doing on Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter Duna, well, we\u0027ll see. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBloopers and Outtakes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody that\u0027s tried something like that plane extraction knows exactly what \u0022really\u0022 happened.

So early on the morning of the 62nd day since the asteroid strike, him and Bob set out to conduct two more Grep-Sed launches.

Wernher\u0027s \u0022kapsuul\u0022 was repurposed as the control hub for the two lower stages. A new compressed-gas reaction control system was developed to allow for the spacecraft to orient itself prior to firing the orbital stage, as seen below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150215_ksp0021_0493_seeker1-2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150215_ksp0021_0493_seeker1-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo thruster blocks were all that was required for the RCS, as that provided both roll and pitch.

Foremost, the \u0022kapsuul\u0022 was being treated by KSP as the root part, despite being neither the first part added nor the only probe core. So when the sounding rocket stage was fired, focus would remain on the Songbird. This configuration also made it difficult to reach a good deployment altitude. The Seeker 3, a design that had worked previously (in an alternate universe), failed miserably and spun out of control. As a result none of the first three were successful in placing an object in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately I decided to scrap the K-5/Sounding Rocket combo and just moved on to placing something in orbit. Anything. Funds were running low, and I really needed to finish off that orbital contract so I could start taking other contracts.

It was a negligible added mass for a huge potential return in science data. Thanks to these changes and the upgraded Songbird, the Seeker 4 became the first artificial satellite of Kerbin crafted by the hands of kerbals. Yet it couldn\u0027t stay in orbit for long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatteries. Batteries. Batteries. Power. Always a problem in the early game. Not only do probe cores suck down energy at an incredible rate, but there is no way to get it back in the early game without using a LV-T30 or LV-T45 engine. So, as much as I would\u0027ve like to have left the Seeker 4 in orbit for m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths or even years, it had to return after a single orbit. The science it had gathered was useless if it was always 74kms up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150215_ksp0021_0546_seeker4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150215_ksp0021_0546_seeker4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter one orbit the Seeker 4 used its black magic to reorient itself retrograde and burn. I knew my only hope of recovering the science was to land the \u0022kapsuul\u0022 on solid Kerbin, as the force of impact with the Songbird still attached would be fatal with a water landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150215_ksp0021_0553_seeker4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150215_ksp0021_0553_seeker4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I failed. The spacecraft exploded upon coming into contact with Kerbin\u0027s Ocean, the debris sinking to the deep blue bottom of Jeb\u0027y Kerman\u0027s Locker. All that science data lost forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Seeker 4 was the end of an era on Kerbin. Rocketry was now an accepted pursuit, with engineers and scientists flocking to Cape Kerbal from all over the planet. With crew\u0027d spaceflight having been proven safe by Jebediah, and orbital spaceflight having been proven possible by Wernher, the DEMO program was ready to move to its next stage: Placing a kerbal into orbit. With that new purpose came a new name - DEMO 18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=class: grid, align: left]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Mission[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Mass[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Expense[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Income[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Science[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr][td]Seeker 1[/td][td]14.4[/td][td]12,001[/td][td]4,587[/td][td]7.0[/td][/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr][td]Seeker 2[/td][td]13.7[/td][td]11,359[/td][td]0[/td][td]1.7[/td][/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr][td]Seeker 3[/td][td]13.9[/td][td]11,684[/td][td]0[/td][td]0.0[/td][/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr][td]Seeker 4[/td][td]14.3[/td][td]11,020[/td][td]60,244[/td][td]40.0[/td][/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKestrel 1 Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 1 day 324 - Cape Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDEMO-18\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was considerable debate amongst the kerbonaut corps as to who would be first to orbit the planet. Jebediah was the logical choice, being the only kerbal to prove he could live in space. The two new pilots, Annie and Jenzer, were also considered front-runners for the flight. Nobody expected Bill or Bob to be first. (Few understood why they were part of the kerbonaut corps in the first place.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no rush for the administration to choose however, as upgrades for the launchpad and other facilities were required before the Kestrel Program could begin. The larger mass and taller rockets required for placing a kerbal into orbit necessitated improvements, as a strange mystical prompt kept alerting the VAB crew to the excessive height and mass of everything they tried to launch. Even something as small as the Kestrel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so 50 days later the first craft rolled out to the new launchpad. A small bird of prey with a smaller passenger, none other than Jebediah Kerman. Rumours were circulating that Jeb had threatened to \u0022take his capsule and go home\u0022 and no one was interested in using Wernher\u0027s 3-body \u0022kapsuul,\u0022 so all objections were dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene had his small flight operations crew assembled in Mission Control, each controller prepared for the thousand different ways everything could go wrong. Behind him were more reporters than he could remember ever seeing, all crammed into the small press box they jokingly called the fishbowl. Wernher was pacing nervously at the back of the room, and would occasionally give the camera-wielding occupants of the fishbowl an artificial smile. Gene got his attention and waved him into the Flight Director\u0027s trench.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Doctor von Kerman.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Herr Kerman.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Call me Gene.\u0022 He flipped a switch on his console to start the countdown and turned back to Wernher. \u0022So, anything peculiar we should expect from this new bird of yours? Or are you normally this nervous?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe famous Westlander rocket scientist shook his head. \u0022No, just always nervous. The Kestrel is only the K-5 wrapped in the smaller shell, built using more modern components and more efficient engines. Fewer tanks, lower mass, new name.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kestrel, yes. One of the smaller birds of prey. I can only guess you have plans for the future. Right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher smiled. \u0022Ve shall see, yes?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0022_0001_kestrel1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0022_0001_kestrel1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene turned a knob to free his headset from the foot pedal and stood up from his station. \u0022Controllers, we need a go / no-go for flight.\u0022 He glanced around the small Mission Control room and started calling out each station\u0027s ID, getting an affirmative \u0022Go\u0022 from each. \u0022Launch control, we\u0027re Go across the board, all lights green. Let\u0027s light this bird.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy flight\u0022 came the response from the kerbal at the very front of the room. The launch controller\u0027s job was the easiest in the room: Count down from 10 and press the large red button that dominated his console. Upon reaching zero he enthusiastically smacked the button with both hands. An electrical circuit closed, generating a pulse. The signal raced along the wires between the mission control and the launchpad at the speed of light, triggering a relay that toggled a solenoid that opened the fuel and oxidizer valves at the base of the Kestrel. Sparks were followed by flames followed by a river of fire, and Jebediah Kerman was away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0022_0003_kestrel1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0022_0003_kestrel1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe roar from rocket was drowned out by the roar from the press room. Gene thought for a moment the back wall of the building might have fallen off again then realized it was just the sound of applause, cheers, camera shutters and the raucous roar of the reporters. He elbowed at Wernher motioned back towards them with his thumb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where\u0027d they get these guys? The sports desk?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher shrugged. \u0022Perhaps a few of them?\u0022 Completely missing the joke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0022_0013_kestrel1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0022_0013_kestrel1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kestrel let out its final screech just as the Songbird stage started to sing. Telemetry showed a good ascent profile and perfect performance from Wernher\u0027s new engines. Gene buzzed the Flight Surgeon to get a report on Jeb and got a big smile and a thumbs up as a response. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, Booster. We show Songbird cutout.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy Booster. Fido?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah flight. We show good injection. Kestrel is in orbit with an apoapsis above 111km and a periapsis somewhere near 72km.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene smiled and shook his fist in victory. \u0022Copy Fido. CapCom? Let Jebediah know the good news. Good job kerbals, but we\u0027ll hold our celebrations until Jeb\u0027s Kerbin-side again.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, CapCom.\u0022 Bill took his foot off of his headset footpedal and cleared his throat before continuing. Gene heard it regardless, given that his station was a mere 4 feet behind the CapCom. \u0022Showing LOS on Kestrel 1. Reacquisition in 30 minutes, give or take.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoss of Signal was an expected condition, as they had only built a handful of ground relay stations and so far there were no relay satellites in orbit. Twenty nine minutes later Jebediah\u0027s voice came booming over the feed. He was ranting about the emptiness of space, a large glowing disc on the far side of the planet, and a huge, endless desert stretching across the other continent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the next orbit Jebediah made his intentions clear: He was going to land in this new desert, somewhere just west of Puerto Kabat. \u0022Look, there\u0027s friendlies in Kabat, so worst-case scenario I have to hike through some sand. I\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene motioned to Bill to patch him through directly. \u0022Kestrel, Flight. That\u0027s a negative on the desert landing. We can\u0027t have kerbonauts dropping down in enemy territory without prior authorization. Wouldn\u0027t want to start another war, now would we?\u0022 Gene waited a few moments for a response. Nothing. \u0022Kestrel?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, I heard you flight. Unless something has changed in the last few m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnths, Kabat is not one of the constituent states of the CCHR. Investigating the scale of the impact event would be helpful, correct?\u0022 Bill motioned at Gene, indicating LOS was just a few seconds away. \u0022Besides, I\u0027m Jebediah Kerman. What could possible go....\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, CapCom. Showing LOS on Kestrel 1.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy CapCom.\u0022 Gene ripped off his headset and tossed it at his station. He picked up his coffee cup to take a drink, only to find it empty. \u0022Ok kerbals, we\u0027ve got 30 minutes until Jebediah comes around again. More than likely we\u0027ll get a call from the defense minister long before then asking about some unknown spacecraft landing in enemy territory. So if you need a break, now\u0027s the time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Jebediah Kerman was not one to be dissuaded by a grumpy Flight Director. He knew perfectly well he had nothing to fear from landing at Puerto Kabat, mainly because he\u0027d spent more than a year there during the early part of The War. He had friends there. His old restaurant as there. He could probably even buy a new plane there if he wanted. What could he possibly have to worry about?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0022_0019_kestrel1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0022_0019_kestrel1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploding on reentry would be a good place to start. He hadn\u0027t really expected the Songbird stage to melt during reentry, and perhaps it hadn\u0027t, but the flames shooting past the small window in his capsule were telling a different tale. They eventually were bad enough that he gave in and jettisoned the nearly empty tank and its engine. \u0022Could\u0027a sold that for scrap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150222_ksp0022_0021_kestrel1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150222_ksp0022_0021_kestrel1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoments later the flames stopped. The capsule quickly sank into the thick air, and soon the noise form the wind was obvious. The chutes popped, unreefed, and fully deployed. And then he was down. The sand sprayed up in a geyser following the impact, and the capsule sinking down into the soft upper layer of dust. He wasted no time jumping out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Last time I was here\u0022 he said to no one in particular, \u0022there was a road along the coast.

Nothing but sand. \u0022This doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u0022 He grabbed the survival pack from the capsule, ditched his helmet, and started hiking for the top of the ridge.
