I suggest that the game settings buttons be renamed from \u0022Apply\u0022 and \u0022Accept\u0022 to \u0022Apply\u0022 and \u0022OK\u0022 instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very minor gripe, sure, but more often than not, because \u0022Apply\u0022 is first of two buttons with similar (at a glance) labeling, I click it without realizing that it won\u0027t close the window, so I have to then click \u0022Accept\u0022 in order to finish and back out. The Unity UI engine doesn\u0027t try to accommodate usability standards, so it\u0027s left up to the designers to compensate with familiar labeling. As it stands, the current labels are a slight deviation from the standard that is observed in nearly everything else, from the OS itself to interactive websites. Does anybody else notice this, or is it just me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I know it\u0027s extremely minor, but it does give me a virtual flick in the head whenever I stumble into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
