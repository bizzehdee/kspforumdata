The information crackled through Jeb\u0027s radio who was busy preparing his EVA to the surface Duna. After spending a whole lot of days there together with Bill and Bob due to budgetary cuts and the plain lazy mission director who refused to launch a return mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb thought it was a great idea but it really didn\u0027t matter how much he wanted to go there, it wouldn\u0027t make any changes to his situation. So he just replied to KSC that it was wonderfull news. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more months passes and Jeb Bill and Bob spent even more time on the Dunan surface boring themselves and waiting for a rover that was supposed to arrive a long time ago but missed the target by 120km and was roving ever since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut meanwhile at the Space center back on kerbin the atmosphere was tense! \u0022T-minus ten, nine, eight, ..., three two one ignition! And we have a liftoff!\u0022 the launch director yelled out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA recon unit with on board Haddos and Seery Kerman had just left with as mission: find a suitable place for setting up a munar base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s cool that we\u0027re going to the mun isn\u0027t it Seery?\u0022 screamed Haddos trying to get his voice louder than the roaring of the powerfull mainsail engines. \u0022Yeah replied Seery, although i can\u0027t wait to get rid of some of those engines, because this sound isn\u0027t bearable!\u0022 Just a few moments later the first stage decoupled, reducing the sound level to a more tolerable level. Some time later both kerbals were in orbit enjoying both the view and silence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When do we have to get ready for our trans-munar-burn?\u0022 asked Seery. Haddos replied that they had a few more minutes of peace before they would have to get back to work. Haddos started reading his comics and Seery was dreaming away by the amazing view of kerbin. Haddos had brought a whole pile of KinKin comics, he was a big fan of captain Haddock! A small alarm sounded alarming the crew to get ready for there burn. \u0022This is Haddos Kerman, ready for burning\u0022. \u0022This is Seery, Same here!\u0022 Mission control awnsered that everything looked good and the burn could soon begin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good day Crew you have about twenty seconds before your burn\u0022 those words sounded through the radio. Both kerbals were in position and Haddos\u0027 hand was ready to push the throttle. \u0022Okay, three two one fire engines!\u0022 The two small LV-909 engines fired and started pushing them away from kerbin. \u0022Excited Seery?\u0022 Asked Haddos. \u0022You have no idea Haddos, I don\u0027t really get why they chose us though, we were hired one day and the next we are fired to the mun!\u0022 Haddos laughed and awnsered \u0022thank god every kerbal has an astronaut built in!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinutes later there burn was complete and they were on route to the Mun! Seery took a quick Eva to check the rovers hanging by the side of the craft. \u0022Looking good he said, oh man even by night kerbin still looks beatifull doesn\u0027t she!\u0022 \u0022She sure does\u0022 Haddos said. \u0022But you better get back in because we don\u0027t want to lose you in outer space, or even worse, get killed by the kraken!\u0022 \u0022How so the kraken?\u0022 Asked Seery. \u0022Well although many of us thought he is dead ,we have lost nearly a dozen of earlier ships trying to reach Kerblab\u0022 said Haddos. \u0022Are you sure it wasn\u0027t just faulty engineering Haddos?\u0022 \u0022Well maybe but the engineer told me it was the kraken\u0022 replied Haddos. \u0022So the guy who designs our rockets blaims the kraken (who is obviously dead), I don\u0027t know but that sounds like an excuse to me!\u0022 Seery quickly awsered. \u0022Well it would make more sense than the kraken\u0022 Haddos awnsered with a small doubt in his voice. \u0022I really don\u0027t get why that guy isn\u0027t fired yet, he must have caused hundreds of faulty missions by now!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well he is the only guy on Kerbin who can actually design rockets!\u0022 Seery awnsered. \u0022Yeah that\u0027s right but still! Remember that mission to laythe, only when landing they discovered that the landing gear was placed to high ,resulting in the fact that those kerbals are still stuck there!\u0022 said Haddos. \u0022Yeah the engine that broke off and the lander that flipped over was really a failed end to the mission that would change history\u0022 replied Seery, \u0022but anyway i\u0027m getting kind of tired here.\u0022 \u0022Yeah me too\u0022 said Haddos, \u0022time to take a nap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of hours later Haddos woke up, he looked out of his window and saw the moon as never before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Seery wake up!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-what happend, did anything explode again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- noooo, come check out this wonderfull view of the mun!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ooooh my!!
