I\u0027ve heard that it\u0027s the hardest of the bunch, but I haven\u0027t verified that, I just know that having life support consume electricity makes your early career mode flights \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E interesting. Assuming you don\u0027t have batteries and don\u0027t stack multiple capsules, a single mk1 capsule has just enough electricity for 20 minutes of life support, assuming you use your electricity for nothing else and don\u0027t have an engine with an alternator. Yes, that means suborbital flights until you unlock batteries. You can get credit for orbital flight, you just don\u0027t have the duration to do an actual orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T20:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI go with TAC as well. Ioncross doesn\u0027t have a readout for non active flights which is essential if you\u0027re like me and you have up to 20 missions running at once. ECLSS also has a readout but I had some performance issues when I tried it, those are probably fixed by now though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with TAC is that the stock models are a bit ugly. But that\u0027s easily fixed with some user made models and creative use of other mods (Containers from zzz and spherical fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
