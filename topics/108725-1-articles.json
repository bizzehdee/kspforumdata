What I came up with is that Kerbin is experiencing an oil shortage and fuel would be limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the start of the game you would have a limited amount of stored fuel including LFO, Mono, xenon, and solid fuel. This could be modifiable depending on the level of difficulty you want. All ore would need to be removed from the KSC and surrounding area but could be found in areas of Kerbin. Fuel and ore recovered gets added to the reserve. Stored ore can be converted to any type as KSC would have a built in ISRU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptionally I am wondering if there should be a weekly or monthly allowance of fuel granted from some organization that would be based on your achievements and would degrade over time if you didnt do any missions to prevent time warping infinite fuel. Missions would have diminishing affects as well so you couldnt just keep doing mun missions and keep getting fuel grants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would give purpose to establishing mining and refueling stations around kerbin and other bodies to reduce the amount of fuel used launching new rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - Limited fuel to start the game.

Imagine having to buy more fuel if you\u0027ve run out of your current supply. Maybe Fuel supplies should be dependent on your reputation? There needs to be more things affected by that. Combine that with some sort of reputation decay (I think there\u0027s a mod for that) And boom. No timewarp fuel exploit. Maybe contracts should also be modified to grant fuel allotments when accepted with heavier reputation burns if canceled to make it painful to exploit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m surprised this wasn\u0027t added into stock already.
