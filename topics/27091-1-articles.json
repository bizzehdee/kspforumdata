It doesn\u0027t let you immediately see which are the small parts for use in probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn instant example of this is with the docking ports. The normal sized docking port has a smaller icon that the JR sized port. Totally the wrong way around imho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really needs to be a way of sorting the parts by size(ie 1.25m, 2.5m etc), by type (ie by function... sensors, rocket engine, tanks, etc). I think they need to be included even before resources because the more parts you get the harder it gets to find the part you want. At least have a detail listing so that you can see the individual stats like how Windows Explorer does things. In fact an Explorer like interface would be a lot more intuitive than the current system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current system is good enough for a few parts but it needs to grow along with the number of available parts these days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iRommel","CreatedById":63519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T08:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esubset or filters would be awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eparts fitting onto parts without first fitting them somewhere else would be awesome as well. and by awesome i mean.... it should already work like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor example, click propulsion, then click on a part size. large, medium or small. then you get (large) mainsails orange tanks etc , (medium)aerospikes etc (small) ant engine, donut fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i first started playing this game i literally had to dedicate serious time to looking at the icon trying to figure out some semblance of order.... and i think there is none. i have simply memorized where the parts are on the list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kromey","CreatedById":57375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T08:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iRommel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iRommel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei have simply memorized where the parts are on the list.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...And then you switch from playing on your Linux computer to your Windows computer (or vice-versa), and all your parts are in a different order!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexL","CreatedById":32200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T09:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iRommel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022iRommel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esubset or filters would be awesome.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, and they\u0027re coming to an editor near you (hopefully) in the next update.
