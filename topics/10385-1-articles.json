You can see all the ROM, the RAM and the registers in the CPU... and you can program it using a little instruction set I designed.\n\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2434899/CPU.xlsm](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2434899/CPU.xlsm)\n\nAt the moment it just computes the Fibonacci sequence, and stores each value in the first RAM location.\n\nThe instruction set is explained there, and I will probably add some extra features to it later on...\n\nYou\\\u0027ll need to enable the macros, but don\\\u0027t worry. It is safe. I wrote it all myself.\n\nI just did this for fun, but I figured if I let other people at it they might do some cool stuff with it, and maybe even add some cool stuff.\n\nI had planned on doing some I/O... which would require Interrupts. But that\\\u0027s going to take a fair amount of time."},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T00:09:04Z","Content":"Good!

And so, the whole thing is unstable whilst the thing is clocking automatically. You have to carefully switch the autoclock off (wait until the clock signal is mid transition and then click it, otherwise it might catch the macro call in the middle of the transition function and it gets very unhappy).\n\nI\\\u0027m not sure if there\\\u0027s anything I can do about it at the moment. I will look into it. For now, you\\\u0027ll just have to be careful or manually clock."}]}
