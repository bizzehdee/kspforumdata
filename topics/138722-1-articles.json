On Kerbin reentry the cockpit (Mk2 Standard)\u00A0heats up way faster than anything else and explodes every time.

You\u0027d think that the cockpit - with poor Jeb and Bill inside - would be more resilient, or at least as resilient as the Mk2 storage and fuel parts, plus wings and landing gear etc. To me it\u0027s a bit unrealistic like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I expecting too much of the Mk2 cockpit?

At very high altitudes (say, 40km - 50 km), the primary ways that matter to us are radiation and conduction. Spacecraft surfaces heat up primarily from radiation - the spacecraft forms a supersonic shockwave ahead of itself, compressing the air in front as it plows through. That air, thin as it is, is VERY hot - typically a couple thousand degrees. It doesn\u0027t actually touch the spacecraft surface directly but it DOES heat the nearby surfaces by radiation (think of standing next to a red-hot heating element in a floor heater or placing your hand next to a toaster while it\u0027s heating bread ...).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, having heated up the spacecraft belly of wings/fuselage by those radiation effects, those now-hot parts of your spacecraft naturally conduct at least some of that heat away from themselves to the cooler adjacent parts.

A long, slow hot entry is the worst possible way to enter in real-life, and not a great way to do it in KSP either.

That\u0027s why we sometimes see parts mounted to our capsules or spaceplanes heatsplode even when they\u0027re not directly exposed to the entry airflow directly - they\u0027re heating up by being mounted to parts that are heating up rapidly by entry effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now with all this in mind, the best way to get a spaceplane down safely and efficiently is to dump as much velocity as possible, AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND\u00A0WHILE UP HIGH in the thinner air - yes, slowing your craft will require converting all that velocity/kinetic energy to heat, but doing it QUICKLY minimizes the time during which the craft is exposed to that heat, and thus reduce overall heat flux. A long, slow hot entry is the worst possible way to enter in real-life, and not a great way to do it in KSP either. That kind of entry just lets all the parts of your spacecraft get much hotter than necessary, which can lead to part failure or complete loss of vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell gee, it sounds like you are directly contradicting my advice.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was trying to simplify things to get the message across but it looks like there\u0027s more to it than that - maybe i don\u0027t get all the physics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll explain how i think it works and let me know where i went wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. re-entry is the conversion of kinetic energy of the space vehicle to heat via friction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. in KSP, i was under the impression that the rate at which this occurs is down to dynamic pressure ie. combination of speed and altitude. the faster and lower you are the more rapidly kinetic energy is converted to heat\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. if heat generation \u0026gt; heat dissipation, \u00A0stuff gets hotter and can explode. \u00A0 \u00A0 In my experience skin temperature is what makes stuff blow, so it\u0027s not really about small amounts of heat building up over a long time, just too much heat arriving at once in the very short term - before it has time to conduct away to the core of the part, a radiator , engine pre-cooler or some other heat sink.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. so, by maximising lift (keeping the wings level and maintaining max lift AoA, but not deliberately stalling) you stay up in thin air as long as possible, slowing the process of frictional heating down. \u00A0 \u00A0There is still just \u00A0as much kinetic energy to convert to heat,\u00A0but it\u0027s spread over a longer period so the spacecraft can cope. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, are you saying that\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) in the upper atmosphere, ambient temperatures are very high so the craft cannot radiate heat away - heat flows from hot to cold as you point out - so you need to get down as fast as possible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) that lift may be better than drag, but 90 degrees AoA generates so much drag this wins even though zero lift is produced - it\u0027s a case of quantity over quality?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) some mojo that applies to blunt body shock cones that may not apply to the KSP model?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: do what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0says: entry at a very high AOA with a Pe around 50km.

So if you set a low Pe and then try to use your wings to counteract the natural tendency of that initial trajectory to forcer you lower into the atmosphere, you\u0027re not only greatly increasing the stress on your craft, you\u0027re also forcing your craft to go faster, lower in the atmosphere than you otherwise would AND trying to turn that kinetic energy into heat via drag than you otherwise would as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne spaceplane rides down for 90 seconds at 25 degrees AoA and wings level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other rides down for 90 seconds at 25 degrees AoA but in a 90 degree left bank, attempting to turn as hard as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth have been at the same AoA for the same length of time from the same starting velocity, so will have lost the same amount of speed, but the one with level wings will surely be higher up in the atmosphere after 90 seconds ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue.

How many banking turns you need depends on how far off-track you are from your intended landing site, how fast you\u0027re going when you get down into the \u0026lt;30km altitude range and start really FLYING as opposed to bullying through the upper atmosphere, and how far away you are linearly from the landing site.

The vast bulk of the heat is due to compressive heating of the gases you\u0027re plowing into -- it heats up so much it becomes a plasma. Blunt noses work by keeping a boundary layer of gas between your spacecraft and the plasma, so you heat by radiation and not by conduction.

Reinforced carbon-carbon works by having a high melting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe heating is proportional to your airspeed *cubed*, and only to the square root of air density. Roughly, that means that every 5km you need to lose a sixth\u00A0of your airspeed to maintain the same heat flow. If you come in from Minmus at 3200 m/s surface speed, and you\u0027d blow up at 40km at that speed, then to survive at 35km you need to drop to 2700 m/s, at 30km you need to be going a bit under 2300 m/s, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you can maintain that boundary layer (e.g. by pitching up steeply), heat takes time to transfer to your spacecraft.
