So I tried a simple rocket, six boosters and 3-4 decouplers per booster. And this is what I get. It stages the parachutes in stage3, and the main engine in the last stage. and puts one set of decouplers all by themselves. Is this the expected behavior or am I doing something outside of its limitations? I love the plugin, just still a little confused on its limitation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what you\u0027re doing. You can\u0027t actually attach one part to another part through multiple connections. So for example a booster can\u0027t be attached to the center tank by two different decouplers. You can place two decouplers, but only one will attach to the booster; the other will just hang off the center tank and do nothing. This is a limitation of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again summoning my awesome MS Paint skills:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D5WBffb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D5WBffb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe left is what you\u0027re trying to do - you want each decoupler to connect to the center tank and the booster. The right is what actually happens - the second decoupler is completely unattached to the booster. (It will collide in the physics engine, but isn\u0027t actually attached)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat AutoAsparagus (or any other mod) sees is just a decoupler sitting there on the center tank, with nothing attached to it. AutoAsparagus has problems with decouplers that don\u0027t attach to anything (listed as a known bug about fairings on the first page).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use two tanks on two decouplers (one on top of each other) to try to get around this, then the two tanks won\u0027t connect vertically.

The fairing issue was annoying but adding them last is an easy work around. I had two major issues that led to me uninstalling it for now.
