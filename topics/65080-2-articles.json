I was forced to quit because I left the country. After about march of last year, I started to run out of steam and haven\u0027t played the game nearly as much since then (about 2-5 hours per week). I spend more hours scouring the forums and installing mods than playing the game, interestingly enough. You could say that I\u0027ve checked out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an easy way to avoid running out of Steam. Just click on the menu in the top right corner and select the 2nd option Go Offline. Now you can run your Steam games without an online connection and it won\u0027t time out. At least I assume that is what you are talking about since no human could get bored of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T12:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt many who quit would be reading this...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T12:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI take frequent breaks from it.

If you downloaded and applied even one single mod, you already got more than the industry standard\u0027s worth of free bonus content. And KSP gives you orders of magnitude more than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a case of Unity being subpar (though it certainly is), or KSP being unfinished (though it certainly is), or anything similar - this is a case of you binge-consuming to the point where you throw up. It is the same reason why some people can play World of Warcraft obsessively for three years to the point where it destroys their lives, only to turn around and become viciously hateful towards the game and anyone who continues to play and *gasp* dares to have fun doing so. It\u0027s a crying shame because they forget and deny all those years they genuinely did have fun. Believe me, I know people like that, knew them before and after. It was certainly not the game\u0027s fault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t let that become you. Don\u0027t binge-consume, and don\u0027t play purely because of a perceived obligation. This is just a game, meant to be fun. And nothing is wrong with deciding to quit a game, so long as you don\u0027t do it out of disgust over what it has done to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quit the game once - I was forced to eat.
