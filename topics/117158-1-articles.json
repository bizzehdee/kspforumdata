I found that it is possible under just the right conditions, but barely. The entry corridor is so narrow that if you miss the correct periapsis altitude by just a couple hundred meters you will either blow up or fail to capture. The design of the spacecraft is also very important. The spacecraft requires a large ablator and a low \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eballistic coefficient\u003C/a\u003E, i.e. low mass per cross-sectional area. A low ballistic coefficient means that the spacecraft will decelerate more quickly for every unit of dynamic pressure produced. This allows aerocapture to occur higher in the atmosphere and with less aerodynamic heating.\u003Cp\u003E The vehicle I used in my tests had a mass at atmospheric entry of only 2915 kg and was equipped with a 2.5 m heat shield. This means its mass was less than 600 kg per square meter of ablator surface. I don\u0027t think that anything much higher than this would have a very good chance of survival. My velocity at atmospheric entry (200 km altitude) was 9783 m/s, which is about typical for a Kerbin-to-Jool transfer. For this vehicle and conditions, I found that the ideal periapsis was about 196,200 m \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1200 m. On one attempt I came in with a periapsus a little below 196,000 m and just barely made it, having burned off all but 3 kg of my ablator (a few meters lower and I probably would have been destroyed). On another attempt I came in with a periapsis just a little below 196,500 m and failed to aerocapture (I actually got my eccentricity below 1 but was still on an escape trajcetory due to the patched conics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Although, in this example, a periapsis altitude \u0026gt;196.5 km would not result in an aerocapture, the vehicle would be significantly slowed down to the point that just a small burn would be necessary to finish off the capture. This might be a good strategy to use - a combination of aerobraking and propulsive braking. Obviously the higher the periapsis altitude, the less the heating and the greater your chance of survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve proven that small probes can survive a Jool aerocapture with proper design and targeting. Unfortunately, I think that large massive vehicles are a greater challenge. The need for a low ballistic coefficient means that a large craft would have to be equipped with an unwieldy number of heat shields. For Jool aerocapture you want to use a \u0022pancake\u0022 design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESave yourself a lot of quickloading and forget jool aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible.

Using Laythe to aerobrake will get you into a Jool orbit, but you\u0027ll then have to perform a series of burns to get the Bop. Bop\u0027s orbit is also 15 degrees out of plane with Laythe, so that doesn\u0027t help.

The method I used was chosen because I thought it was easiest, not necessarily the most efficient.

From there I would drop my periapsis at the appropriate time to approximately match Bop\u0027s orbit. I would then just wait for an opportunity to create an intercept, much as I would if I were rendezvousing with another ship.
