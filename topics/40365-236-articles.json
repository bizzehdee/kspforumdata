So the ship is at 13kW of 1.2MW but the reactor core is at 113 Watts??? Nothing makes any sense!!!! then the reactor also says it\u0027s producing 450kW of thermal energy. Great yet another Power number that I cannot correlate with any of the other numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to go take a shower because this is really pissing me off. I keep spending hours putting things in orbit and fiddling with phasing only to have them shut down because I cannot figure out the right amount of radiators to put on them. I mean JESUS what do I have to do put 16 maxi huge gigantor radiators on a 0.625 reactor to be sure I have sufficient cooling!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe waste heat can be a frustrating if you don\u0027t understand whats going on ... and I don\u0027t pretend to fully understand it either. After you warp your craft for awhile does the waste heat bar stabilize ... or does it fill up and shut down your reactor? The reason I ask is because like in real life radiators dissipate more heat the hotter they get (the more full the bar). This is non-linear and a bit difficult to wrap your head around. It is impossible to have a waste heat of zero so don\u0027t try. So long as waste heat eventually stabilizes somewhere on the lower quarter or so of the bar you should be OK. Since your craft doesn\u0027t need that much power you could probably get away with much higher wasteheat (75%-ish) since efficiency (more about that later) shouldn\u0027t be an issue. Also, I believe I read many pages ago that Fractal is working on some kind of Thermal sizing / management thing for designing this stuff in the VAB which should help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow about the reactor efficiency according to the Wiki the non-upgraded 62.5cm reactor produces 1.5 MW of thermal power. The non-upgrade generator has a best case efficiency of 31% (leaving you with 465kW of power). However, this number is further reduced by the ratio of hot to cold bath temps for the generator. The hot bath is the reactor\u0027s temperature and the cold bath is the radiator\u0027s temp. The efficiency equation is this (1-Tc/Th) ... so say your reactor temp divided by the radiator temp is 0.5 then you will lose 50% of that 465kW and only output 232.5kW from the generator. Similarly if the ratio is really high like 0.9 (lots of waste heat) then you would only have 46.5kW output from the generator. The mystery part of this to me is how the waste heat bar relates to temperature ... so I generally don\u0027t think about it. I just try to keep it less than ~25% full (unless doing some short term high power draw stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T16:30:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AeroEngy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T16:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing a 1.5MW nuclear reactor to power a 1.5KW sensor seems like overkill when you could do that with two small solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, trying to cool even a 62.5cm nuclear reactor with radial radiators is ineffective, for reference, it looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0hm9Hi1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220hm9Hi1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you can just do this (notice the massively higher efficiency in this second case due to the lower radiator resting temperatures):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X79BCpN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X79BCpN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T16:40:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
