According to the wiki, these points have no drag but using the debugging menu tells a different story. The drag from the radial attachments and the fuselage is quite significant, but still comparable to what it was before. However, my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is not an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E anymore. It fails to ever generate enough thrust to get past mach 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s going on? This is very confusing. This doesn\u0027t seem to be purely drag related. Is it possible that one of my engines is getting clipped and not contributing the thrust that it says it is? Wouldn\u0027t it be heating up the surrounding engines in that case?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up using a smaller engine plate and displacing the engines, which is lighter than before and less drag, I think (I\u0027m eyeballing it, so I\u0027m not able to tell the difference when it\u0027s marginal). But this is still weird, and I\u0027d like to know why I can\u0027t use the radial attachments instead of an engine plate (I have no need for the decoupler or the extra mass!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore anybody flags it up: the Mk3 engine mount is useless here because it doesn\u0027t let me change the number of engines. I can put it between the fuselage and engine plate, to get less drag, but the extra mass cost is crazy. Would be better spending that mass budget on another engine!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-02T14:31:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2022 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by fommil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt_Duckweed","CreatedById":201466,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T18:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo see the exact amount of drag each part is producing, and the total drag the crat is producing overall, you can enable a couple of options in the debug menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlt-F12 -\u0026gt; Physics -\u0026gt; Aero -\u0026gt; Check \u0022Show Aero GUI\u0022 and \u0022Aero Debug Data in Part Action Menus\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag in KSP is calculated based on the surface area and shape of parts.... kind of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you node attach parts, the game reduces the surface area of the face the node matches with but the surface area of the corresponding face of the attached part (so node attaching a 1.25m fuel tank on the front of a 2.5m tank reduces the front face area of the 2.5m tanks by 25%, and completely eliminates the rear face area of the 1.25m tank)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a part isn\u0027t node attached it is considered fully exposed to the airstream, unless it is in a fairing/bay.\u00A0 This is what is happening with the radial attachment points.\u00A0 This means they are creating a lot more drag than the engine plate would (since the engine plate is using node attachment)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor more info on how the drag calcs work, check out this video:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kU4-5F0FkQs?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Kerbal University: The Drag Cube\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T19:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to gameplay questions\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fommil","CreatedById":112495,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T20:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194412\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667414138\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201466\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lt_Duckweed\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Lt_Duckweed said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo see the exact amount of drag each part is producing, and the total drag the crat is producing overall, you can enable a couple of options in the debug menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, I\u0027m using that.
