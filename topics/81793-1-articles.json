The winner or winners of Commercial Crew will be announced before the end of this month, a whole month before the next NASA budget automatically kicks in (in the form of a continuing resolution) unless an actual budget is passed (which is looking unlikely). A continuing resolution would fund Commercial Crew at identical levels to last year and would fund at least 1,5 winners. With this in mind I don\u0027t understand how you can come to the conclusion that unless Boeing gets picked, NASA isn\u0027t getting any money for commercial crew, or that if Boeing doesn\u0027t get picked, Congress will cut funding. Furthermore, only the NASA Administrator and Deputy Administrator have to \u0022please\u0022 Congress, not some mid-level civil servants picked for a committee. Congress does not influence decisions at this low level of procurement. Besides, the funding Boeing would get from winning Commercial Crew might as well be an accounting rounding error, given their vast aerospace and defence contracts. Let\u0027s not forget the 3 billion dollars or so they receive every year for work on SLS and Orion. Congress is a lot more interested in defending that pork (hence \u0022Senate Launch System\u0022) and ULA\u0027s EELV monopoly.
