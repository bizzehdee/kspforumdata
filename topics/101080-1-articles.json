The first one I made worked fine, then I made a slight change and then it started doing this. Since then, every craft i build does this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat usually happens is I\u0027ll start a flight, go VTOL, take off, and start ascending. It doesnt always happen immediately, but then it\u0027ll randomly freak out. My latest craft would wig out so bad a part would shoot off dozens of KM away causing the craft to spin wildly out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it might have to do with parts that I take off, and replace (perhaps to move or adjust them), but it\u0027s like theyre no longer attached to my ship. Sometimes it\u0027ll happen right off the bat, I\u0027ve seen modules fall 90 degree from their attachment and just flop around. Shoring up part\u0027s like these does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the latest ship, I noticed that whatever flew off was still attached to the struts. This is becoming incredibly infuriating since I spent 3-4 hours crafting these ships, and when I went to test them something would just flop around like the part had zero rigidity at all. Almost like it\u0027s not even really attached. (I\u0027ve seen part\u0027s just literally fall off immediately, perhaps held on by a strut) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best I can describe this phenomena is that it\u0027s like the part\u0027s are just storing up and gathering energy, then suddenly releasing it all at once causing it to discombobulate with out actually breaking (for some reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the best i could capture it. The craft isnt broken, but all the part\u0027s will fling out like this then go back together (with this one anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0NwddmY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220NwddmY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T07:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The DigitalAlchemist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The DigitalAlchemist","CreatedById":133218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T23:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeyZR3Y2iTA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis is becoming SUCH an issue, I went ahead and captured a video of it. Imagine this happening every 30 seconds, whenever your trying to maneuver, whenever your aligning to a node in space, whenever your trying to go for a sensitive landing. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis appears to happen when I turn. I think it\u0027s just suddenly \u0022jolting\u0022 the ship back to what ever it\u0027s original orientation is. Like the physics didnt turn with it and suddenly they catch up and go \u0022oh no, that was supposed to be here\u0022 and yanks it instantly back into position causing the vessel to get thrown back in that direction.
