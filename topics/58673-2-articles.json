In the case of multiple mods adding the same resource you could solve the multiple additions of the same resource by using a mod-specific name for the resource in its \u0022deposit\u0022 form and a universal name is it\u0027s \u0022mined\u0022 form. For example; mod A adds X amount of \u0022Ferrous Ore\u0022 which when excavated yields \u0022Ore\u0022 as a resource. Mod B adds X amount of \u0022Mun Ore\u0022 which also yields \u0022Ore\u0022 when excavated. In this way, both resources get added to the map, but only the parts of Mod A will be able to mine \u0022Ferrous Ore\u0022 and conversely, mod B can mine \u0022Mun Ore\u0022, thus preventing the concentration from exceeding 100%. Now anyone could exploit that by simply transferring either example into eachother\u0027s parts, but that\u0027s a bit harder to solve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for atmospheric/oceanic resources, you could just use an averaging mechanic? Mod A adds 10% Nitrogen to a planet\u0027s atmosphere, and mod B adds 20% nitrogen, so in game effect is 15% nitrogen in that atmosphere? Just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource definitions aside, I\u0027m really excited for this because with this system, a temporary fix for Kethane/EL can be easily devised for use on my KMP server. At present, since the Kethane and EL Ore are spawned randomly whenever you start a new game and stored in the persistent.sfs file, and KMP generates a NEW persistent.sfs everytime it synchronizes, kethane and ore deposits change constantly, making a kethane/ore base impossible as your deposits will literally disappear right out from under you. With this you could simply add Kethane and Ore to the resource spawner and have their spawns based on a static map which could be distributed to all the players. Exploitable, yes, but it will work for private servers like mine, since I know the people I play with won\u0027t cheat (they even hate using spawn commands in Minecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreadp1r4te","CreatedById":98426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T21:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ratzap\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ratzap\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne question that comes to mind: can a minimum threshold for something be set?

I like the kethane grid. I currently use a modded source with both kethane and the fnplugin working in the same namespace. Use the kethane stuff for planetary extraction and fn plugin for the rest. Would it be interesting to create some unified resource scan overlay and gui with planetary resources showing up in a kethane-like grid on the map view only and oceanic/atmospheric/magnethospheric resource scan results integrated into the gui somehow?(maybe also with a togglable highlighting overlay on the oceans, atmosphere/magnetosphere edge, perhaps with fading).

Right now one needs to define a ATMOSPHERIC_RESOURCE_DEFINITION for each gas in an atmosphere. It would be nicer if we could define things per celestial body, with biome modifiers.
