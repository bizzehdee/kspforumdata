Laaaaaag. I understand a lot of parts will eventually cause lag, but I\u0027ve barely started the station. The lag became noticeable when I added the battery banks.

Yes, the part count on the battery pack is what is getting you, more so than any calculations. As far as your first issue, just rotate it correctly before docking. There is no requirement for the ports themselves to be oriented any particular way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T23:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it not have certain angles it can dock at?

This means if you approach two of them, they will connect in whatever orientation they are. To correct your orientation, the only thing you can do is undock, go back a bit, rotate and then try to redock in the right orientation. Alternatively you can use a combination of tricouplers and regular dockingports but it\u0027s a bit harder because they don\u0027t always all connect and it adds to your part count. You could also use Hydrotech RCS, it adds docking cameras and targets so you can lock your craft in the correct and for docking. An extremely useful mod and in my opinion better than Lazor\u0027s docking cams for what is of the cameras. Up to you if you wanna check it out. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24678\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the second: It really is part count. By a quick judging, you have at least 200 parts there if not more, and depending on your computer, this can start to cause a bit of lag. Especially if you\u0027re looking at Kerbin at the same time. The only thing you can do is reduce the part count, the batteries don\u0027T change anything to lag. Although you\u0027Re going a bit overkill on the batteries so you might want to reduce that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T23:49:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T01:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for alignment, there nothing you can do except undock, back off, and dock again, hoping for a better alignment.

I assume there\u0027s some kind of distance and/or time limit after undocking before you can redock? I think that\u0027s what happened the first time to make me think there were docking angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I rebuilt, focusing on minimum number of parts. The RCS and fuel tanks no longer have RCS ports (sucks for docking). Battery banks are gone, hate to do it but I threw a generator in each solar array. Removed a couple parts from the utility vehicle as well and I\u0027ll only keep one or two up there. I\u0027ll also probably do only 1 lander and 1 interplanetary transport and no probes, which can be sent up when they\u0027re needed for a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: the amount of RCS is because the main purpose will be a refueling station, though that\u0027s two modules and I can probably take one off. Then again that\u0027s only 6 parts. The other three ports there will have orange fuel tanks as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XLxrPG3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XLxrPG3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
