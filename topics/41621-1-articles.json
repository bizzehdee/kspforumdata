As is, you can create orbits within the atmosphere as long as you stay above the cutoff point, by removing that, you\u0027re changing that limit to staying above the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boomerdog2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boomerdog2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you mean debris that reenters the atmosphere gets destroyed so we wouldn\u0027t be able to salvage it?

Outside that bubble, the craft/debris goes on rails, which doesn\u0027t simulate aerodynamic drag, so the craft/debris impacts the ground and is destroyed. At one point I was using Romfairers plugin to increase the size of the bubble to almost 100km which let me get closer to making it work, but there were still issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T16:24:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firenexus13","CreatedById":67143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T16:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei mean stuff like whole ships that can survive a water crash, or decoupled parts of ships within 2.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T22:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand.
