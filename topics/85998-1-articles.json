It\u0027s possible he might rip the ship apart coming out (seriously). Sometimes just leaving the ship, going to the space center / tracking center / back to the ship will get him out, too. But in either case, it\u0027s quite possible the Kerbal is already dead (counted as debris instead of an EVA), in which case nothing you do will matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther options include standing the ship on its nose and letting gravity pull him out the way he went in. But if you can do this, it means the Kerbal wasn\u0027t your only way to control the ship. Either you\u0027ve got another Kerbal aboard or a probe core. So if you\u0027ve got that, you can just fly home with the Kerbal still stuck in place. Or, if you can decouple the part the Kerbal is wedged behind, that should do the trick, too. Maybe you\u0027ll have to send a rescue mission then, but it should work. If you can\u0027t decouple the wedging part, you can shoot it off with Whack-a-Kerbal, again probably requiring a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorst case, the Kerbal is already dead anyway, in which case no need to worry about him. If he\u0027s not dead, you can\u0027t decouple the part, have no other means to control the ship, and don\u0027t want to use Whack-a-Kerbal, you can always send another ship, have the Kerbal from that ship fly the 1st ship home, and save the trapped Kerbal that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T20:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to destroy the ship but are looking for \u0022cheats,\u0022 you can edit your save file.

Search for your kerbal\u0027s name, then scroll down a little where it says \u0022LAT\u0022 or \u0022LON\u0022. Pick one of those numbers and add 0.001 to it\u0027s value (in other words, increase the lat or lon slighly).
