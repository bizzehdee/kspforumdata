It\u0027s more of an idea at this point than anything else, but it seems to have some potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Data alone isn\u0027t really worth that much until you actually do experimentation on it. Samples and reports are really only useful as a starting point in the real world; they need to be analyzed and have a battery of tests run on them. This is where the idea of intangible vs. tangible science comes in. Intangible science is information that would not, strictly speaking, gain any benefit from labwork and could pretty much be analyzed as-is in data form: things like reports, instrumentation readings, and so forth. This data should be transmittable freely back to R\u0026amp;D without any penalty (or returned as well; either way should always get you full returns on the intangible aspect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Tangible science, on the other hand, is the stuff of laboratories: experimentation on surface and atmospheric samples, detailed observation of materials studies, that sort of thing. This is the sort of science that should NOT be transmittable as data at all, and which should instead have to be either returned to R\u0026amp;D back on Kerbin, or run through a battery of tests while in space via a mobile space lab. Should the latter be done, each experiment type you run on the tangible science should be converted into a transmittable result. The catch? Each tangible item would have a large number of possible tests to be run on it, and each time one is run from a space-based laboratory, the current sample is used up. Returned samples to Kerbin would get the full battery of tests run on them without the need to go grab more, as an added incentive to get it home instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This system would have a number of interesting effects. For one thing, it would make science an ever-evolving thing: early on, science would be all but exclusively about returning data to Kerbin. Mid-game, it would be about balancing out transmitted data from probes with the manned missions for samples. And end-game, much of your science would be performed off-Kerbin in orbital and surface laboratories. For another, it could be used to almost completely eliminate the grind factor: each experiment is run once for its science per situation, with no need or benefit to running repeat experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To make things even more interesting, science experiments could yield different results as well from returned tangible science, tangibles experimented on in orbit, and tangibles experimented on from the surface of a body besides Kerbin. This would split up the science rewards into three different categories, with each one presenting the player with new opportunities to find use for old science experiments they\u0027ve run before. It would also dramatically up the amount of science experiment flavor text, which could only be a plus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dun Kirk","CreatedById":11365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T15:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if we wish to transmit surface samples, then they should add a part you have to research which does the analysis, or add it as a feature to say the lander can and tri can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said they indent to add IVA? so wether you get to spash mun rocks yourself I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Brain","CreatedById":33487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T20:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent suggestion, I hope they will add this or something similar! It has bothered me how a sensor scan result could not be transmitted without data loss. I think the analyzing results should differ based on where you perform it, for example analyzing in orbit might give you more science, but in high orbit or dusty places the radiation or dust might severely reduce the effectivity of the analyzing equipment, which would mean you would need to perform the experiments several times to make sure the instruments would have functioned correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELive long and prosper!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T20:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a few suggestions along these lines, all explained a bit differently, but they all seem like really good ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing they all have in common is that people keep suggesting some variant of the idea of splitting up science into two different kinds - one kind that transmits well, and one kind that doesn\u0027t transmit well. Regardless of the exact means of doing it, this would mean there\u0027s a reason to return things to Kerbin when right now, there just isn\u0027t. The only thing you lose from transmitting right now is patience as you spam the transmission over and over to get a value that approaches the asymptote of the same value as a return mission would give.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the logical way to do it is to distinguish how much of the science value is \u0022data only\u0022 and how much is \u0022physical\u0022. (And some experiments might not be 100% one way or the other - some might be, say, 25% data and 75% physical.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe value that is data-only should be worth exactly the same regardless of whether it\u0027s transmitted or returned (no spamming anymore).
