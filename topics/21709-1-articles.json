There are a lot of ways to build successful ships. I suggest you look around the Spaceship Exchange section for ideas.

It really helps to work out how to build and pilot a rocket successfully and you can also pick up tips and tricks like timing your injection burn to the Mun to coincide with it rising over the horizon of Kerbin. You also realise that bigger is not always better unless it is required. Some good channels are Pleborian and Scott Manly.
