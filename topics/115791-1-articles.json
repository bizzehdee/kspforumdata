The FC Array was only producing 9e/s and not the expected 18e/s. \n\nI made a simple test assembly with just a fuel cell array, LfOx tank, grav meter/antenna (to drain charge) and discharged battery, then fired up the fuel cell array, but it ran as expected at 18e/s. When I added an engine to the assembly the output dropped. \n\nMore engines dropped the output further. I tried the Rhino, Mainsail, Reliant. All dropped power generation output. \n\nI tried solar as well. The gigantor lost power output with engines added to assembly, but worked just fine when the engines were removed. \n\nWeird. I have a modded 1.04 game, KER, Trajectories, KAC, life support, etc, but nothing that changes the engines from stock configuration. \n\nTonight I will remove the mods and see if I still get the same bug but first I wanted to check if anyone has heard of such an anomaly to save me some time. I have searched around but no luck finding an answer. \n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T16:12:32Z","Content":"I will have to run a couple of tests to be sure but this sounds very much like another issue caused by bugs and inefficiencies in the Part.RequestResource function (e.g. [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97565), [this](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5132), [this](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/5136) etc.)."}]}
