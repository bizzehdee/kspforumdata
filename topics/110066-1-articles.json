If not, is there an updated batch floating around?\n\n2) In reference to this post: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread!?p=1099022\u0026viewfull=1#post1099022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread!?p=1099022\u0026viewfull=1#post1099022)\n\n    LD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command%_64\n\nIs this accomplishing the same thing as #1? If so, should I use #1, #2, or both? Just a bit confused on what the ideal start up solution is.\n\n3) Currently, I have a file in my Kerbal Space Program directory called \u0027KSP.SH\u0027. It has the text contents of #1 and I use it to launch the program and play. \n\nBecause it is inconvenient to go to the folder to launch that file every time I want to play, I tried making a shortcut but it does not work. I right clicked, and went to \u0027Make Link\u0027 and drug the resulting file to the desktop, but only the \u0027KSP.SH\u0027 in the actual program directory will properly boot up; the \u0027link\u0027 does absolutely nothing.\n\nI really appreciate any information anybody is able to provide. I would be lost without these forums!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T04:32:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T04:58:48Z","Content":"1)\n\nEnvironment variables:\n\nLC\\_ALL=C - needed for certain (non-english) system locales to avoid various \u0027numerical issues\u0027, mostly related to the use of \u0027,\u0027 rather than \u0027.\u0027 as a decimal separator.\n\nLD\\_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 - preloads libpthread \u0026 libGL, preempting the dynamic linker.
