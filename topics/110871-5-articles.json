It\u0027s significantly higher than rocket parts (including mk1 LF tank), cockpits and sensitive equipment, but it\u0027s probably not gonna pull its weight on a rocket as a radiator, and the thermodynamics benefit is marginal on a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it into numbers, given a constant conductive energy flux into the part and the formula above, a precooler emits heat as if its temperature is (0.8/0.95)^(1/4)=~4.4% higher than an engine of the same temperature. Compared to the usual part threshold of 2000, that\u0027s 1915, which is almost completely red on the temperature gauge. The actual benefit will be even smaller due to the fact that conduction is not immediate and it will be at a lower temperature than the heating part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally have exactly one plane which stabilizes in terms of temperature at above 1900 and it\u0027s engineered and flown to do specifically that, and scenarios where a part goes above 1900 but survives are rare in my life.

Also, for short term heating, a part with a high thermal mass (for example a full fuel tank) will probably absorb more heat which you can dissipate later than the precooler will radiate away due to the higher emissivity, though I don\u0027t have the numbers to back that up, just my intuition. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Your mileage may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T11:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe OLD story, lack of parts in stock KSP. If you build a very small, minimalistic plane, you dont have pure liquid fuel tanks. The standard fuselage tank holds 150 units, way too much. Using a FLT100 without oxi is inefficient. A nacelle now gives intake air and holds 40 units of liquid fuel for a weight that is just within acceptable limits... guess that is its use.

Yesterday I cracked the single engine RAPIER SSTO! And now I have a nice point of comparison, on the low TWR end of the table, and built by me so I know it inside and out. Turns out, the key was intake drag, I used a couple precoolers \u0022in-line-but-looking-side-to-side\u0022 (attached through nodes so they wouldn\u0027t create drag, but offset heavily, basically) and went trough the Mach barrier without issues on a 15mT design. Subsequently, that meant a rocket takeover at about 1,300m/s and \u0026gt;500m/s on orbit, on a similar design as the ~18mT one that is here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve learned? All in all, the RAPIER gets the higher payload fraction (same payload, 3mT lighter on the runway). BUT. The turbojet\u002BLV-909 design gets the higher vacuum delta-v! The higher isp of the dedicated vacuum engines and the higher transonic thrust of the turbojet more than make up for the increase in powerplant weight, so you might get a fatter SSTO, but it will be a longer-ranged one, especially if you are planning a mission profile with refueling in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I have a design rule: if it is meant to go to LKO, and no further, then RAPIERs are the way to go, with Turbojets added to save big designs that are just a tiny bit starved for thrust. However, for long-range stuff that isn\u0027t transported by other stuff (high kerbin orbits, Mun/Minmus flybys), then the turbojets will probably get a higher range when paired with the right in-space powerplant. And, you know, the all-liquid SSTO. I have one of those, obviously, but I still think I have a long way to go before I max out dV. I suspect a RAPIER hybrid design will get better results there on account of the nuke\u0027s low thrust (actually, I know, because people have posted such things).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
