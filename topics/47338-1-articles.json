ESPECIALLY wing parts. Making big delta wings out of the smaller wings makes the ship wobbly, unstable, and just plain ugly. RCS ports are great for maneuvering larger spacecrafts, but when you get to REALLY big spacecrafts, we\u0027re going to need some really heavy-duty RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T02:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely. such a pain in the ass to put so many struts in every wing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T03:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou just pointed out why things are large enough...
