This is particularly problematic around bodies like Jool where sunlight is weak). Alternately, you can imagine the single dish relay rotating to re transmit signals back and forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure why the connection strength would be off for the second relay. My best guess is that you have plasma interference turned on and the communication path was through the atmosphere of Kerbin for the second relay (I think that would do it. A lot of my probes loose connection at high altitude during launch briefly until I extend a longer range antenna and I think it\u0027s due to plasma interference in the atmosphere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GKSP","CreatedById":160883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T19:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to put both antennas in almost the same orbit, so none of them are inside the atmosphere.\u00A0 On another pass, I had little connection to both relays but full connection to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027ll just overlook this problem as my relays are outdated anyway.\u00A0 Actually I might not want to overlook this; I plan to utilize a science station orbiting the Mun and that has a spotty signal.\u00A0 Depending on how long the science processing from the Mun landing I\u0027m doing soon will take, I\u0027ll just launch some new relays.\u00A0 This will be using two eccentric polar orbiting sats, like in a guide I\u0027ve seen, but my extra ground stations aren\u0027t working(and I\u0027ve made sure its enabled) so I\u0027m also going to include three circular equatorial sats.\u00A0 Think this\u0027ll work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T22:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis guide\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0expliain commnet in detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSignal strengh is \u00A0related only to max range ane actual distance between the crafts.
