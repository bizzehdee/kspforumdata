To use more analogies, the UR-700 and its spacecraft were \u0022total paper rockets\u0022, while *Starship in general* is not a paper rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that said, I (now) think it could be said that both \u0022Operational SLS\u0022 and \u0022Operational Starship (Cargo Starship)\u0022 are both paper rockets. No Cargo Starships have been built, neither has an operational (capable of fulfilling its intended mission of taking humans to the vicinity of the Moon) SLS-Orion been fully fabricated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say this not to say that Starship can\u0027t be used for further roles in Artemis or whatever or that it \u0022can\u0027t\u0022 replace SLS. I say this as many of the posts I have seen (not necessarily yours or anyone in particular)\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emake it sound\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0or \u003Cem\u003Eseem to imply\u003C/em\u003E as though Starship will be fully operational after the static fire, when it is not. Regardless of the state of SLS (which I now recognize as being as on the verge of simply being equal in development to Starship, not ahead), \u0022Operational Starship\u0022 is still paper. Again, that is not to say that \u0022Operational SLS\u0022 is here or will be ahead of \u0022Operational Starship\u0022. It is just that \u0022Operational Starship\u0022 is not \u0022more ready\u0022 than \u0022Operational SLS\u0022 right now, which is what some posts I have seen appear to imply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it is important to make this clear, as such posts that appear to\u00A0imply Starship being operational are what attract silly and desperate defences of SLS- and absurd and nonsensical attacks on Starship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to clarify my definition of \u0022paper rocket\u0022. Once a rocket has been fully fabricated- not even necessarily tested- I think only then it is no longer paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this based on the definition used for\u00A0other \u0022paper projects\u0022. A couple of examples are the German E-100 super heavy tank and the Sovetsky Soyuz class battleships. These had some components manufactured- multiple ships of the Sovetsky Soyuz class started construction and the hull of the prototype E-100 was partially completed- however these projects were never completed fully. The E-100 never had its turret installed, while the Sovetsky Soyuz class were cancelled well before they were functioning ships. These vehicles are considered to be paper projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use an example for spaceflight, if SN20 had only had its nosecone built before some event forced the halt of Starship development, I would consider SN20 to be a paper rocket. However it has now been more or less fully assembled, and thus is no longer paper. Even without all of the\u00A0tiles it could still fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitions may of course differ, I share my definition simply to inform you of it, not to change your opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven without using my definition, I think the logic of my opinion on \u0022Operational SLS\u0022 and \u0022Operational Starship\u0022 being equally unready, and the need to take care in not accidently implying otherwise,\u00A0still stands. However, that is not to say you must adopt my opinion or anything.

If you are comparing the US and Soviet space programs of the 80s and 90s, no one is going to say the Soviets built five Buran orbiters while the Americans built five Space Shuttle Orbiters and thus imply the production was somehow equal. One Buran orbiter was built, and construction began on four more but they were never completed. On the other hand, you can casually look at Starship production and say they have \u0022built\u0022 SN8, SN9, SN10, SN11, SN15, SN16, and even SN17 as some parts were fabricated despite it not being fully assembled (completed). That sentence makes sense (at least to me).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to clarify when I say \u0022paper rocket\u0022- and likewise probably when others use it to- I (and perhaps\u00A0we) do not mean it literally. I didn\u0027t realize it until now, but \u0022paper (insert vehicle type)\u0022 seems to be somewhat of a slang term for any \u003Cem\u003Enon-completed\u003C/em\u003E project. An example of this is how the historical war-related video game community frequently refers to the Stalingrad class battlecruisers as \u0022paper ships\u0022 despite them having been laid down before cancellation and thus not literally paper.
