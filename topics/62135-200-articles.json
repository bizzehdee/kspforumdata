Sorry. Perhaps consider it constructive criticism for the design process for the Rover v2.0. Or maybe sometime there could be a retrofit of the current rover frame and wheels to give some of Lo-Fi\u0027s Kerbal Foundries wheel code to these wheels. Just an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, I think the new mod is smashing, really outstanding work as always, Helldiver and all of the KSO team. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chadley123","CreatedById":115223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T00:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have smoke screen installed?

However, there is a bit of overlap between the first three stages for convenience. For instance, the shuttles will both include the round docking ports from phase 2, the S25 includes the oms engines from phase 1, the KSO includes the aux fuel tank and stack shroud from phase 2, etc. Just what makes sense. Now, personally, I don\u0027t think the alt cockpit parts for both shuttles are necessary and instead set it up to be a texture switch patch, so you get the benefit of all the cockpits but just one part. Less part catalog clutter and you don\u0027t have to rebuild your whole fleet craft files. Since a few people seem to be running out of ram I\u0027m also wondering aloud whether alt textures for phase 4 should be optional too. But this is all subject to change until it\u0027s finalized and the more input from what everyone wants gives us a better idea of how to finalize it.

The options list has since been changed to match the OP and has been reorganized. The graphics are different too. The installer will also include an uninstaller for easy upgrading (but is not necessary to use if you don\u0027t want it and can be deleted), but does not modify the registry and does not create an entry in the Add Remove Programs list of windows. Also note, the installer will require to be run as admin if (and only if) you are installing to a location that requires it (such as C:\\Program Files).\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-25T07:19:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2014 07:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qnistNAMEERF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
