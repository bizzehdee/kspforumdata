I\u0027d also love to put in the old-style directional gyro as circled in green, and maybe a tachometer-styled thrust indicator (blue circle)? Just as long as it says RPM x100, it can just show a throttle setting percentage.    I understand you\u0027re probably busy and might not be able to or want to do those instruments, but I figure there\u0027s no harm in asking.

That would allow a great scalability, here is what I mean:  \n\nFlying around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is cool but there are plenty of custom runways that a player can add in his game.  \n\n1. Using the data from cfg\u0027s the charts could be generated procedurally. I doubt that anyone would be patient enough to force all those custom runway creators to draw proper charts and maintain them but having them procedurally generated we could have default charts even for the laziest ones.  \n\n2. Those data could be used by an ATC mod for vectoring, landing etc., thus we\u0027d automatically had both charts and ATC services using the same data, and for every custom runway added.\n\nAre you interested in that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-10T17:21:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2017 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrFancyPL","CreatedById":94843,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-11T10:09:36Z","Content":"Hello, can somone help me ?
