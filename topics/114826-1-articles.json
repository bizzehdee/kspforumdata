Problem occurs when there is leftovers in your gamedata folder from previous install, like custom config files and similar.\n\nCKAN does not delete those files on it\u0027s own and there is where all trouble starts. Because people will assume that CKAN have installed everything properly with all needed dependencies, but unfortunately it is not always true.\n\nBesides file leftovers there was also situation when CKAN bot picked up wrong version info and downloaded wrong version of MFI, as much as I can recall from various posts what was reason for trouble.\n\nIt was not always CKAN fault, some responsibility also have mod developers by puting wrong version info that CAKN bot ckeck.\n\nYou can\u0027t blaim mod developers either because of all that fuss they just does not provide CKAN support at all. For some modders taking care of additional info is too much time consuming and they can use that time for additional coding and their mod development instead.\n\nEDIT:\n\n@Amedee, bug you have reported in FAR thread looks same as I encountered with faulty install of universal storage mod and DMagic orbital science mod.

Some combinations of values have problems (e.g. set a light RGB slider to 0.45, 0.65 or 0.9) that result in the OnEditorShipModified event being fired every frame (or even multiple times per frame).
