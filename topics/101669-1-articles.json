I\u0027ve even installed a few mods too and been playing with them fine. (KAS, Kethane, EPL, KAS, and Kerbal Engineer to be exact) However, I\u0027ve recently tried to install Karbonite, K\u002B, and FTT from USI and I\u0027m having issues getting them to work properly. Only Karbonite will work at all and it\u0027s about half the parts at best. None of the particle collectors, engines, landign pads, etc. only the two drills, skinny tanks and ka-100 detector. All work fine though, at least I think. When installing FTT and K\u002B however, I do not see any of the parts whatsoever. Any help in getting it to work would be appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not too savvy on the versions and what not, but I know I\u0027m playing beta than ever, I think it\u0027s .90. Windows 32-bit version downloaded from the KSP site, not steam. I\u0027m running windows 7 on my machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m reaching out to the KSP community for help in getting more out of this great game. I\u0027m hooked and want to take it a step further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to create a new install of KSP and use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E to install those mods.
