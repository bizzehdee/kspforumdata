It feels plenty roomy. The only down-side is the idiotic visual pre-sets and filters which you can\u0027t really turn off (Sony\u0027s video engineers were smoking some good stuff when they designed the default settings for this thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I would like a multi-monitor setup is under the following conditions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Bring back the more square aspect ratios like 3:4, ultra-letter box is not fun. Even 16:10 is hard to find, these days it\u0027s all 16:9 or wider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Make the screens cheaper. You can find a decent TN screen here and there, but it\u0027s still 230$ x3, so you end up paying near 700$... a LOT more if you want G-sync, 120FPS or IPS displays. And yeah, I said x3 and not just 2 because most games play terribly with just 2 screens, so you need at least 3 (which costs too much, so I stick to 1 screen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Shrink the bezels, otherwise it just feels like you took a big screen and stuck lines of black tape onto it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember having more issues, but I can\u0027t recall them at the moment. But yeah, fix those and I\u0027d be all over multi-monitor gaming.

That was mostly just confusing and caused my computer pain, but I do wish KSP would support dual screen setups. Something like being able to be in flight mode on one screen and have map mode plus any mod window clutter on the second screen.
