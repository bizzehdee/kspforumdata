requires shielding gas, an unless your atmospheric recyclers can handle it, its better to keep it out of that system if at all possible. so just make the atmosphere the shielding gas, and wear an oxygen helmet (welders usually need a hood and respirator anyway so this solves two problems). small assemblies and fasteners would be done in shirt sleeve environments, possibly in the hab ring. you generally start with smaller parts the further out from the center, when you get to the industrial levels you can start handling larger more massive components, when you get to the utterly massive

of stuff from earth that cannot be made in space, but are fairly cheap to launch, like semiconductors. you will also need a lot of storage for consumables. i expect tankage and cargo containers to be

which very well may damage the station on subsequent orbits. you at least ones some heavy duty nets to catch large parts, and perhaps some mylar layers to catch smaller parts. though an unpressurized construction hall with solid walls would be the best option. i like the design of tycho station in the expanse, as it has a big hanger for storage and construction, and a separate grav section (i dont think the show got the design completely down as described in the books as the station has thrust and the hab modules are supposed to rotate for thrust gravity). babylon 5 also had a fairly good design having a separate zero g part of the station. i dont think either example had dedicated shipyard facilities. i figure a large platform with a pair of oneil cylenders would work out best for a purely industrial operation. a ring station would be better if you are also doing agriculture as you could have a transparent roof and reflectors with an offset industrial ring. the former would have better capacity for industrial operations, and the latter for an overall multipurpose self sufficient space city. or maybe some hybrid of the two. im thinking it would be a very large station. i also wouldn\u0027t be totally opposed to surface facilities on a low gravity world for the big stuff. this would come with launch costs (significantly smaller than earth), but you dont have to worry about

your station with an industrial ring inside a habitation ring. you certainly wouldn\u0027t want a zero g machine shop, its probibly not safe to operate a lathe in zero gravity.\u00A0 large unpressurized bays (meant more to contain wayard parts than anything else) would be a good place for the final assembly of smaller ships and modules for larger ships. larger ships would probibly be handled in external construction frames, where you are mostly assembling the ship from modular sections that simply bolt together.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nareas meant for welding could be unpressurized or use a noble gas atmosphere. many welding techniques requires shielding gas, an unless your atmospheric recyclers can handle it, its better to keep it out of that system if at all possible. so just make the atmosphere the shielding gas, and wear an oxygen helmet (welders usually need a hood and respirator anyway so this solves two problems). small assemblies and fasteners would be done in shirt sleeve environments, possibly in the hab ring. you generally start with smaller parts the further out from the center, when you get to the industrial levels you can start handling larger more massive components, when you get to the utterly massive parts, you are either in the hub or zero g sections of the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso you will probibly want a separate freight dock connected to the intrastation transport network. if you are refining and forging your own metal stock, its going to be getting a lot of traffic you really dont want interfering with construction operations. you will also be receiving a lot of stuff from earth that cannot be made in space, but are fairly cheap to launch, like semiconductors. you will also need a lot of storage for consumables. i expect tankage and cargo containers to be bolted to every possible surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin star trek its usually just some mooring frame which i think is a terrible way to build a space craft. you end up losing parts which very well may damage the station on subsequent orbits. you at least ones some heavy duty nets to catch large parts, and perhaps some mylar layers to catch smaller parts. though an unpressurized construction hall with solid walls would be the best option. i like the design of tycho station in the expanse, as it has a big hanger for storage and construction, and a separate grav section (i dont think the show got the design completely down as described in the books as the station has thrust and the hab modules are supposed to rotate for thrust gravity). babylon 5 also had a fairly good design having a separate zero g part of the station. i dont think either example had dedicated shipyard facilities. i figure a large platform with a pair of oneil cylenders would work out best for a purely industrial operation. a ring station would be better if you are also doing agriculture as you could have a transparent roof and reflectors with an offset industrial ring. the former would have better capacity for industrial operations, and the latter for an overall multipurpose self sufficient space city. or maybe some hybrid of the two. im thinking it would be a very large station. i also wouldn\u0027t be totally opposed to surface facilities on a low gravity world for the big stuff. this would come with launch costs (significantly smaller than earth), but you dont have to worry about wayward components.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood ideas.
