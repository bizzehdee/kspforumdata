It\u0027s like a high pitched noise that you don\u0027t notice unless you\u0027re close to the laptop. I was thinking it was the fan, but i want to make sure of it before buying any parts. The laptop\u0027s an Asus x52f-x2. I haven\u0027t upgraded anything yet. I\u0027m still waiting on a replacement GPU and more RAM to arrive. Might get an i5 for it to but, that\u0027ll wait a month or two. Anyways is it the fan or something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TelluriumCrystal","CreatedById":25647,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T03:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the fan, can\u0027t really think of anything else if you\u0027re sure it isn\u0027t the speakers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no experience with said laptop, though, so I\u0027d ask someone who knows what they\u0027re talking about before reaching a final decision...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
