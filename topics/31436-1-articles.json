I design them the way I want them. I add fuel tank and some boosters on the side in prep of landing on the mun. When I test to see if all is well I take off and it always takes off in one direction. It never takes off straight. Most of the time it will flip on launchpad . If I do manage to control it if I turn on SAS and throttle off it spins out of control or sas off and try to control it manually it fails and spins out of control and and cant regain control Below is pics\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t0lQwuR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t0lQwuR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T04:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to keep the center of mass balanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use RCS or capsule torque to compensate some, but probe cores don\u0027t have enough torque to compensate for an imbalanced load on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T04:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry a taller rocket with fins at the bottom.

For added torque, like brofessional said, you have to add a command pod, or in this case just add the SAS module, which I think has 15 torque...something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
