My station in 0.24 was a bit larger still, about 1500 tons, and its lifter was somewhere around 20000 tons (21 5m stacks, a bit larger than yours); unfortunately, 0.25 came out before I could build up enough funds to afford to launch it, but I\u0027ll get to it in a week or two in my new career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is that I didn\u0027t attach the booster stacks to the sides of the station; they were linked to each other, and the station sat on top of the resulting \u0022brick\u0022.

Rather than rebuild each from the ground up, I went through the somewhat drawn out process of swapping the mod parts with the stock ones. Most of my designs were simple enough to update, but a few of my more complex SSTO spaceplanes required a lot of work to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thanks to this work, the \u003Cstrong\u003ESleazy Weasel 7c\u003C/strong\u003E rides again! (That means the fourth iteration of the seventh generation of the design, in case you\u0027re wondering.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pW5juJT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pW5juJT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9YiYFI4.png\u0022 alt=\u00229YiYFI4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QXVHIir.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QXVHIir.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust under 33 tons, costs 282k, capable of flying to Laythe and back without refueling along the way (assuming you don\u0027t mind multi-hour ion engine burns), and built with just about every amenity Jeb could want. Plus, it looks cool. For engines, it has four RAPIERs (two in the back, two in those gaps in the wings), four radial hybrid ion engines (mod part, functionally equivalent to two LV-Ns with slightly better efficiency but consuming xenon and electricity in addition to LFO), and two ion engines in the wing pods. While those screenshots don\u0027t show it too well, the design has 18 small extendable solar panels and six large fixed ones (mod part, each analogous to eight stock fixed panels), giving it more than enough power for the engines. With the number of intakes it has, this plane can get up to ~1600m/s before the intake air runs out, so it\u0027s pretty efficient at getting to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing it doesn\u0027t have at the moment is a cargo bay, because I\u0027ve got smaller spaceplanes to handle that sort of work. It can\u0027t operate in the atmospheres on Duna or Eve, and it doesn\u0027t have enough engine power to handle Tylo, but other than that it can go pretty much anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first test flight, I went to Minmus and back without using ion engines, refueling, aerobraking, slingshotting, or anything else along those lines. It barely had the range, but managed it without any major problems. (It was a test flight, so I ended up with a list of a dozen or so minor things to tweak when I got back.) Given that I\u0027m deploying a network of kethane-based fuel depots, mining rovers, etc. I won\u0027t need much more than that, but as I said the ions give it enough range to get to Laythe and back if need be. (Yes, I\u0027ve tested that, back in 0.23.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-12T11:59:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2014 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T13:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I installed NEAR, the simpler version of FAR, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*suddenly breaks into a truly awesome recorder rectal of the titanic song*\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso,\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7JthgTMHDU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, be cause it was time to get ISP right. \u003Cp\u003EThen it was time for Ssccience! \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThe testing stuff kind, not the watered down careermode kind\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/1sr5kTL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1sr5kTL.png\u0022 alt=\u00221sr5kTL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot to know how engines work now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning.
