And I\u0027ve seen a few thoughts posted on this topic in some form. But I want to offer my ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany have already commented on how science right now is pretty tedious and \u0022grindy.\u0022 Well I think a lot of that stems from experiments having instant completion. Again, I would be floored if Squad wasn\u0027t already thinking about this, but anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there should be three types of experiments: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne type produces ongoing science at a slow rate, with diminishing returns over time. Pop a satellite in orbit around the Mun. Let it start running \u0022scans\u0022 and it slowly returns science. Eventually nothing else can be learned, and that science avenue \u0022dries up.\u0022 It\u0027s basically \u0022mining\u0022 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second type is a one-shot experiment. It returns a sizable amount of science, but takes a while (minutes, hours, days, maybe even weeks or longer) to run. These types of experiments would be valuable for space stations and bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third type are the simple readings from instruments (temperature, pressure, etc) and reports. They are quick, and return an ok amount of science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, here\u0027s my caveat for all of these science gathering mechanisms - the same experiment/reading/report cannot grant science from the same \u0022biome\u0022 more than once on any single mission. So you can only send one EVA report from High Kerbin orbit per mission. Further science requires more missions, not more in and out of the capsule. This should help address the science spam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my $0.02 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T23:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, with some experiments being instant results, and others that take time.
