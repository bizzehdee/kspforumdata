Herbo Kerman here, talking to you over this fancy live-feed camera they sent up on the latest delivery. I\u0027m the Chief Utility Rover Inspector, Operator and Utility Sanitator here at the Munbase. CURIOUS, for short. They put \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cutility\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in there twice just for that reason. Gotta love flight directors! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s that son? Yeah, you could say that I\u0027m a truck driver. But I drive a truck on the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E Mun. It was either that or being a \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E two-bit television host.

She\u0027s got a more boring name on paper. She\u0027s been with the Munbase since the first crew came down and she moved pretty much everything into position that couldn\u0027t move itself. More on that later. We got some new buggies sent down for daily stuff, but there\u0027ll always be someone wanting Betsy\u0027s ample power generators and big, solid wheelbase. Heh. Well, let\u0027s take a look around before I get too carried away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/74iKd6h.png\u0022 alt=\u002274iKd6h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Close-up Habitat Arch Observatory Station, or CHAOS. I swear. They pay people to make this \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E up. It\u0027s got a multispectral thingamabob projector pointed towards the Arch that makes those pictures in funny colors that don\u0027t mean nothing to anyone. The fella inspecting the new buggy over there is Cordorf, and that would be Ribcan smiling at the camera. Hey Rib! Did that rock move yet? Heh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1hhbreG.png\u0022 alt=\u00221hhbreG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe put up these light masts around the Arch so they can see it sitting still even when it\u0027s dark. That was a few hours of my time well spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, time to move back to base and show you the rest. They won\u0027t let us drive under the Arch because the scientists back home think it might be a portal to a different dimension. I kinda hope it is. I hope it has trucks. And blackjack. And \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E. In fact, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E the trucks and the blackjack. Anyway, the recommended speed limit on the Mun is seven meters per second, so I kinda try to keep her under thirty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oNWgNlu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oNWgNlu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWheeeeee!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see you try \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E with a loaded truck on Kerbin! I\u0027m carrying the crew cab behind me which we use to move people around. Now that we got the buggies we won\u0027t be doing much of that anymore I guess. On front is the lifting fork. It slides right under the docking ports underneath each module, and then the little wheels lift it up so the thing docks. We call those ports \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E around here. Heh. Alrighty, it\u0027s not far to the base, just about six clicks as the duck flies. Not that ducks would fly very far on the Mun. Someone tried that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HavTJTD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HavTJTD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHome! These are the hab modules. They house four Kerbonauts each. We got three habs and twelve Kerbonauts manning the base. It works out perfectly. Who would have thunk?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K1HLshm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022K1HLshm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the main Munlab, with the command observatory on top. Malemone is the boss around here. Yo Male! Stop breathing through your mouth, you\u0027re on TV! Heh. The fella coming down the ladder is Gerton. Sorry, \u003Cem\u003Edoctor\u003C/em\u003E Gerton. He\u0027s the finest scientist that\u0027s ever been paid tons to look at a funny rock on the Mun. Here, lemme show you his view. Move it Doc, I\u0027m coming up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmK32Fc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EmK32Fc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that is one fine piece of truck right there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yv9V7ZX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yv9V7ZX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigured you\u0027d like this shot. This is one of the two Mun Buses we got parked at the base right now. They can hold seven guys each but we only use them for six at a time. Makes the math easier I guess. It\u0027s what you come down in and what takes you back up once your rotation is up. Not that that\u0027s ever happened, but it\u0027s the thought that counts. They\u0027re strong enough ships to take you all the way back to the Kerbin Fuel Depot. Now, we should probably take a look at... OH \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E WHAT\u0027S THAT FALLING FROM THE SKY?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S3FciMA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S3FciMA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaha, gotcha! This is a picture I took earlier. That, sir, is the latest and greatest in Mun-roving truckery around. The Mun Mammoth. It\u0027s a mobile lab with all the bells and whistles. See, every time we bring something down here, the Muncrane guys say they see stuff twinkling in a big crater a ways East of here. So we\u0027re going to check it out. And who\u0027s the most experienced driver on the Mun? Yessir. That would be me. Herbo Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yqKoEIA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yqKoEIA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAin\u0027t it something? I heard they had a lot of fun testing this at KSC. They say it runs over everything smaller than it. And most things are smaller than it. Heh. Tends to flip if you brake too hard they say, so I guess I\u0027ll just keep her going!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, enough of that. I\u0027m dying to try out one of these buggies they delivered. It\u0027s hang-on-for-life driving, but they put on some nifty rollbars to keep you in your seat. Seems they\u0027re working on actual chairs with seat belts back home. Will wonders never cease? Let\u0027s get going. Yo, Billy-Bobbro! Wanna take this buggy for a spin? Heh. I swear that\u0027s his real name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wnl4HyA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wnl4HyA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWheeee!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FLYrIbr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FLYrIbr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlrighty folks, this is Herbo \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E[bLEEP]\u003C/span\u003E Kerman signing out from the Munbase!
