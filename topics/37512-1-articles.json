(so climb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo things keep a jet in the air: Lift generated, and thrust/air keeping the engines flowing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I had a 50t jet with 2 turbojets and two regular intakes. This aircraft could operate to approximately 19,500m and could accelerate to Mach 4.1 (KSP does not handle jets well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modified that jet up to 60t, with 4 turbojets, a ram intake, a radial air intake, and I increased the lift by about 20-35%.

One thing the SPH doesn\u0027t show you is \u003Cem\u003Equantity\u003C/em\u003E of lift.
