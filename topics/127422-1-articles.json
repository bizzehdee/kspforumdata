Wings are always deployed, and coming in with a 30 degree AoA with wings is a good way to make sure you have plenty of time to deploy chutes. Airbrakes could probably work too... I\u0027m not sure which is more mass efficient (although winged vehicles as a payload are a pain to launch... airbrakes don\u0027t cause that problem)... they have a low heat tolerance, but that shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue on duna. But even just small canards/small delta wings should be enough to help control reentry trajectory, and to give you a better margin for chute deployment - as I said... that duna lander I posted was over built... part of it was that I just wanted a really wide base so that it wouldn\u0027t tip over. The wings were more mass efficient (and less draggy) than using girder or I-beam segments... once I had my X of wings to put landing struts on for a wide base... it was just 1 more set of wings and some control surfaces to make it a functional glider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also done plenty of duna landers without aerudynamic control surfaces/wings... they aren\u0027t needed, but they can be convenient if their mass penalty isn\u0027t causing you a problem, or messing up the aerodynamics when you try to launch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T20:05:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T21:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222316822\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449772556\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154785\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ehco Corrallo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Ehco Corrallo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, the Mk 1-2 Command Pod \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E awful.

I could use few parachutes because of the brakes\u00A0(I\u0027ll check the mass difference between drogues and airbrakes) and actually slow down while in high atmosphere at high speed. The last few landers I\u0027ve tested weren\u0027t able to slow down soon for parachutes to be 100%\u00A0efficient. If I use airbrakes I can slow down earlier, deploy the drogue earlier, and make the most of the drag. It\u0027s actually a good thing that airbrakes aren\u0027t always on, at least in this case it might be: I can use them to get a better degree of control on entry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho knows, maybe this is just a huge rationalization and I just want to use them.

I\u0027m pretty sure I can use a Service\u00A0Bay and rotate three EAS-1 seats inside of it, and send my crew into space Martian-style. The Service Bay has a nice flat profile, ideal for generating large amounts of drag and landing on hills. My two biggest enemies in landing on Duna have been, incidentally, a lack of drag, and hills.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few observations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs long as you make good use of body lift and don\u0027t set your approach angle too steeply, you should have no problem slowing down to drogue speeds; you really don\u0027t need airbrakes for that.\u00A0 By all means use \u0027em if you want, I just think you don\u0027t need them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAirbrakes are indeed cool, and the fact that you can turn them on/off is a major attraction.\u00A0 I like using them myself, I just don\u0027t use them on Duna because I find that drogues are both necessary and sufficient.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you do use a service bay with command chairs:\u00A0 be very, very careful if you do that.\u00A0 Service bays can behave oddly (e.g. shake your ship to pieces) if anything clips them from the inside.\u00A0 Make sure none of your command chairs (or the kerbals sitting in them) come close to touching any of the interior surfaces of the service bay.\u00A0 Also, I\u0027m not sure how much protection the kerbals will get from overheating-- I think things in a service bay heat up to the same temperature as the bay itself, and spacesuited kerbals have a pretty low temperature tolerance these days.\u00A0 I\u0027m not flat-out saying it won\u0027t work, just be aware that it\u0027s a potential issue, and you may want to try doing a sandbox test run first to make sure they\u0027ll be okay.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna is indeed hilly.\u00A0 I find that it\u0027s not too much of a problem for \u0022traditional\u0022 landers that come down vertically on parachutes-- just make sure the lander is low and squat so it doesn\u0027t tip.\u00A0 Where the Duna hills become a royal pain in the fundament is if you\u0027re trying to land a plane.\u00A0 Finding somewhere flat enough to land is a real chore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ehco Corrallo","CreatedById":154785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T19:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve ran a test with Hyperedit, and the airbrakes worked really well.
