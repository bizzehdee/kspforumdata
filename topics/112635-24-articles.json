Everything in KSP... and I mean EVERYTHING... tries it\u0027s damnedest to fly. The sub I\u0027m working on currently has the ability to load on 140 tons of ballast (yes, tons) and 0.01 tons difference between the front and rear ballast tank is enough to change the keel angle by several degrees. And, the difference between floating, sinking and neutral buoyancy is again... 0.01 tons. The problem is, you\u0027d have to first have to kill the stock float code, then make a perfectly neutral buoyant torpedo, then make a perfectly balanced torpedo and then... keep it from flying out of the water. All the same problems I\u0027m having with the sub but, on a much smaller scale and in a much more immediate time frame. Basically, a torpedo would have to be designed... perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it could be done but I\u0027m just not going to spend that much time creating a weapon to kill a non-existent enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T22:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short Squad never imagined water as being anything other than a big splashy (And highly destructive) landing pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T22:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the question of what they are doing with the water in Unity5 is still unanswered.

B9 was a huge influence in tone and style for many later parts mods and Squad-released parts as well (and the \u0022complex\u0022 overlap between the two ;D) and I\u0027d consider them emulating, rather than outright copying.\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, thank you for your efforts and I\u0027m really looking forward to trying some floating and (purposefully) sinking craft! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Bc, hope you enjoy the sub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI considered that. While it\u0027s true that jet engines have a definitive shape, and that emulation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Mk2 went beyond flattery to damn near copying the exact dimensions. He made them different enough to keep from being accused of stealing them. And yes, B9 was a source of much inspiration. Here\u0027s the problem I have with it. When inspiration leads to copying a work that closely it becomes a copyright violation. And when those who do copy a work that closely and profit from it, it takes on a new shape. I\u0027m not sure what the B9 license is, it may allow such, but to me, that\u0027s no better than those guys who take open source software, slap a new gui on it and sell it as something special. It\u0027s bottom feeding. And looking at how closely his new radial engines match the work of B9, he apparently has no need or desire to change that. Yes, he\u0027s good and he has some unique designs (or I assume they are), but if I wanted B9 parts, I\u0027d install it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before we go this direction, yes, my sub was inspired by a real-life design.
