Everything in KSP... and I mean EVERYTHING... tries it\u0027s damnedest to fly. The sub I\u0027m working on currently has the ability to load on 140 tons of ballast (yes, tons) and 0.01 tons difference between the front and rear ballast tank is enough to change the keel angle by several degrees. And, the difference between floating, sinking and neutral buoyancy is again... 0.01 tons. The problem is, you\u0027d have to first have to kill the stock float code, then make a perfectly neutral buoyant torpedo, then make a perfectly balanced torpedo and then... keep it from flying out of the water. All the same problems I\u0027m having with the sub but, on a much smaller scale and in a much more immediate time frame. Basically, a torpedo would have to be designed... perfectly. \n\nI think it could be done but I\u0027m just not going to spend that much time creating a weapon to kill a non-existent enemy."},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T22:26:30Z","Content":"In short Squad never imagined water as being anything other than a big splashy (And highly destructive) landing pad."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T22:35:41Z","Content":"And the question of what they are doing with the water in Unity5 is still unanswered.

I went through several methods, from using built-in functions to the scary sounding, ray-casting. I decided to test this code at Kerbin\u0027s deepest point.

As with other pre-releases, keep watch on this thread as I\u0027ll release it in a post before I make it public or on the OP.\n\nFind it here: [http://www.kerbaltopia.com](http://www.kerbaltopia.com)\n\nDue to the file size of this new pack, and due to the fact that stock parts and most other Maritime Pack parts will be currently incompatible with sub surface usage, the Submarine Pack will not be integrated with the Maritime Pack. It will remain a separate entity.\n\nAlso, much of the content of the OP has been moved to the website above. Updating the OP in preparation for pack releases and updates was becoming a nightmare. Plus, with the addition of the upcoming Sub Pack, it simply wasn\u0027t big enough to hold all the documentation.\n\nAs of the next release of these packs, the license agreement will be changed on ALL parts and plugins to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License.

While I doubt Squad would ever want to include anything that resembles a boat intentionally and whether Porkjet actually asked permission is irrelevant. I\u0027ll be damned if they\u0027re going to profit off the fact that I\u0027m already creating a mod for them and THEN, turn around and steal my work. If I were bac9 or one of the guys who helps him maintain B9, I\u0027d be livid. The CCA-NC license covers that but still allows anyone who wants, for non-commercial purposes, to freely use what I\u0027ve created.

Squad put out [this link](http://imgur.com/a/NkzMp) to an imgur album of what Porkjet is working on. It might just be me, but there\u0027s too many parts that look like parts that B9 put out years ago. Just look at the Mk2. That was in B9 when I first started playing. Suddenly, it appears in KSP parts, but it doesn\u0027t exactly match the B9 Mk2. Otherwise, it\u0027s almost identical. Now, they\u0027re showing images of his turbofans, which look almost identical to the ones B9 has.

While it\u0027s true that jet engines have a definitive shape, and that emulation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Mk2 went beyond flattery to damn near copying the exact dimensions. He made them different enough to keep from being accused of stealing them. And yes, B9 was a source of much inspiration. Here\u0027s the problem I have with it. When inspiration leads to copying a work that closely it becomes a copyright violation. And when those who do copy a work that closely and profit from it, it takes on a new shape. I\u0027m not sure what the B9 license is, it may allow such, but to me, that\u0027s no better than those guys who take open source software, slap a new gui on it and sell it as something special. It\u0027s bottom feeding. And looking at how closely his new radial engines match the work of B9, he apparently has no need or desire to change that. Yes, he\u0027s good and he has some unique designs (or I assume they are), but if I wanted B9 parts, I\u0027d install it.\n\nAnd before we go this direction, yes, my sub was inspired by a real-life design. However, I seriously doubt anyone will find a way to take mine on a cruise to the Bahamas. Now, should I build a REAL submarine and incorporate a lot of the designs used in the [Migaloo](http://www.migaloo-submarines.com/), then try to sell it... it would be a serious legal matter."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T00:33:56Z","Content":"You can confront PorkJet on it if you\u0027re that upset about it, or at least ask what\u0027s up with the B9-alikes.\n\nActually, Bac9 (is he still around?) and those in the B9 thread should be the ones to confront PorkJet about it, but anyway......\n\nEdit: That submersible yacht looks like something straight out of James Bond....."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T01:26:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can confront PorkJet on it if you\u0027re that upset about it, or at least ask what\u0027s up with the B9-alikes.\n\u003E Actually, Bac9 (is he still around?) and those in the B9 thread should be the ones to confront PorkJet about it, but anyway......\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: That submersible yacht looks like something straight out of James Bond.....\n\nIt\u0027s not that it upsets me, it more disgusts me.
