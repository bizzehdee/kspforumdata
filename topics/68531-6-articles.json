Single row of 6-8 side boosters in single row is fine, especially if they are smaller diameter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you wondered why RL rockets are built and look the way they are?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the people who tell me I BAIU reason, here are the actual reasons I dislike it - mainly because it cashes mechanics KSP does wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. ISP \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP - varies ISP by varying fuel consumption, while IRL is the trust of the engine which varies. This is why a lot of RL rockets won\u0027t make it without SRBs, kerosine boosters and the like. This is also why asparagus is so effective in KSP - you have more thrust at launch than you should, you burn fuel faster than you should. You need less start thrust and stage faster - so you minimize dead weight. Now while this is issue with all ksp designs, the more you stage the more you gain (only drawback are staging parts). There is a mod around, which can scale trust with ISP, if you try it, it will make you appreciate the usefulness of SRBs and brings asparagus more in line with reality, together with the practice of using vac engines for main stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Engine weight - KSP balances engines by adding weight to them. Any engine which is not boosting, is payload which pretends to be engine. Radial boosters designs benefit from this. Since asparagus sheds dead weight faster, it\u0027s more efficient. Since RL engines are lighter, the gains from asparagus or radials is lower as well. Food for thought - skipper engine weighs 4 tons (that\u0027s an extra Mk1-2 pod) - you want that boosting instead of just doing nothing at the top of your rocket. Now this would be bad idea in RL due to 1. But how heavier KSP engines are ? Roughly 2-3 times the mass for the same thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Drag - Drag in stock KSP has more to do with number of parts, than surface area and AoA. While asparagus (or any rocket with many radial boosters), still has more drag by virtue of more parts, it\u0027s much less as it should. Obviously there is mod for that as well. It\u0027s not a problem with FAR if you are reasonable, but less effective than tall rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Control - Due to the ridiculous way torque (and drag) works you can control virtually any \u0027rocket\u0027 which stays together- this used to be somehow balanced with rocket floppiness, but yeah two wrongs making a right, and the art of playing the strutivarius . Again, nothing wrong with reasonable designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Reliability - KSP engines don\u0027t have stutter, flame out exactly at the same time, That is, you can rely on symmetric trust. Also decouples never fail to decouple (unless you mis configured something). Which again, gives benefit for asparagus launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. There is no mission cost involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Lack of alternatives - a lot of rocket technology makes sense using, due to some particular benefits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake for example SRBs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. They are cheaper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. They can be stored for years and still work, transported easier etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c. If they explode they are easy to clean up (as long as... you know)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d. They can be more easily recovered (as they can take much more punishment without damage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e. While they cannot be throttled they don\u0027t provide constant throttle, they can be designed in different ways, for example near constant trust, near constant TWR. (This really annoys me in KSP, with the crazy TWR increase at the end of the srb burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t understand why people have such issue with, \u0022you can go further with bigger engines than with few smaller ones\u0022. Of course you can, and definitely should be able to. The problem with ksp, is that engines don\u0027t have the issues should should have, and have issues they should not. Also everything is free, so it like saying \u0022OMG I can drive further with a truck full of fuel, than with a car\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo compare rockets, you need to compare their payload ratio. If we compare first (lifter) stage, say 80km low equatorial orbit. The payload vs the total size of the rocket will give you good point of comparison. I don\u0027t say engines are balanced, pretty sure Mainsail is totally lame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T21:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002278stonewobble\u0022 data-cite=\u002278stonewobble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf all other engines are deleted and replaced with this?

Yes, there is. More options puts the choice of playing how anyone wants to and everyones taste of balancing in the hands of the player. Ie. if I think the new parts are too easy. I can choose not use them and challenge myself in other ways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s allready possible, if not encouraged even, for people to make modifications to the game. For the sake of creating options for people. Personally I don\u0027t have the need to tweak precise stats of each and every engine. It\u0027s enough for me with a nice range of mostly stock parts to choose from. I also don\u0027t see a problem that some of these options come from the vanilla game rather than mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No, it doesn\u0027t. It makes perfect sense. If I or anyone else enjoys making a rocket with part Y (no matter how op or under powered it is), then the game is better, for that person, with that part in it, than it would be without it. Ie. If I love chocolate an icecream with chocolate is better than an icecream without chocolate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Which is absolutely true... Which is the reason all of us has games that we do not like and don\u0027t want to play. They\u0027re are simply not our cup of tea, eventhough they might be someone elses. The best we can hope for is that a game somehow matches some or, if we\u0027re really lucky, most of what we enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Which is, again, absolutely true. Fun is subjective. For some balancing adds fun and for others it can detract from fun. Since there is no universal truth when it comes to subjectivity, neither has the high ground from that perspective. The fact of the matter is that if a game offers balanced and overpowered, a player can choose balance or overpowered or both. If the game only picks one of the 2 to offer players, then players who like the opposite will either be forced to play the other or not to play at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m not adverse to balancing of the engines in kerbal space programme.

I mean you can\u0027t even see dv stock, you have to guess, ksp doesn\u0027t even give you the information you need to do the math as far as I\u0027m aware. Most people are going to wing it, and I recommend more of you try it, it makes the game a bit lighter sure, but it\u0027s a blast. Now imagine doing that without even having a clue about the basic math or principles. Rockets will be over built.. These engines are not over powered, regardless of how much \u0022evidence\u0022 you produce, the game needs to be easier so more people can enjoy it instead of catering to the top 1% of players who heavily mod anyway.. most of whom are mod makers themselves... This helps bring in fresh players and gives them some breathing room to learn. It\u0027s a good thing, it can help teach players the concepts without becoming frustrated at every launch. This is an amazing game that actually manages to grab otherwise disinterested people and slap a little science into them whether they realize it or not. I think an easy button is an allowance we can bear no? I mean nerf it don\u0027t nerf, it\u0027s not a big deal in my book, but I want more people to make more trips to distant planets, to really dive in, and I think this is a step in the right direction.

This is the first time I\u0027ve seen the forums turn this sour (not that it\u0027s especially bad, but before it was far more pleasant than most forums) so I think everyone should actually be asking what is best for the community as a whole, including the casual players, and not what\u0027s best for gameplay or any other metric, because honestly this game has always been bigger than that. That\u0027s why it\u0027s special, and that\u0027s why Orbiter never took off. My vote is for whatever grabs the most people and opens their eyes and gets them interested in learning more. I understand the arguments all these graphs intend to show, and by all means suggest away, but bear in mind the little people, we are not rocket scientists and we don\u0027t want to be, but that doesn\u0027t mean we don\u0027t want to play.

Yes, there is. More options puts the choice of playing how anyone wants to and everyones taste of balancing in the hands of the player. Ie. if I think the new parts are too easy. I can choose not use them and challenge myself in other ways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s allready possible, if not encouraged even, for people to make modifications to the game. For the sake of creating options for people. Personally I don\u0027t have the need to tweak precise stats of each and every engine. It\u0027s enough for me with a nice range of mostly stock parts to choose from. I also don\u0027t see a problem that some of these options come from the vanilla game rather than mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No, it doesn\u0027t. It makes perfect sense. If I or anyone else enjoys making a rocket with part Y (no matter how op or under powered it is), then the game is better, for that person, with that part in it, than it would be without it. Ie. If I love chocolate an icecream with chocolate is better than an icecream without chocolate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Which is absolutely true... Which is the reason all of us has games that we do not like and don\u0027t want to play. They\u0027re are simply not our cup of tea, eventhough they might be someone elses. The best we can hope for is that a game somehow matches some or, if we\u0027re really lucky, most of what we enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Which is, again, absolutely true. Fun is subjective. For some balancing adds fun and for others it can detract from fun. Since there is no universal truth when it comes to subjectivity, neither has the high ground from that perspective. The fact of the matter is that if a game offers balanced and overpowered, a player can choose balance or overpowered or both. If the game only picks one of the 2 to offer players, then players who like the opposite will either be forced to play the other or not to play at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m not adverse to balancing of the engines in kerbal space programme. I just don\u0027t need it enough, to hinder other people to play with unbalanced engines, as long as I can choose what I want. Ie. I can use the new engines or not, the new engines did not remove the old engines afterall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my humble oppinion it should be up to either a democratic ingame poll or we should let it rest with the autho... uhm creators vision for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I got from your response is that because fun is subjective (which it is) and because some people might have fun with some parts, who are we as individuals to say I don\u0027t like that part, we should change it. Because we can choose weather or not to use a part, we are not being forced to use that parts. So why can\u0027t we just let them have their fun if we don\u0027t have to use those parts which we deem OP. Your position on this is further backed up by your statement that we are able to modify the game to suit how we like it (effectively saying we shouldn\u0027t use the suggestion page because we can modify the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your second to last point, you say you\u0027re not against the balancing of the game, but not enough to \u0022hinder other people to play with unbalanced engines\u0022.
