Are you tired of massive transports that only get ten Kerbans into space? Are you looking for a fast, maneuverable platform that will fit in your hangar? KC Ltd. has the answer for you! Meet the KC-35 D Armadillo SSTO 18 passenger Fast Attack Transport. Smaller than most bombers (Heck, smaller than it\u0027s name!), the Armadillo is capable of carrying 18 passengers up to orbit and back. Although less agile in the air than the original KC-35, due to increased thrust and weight, it is still capable of evasive maneuvers. Veteran pilots will find that barrel rolls, immelmans, and loops are still within the Armadillo\u0027s capabilities. Steamlined, fast, small, and agile, we here at Kerban Carriers Ltd. are sure that you will find the KC-35 D Armadillo to be your go to platform for intraplanetary and even interplanetary transport!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease place your purchase order here, full instructions and owners manual come with purchase.

The center of mass is below the center of thrust, and it just tumbles with the aerospikes on. This is without a crew, don\u0027t know if Kerbals have mass, but if they do this issue will most definitely be much worse.
