Nuke rockets (Second choice) help a lot of interplanetary but Duna or Eve take so little deltaV to reach that any of the other engines will work for a mission to either. or both. Then after those missions you should have enough science to unlock everything else. Ion engines are a waste of time in my personal opinion. I messed around with them a bit but the burn times are outrageous. They are good for TINY TINY TINY probes and that about it. Turbojets (Third choice) are good... planes are fun to fly but spaceplanes are annoying to get into orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T16:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI reckon always get science items first.

The Gravioli Detector yields a large amount of science in and of itself. After that, it really\u0027s a matter of your own gameplay preferences. I\u0027d say the nuke if you want to go to Duna or Eve soon, the Turbojet if you\u0027re wanting to stay local for the time being. Ion Propulsion is usually what I unlock dead last in the whole tech tree; anything an ion engine can do, a regular rocket or spaceplane engine can generally do faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re comfortable designing SSTOs and have small payloads that you want to start sending up, then I\u0027d say get the TJs.
