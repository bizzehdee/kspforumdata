So I am posting this here in hope someone can point me to the right direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSituation: I am a salvagemonger. I recover all the stages I can. I do that:\u00A01-because of $$$, 2-because it sounds realistic (you don\u0027t see NASA droping stages on peoples head just because they are not usefull anymore) and 3-because I enjoy engineering the stages for recovery, it is like a bonus challange/prize for the main mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil now they have been challanging but ok. But now I ended up with a complex situation as the stages become bigger and longer. I have this stage: mainsail with 3 double tank and a few other small parts, I can manage to speedbreak to parachutes limits and deploy them. I manage to make the stage land \u00A0standing up or on its belly, however even when it lands on its belly it comes down with some degree, since it is too heavy and the once the rocket touch the ground cuts the parachute it comes down and crash at ground normally destroying the small and expensive parts and also the topmost double tank.\u00A0For the record I manage to touch ground at 4m/s. And this is more a problem in water then in land, because in land I can just extend the airbrakes and once the rocket cut the chutes only one airbrake is destroyed ($1000 is acceptable), but in \u00A0water the airbrake make no diference and all the parts that are topmost get the impact and break appart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoo I was thinking what could be the most aproximated solution to real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInflatable Floaters that would expand as soon as the stage splash or land to minimize the shock of angled parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA way to flood the fuel tanks as soon as it hit the water, this way I could control buoyance and not let the stage tip 90 degree to its side and break other parts. over ground I can keep with the airbreakers for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoo my question is: do you know of any mods that allow me this things? Does such thing exist?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-25T01:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSXT mod have inflatable balloon and several parts that specifically designed to land on water (such as floating pad for seaplanes or inflatable airbags).

Once I develop a stage that land safelly then I just launch and leave the recover for Stage Recover to handle the procedures.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBallutes - also interesting in concept, but sounds a bit exagerated and unrealistic and I prefer a more realistic playstyle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour parachute suggestion - it seems you didn\u0027t read all the post, but I don\u0027t condeem you. You can\u0027t just place a set of chutes on each tip of the stage, because the stage will probably land inclined and this is a real problem if your stage is long, because once the lowest part touches the land or the water the chutes cutoff (even realchutes) and the other side hanging in the air drops abruptly and gets destroyed, even on water. \u00A0Soo this doesn\u0027t\u00A0work, I tried much before coming here. The solution is to measure the EXACT EQUIDISTANT distance from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and place radial chutes, this is \u00A0A PAIN IN THE ASS and I just came here looking for a diferent solution because I don\u0027t want to do that everytime I design a new rocket. But now I am using a hack mod that allow me to jump right over the situation saving a lot of time for the tests, before this I had to setup the chutes, launch, drop, wait, wait, wait, open chutes and wait more just to see how it would land, even an inclination as small as 6 degrees would result in catastrophic drops and back to drawing board. Plus I was satisfield with side lands before, but now I am not, when I realised that 4m/s is a LOT even not destroying the stage, in RL it would cause major damage to anything. \u00A0Now I use airbags and floater associated with smaller stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223107865\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162493\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498872890\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158362\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Martian Emigrant\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Martian Emigrant said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat?

But this jouney to find a solution brought me to question how reasonable it is to drop a 10 tons stage on its side at 4m/s?
