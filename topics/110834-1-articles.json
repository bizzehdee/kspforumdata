Attempt to get into 80km orbit, then dock CSM onto top of LM and transfer burn to the Mun. When you dock CSM to LM be sure to switch control to the Lander Can. Lander has a FL-T200 clipped inside and outside has a Rockomax 48-7s. Lander has ~2200 m/s of Delta-V, enough to get it to the surface and back to CSM. Has more than enough fuel to get back to Kerbin, vacuum delta-v is 6,393 overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft file is here: Will upload to KerbalX sometime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fBiM24m.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fBiM24m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-25T22:52:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2016 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by legoclone09\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded photos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics or no clicks...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gmpd2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gmpd2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPics or no clicks...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, no pics means no clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make the game GUIs disappear for glamor with f2, and you can take screenshots with f1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t available for pics at the time, I only had my Mediafire link.
