Attempt to get into 80km orbit, then dock CSM onto top of LM and transfer burn to the Mun. When you dock CSM to LM be sure to switch control to the Lander Can. Lander has a FL-T200 clipped inside and outside has a Rockomax 48-7s. Lander has ~2200 m/s of Delta-V, enough to get it to the surface and back to CSM. Has more than enough fuel to get back to Kerbin, vacuum delta-v is 6,393 overall.\n\nCraft file is here: Will upload to KerbalX sometime.\n\n![fBiM24m.png](http://i.imgur.com/fBiM24m.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-25T22:52:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2016 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by legoclone09**\n  \nAdded photos"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:00:09Z","Content":"Pics?"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:02:57Z","Content":"Pics or no clicks..."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:56:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pics or no clicks...\n\nYep, no pics means no clicks.\n\nYou can make the game GUIs disappear for glamor with f2, and you can take screenshots with f1."},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:27:58Z","Content":"I wasn\u0027t available for pics at the time, I only had my Mediafire link.
