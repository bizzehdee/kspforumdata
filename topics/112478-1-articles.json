Thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) equals thrust divided by a quantity equal to the mass of the craft times the surface gravity of the world in question. Or, in short:\n\nTWR = T / mg.\n\nThe wiki has the Mun\u0027s surface gravity data; it\u0027s 1.63 meters per second per second. Any engine you would use on Mun would produce its vacuum thrust, of course. A craft with a TWR value of greater than 1.0 can take off from the Mun; one with less than that won\u0027t be able to take off/will crash.\n\nSo - example time. Let\u0027s say you\u0027ve got a craft utilizing a single Terrier engine; in vacuum, its maximum thrust is 60 kN. Let\u0027s say you want a craft that has a 1.2 TWR on Mun.

I am trying to do it with poodles, because they have great stats, but I need to do some experiments to see exactly how much using a less mass/ISP efficient engines will effect it. The KW Vesta is the next best thing, and I think that Dv is potentially manageable (it seems a little low).\n\n![11246186_10153317281734242_3529236030752930459_o.jpg](https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t31.0-8/11246186_10153317281734242_3529236030752930459_o.jpg)\n\n![10275458_10153317287804242_2062252350420839810_o.jpg](https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/10275458_10153317287804242_2062252350420839810_o.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That delta v map is not up to date.

That makes sense. But the problem I was having, I can slow down, you just don\u0027t have very long to slow down in a 10K circular orbit.\n\nOK, so changing the body I have a ~4TWR, and enough fuel. And sure, I see how it might be possible to land theoretically. I don\u0027t know if I will be able to do it, I ended up crashing into the ground at about 70 m/s. It seems I will basically be starting a suicide burn directly from a 10K orbit, and if I let off that throttle for a second I will be going to fast to survive.

Nothing wrong with having it that high on Mun, since there\u0027s no atmospheric drag to bleed off your delta-V.\n\nSince you\u0027ve got KER, toss up the Surface and Vehicle tabs when you go to make your Mun landing (be sure to add one of the KER flight computer parts to your craft before you launch). On the Vehicle tab, there\u0027ll be a stat telling you the distance to suicide burn - you want to begin a full power retrograde burn (Z-key) when that figure gets as close to zero as you can manage (try not to start your burn after it gets below zero; at that point a crash is pretty much inevitable). And, as with any time you go for a suicide burn, quicksave before you start..."},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:01:21Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need KER parts with an engineer or upgraded tracking station, and I will have both.\n\nBut great suggestion. That would make it easier.\n\nBut I am almost wondering if attaching some \u0022Thuds\u0022 might overall make the craft more efficient to land. If I am thinking straight, a TWR of 4 is only 3/4 efficient, While one of 8 would be 7/8s efficient. Which should be far more important than a few pounds and ~20 ISP.\n\nThey even could be attached to the miner.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOK, turns out I was actually in much better shape than I thought I was. Those miner tanks were not connected to my main rocket. So I can give my miner a TWR, capable of doing small suborbital hops, with some terriers, increase my Dv dramatically, and make my overall TWR go through the roof. All while giving my miner the ability to do small suborbital hops theoretically.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T20:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:20:23Z","Content":"If you want the latest dV chart for 1.0.2, the go-to now is metaphor\u0027s updated chart.
