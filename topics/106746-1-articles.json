Only mods I currently have in are KER (Kerbal Engineer Redux) and Chatterer, both updated to the latest version as of posting. I don\u0027t believe these mods are interfering in any way, but as it is technically a modded install I will post it here. The Bug: I\u0027ve accepted a mission to land a new surface outpost on Mun which has the following requirements for completion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding it on the Mun (obviously) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequires antenna, docking port, and can generate power \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a research lab at the outpost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a viewing cupola at the outpost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave 1,000 units of RCS fuel/Monoprop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The outpost must be on wheels*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand maintain stability for 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built flown and landed a craft which meets all specifications, but the outpost must be on wheels has never procced.

I can provide logs if needed, but don\u0027t see a point for it considering the type of bug it is. That and I\u0027m unsure what would be needed in this situation. I think that\u0027s all I need to post, if I forgot something or this needs something I\u0027ll update it/respond below.

The small gear bay has some collider issues that prevent it from working with this objective at the present time. Pretty much any other wheel will work.
