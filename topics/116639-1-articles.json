Just wanted to share my mission to Sarnus and it\u0027s moons. This mission was based pretty heavily on the Cassini spacecraft / orbiter - as with other sandbox missions I do, I plan to come up with a \u0022research paper\u0022 outlining Sarnus and it\u0027s composition and effect on the small moon system.\n\nBut first, there needed to be a spacecraft there to take pictures and do science!\n\nThe S-S-O Discovery One is the very first launch and spacecraft in this new program - the Discovery program. S-S-O means \u0022Sarnus System Orbiter\u0022 and \u0022One\u0022 means the first craft launched (no failures.)\n\nImage album is below:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Maybe SSODO can do a flyby and check it out for further possibilities.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T04:43:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by -ctn-**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T08:15:56Z","Content":"What mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:08:55Z","Content":"That looks lovely ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I like complicated smaller scale missions."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T13:11:39Z","Content":"Thanks!\n\nAs for mods, I think this is right:\n\nRemoteTech for the antenna dish\n\nHullCam VDS for the cameras\n\nDMagic Orbital Science for most of the science parts\n\nAnd AIES Aerospace for the RCS thrusters."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T04:45:33Z","Content":"Little bump for new Imgur album, graphics, and description!\n\nAfter getting ready to launch, I realized the newly-installed Outer Planets Mod\u0027s Sarnus had a transfer window only 20 days away. So I switched gears and built a rocket to take the spacecraft out to the Sarnus system instead!\n\nEDIT:\n\nA little maneuvering today: flyby #28 ended up with Slate and Tekto encounters, all the while doing a Sarnus flyby of 384,500m. That\u0027s only 84 kilometers above the atmosphere! Some great science was collected that will be studied for some time.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
