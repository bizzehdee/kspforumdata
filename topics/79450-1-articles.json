I have this weird idea where the sum total of the courage of kerbals in a ship determines how far you can go before the crew commit mutiny, and/or you suffer massive reputation loss, and courageous kerbals are hard to come by, so you\u0027ll have to hire more, but less courageous kerbals to do a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModsdontlockthisthreadplease \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"captainb","CreatedById":116685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T21:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Algiark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Algiark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELike, apart from staffing the lab, practically you can do everything else with just one kerbal.\u003Cp\u003EWhat gameplay mechanics, do you think, can force or encourage players to send multiple kerbals on a mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of the science lab, I just think it needs to be better implemented.
