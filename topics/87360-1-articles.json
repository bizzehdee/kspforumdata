It adds challenges to the game and hence replay value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question, however, has plagued me since the advent of contracts: Why aren\u0027t there contracts for anything besides testing, rescues, \u0027collect science from orbit\u0027, and planting flags? They\u0027d dovetail perfectly into career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start out, you could be tasked with retrieving a surface sample or sending a crew report from a certain biome. As you unlock more science instruments, you could get contracts to collect data from a certain biome and altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could work with other items in the tech tree too. For example, once you unlock docking ports you could get a contract to rendezvous and dock with a ship or station in orbit for the purpose of transferring crew. They already do something similar to this with the rescue missions. Subassemblies could be added in the same manner in which experimental parts are added, with the requirement that they be delivered to the rendezvous as cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you advance further, there could be \u0027test pilot\u0027 contracts where you\u0027re required to reach a certain velocity at a certain altitude, test a stock aircraft or a player-created one at a certain amount of g-force, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above contracts (and I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll think of more) could be set to be offered at random when the player reaches a tech level that makes the mission possible. These would add even more variety and more replay value than what\u0027s already offered and what\u0027s on the slate for adding FinePrint in .26.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T06:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI rly lile the idea of a docking contract. I think of it as the other contracts given once a game like \u0022start a vessel\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like to fly stock vessels and I normally delete them to make room in the save menues. Not saying they are bad I just don\u0027t like to use stuff that I didnt design myself, for many reasons that don\u0027t matter here. I could imagine to do stuff like \u0022reenter at a speed of 4000 at a hight of 30 km\u0022 but with any (mybe manned as a requirement?) vessel I want.
