Duna III the third of the Duna series. Duna I was a sateillite that sucessly went into orbit with duna in 1978 and then the infamous Duna II was a manned mission to land on Duna and back to kerbin, But however due to limitations with the technology at the time Duna II was cancelled and scrapped. Duna III now in the 90s the technology required for landing on Duna was now available... Altough the first 7 attempts to land the lander were failures ether missing the landing, missing Duna entirely, or worst case scenario crash landing; But after the 7 attempts the 8th one proved to be sucessful landing the north pole on Duna and collected a great amount of data from the north pole!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hvmcyeO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hvmcyeO.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe Duna III lander weighing at a 3.8 tons!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nCurrently there is a planned mission in the works for a manned mission to land on Duna and back to kerbin!
