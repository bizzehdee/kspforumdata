I accepted the contrast of Mun Outpost and I built a Lab rover and a living space rover and succeeded to land them on the Mun and then I docked them together. But then I found that the confirmation of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Landed on the Mun\u0027 kept twinkling, and I cannot get the confirmation of \u0027Maintain stability for at least 10 seconds\u0027. When I get a closer look of my outpost, I surprised to find that my rover keeps vibrating and twisting! Just like a perpetual motion machine! But I was doing nothing! Then I closed the RAS and SAS, released the brake, but they do not work. I was able to move the rover forward or turn, but whenever I stopped, the rover started dancing. When I tried to return to the space center, the game crashed. I do not know why these things happen. Does anybody have ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T14:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you running any mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T15:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes not having enough structural integrity can cause weird harmonics and oscillations in the physics engine.

They didn\u0027t twitch, they actually cartwheeled over and over (just very slowly), propelled by some invisible force. They fixed that issue, but I\u0027m wondering if there is some residual invisible force that\u0027s causing the twitching. The cause back then was small hexagonal and small cubic strut parts and their position relative to docking ports. If you had those parts connected between the root part and the docking port then things would go badly wrong. I would suggest, if you have any small hexagonal and/or small cubic strut parts, to remove them from your design and try that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T11:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have SAS or MechJeb on?
