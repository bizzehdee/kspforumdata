I know if instead the question is between Mars and Venus then Mars is probably the more hospitable of the two. But while both Duna and Eve are more friendly than Mars and Venus I think Eve has some advantages that may put it ahead of Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s have a look at the numbers first, at sea level:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eatmosphere = 0.2atm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity = 0.3G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etemperature = really cold\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V to orbit = 1,380m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eatmosphere = 5atm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity = 1.7G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etemperature = 150 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V to orbit = 12,000m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so Eve\u0027s sea level looks pretty horrible. However while there\u0027s no where on Duna where you could find a place with denser atmosphere and hotter temperate, there are places on Eve that\u0027s more friendly than its sea level. On one of those 6km Eve mountain tops you have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eatmosphere = 2atm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity = 1.7G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etemperature = 120 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V to orbit = 7,500m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that\u0027s not so bad. The only real obstacle is the temperature, but 110 degrees is well within modern engineering capabilities. Aside from these Eve also have the following advantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eliquid water ocean - yes okay it\u0027s laced with radioactive isotopes, but water is water and you could always purify it.

With plenty of cheap energy you could afford to actively cool your habitat, distil pure water and generally do stuff. Duna on the other hand with reduced solar panel efficiency due to distance to Kerbol and lack of nuclear fuel source will probably require large amount of solar panels/nuclear reactors shipped in from Kerbin to keep a colony alive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does everyone think of the possibility of a Kerbal colony on Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T15:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about Duna in the ice caps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JacenHan","CreatedById":57331,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T15:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe actually have no idea what the oceans are Eve are made of.

I\u0027m going to remove myself from the KSP limitations currently in play, and pretend like we\u0027re actually planning a real mission. Because that kind of stuff is fun.

Even though you\u0027re closer to the sun, that atmosphere is going to pretty much stop any visible light coming in. Solar panels on a realistic Eve would be useless. Conversely, if you don\u0027t have light, that\u0027s another power requirement if you\u0027re going to do hydroponics to sustain breathing air and some sort of food for your crew. So, uh, that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The pressure of the atmosphere would be enough to crush pretty much anything. You\u0027d need some VERY resilient vessels, and crew would pretty much never be allowed to go EVA unless you had some kind of porcelain/glass (acid in the air, by the way) Newt Suit. Also, this alone would eliminate heat from the equation as a power generation method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The only power generation you\u0027d be able to do is a nuclear reactor or radiothermal generator. The nuclear reactor would be very large and heavy, and would need another launch to get it there, most likely. The RTG would be lighter by itself, but if left alone would immediately irradiate crew members to death. You would need to either keep it very far away and run large cables to it, or you would need to encase it in some sort of (inherently heavy) radiation shield... So uh, good luck finding power. Actually, you may be able to use a wind turbine, just make sure it doesn\u0027t break in the high winds or you\u0027ll be entirely screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Re-entry would have to be done incredibly carefully, the g-forces encountered would easily kill crew if you didn\u0027t purposely try to speed yourself up to counteract the atmosphere so that you slow down slower. Parachute landings are a no-go until you get to about 50m/s or so., because they create too many G\u0027s. Also, the heat would probably melt the vessel before you got low enough to deploy your chutes anyhow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Where are you going to get water? If you ship it with them and make them recycle their own waste water, that\u0027s more mass you have to send in and properly decelerate. If you decide to mine it, you\u0027re going to have to have some kind of mining rover that can extract it from the oceans, again, more weight to decelerate. This rover would have to be able to traverse VERY steep inclinations to reach the water, because your landing spot would HAVE to be on top of some kind of mountain, else return would not be practical. Once you extract the water, it would also be very salty from the sulfuric acid reacting with the minerals in the water and causing sulfates. So, there\u0027s another power draw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Food? If you send them with hydroponics, that\u0027s a huge power drain. If you send them with a limited supply, that\u0027s not sustainable and is sadistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Return or resupply/crew changes. These would require a massive, ungainly rocket with tons of delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Heat. Very much heat, but so much pressure that it can\u0027t really be used effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some of the points about landing on a realistic Duna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Solar power is a viable option. Solar power is very lightweight and safe around crew members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Atmospheric re-entry would be much more viable, as the G-forces produced would not be deadly, nor would the atmosphere be thick enough to cause considerable heat. Landings can be done entirely by parachute if there are enough of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Leaving the surface would be much easier due to lower atmosphere and gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Water could be extracted from the ice caps in small amounts, but separating it from the mostly carbon dioxide ice would be complicated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Anything that was a threat on Kerbin to getting to orbit or doing atmospheric shenanigans is reduced. So is anything that\u0027s a benefit so there\u0027s that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is the best place for a colony of what you said. Personally, though, my prime candidate for a colony has always been and always will be Gilly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lowest delta-V budget to get to the mothering SOI (Eve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gilly would likely have ice on it, as it is said to be a captured asteroid, and many asteroids contain some ice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Any atmosphere a realistic Gilly would have would be absolutely miniscule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Descent and return take incredibly small amounts of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Close proximity to the sun would make solar power a very good power generation method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Low gravity so base construction would be safer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Crew would have to exercise to maintain muscle mass, as Gilly is essentially as low-gravity as a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You still get to look at Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA realistic Eve (and the current Eve, really) should be meant for nothing more than a destination for one expedition, or as a prison planet for life-sentences. It just is not practical as a colony planet...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azazel1024","CreatedById":44262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T18:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI figure those ice caps are mostly frozen CO2, like Mars.

During each hemispheres winter time approximately a 1m layer of dry ice is deposited consisting of about 20-30% of the entire atmosphere\u0027s content of CO2. In the spring time, it melts over a period of a few days generating enormous wind storms (400\u002Bkm/hr) and massive, often times global, dust storms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to keep in mind though, 400\u002Bkm/hr is frightening still, but with the atmosphere being only 1% as dense, the wind force is actually only equivelent to about 15km/hr on Earth at sea level. However, very light particles can still be transported at enormous velocities.
