I would like to try my hand in strategy creation, but I don\u0027t know where to start. I have looked at the configuration file for SKB, but that still doesn\u0027t tell me how to use the options given and what options are available that I don\u0027t see used there. Does anyone know the entire set of options available for strategy creation, or at least have a straightforward way of explaining how the basic options work? Any help would be much appreciated.
