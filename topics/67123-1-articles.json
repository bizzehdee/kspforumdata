I finally decided I wanted to contribute to thread so here I am!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame philosophy: I like to play stock only at the moment and I like to do more complicated explorations rather than a quick landing and return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiggest achievment: Either getting to Jool or lifting 4 orange tanks to orbit to use as modular fuel sections for my modular interplanetary ships (500 tonnes and laggy when leaving orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans: Decending a Mohole in an RCS sled that I have been testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture plans: If the asteroid thing is free to play I would like to put one in a very very low munar orbit before building a base on it (if such a thing is possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is it about this game that I enjoy watching other people like Scott Manley doing things on you tube as well as doing it myself!!!

And I realized my tendency to build wide rockets needed to be taken a few steps further. I had actually wasted months in the game trying to create a super heavy lifter, then I read that thread and got four tanks into orbit after only an hour. The other secret was creating a central core of super strong fueselage sections (the ones that look like jet fuel), everything just strutted on to that!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T13:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have awesome achievements.
