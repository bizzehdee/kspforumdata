First of all, I\u0027m enjoying the update so far. I feel like I\u0027ve got a real progression system working against me, though the gameplay honestly doesn\u0027t feel as refined as the science tree did when it was released. Anyway, I just want to suggest that, when the time comes, you should scrap the procedural mission briefs. The humor in KSP delivered by the flavor-text and whatnot is something of a cherry-on-top to the game, and the awkward-to-read, unfunny procedural briefs are a real subtraction. I suspect you\u0027ve put a fair amount of effort into such a daunting feature, and that your first urge will be to try and fix it rather than scrap it, but I\u0027d really say that you should just do away with the procedural briefs and replace them with some of that witty writing we were all surprised to find in a space-sim game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I understand that there are a lot of contracts to write descriptions for - even if you start reusing them - so man-hours may be an issue. With this in mind, I\u0027l tell you that, at least from my perspective, I\u0027d rather have a small quantity of often-repeated hilarious mission briefs than a large quantity of unfunny ones.

Kinda feels wasteful to drop a lone decoupler from the launchpad, testing landing gear in strange places, etc. I\u0027m sure it will get better as the system improves over time for sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside (I\u0027m sure others have already figured this out) if you get a contract that asks you to test a certain engine or other part in \u0022splash down on Kerbin\u0022 or the like, after you\u0027ve landed/splashed down, add a new stage to the staging options, and drag the engine/part you need to test up to the new, unactivated stage (yes, even if the part was already activated in a prior stage, just pretend it wasn\u0027t and make a new stage for it). Then all you have to do is \u0022stage\u0022 the engine/part while splashed/landed and it will count as triggering it for the first time and complete the test, even if it wasn\u0027t the first time you \u0022staged\u0022 it. This also works for empty SRBs that you need to test at certain locations -- even after they are empty, just make a new stage, drag the item-to-be-tested to it, and stage it again (even if it has already been staged prior).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Capsule\u002BFuel\u002BLV-909. Stage launch, activate engine, and use it to fly short distance to water; splash down. Turn throttle to zero. Make a new stage option, and drag LV-909 to the new stage. Active this stage as though you were activating the engine for the first time. Any tests that required a test of the LV-909 while splashed down will be completed, even though you used that engine to get there. I haven\u0027t found a need to deactivate the engine first prior to \u0022re-staging\u0022 for it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T20:27:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Holyvision\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T20:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boamere\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Boamere\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESUGGESTION: What we need is a \u0022cha-ching\u0022 sound-affect or something along those lines when we complete a mission and get money, and we should have a little green popup showing how much profit you made (like this: \u0022\u002B5000\u0022 underneath your cash bar) This will make completing a mission more satisfying!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
