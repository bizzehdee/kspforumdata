So what\u0027s an extra 5 or 10 bucks to show our appreciation? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think everyone that got this wonderful game back in early alpha and enjoys mods should pick your favorite authors and give a lil. \u00A0Just to show them you appreciate the hard work it takes the update mods to a new engine. \u00A0Many are students and would no doubt love some extra money for caffeine and sweet, sweet Snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of this as a sort of pledge drive. \u00A0No pressure or guilt. \u00A0Even a thank you would probalbly be awesome (instead of bothering about updates). \u00A0Remember, these gals and guys put in serious dev time as a hobby and most aren\u0027t paid to do it, so THANK YOU ALL. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 (as a former modder myself: \u00A0I know deep down it comes from a love of the game and desire to add a personal touch to it but I just want all the hard working mod authors out there to know \u003Cu\u003EYOU ROCK\u003C/u\u003E and help make this game the awesome, personally customized experience it was born to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T23:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222531875\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461361576\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022114782\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022autumnalequinox\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, autumnalequinox said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of this as a sort of pledge drive. \u00A0No pressure or guilt. \u00A0Even a thank you would probalbly be awesome (instead of bothering about updates). \u00A0Remember, these gals and guys put in serious dev time as a hobby and most aren\u0027t paid to do it, so THANK YOU ALL. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 (as a former modder myself: \u00A0I know deep down it comes from a love of the game and desire to add a personal touch to it but I just want all the hard working mod authors out there to know \u003Cu\u003EYOU ROCK\u003C/u\u003E and help make this game the awesome, personally customized experience it was born to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. \u00A0Rep-likes, while showing community appreciation,\u00A0don\u0027t pay the bills. \u00A0Although AFAIK (and unless things have changed VERY recently) the US courts have frequently\u00A0said that mods are all derivative works and thus that modders have zero rights to their products, Squad has chosen to be more magnanimous. \u00A0So hit that \u0022Donate\u0022 button before Squad changes its mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T23:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222532067\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461366946\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. \u00A0Rep-likes, while showing community appreciation,\u00A0don\u0027t pay the bills. \u00A0Although AFAIK (and unless things have changed VERY recently) the US courts have frequently\u00A0said that mods are all derivative works and thus that modders have zero rights to their products, Squad has chosen to be more magnanimous. \u00A0So hit that \u0022Donate\u0022 button before Squad changes its mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed!
