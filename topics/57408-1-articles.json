The DTS-M1 not only seems to have LESS bandwidth, but also pulls 50% more power and is 6 times heavier. So how is it better?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the 88-88 is only .36Mits/sec. Nearly 1/2 16 and twice the power and 5 times the mass. So how is it better then the first two? The 16 has the highest data rate, lowest power consumption per packet and lowest mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T06:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know, right?

Something I\u0027ve noticed in a lot of online games. Even Eve does or did it wrong. They put data for the same thing in several places and then have to change every place instead of putting the data in a common place which would then update every place that uses it at once, but would also allow changing it on the fly while the severs are running instead of having to wait for a restart to apply changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T00:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vorg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vorg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat is displayed should come from the same cfg file the game uses so you don\u0027t get these screw ups.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does come from the part.cfg, but the bandwidth isn\u0027t in there directly, it\u0027s calculated from 2 parameters which are in there.
