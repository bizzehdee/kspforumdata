Even though science is useless in sandbox there is still the opportunity for lots of fun, running science experiments and getting your data back to Kerbin. I\u0027d love the option of doing this in sandbox, and if you don\u0027t want to do it, thats fine too, as it wouldn\u0027t be a requirements like in career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI concur.
