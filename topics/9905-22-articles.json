It\u0027s again my personal opinion, but I will say that you need to get rid of the big animated red button cluttering the UI (even if it was really cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E ), and replace it by something more discrete and less Noisy. I also think you need to do something about the floating button beside the lazor system UI. They move when you open them and it can be quite frustrating, maybe simply integrate them on the lazorsystem UI like toggle button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you split some features one day, the KPS system is one of my favorite sub-system, so please split it first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It can also be shared as a common system for other mods (for ex : kethane detection)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m just making suggestions.

I.e. Apoapsis has to be almost the same as Periapsis. And your parking orbit has to have almost 0 elevation. Use the readouts in the Parameters tab and the green circle in the map overlay to help with this. The green circle will show up when you press \u0022Map overlay\u0022 and go to map view. When you have done this your orbit should look something like the image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img546/7112/lazorsystemtransfermun.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lazorsystemtransfermun.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait until the red line (your phase angle) aligns with the cyan line (departure angle) and start thrusting in a prograde direction. Using the Lazor Guided Flight in \u0022prograde\u0022 mode will help a lot here. The goal here is for your orbital velocity to reach the \u0022V Departure\u0022 value in the numerical display. Or your transfer orbit reaches the mun\u0027s orbit. So while thrusting zoom map view out and watch your transfer orbit. If you have aligned everything up correctly you will see your transfer orbit connect with the mun through the patched conics system in KSP. When this happends, press X on your keyboard immediately to shut of your engines. It looks something like the image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img820/3764/lazorsystemtransfermun2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lazorsystemtransfermun2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETransfering from Kerbin to Duna:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you start this transfer it is a good idea to go to map view and fast forward until the red line is close to the cyan line or in other words your phase angle is a few degrees bigger than the Departure angle. The departure window display will also give you a median estimate of how long this will take. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen launch your vessel and assume a circular, non inclined orbit. In map view this may look like something like this. It is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every important\u003C/span\u003E that your starting orbit has an inclination very close to 0 for this transfer to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img515/6571/lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have to wait until the planets align. Depending on your orbit warping forward and low orbits may take a looooong time. That\u0027s why its a good idea to launch at the right moment or set a high parking orbit. When this happends, you will see the cyan line on your map and when it is almost at Kerbins SoI its a good time to line up your eject angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the image below my vessel is 6 degrees ahead of the eject angle. In this toturial i started the burn at 3 degrees ahead. Anyways, start thrusting until your velocity is somewhere around the \u0022V Eject\u0022 value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img441/6571/lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen just like the kerbin - mun tutorial, zoom map view out and look at where the orbits will meet. If you have done everything right, your will see something like the image below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img201/6571/lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lazorsystemtransferduna.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is entirely possible that the orbits does not connect. Most likely because the parking orbit had too much inclination OR the orbit of your target planet is inclined, eccentric or what not. In that case you have to do mid transfer corrections to connect the transfer.
