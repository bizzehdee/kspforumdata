I planned to get into a low orbit so I could get the low space Science for Moho as well as the high space Science. Long story short I didn\u0027t have the delta-v to get into orbit, so I got the high space Science and basically panicked and tried to tweak my trajectory to get back to Kerbin.\n\nThat didn\u0027t work so now I\u0027m in some weird orbit where the apoapsis is roughly where Kerbin orbits, and the periapsis is slightly closer to the Sun than Moho. I only have around 200m/s of dv left, and no matter what I try to do to the trajectory, I just can\u0027t get back to Kerbin. I even left it for a while to go do other missions and hoped that eventually Kerbin and the craft would miraculously intercept one day, but it never happened.\n\nWhat should I do? The craft has a docking port on it so I could send a load of fuel up there, dock it, refuel, undock, and then I would have the dv to get back to Kerbin, but I don\u0027t know how easy that would be. Alternatively I could send an unmanned crew capsule and transfer the crew over to the capsule and then get back home that way, but I sort of want the Science you get from recovering a craft from Moho.\n\nAny suggestions? Poor Valentina has been stuck out there for 3 years now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:00:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:38:58Z","Content":"Look at hitting eve or moho, should be easier.

I got a \u0022sun flyby\u0022 contract and used valentina. I escaped on a solar radial-in direction, got just outside kerbin soi, then burned radial out (back toward kerbin) to get back in. This works well with radial-in/out escape paths because you aren\u0027t changing your orbital period relative to kerbin... (not much anyway), whereas if you escape prograde/retrograde, getting back can be difficult... because once you change your orbital velocity relative to kerbin, you start falling away (both in terms of phase angle and altitude). I recommend radial changes for short there-and-back trips to solar soi. At the very least you can regain encounter in half an orbit with very little dV.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nTo answer your original post, with 200dV and such an elliptical orbit, the best option is to simply wait a year or two for re-encounter. Highly elliptical orbits spend the vast majority of orbit time at their apoapse... in contrast kerbin will be moving quite quickly while your ship is at it\u0027s apoapse. This increase odds of encounter significantly, you shouldn\u0027t have to wait very long. Save all dV for getting re-captured. Once you have an encounter coming up, try to get a pass through atmosphere by planning a maneuver a ways out, 200m/s should be enough to tweak an atmospheric capture."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:06:28Z","Content":"You should have PLENTY of dV to get back so long as your apoapsis high enough that it will encounter Kerbin\u0027s SOI, but it is going to take a very long time.\n\nWhat you can do is create a bunch of manuver nodes. Make sure Kerbin is your target and each new manuver node (after the first) happens after your craft would pass Kerbin\u0027s orbit. As you add more nodes for your subsequent passes you should see that you should be able to see how close you get to kerbin on every pass. Keep adding nodes until you see something that looks reasonably close. Then, at that point, make very small adjustments to the first node and watch how it affects the closest encounter.\n\nBecause you have such an early manuver node compared to the encounter the deltaV required will be very small. From there, once you are close to your kerbin encounter, you can adjust your orbit to try and get a capture orbit with aerocapture. Just be careful on the heating."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:50:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You might not have enough to be captured by Kerbin.
