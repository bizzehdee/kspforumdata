I made the model and everything, and in Unity, I have placed everything where they belong. The ailerons function when I\u0027m rolling the plane, but the animation seems a bit off; the ailerons rotate along the wrong axis. I have tried rotating the flapTransform (what I called the transformName in the control surface module), but the rotation axis is not affected. Please help. Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSOLUTION: Looks like the rotation axis for transformName is determined in the 3D model editor, not Unity. Rotating the model in blender so my desired rotation axis was on the x-axis solved the issue for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-26T19:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2018 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by o24UK42o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound my own solution\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"o24UK42o","CreatedById":194253,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T18:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean is, the control surfaces are at a different angle than parallel to the ground due to the shape of the wings I\u0027m making. It appears that all elevators and ailerons rotate with respect to the horizontal red axis in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. I need my ailerons to rotate with respect to a tilted axis, like tilted at a 12 degree angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone is wondering, I\u0027m making a nice looking A-10 Thunderbolt II with RPM and ASET internals.
