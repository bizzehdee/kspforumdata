It is important to note that afaik Mono can only handle pure .net assemblies (c\u002B\u002B/cli allows some crazy .... with native libraries, but that\u0027s platform depended [=bad] and tricky to realize). That means you would have to exclusively rely on manged libraries, preferably the .NET Framework Class Library. That\u0027s like learning a new language, and thus not much harder to switch to c#. I think there were also some issues [though resolvable] with creating c\u002B\u002B assemblies for .net 3.5. Also pretty much all \u0022reference\u0022 code (other mods) are in C#, so you should be able to read c# anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr C\u002B\u002B KSP modding is not worth it.
