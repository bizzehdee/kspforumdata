Its can be dangerous for your ship, but if you go up in small steps (x2, then x3, then x4) it can make burns go much faster, especially with nukes or Ions.\n\nI\u0027ve even done it in atmosphere to get space planes to orbit quicker, though my wings bend a bit lol.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T04:42:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 04:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T05:00:07Z","Content":"I support this.
