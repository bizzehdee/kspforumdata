I get my creation down on the planet, got my minmus landing mission done and sent Valentina out on EVA where something quite unexpected happened.\n\nShe were sent flying on an eternal tumble that I was unable to recover from. When she were in the air I could recover flying EVA reports. When she touched the ground I were able to take surface reports. I did also manage to gather a surface sample that in fact turned out to put the whole system into her pocket.\n\nI think what might have happened is that while tumbling she fell under the surface of Minmus with the result that it erased the world.\n\nStep by Step guide on the steps leading up to the bug:\n\n1. Landed the craft on minmus Great flats to the north with the crew hatch facing west/Southwest. (northern part of the butterfly shape not the smaller lake.)\n\n2. Took science samples from Mystery goo and Materials bay.\n\n3. Took crew report and transmitted it to kerbin.\n\n4. Pressed the EVA button on Valentina\u0027s portrait. (Note: The screen quickly flashed with SAS controll off)\n\n5. She was sent flying and I tried to recover from the tumble with the EVA RCS but failed.\n\n6. Took Surface sample\n\n7. Attempted to take EVA report on ground but before I could do so the world vanished and all altitude numbers disappeared.\n\nThe world persisted on being gone on all other saves and required a client restart to reappear.\n\nOn the savefile you will see that most of the remains of the lander is now on their way out of the kerbol system.\n\nA quicksave file is included and continues from before my small encounter with the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\n\nIf you don\u0027t do anything you can wait 1 orbit and make a small adjustment to get an encounter with minmus.\n\nFew additional notes:\n\nIt was the first time that Valentina did an EVA on this particular craft and all other EVA\u0027s with similar craft setup around the cockpit have been done with Jebediah.\n\nJebediah has occasionally been pushed a tiny way down on the ladder on the cockpit on this craft setup when exiting on EVA but have not fallen off both in space and on kerbin.\n\nThe lander she were launched from did not move when this happened and was standing firmly on the ground.\n\nLink: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ab3iikl4vz0rjkr/AACMloHOe4o_s4RLVTIYunEsa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ab3iikl4vz0rjkr/AACMloHOe4o_s4RLVTIYunEsa?dl=0)\n\nVersion:1.0.0.830\n\nMods: No mods\n\nPS: Currently trying to see if the bug is recreatable\n\nDiscoveries so far:\n\nGoing out on EVA in space will spawn her clipped through the heatshield and she jitter around alot but pushes her down on the ladder after half a second. This action is almost instant and with no jittering with Jebediah on earlier crafts build with the exact same obstacles around the cockpit.\n\nEdit:\n\nWhenever I exit the cockpit with Valentina on Minmus she seem to launch herself into various spins. Landed there again with the save and this time I was able to recover from the spins but repeatedly the same result of her getting sent flying, especially on slopes it gets rather violent but else seems to be random. I have not been able to destroy the world again using this particular bug so it does seem that it was one bug that led to another.\n\nIt seems that she needs to be on a planets surface for the spins to occur. In space she still just jitters and is then pushed down on the cockpits ladder. Tried it about 20 times and she sticks to the craft in space.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nNailed the problem down to being the female kerbals physics being bugged!\n\nProof: Take Jebediah and Valentina out for a run on the launchpad. Simply sprint, jump and watch the 2 instances that happens.\n\nJebediah will fall face first and immidiately get up.\n\nValentina however will jitter all over the place with warping textures and so on. With enough momentum this jittering will send her into an uncontrolled jitterdance that have the physics dance through the night.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xxserilviaxx**\n  \nNew info. \u002B added step to proof \u002B Added links in latest post"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruther","CreatedById":142224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:37:31Z","Content":"I have the same bug.\n\nI had just landed on Kerbin whed I decided to perform an EVA with Valentina.

However it does seem it also can happen on kerbin.\n\nI believe that it\u0027s the female kerbals making a certain twist that forces them through the ground and then the world disappears (Just a wild guess of mine though)\n\nI think it should most definately be possible to recreate the bug where the world disappears by running around the rocket when landed on minmus maybe jumping into the rocket and exiting it repeatedly. All you have to do really is to get the female kerbal enough momentum and all hell breaks loose ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: Oh and btw, I managed to get her stuck once in between the decoupler and the nosecone on the rocket. It looked quite hillarious but unfortunately it didnt initiate a world destruction.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T17:45:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xxserilviaxx**"},{"CreatedByName":"xxserilviaxx","CreatedById":79675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:34:15Z","Content":"YES! I DID IT!\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljeej4hv26ffs5j/quicksave.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljeej4hv26ffs5j/quicksave.sfs?dl=0)\n\nOk down to the thing. The quicksave contains my extensive testing of female kerbals.\n\nTo Reproduce this requires alot of patience.\n\n1. Click on EVA. Your female kerbal should now either:\n\nA: Be stuck with her helmet on the top of the heatshield and her body on the ladder able to climb back into the pod or grab onto something.\n\nB: Tumble down from the rocket\n\nC: Sit on the ladder normally.\n\nFor this to work you need for scenario A to happen.\n\n2. Keep climbing the ladder and spam F until she climbs on top of the rocket.\n\n3. Walk down from the rocket towards the crew hatch facing then quickly right before she falls attempt to direct her back towards the rocket.(I managed to make it happen around slightly to the left of the crewhatch.)\n\nIt is important for this to work that you kind of slide off while turning back so that she ragdolls a certain way.\n\nNow a few scanarios can happen.\n\nA: She falls to the ground most of the time and nothing happens. Reload quicksave.\n\nB: She falls rapidly to the ground and she herself evaporates on the ground in a big cloud of smoke.\n\nC: She falls, then penetrates the ground and everything turns black resulting in her destruction of the entire system.\n\nEdit: I posted a new quicksave for you guys to play around with. I have now destroyed the world 3 times out of around 28 attempts. Hope it helps you find the exact causes!\n\nI\u0027m also trying to find a failsafe method of making her fall like this and I think I\u0027m on to something. Screenshots will be headed your way as soon as I have them.\n\nFurther Edit: getting nowhere on the failsafe reproduction and the only conclusion I have atm is that its a bit more tricky to get valentina to destroy the world.\n\nAt the moment I\u0027m around 70% Scenario A. 25% Scenario B and around 5% Scenario C.\n\nWill upload a full album of pictures once I get the final shot of a destroyed world.\n\nAlso it does seem to be easier to do when a craft is newly landed. Take my craft as an example but stick a decoupler and a solid rocket booster and throw it out in the hills. put a nosecone and decoupler ontop of the heatshield aswell and discard all of it before you land with parachutes.\n\nEdit: Here is the screenshots however I still haven\u0027t been able to get the world to blow up and take a screenshot of it aswell. [http://imgur.com/a/hxOKK#0](http://imgur.com/a/hxOKK#0)\n\nEdit: I finally made it with screenshots aswell. It takes a bit of patience but it will happen if you follow the steps. The screenshots have info on them aswell so I can try and guide you to hopefully reproduce this bug aswell.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xxserilviaxx**\n  \nFleshed out the reproduction steps\u002B added additional info \u002B added link with screens. \u002B Added last screenshots"},{"CreatedByName":"Gariba","CreatedById":142280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:19:13Z","Content":"While I have not experienced world destruction, I can confirm EVERY female kerbal flies away when taken out on EVA, and, where I was able to test, duplicate themselves upon trying to reenter a vessel."}]}
