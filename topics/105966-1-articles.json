I get my creation down on the planet, got my minmus landing mission done and sent Valentina out on EVA where something quite unexpected happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe were sent flying on an eternal tumble that I was unable to recover from. When she were in the air I could recover flying EVA reports. When she touched the ground I were able to take surface reports. I did also manage to gather a surface sample that in fact turned out to put the whole system into her pocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what might have happened is that while tumbling she fell under the surface of Minmus with the result that it erased the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep by Step guide on the steps leading up to the bug:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Attempted to take EVA report on ground but before I could do so the world vanished and all altitude numbers disappeared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world persisted on being gone on all other saves and required a client restart to reappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the savefile you will see that most of the remains of the lander is now on their way out of the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quicksave file is included and continues from before my small encounter with the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t do anything you can wait 1 orbit and make a small adjustment to get an encounter with minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew additional notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the first time that Valentina did an EVA on this particular craft and all other EVA\u0027s with similar craft setup around the cockpit have been done with Jebediah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah has occasionally been pushed a tiny way down on the ladder on the cockpit on this craft setup when exiting on EVA but have not fallen off both in space and on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander she were launched from did not move when this happened and was standing firmly on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ab3iikl4vz0rjkr/AACMloHOe4o_s4RLVTIYunEsa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/ab3iikl4vz0rjkr/AACMloHOe4o_s4RLVTIYunEsa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion:1.0.0.830\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: No mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Currently trying to see if the bug is recreatable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscoveries so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing out on EVA in space will spawn her clipped through the heatshield and she jitter around alot but pushes her down on the ladder after half a second. This action is almost instant and with no jittering with Jebediah on earlier crafts build with the exact same obstacles around the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I exit the cockpit with Valentina on Minmus she seem to launch herself into various spins. Landed there again with the save and this time I was able to recover from the spins but repeatedly the same result of her getting sent flying, especially on slopes it gets rather violent but else seems to be random. I have not been able to destroy the world again using this particular bug so it does seem that it was one bug that led to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that she needs to be on a planets surface for the spins to occur. In space she still just jitters and is then pushed down on the cockpits ladder. Tried it about 20 times and she sticks to the craft in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENailed the problem down to being the female kerbals physics being bugged!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProof: Take Jebediah and Valentina out for a run on the launchpad. Simply sprint, jump and watch the 2 instances that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah will fall face first and immidiately get up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina however will jitter all over the place with warping textures and so on.

The quicksave contains my extensive testing of female kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Reproduce this requires alot of patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Click on EVA. Your female kerbal should now either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Be stuck with her helmet on the top of the heatshield and her body on the ladder able to climb back into the pod or grab onto something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Tumble down from the rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: Sit on the ladder normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this to work you need for scenario A to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep climbing the ladder and spam F until she climbs on top of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Walk down from the rocket towards the crew hatch facing then quickly right before she falls attempt to direct her back towards the rocket.(I managed to make it happen around slightly to the left of the crewhatch.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important for this to work that you kind of slide off while turning back so that she ragdolls a certain way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a few scanarios can happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: She falls to the ground most of the time and nothing happens. Reload quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: She falls rapidly to the ground and she herself evaporates on the ground in a big cloud of smoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: She falls, then penetrates the ground and everything turns black resulting in her destruction of the entire system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I posted a new quicksave for you guys to play around with. I have now destroyed the world 3 times out of around 28 attempts. Hope it helps you find the exact causes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also trying to find a failsafe method of making her fall like this and I think I\u0027m on to something. Screenshots will be headed your way as soon as I have them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther Edit: getting nowhere on the failsafe reproduction and the only conclusion I have atm is that its a bit more tricky to get valentina to destroy the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I\u0027m around 70% Scenario A. 25% Scenario B and around 5% Scenario C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill upload a full album of pictures once I get the final shot of a destroyed world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it does seem to be easier to do when a craft is newly landed. Take my craft as an example but stick a decoupler and a solid rocket booster and throw it out in the hills. put a nosecone and decoupler ontop of the heatshield aswell and discard all of it before you land with parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Here is the screenshots however I still haven\u0027t been able to get the world to blow up and take a screenshot of it aswell. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hxOKK#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/hxOKK#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I finally made it with screenshots aswell.
