I have found that if you build the spacecraft in a roughly pyramidal stack with (only a few!) winglets near the bottom, it steers fairly well. I\\\u0027m fairly sure this isn\\\u0027t a stable design in Real Life (from memory real rockets need most of their mass towards the front) but it works well here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027re out of the atmosphere, you need either a gimballed engine or RCS (probably both) or it won\\\u0027t steer very well at all[1].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: When you have the SAS on, the spacecraft works against your steering inputs.
