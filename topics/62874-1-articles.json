I got to orbit, refueled and tried to go there anyway, because why not, and found that I was able to get there. That means that the thing had at least 1K ish delta-V, while according to the Rocket equation, it should barely have 180, since the craft weights 21.41 full, 13.41 empty and uses aerospikes for space-propulsion. Then I did some calculations and found that my tugger vehicle, capable of taking large fuel tanks to the moon, get them to the space station and then go to the moon and back again also shouldn\u0027t be able to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, does anyone have an idea of what\u0027s going on?
