Right now Squad is not using any official mirrors for the paid version of KSP, they most likely will not ever. Downloading a paid version from a secondary site is illegal, but more importantly can be dangerous for your system. Many unsavory people like to tack on trojans and other viruses to copies of games so they can phish out your system for any data profitable to them, and even damage your software just for shits and giggles as well as to cover up anything they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can archive all the versions you download from KSP to backtrack to if you are having hiccups. It is a good idea if you have the storage space. But that is for your use ONLY. You are not allowed to share those older versions with anyone without direct permission of Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to sound as the cranky old man here, but I like Squad and what they are doing. This is a unique venture that they have to support on their own, without a Kickstarter or a big publisher to support them. Money made from purchases of the game is what keeps the development going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo tell your friends about the game. Do invite them over to watch you make Jeb happy with many explosions and landing on the Mun. And then do encourage them to pay $15(current price at the time of this posting) to get the game themselves, and share their thoughts on it with more people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they can\\\u0027t afford the game, encourage them to download the demo(0.13) which can be shared with anyone. It is a solid demo giving full capability to use mods and land and/or crash on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcelsior!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
