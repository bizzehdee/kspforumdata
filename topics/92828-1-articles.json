This worked great for Mun, Minmus and even Duna. But when Jool contracts started appearing, the challenge became tougher. My solution was to build a space plane that drops tanks as it ascends. This leaves more delta V for the nuclear rockets once in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this approach I was able to fulfill a contract to plant a flag on Vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the mission of brave Obmund Kerman to plant the flag and return a sample from the Icy moon of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/uZlwm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
