Basically, build your launcher with all your satellites on it like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rEJutn3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rEJutn3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither launch to an LKO parking orbit and then burn to Kerbosynchronous Transfer Orbit, or launch directly to KTO. In either case, your apokee should be almost exactly 2868.75 km (the height of the final synchronous orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext comes the tricky part. At apokee, you need to burn prograde until your orbital period is a particular integer ratio of the final orbital period. For example, the rocket in my picture is carrying 4 satellites, which are put 90 degrees apart. In my case, my orbital period was 3 hours (for a semisynchronous orbit), but for KSO your final orbital period will be exactly 6 hours. If I\u0027m in an orbit with a period of 3/4 of that, or 4:30, and I release a satellite at apokee which instantly circularizes, then at my next apokee the satellite will have only orbited 270 degrees, leaving me 90 degrees ahead of it, perfect for releasing my second satellite. Alternately, I could make my orbital period 5:15, and release a satellite every two orbits. The closer you make your orbital periods, the longer it will take to release all your satellites, but the less dV they will need to circularize their orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s map screen doesn\u0027t show you your orbital period. I strongly recommend using Mechjeb, Kerbal Flight Engineer, or another mod that gives you detailed orbital data. Alternately, given a desired apoapse and orbital period, you can calculate the desired periapse manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with Mechjeb, you won\u0027t be able to get the satellites\u0027 orbits perfectly synchronized, and they will eventually drift out of alignment. Real satellites drift out of alignment too (though due to orbital perturbations and not floating point rounding errors), but they generally have someone watching them and sending commands for station-keeping burns etc. However, this is not how most KSP players like to spend their time. Instead, I recommend editing the save file after you get them in approximately the right orbit, and not touching them after that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T12:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do your satelites have so many antennas and a ladder?
