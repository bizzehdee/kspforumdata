For close in dog fight like battles it would be tactically better to have them use Newtonian maneuvers as well has fighter jet type maneuvers. Using strictly Newtonian physics would kill the pilot pretty quickly. That is unless all maneuvers are done at incredibility low velocities. Newtonian physics also is a disadvantage because the target can be tracked easily based on those physics. Long distance battles using only Newtonian or orbital physics is also very easy to defend against. The only advantage of Newtonian only fighting is the ability to use beam weapons at light second or light minute distances because you know where the target should be based on the physics. In \u0022real\u0022 life current spacecraft are limited by fuel capacity but if you had a lot of fuel the only reasonable way to fly and fight would be to constantly change velocity and vectors. To do this with any expectation of pilot survival would be to put the G forces in one constant direction. The best way to do this is to have the ship under constant acceleration and basically fly like a jet fighter. People seems to be under some sort of fallacy that modern day fighters have to always be flying upright. Modern fighters can fly in just about any orientation and are limited more by the pilot\u0027s inability to handle G forces than the plane\u0027s ability to fly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t watch the video in the link.
