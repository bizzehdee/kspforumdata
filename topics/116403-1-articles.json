I am aware that this game has severe problems with RAM. However, I have played KSP before with lots of mods before such as KWRocketry, B9 and EVE with ATM of course and it does not crash unless I really strain the system. The strange thing now though is that when i run my backup copies (version 0.25), it no longer works as well with crashes around a minute into the game and more than 4GB RAM usage. I am not sure the problem is due to my PC software, my hardware or the game. I suspect that it is my PC\u0027s fault but have no idea how to verify it and fix it. I have included some file links below. Any help will be greatly appreciated! I can\u0027t wait to start playing this wonderful game again. I think I will try the Opengl method that I saw mentioned elsewhere on the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9HPtOoHBQSkbmNUY3NZRkVndGM/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9HPtOoHBQSkbmNUY3NZRkVndGM/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E (My 1.0.4 Version output_log.
