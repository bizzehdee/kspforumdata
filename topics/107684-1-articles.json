The moment I replace the mbm texture with dds, it seems like the UV maps are in all the wrong place. I have tried using DXT 1 compression with no mipmaps and with mipmaps and het the same result. I have also tried using Paint.Net with the same result. Has anyone else run into this problem? When I get home I\u0027ll post some pictures to show what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore you export dds, flip the texture vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Porkjet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Porkjet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBefore you export dds, flip the texture vertically.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhhhh, ok, I\u0027ll give that a shot.
