The moment I replace the mbm texture with dds, it seems like the UV maps are in all the wrong place. I have tried using DXT 1 compression with no mipmaps and with mipmaps and het the same result. I have also tried using Paint.Net with the same result. Has anyone else run into this problem? When I get home I\u0027ll post some pictures to show what I mean."},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:39:56Z","Content":"Before you export dds, flip the texture vertically."},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:48:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Before you export dds, flip the texture vertically.\n\nOhhhh, ok, I\u0027ll give that a shot.
