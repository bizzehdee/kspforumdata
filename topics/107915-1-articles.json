It works with the ModuleJettison module in the config file, where you name the fairing \u0022object\u0022 or model there. That module hides the model until such time that the bottom node of the engine has a part attached to it, then it spawns the model and activates it. During flight you can manually eject them, or when the bottom node gets decoupled from, the fairing will fall away with the part below automatically. The panels themselves become debris and won\u0027t persist through a reload. Since they are models, the only way to modify their size is to edit them. It\u0027s possible to load the fairings with a separate MODEL {} node in the part config, so they load from their own .mu, which means you can also independently set their scale and locations in the MODEL {} node. I have used this in Novapunch to use one model file for several different parts, you just need a texture that can handle the scaling without looking bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes you can use it on any part that has stack nodes (it doesn\u0027t have to be the bottom node, you can specify it in the ModuleJettison module config) and you can use the module to eject any sort of model you want, it doesn\u0027t have to be a fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, its not really a \u0022functional\u0022 fairing but for most of the currently implemented engine fairings, the difference it would make to drag performance would be negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual interstage fairings would be wonderful at some point though, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T18:27:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*Smart stuff goes here*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent, thank you for the information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was actually thinking of the Odin/Thor/Huginn fairing model while asking!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
