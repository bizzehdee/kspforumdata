I may just designate it as a fuel tank and allow people to stack them. If not then I will probably make it an emissive part, so it\u0027ll get hotter and glow the higher the throttle. as for the exhaust, I\u0027d really like to try to get a semi-massive violent roaring trail, bigger than the 909. this is meant to attach to 1.25 meter parts. all in all the whole thing comes in at a generous but modest ~3000 faces, so this baby is going to look as smooth contoured in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know anything about the warp mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T02:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T04:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as a version is ready for testing, I want to test it.
