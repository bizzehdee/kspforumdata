It was precisely located between the chair and the keyboard. Your message pointed me to the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I installed Karbonite, I thought the /UmbraSpaceIndustries/ level was a mistake and put the /Karbonite/ folder directly into GameData (so I had a \u003Cem\u003EGameData/Karbonite/ \u003C/em\u003Estructure). When I opened (for the 50th time this week) the \u003Cem\u003EKA_AtmScoop_125_01.cfg\u003C/em\u003E file, I noticed it was pointing to the model in \u003Cem\u003EGameData/\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUmbraSpaceIndustries\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E/Karbonite/\u003C/em\u003E...etc instead of \u003Cem\u003EGameData/Karbonite/\u003C/em\u003E...etc. All the models that were not affected by the issue did not have this line, the model was affected by some other code somewhere. This is why it did not behave well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooooooooo I put the /Karbonite/ folder into a nice, brand new and shiny /UmbraSpaceIndustries/ folder, added more boosters and poof! it all sorted itself out.
