Okay so I have KSP through steam and have the latest updates and everything and not modded game at all. The sound folder in the local KSP file on my computer is empty. I dont know if thats normal? Ive uninstalled and re-installed twice with no effect on the sound whats so ever. Also, the sound didnt work in the last build before the 1.00 update. Id be happy to answer any more details if needed! Thanks so much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi fsadr, please download the latest DirectX from Microsoft and install it, this issue has been traced to a bad DirectX install \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118975-1-0-2-no-sound-on-Win-7-x64-Not-Steam\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118975-1-0-2-no-sound-on-Win-7-x64-Not-Steam\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
