You get a card by \u0022constructing\u0022 a rocket in a downcard deck infront of you. You can start multiple ones. They have to contain a command module and at least one engine and fuel tank. They can contain structural elements. If it is you turn you have to play 1 to 3 cards onto those decks. You can also \u0022launch\u0022 one rocket per turn. At the launch a number of 6-dice is rolled and if that number exeeds your total structural value your rocket explodes and you gain nothing. But if you get a sucessful mission you get a location card of your choice which you can \u0022reach\u0022 with your delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have kerbal cards, those can have a positive or negative impact on structural value instead of the command pods (which then have a crew requirement).
