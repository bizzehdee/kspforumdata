NASA actually considered entry to start at 122 km for shuttles, because that\u0027s where atmospheric drag became noticeable and control surfaces started working (that\u0027s when the shuttles stopped using RCS and started using aerodynamic controls). In KSP, an orbit at 70 km will last forever; on Earth, an orbit at 101 km will not last a single orbit, and any orbit below 300 km will only last days. It\u0027s not really accurate to compare 69 km in KSP with 100 km on Earth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, the definition of \u0022space\u0022 for real life, and for KSP, are not the same, but I will point out a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could orbit in theory, with a low enough drag coefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital period for earth is about 90 minutes, so you\u0027d have to go 90 minutes without drag bringing you PE down too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, what altitude can you \u0022orbit\u0022 kerbin at for 90 minutes.... at least with stock aero, it seems to be more than 40km (I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll even make 1x 30 minute orbit, maybe I need to fire it up to test this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think an orbit of 68km will last for days in KSP either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use 40km for KSP, and 122 km for real life, its still about 3x smaller instead of approximately 2x smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn RL, you have to consider how long an orbit will be stable, on the oder of weeks for most cases, in KSP, if its stable for a few hours (maybe longer? I really am not sure how long a 68x68 km orbit will last), its stable forever. I wouldn\u0027t use the engine limitations to argue the thickness of KSP\u0027s atmosphere relative to RL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*When* KSP is modelling atmospheric drag, it seems to be modelling an atmosphere that is much thicker relative to its planet\u0027s diameter than ours is, and I think its about a factor of 3, as opposed to the ~1/10th of the actual celestial objects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, the Apollo missions, prior to trans lunar injection, went to an orbit of 185km, which is less than 3x the height of kerbin\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebdito: That summary is nice, but its also worth noting that things in KSP are unrealistically heavy. RL rockets engines have a much much higher TWR, the chemical rockets can get better ISPs (H2 LOX fuelled), and the mass fraction for entire stages varies between 13:1 and 17:1, when the best tanks in KSP (with no engines or anything) are only 9:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it took a lot of engineering to get parts to those specs, but in KSP, we don\u0027t engineer the parts, we plan missions with the performance of the parts available to use. Our parts performance is sub par compared to what Apollo had, of course, as your diagram shows, this is offset by the required dV being much less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt \u0022somewhat\u0022 balanced out in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll note that the Saturn V was essentiall 2 stage to orbit*, which is quite hard to do with any reasonable payload fraction in KSP (at least before the nasa parts release, and buffing of the mainsail and skipper)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The third stage was needed to get to orbit, but the vast majority of the burn time on the third stage was for trans lunar injection\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T17:40:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
