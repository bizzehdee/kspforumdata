At the moment I\u0027m having a bad time with my mun base and other landed craft. For no reason, my structures keep ending up under the surface so I have to track down a previous save game and hope that I can return them to their original altitude. With Git, I could go through the commits to the point of time when the structures end up under the surface and restore them and save me a few hours of rapid disassembly while I try and find it\u0027s original altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to write a simple plugin that will fire a git commit command when a game is saved so I don\u0027t have to remember to do it manually. Then if things start teleporting into the planet or other odd nastiness happens to ruin the game, I can hunt through the version history and restore the original altitudes thus rescuing my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said I\u0027m a LAMP developer, working on linux, some python experience so the transition to C# hopefully won\u0027t be that painless.
