A lot of these lag issues are in relation to RPM not this mod which will get an upgrade in the next couple of days, so be sure to [**grab it**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471-1-0-RasterPropMonitor-still-putting-the-A-in-IVA) with MOARdV puts it out."},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T00:02:53Z","Content":"i said about the windows mod, not KPS ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhedd","CreatedById":112088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T02:45:42Z","Content":"I\u0027m liking the science IVA so far!
