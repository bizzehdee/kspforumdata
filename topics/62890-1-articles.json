Cant seem to find a newbie modder posting area so I\u0027ll ask this here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm currently working on a 4 way engine mount for spaceplanes loosely based on the air intake with engine mount from the B9 pack (except with integrated fuel tank etc. The problem im having is best illustrated by this picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6Scia/42f3302140.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002242f3302140.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving trouble finding any info on the web of how to solve this particular problem and get both parts to face the correct way. Just fyi, this is in SPH 2x symmetry in surface attachment mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any thoughts? im sure its something im missing in the CFG. hopefully not in the model itself because getting all that right took a good minute. haha. Thanks in advance for any advice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
