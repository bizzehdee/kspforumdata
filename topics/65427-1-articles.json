I always attach them to my fairings to make them decouple in the upper atmosphere. The fuel breakers are really nice, too; they\u0027re handy for sending tanks full of fuel to orbiting re-fueling stations because it prevents your final stages from consuming the fuel meant for the station.

It monitors whatever fuel tank it\u0027s connected to and performs an action (staging, action group, or play a sound) when it\u0027s empty. Very useful. The mod also has a bunch of other parts beyond that. The information in the OP here is a bit out of date. For example, the altimeter doesn\u0027t only work on descent any more. It can be used to, as Hyperbob pointed out, jettison your fairings or extend antennas when your craft hits a specific altitude during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we\u0027ve got another release coming soon that fixes a couple of bugs and adds tweakable staging and thrust to the fuel valve.
