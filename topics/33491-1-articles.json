Hope everyone is keeping the explosions and random premature staging down to a minimum (Or go crazy with it, If that\u0027s what you prefer, But honestly, Think of all those dead little green guys... Think of Jeb) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairly new to KSP in general, Tried the game out through a friends recommendation. And loved it. Anyways, Ended up buying the game due to the sheer amount of time I expected myself to spend in it, not to mention that I have been having a blast (quite literally in some cases) And it, Unlike some Steam Early Access games, Seems to have a extremely large amount of potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far my accomplishments list is rather small, Mainly getting a ship into a sustained circular orbit around Kerbin, And returning. Next is to set up a small refueling station for my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn visits at a later date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways. Looking forward to causing chaos with you all... And hell, Possibly even launch some rockets in the meantime. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-17T22:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2013 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by FallenAdvent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T18:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
