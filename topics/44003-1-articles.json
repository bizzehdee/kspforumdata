My high school physics course was quite sad on several levels; while the unit of physics I took in college, from an endearingly goofy Cajun tennis player, was fun but very watered-down for us hardcore liberal arts types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince neither my father nor my brother enjoyed physics much either, or ever got that far in it (even though they were science majors themselves: chemistry and biology respectively) I had half-decided it was hopeless to try to learn. Maybe there was even some bizarre genetic defect at work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying Kerbal Space Program, off and on for the past 14 months, has changed my attitude utterly.
