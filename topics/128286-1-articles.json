I suggest you install RCS Build Aid and look at the \u0022engine\u0022 tab. The yellow arrows will show you the thrust vector of each engine and, in the RCS Build Aid panel, you\u0027ll see there is a HUUUUUGE torque applied to your craft (it will be shown by a big, red, circle-shaped arrow, showing the direction of the torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy shuttle can use the SSME for taking off the runway, only if I disable the top engine (I don\u0027t use the OMS either). For this, I have made sure the 2 bottom engines are centered and lined up with the CoM and DCoM (Dry CoM = CoM when fuel tanks are empty).

I only replaced your Hitchiker module by a rockomax tank (the 720 units of fuel version), so I could balance the CoM to make the shuttle stable at an angle of 40\u00B0 to 50\u00B0 above prograde vector during reentry. Then I pour every bit of fuel, monoprop and stuff at the front to make sure it won\u0027t flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, your OMS shows some intriguing caracteristics. Its angle may generate a downwards drag that could tend to pull the aft down. Also, it could weight a lot, pulling the CoM back too much. By choosing lighter engines, empty tanks and removing the adapter, you\u0027ll have a much lighter OMS. You may then be able to push your wings front a little so the CoL is not too far back, re-balancing the whole thing. That may help solving some problems there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook how far front are my shuttle\u0027s wings. CoM is farther to the front too, due to a heavy Cupola module at the front of the hold, and a tank. -\u0026gt;\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128220-satellite-retrieval-with-space-shuttle/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128220-satellite-retrieval-with-space-shuttle/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T19:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell first, I do use OMS engines because I want the realism too.\u00A0 3 Vectors and 2 Thuds(not thumpers, my bad) \u00A0for OMS. \u00A0I don\u0027t care about whether the SSMEs flip the shuttle, because I only use them when the EFT is still there. \u00A0What I care about are the OMS engines, although that doesn\u0027t concern me too much either because I wouldn\u0027t want to use them in atmosphere like reentry. \u00A0The only thing I said about them flipping me around was that they did so much more than they do normally. \u00A0Also, I don\u0027t know what I could take off that wouldn\u0027t sacrifice the realism, as far as engines or the adapter. \u00A0But I\u0027m kind of getting confused with what you\u0027re suggesting, so, with realism in mind, that being that I don\u0027t wanna remove anything that would take away from the look, what do you recommend I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnakyLeVrai","CreatedById":135852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T20:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can replace the Thuds by Terriers, that\u0027ll help shifting the CoM forward a little and you\u0027ll be able to pitch the nose down a bit.

If we forget about the SRBs and ET for a second and instead replace your cargo hold with fuel tanks and try to launch that then you will have on your hands a winged rocket with excessively high TWR\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGive point 1 above, your cockpit and hitchhiker are insufficiently heavy to counterbalance the weight of the engines, which is why you see a CoM that is clearly towards the back of the craft\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGiven point 2 above, you need a lot of lift at the back which means big delta wings at the back. This then results in control surfaces mounted in a position that makes them hard to control pitch\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint 1 and 2 are easy so let\u0027s talk a bit more about point 3. If you imagine your fuselage as a lever with the CoM as the fulcrum, the control surfaces is then the torque that can be applied to this lever to make it rotate about its fulcrum. With say your average subsonic passenger jet the CoM is somewhere close to the middle of the fuselage. This means the control surfaces on the tail have a very large amount of mechanical leverage so only a small amount of torque needs to be applied to make the plane pitch up or down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your case the CoM is towards the back and your control surfaces are also at the back of the plane attached to the delta wings. This puts the torque very close to the fulcrum with a very small leverage, which means huge amount of force must be applied by your control surfaces to pitch up or down. So all else equal this design doesn\u0027t have much pitch control authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow when you use large AoA during reentry what you\u0027re doing is deliberate put the wings in a stalled state to generate drag. Whilst this is good idea for slowing down and spreading out the heat load it also means you\u0027re further reducing your pitch authority since your control surfaces will also be in a stalled state along with the wings. So once it\u0027s time to transition to level flight they generate very little torque to pitch the nose down, hence you continue to fall belly first.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe solution to this is canards. Canards won\u0027t help you with point 1 or point 2 (well they do actually, but not enough to matter), but they do help with point 3 since they will be at the very front of the craft a very long distance away from the CoM so they enjoy a very large mechanical leverage for pitch control. Having canards at the front also means you are now generating more lift at the front of the plane during level flight, which means you could move your main wings and the big control surfaces further back on the fuselage if you want to maintain the current CoL, which then further increases their leverage and pitch control. If you don\u0027t want to ruin the shuttle look clip your canards inside your cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had to struggle long and hard with this same \u0022CoM on the ass end\u0022 problem recently with an even more extreme example than your shuttle:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zipnqd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/zipnqd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo even more engine than your shuttle and even less weight at the front than you as it\u0027s unmanned. Finally managed to make it fly nose first in lower atmosphere by:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMaking the front heavier by using the SLS tank at the front. SLS tank is 9 tons when empty, much heavier than an empty mark 3 tank\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAttach canards all the way at the very tip of the craft for extreme leverage\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCoM quite far in front of CoL, making it excessively stable.
