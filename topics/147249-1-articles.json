Since this was already the 2nd career I played, I did not just want to send a probe. No, Jeb was gonna go. I tried and failed many times. The 1st one flipped in Eve\u0027s atmosphere\u00A0and burned up, 2nd one was just crap in every way, 3rd one flipped again, 4th one landed but had not enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to get off Eve (super frustrating, as it was really close), and the 5th one was finally the good design. It needed some more tweaking to make sure it did not flip (because during test flights I was not satisfied yet) so I put some giant wings with Airbrakes on it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI present you, the Eve lander Mk5, aka \u0022The Moose\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224cf2Xpd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4cf2Xpd.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was not enthusiastic to fly this thing. 997 parts, 21 stages, 58.9 m high. Total cost 1,200,441 funds. No mods except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E. Regular career (normal settings). It launched at 4 frames per second, which dropped a little more as aero forces kicked in a little higher up. It remained playable though (FYI, I have a 4-core Intel i5-4570 CPU with 8 GB of RAM, and a GeForce GT 640,\u00A0running Linux Mint 17.1, so not an expensive system, but\u00A0a light operating system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022z4LYUAU.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z4LYUAU.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the enormous drag on the top of the rocket, it was easy on the throttle and straight up until at least 10 km.\u00A0By 25 km, it was still going mostly upwards. The bottom stage consisted of the SRBs, the big tanks you see separated below and the central bottom stage (blue vectors you see below together with a central mammoth). The liquid tanks were staged in with fuel lines to the central one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lkRQvVQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lkRQvVQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen\u00A0the four mainsails with orange tanks were the 2nd stage which carried it to orbit. They had roughly 500 m/s worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left when it got to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Below, The Moose is already accelerating to get to the transfer orbit towards Eve when it finally sheds the last big engines (and due to the heat of the sepatrons\u00A0blows up a small liquid fuel tank at the top of the mothership, as you can see by the cloud of dust).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229M4Zi3w.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9M4Zi3w.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMother Goose and Goose Lander then made it to Eve with little problem. The Nerv stage had\u00A0over 2500 m/s, which is easily enough to get to Eve. And since it would shed the enormous lander, would have about 3000 m/s for the return trip too. The huge lander was attached by only a docking point Jr (and MANY struts), because I only wanted to bring down the smallest docking port to Eve\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice that the periapsis of both lander and mothership is 69000 m at the time of separation. The lander used NO engines... so the mothership slowed it down into a low periapsis, and then quickly accelerated again in order to not burn up in Eve\u0027s atmosphere. Since the lander was already on the right course, it could just deploy its heat shield, and wait for the fireworks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wOsxdG6.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wOsxdG6.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow you can see the antlers of The Moose a bit better. They had to be this huge because the lander has some stabilizing fins at its bottom which stick out from the heatshield, making the bottom drag even bigger. (Sure, this could have been fixed by just making the bottom more narrow, but remember that in my previous attempt I did not have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E - I was gonna bring the big engines to Eve this time).

Not sure if it is interesting, but here\u0027s a picture of the antlers coming off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222aikZlh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2aikZlh.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd one of the\u00A0parachutes. They slowed down the lander to a blistering 8 or 9 m/s, which was more than I had anticipated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224v9OfiI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4v9OfiI.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rough landing broke off 7 of the 8 the landing gear, but nothing else. The 8th one then decided to join its friends a little while later, so below you see exactly none.\u00A0It was a perfect landing!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SUrg01d.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SUrg01d.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the whole point of the entire mission was to have Jeb do the \u003Cs\u003EMun-\u003C/s\u003EEve-walk and plant that flag. Picture below shows Jeb, but also shows the first stage of the lander. Yes, that\u0027s nearly 100 sepatrons. I want to give that lander a quick boost, then go easy through the thick soup of Eve, before accelerating at higher altitudes. So I put on a stage that burns for only 5 seconds. I put them on small tanks. The entire first stage (tanks and sepatrons) comes off after 5-6 seconds. Probably a bit unnecessary though... luckily, the framerate remained ok.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I didn\u0027t fully realize how big that lander was until Jeb climbed out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y7leVwl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y7leVwl.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, here\u0027s the mandatory Jeb-picture-with-lander-in-the-background:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QdCkIBw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QdCkIBw.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had mounted some extra batteries and reaction wheels at the base of the lander. I sepated some time before take off. I think those parts are what blows up on liftoff. I wasn\u0027t missing any parts on the lander... It happened on every attempt I made to reach orbit (I must have tried at least 30 times). Made for a good show though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll pics below are not from the actual launch. I forgot to take screenshots. So, I loaded the save-game from right before launch, and did it again just now, for this post. I did not play through all the way until docking, so headings and velocities may be slightly off from here onwards, but this attempt made it close to orbit before the game crashed... at least it shows how the thing works, if anyone cares. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D4PAEcC.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D4PAEcC.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the sepatrons already come off, at just 139 m above the surface.

Upon separation, they moved slightly inwards (due to the thick atmosphere), and crashed into the central tank. 9 out of 10 attempts, this was the reason to reset and try again. To overcome this, I had to keep the velocity under 300 m/s on separation, go straight up, perfectly prograde, throttle to zero, separate, and throttle to max quickly again. The problem did not occur on Kerbin testflights.
