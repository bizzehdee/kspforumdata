Get your periapsis near (or right on, really) its periapsis, wait for it to enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI and then burn at your periapsis until your encounter markers match up. The problem there is you\u0027ve got a TON of dV to scrub to bring the orbit down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be too hard though to slow it down just enough so it\u0027s captured by Kerbin, and then you can burn at apoapsis to slow it down to do an aerobrake or somesuch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem with that, you need to do everything quickly as you scream past periapsis. My method, I could take several in-game days and pay almost no dV penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T03:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick (for me at least) is in the launch: you want to line up with the asteroid\u0027s hyperbolic trajectory as best as you can and in the correct direction. After orbit has been established, match the inclination, and burn somewhere around where the periapse of the asteroid is closest to your orbit (use maneuver nodes to tweak what angle will be optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second trick is in the timing of the burn - you want to match up with it as close as possible as you expand your orbit outwards towards the asteroid\u0027s path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arcamean","CreatedById":109710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T22:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I\u0027m not well versed in what to do once you\u0027ve caught the darn things (I\u0027m like a dog chasing a car)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh I love it... favorite quote thus far in the year.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
