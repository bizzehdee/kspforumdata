This 1x1 placeholder is then swapped for the full size texture later using the \u0027texture=\u0027 argument of the MODEL{} call. You need the placeholder because if a .mu is not initially loaded with a texture, you can\u0027t swap or introduce one later when the config is parsed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/34013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E0.20 part tools thread\u003C/a\u003E has descriptions of the MODEL{} call functionality\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-23-Last-update-24th-Jan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModding Information\u003C/a\u003E thread also has several MODEL{} links with examples\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T03:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 03:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NoMrBond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garibaldi2257","CreatedById":98008,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T03:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eahhh, so one texture does work, so long as the models all have different names. roger that. would that reduce the cpu/gpu footprint for loading?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T04:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, textures are (relatively) large so texture sharing helps reduce your mods memory footprint which is always appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
