Generally, how long video encoding takes depends almost entirely on how fast your cpu is. Some encoding software are able to use GPUs and there are purpose built hardware encoders, but I think looking into either isn\u0027t worth the hassle/cost if heavy encoding isn\u0027t something you do regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ecat","CreatedById":68747,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T11:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@op\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload the trial of Sony Movie Studio and test it for yourself: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/download/trials/moviestudio\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/download/trials/moviestudio\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an ideal world you may be best served by a 12 thread i7 processor but in my limited experience, i5 \u002B amd hd6950, I gained quite an increase when using the GPU with certain codecs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
