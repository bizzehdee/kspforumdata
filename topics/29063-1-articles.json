So far I\u0027ve only been toying with designs around Kerbin and its moons, but it\u0027s pretty strong at Kerbin, even in low to middle orbits. When looking skyward, though, I think there\u0027s been a bit of a performance \u003Cem\u003Eincrease\u003C/em\u003E, so it does seem to be associated with terrain, and land terrain at that. In fact, as I watched a capsule come in for a splashdown at sea, it ran smoothly unless I rotated the camera to catch an island in the background, which caused my frame rate to slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackHammer_89","CreatedById":48071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T22:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also experiencing this phenomenon.
