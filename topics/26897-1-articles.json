For example, if you need a maneuver to add 200 m/s delta-V, you can do one burn to add 100 m/s, then wait for your orbit to bring you back around and do a second burn to add the remaining 100 m/s. It\u0027s an efficient way to accurately do maneuvers that require very large delta-V, or more accurately that require very long burn times (since, as has been mentioned, maneuver nodes assume you get the entire impulse right at T-0, which is for obvious reasons impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen somewhere a neat graphic depicting the orbit at each stage of a maneuver done with a dozen or so Pe kicks, but I\u0027m not sure where to find it and Googling \u0022Pe kicks\u0022 just wants to sell me Nikes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T22:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone else can explain the \u0027why\u0027 a little clearer than me, I\u0027m sure, but here goes. 1) the closer to your Pe you are, the less energy it takes to raise your Ap (I believe this is the Oberth Effect). 2) the closer your burn is to your proper ejection angle, the more accurate your trajectory will be.
