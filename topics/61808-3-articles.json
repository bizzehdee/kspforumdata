I\u0027ll try to explain, in the context of this topic. Let\u0027s say we don\u0027t apprehend reality directly through our senses, we form mental concepts that correspond to the real objects. The purpose of the scientific method is then to strip those concepts of anything that can\u0027t be described mathematically, not to know the objects in themselves, beyond our mental concepts (that\u0027s the role of philosophy, by the way). For instance, when we conceptualize an electron as a subatomic particle with negative charge, that\u0027s not all the electron is in reality, that\u0027s just all we need to describe it mathematically to understand a particular phenomenon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWith you so far.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lodestar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lodestar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor instance, think of a soda can and a piece of curtain rod, both made of aluminum. They may be made of the same atoms, have the same mass, and many other properties, but there\u0027s one fundamental difference about them that doesn\u0027t actually have physical existence, their form. The ideal form of a soda can and a piece of curtain rod can exist in our minds independently of any matter. So, we could divide reality in things that can be fully described mathematically without a residue, and things that can\u0027t be described without their forms, or in other words, without a corresponding mental concept, what Descartes called res extensae and res cogitas.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EForm can exist without matter.

I also don\u0027t see how form is not part of an objects physical existence; the form of a piece of metal has a huge influence on its electric properties, for example. I suppose that is because I treat form and shape as synonyms, right? Form is more the idea of an object?

Every pure state is a superposition in a suitably chosen basis, so superposition/no superposition is not a good distinction to make. The post-collapse situation, on the other hand, would be a mixed state. Pure and mixed states can be distinguished rigorously (in calculations and in repeatable experiments).

With that, take a deuterium atom (not regular hydrogen, we want to ignore the core\u0027s spin). We are only really interested in the electron.

You will find it in a (partially) mixed state consisting of the two ground states. The process by which this happens is that the atom emits one or two photons and decays into the ground state directly or indirectly. What happens to the photons almost does not matter; the one thing you cannot do is feed them back to the atom by, say, putting it into a cavity. If they are caught by some matter, if you measure them, if they escape to infinity, if they crash into the moon: the atom will be in a mixed state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you explain that?

The only thing I could come up with is starting with 6\u002B1 Minkovsky space, then forcing the universe to a rotating 3\u002B1 subspace. This leads to the effective metric (ds)^2 = (dr)^2 - (c^2-(omega r)^2) dt^2... which has a naked singularity at r = c/omega with euclidean space on the other side. Not a horrible singularity, wave equations work just fine, but still, objects approaching it from our side are violently squished.

It also can\u0027t be rotation of General Relativity Spacetime in some external space, GR only cares about internal properties and would just ignore an external rotation. The only thing I could come up with is starting with 6\u002B1 Minkovsky space, then forcing the universe to a rotating 3\u002B1 subspace. This leads to the effective metric (ds)^2 = (dr)^2 - (c^2-(omega r)^2) dt^2... which has a naked singularity at r = c/omega with euclidean space on the other side. Not a horrible singularity, wave equations work just fine, but still, objects approaching it from our side are violently squished. And as the centrifugal force pushes everything out, we should be able to observe such events, even though they happen at huuuge redshifts (the huge energy produced offsets that)...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you\u0027re considering only the rotation around one axis, leaving aside the movement corresponding to the Earth\u0027s rotation tilt. The universe would be more like a gyroscope that wobbles when it begins to tilt than a carousel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you\u0027re again trying to eat your cake and keep it. The Lense-Thirring effect translated to a purely newtonian universe would in fact be merely an axial component in the centrifugal force, that pulls toward the equator of the rotating sphere, in addition to the radial component usually associated with centrifugal force. That axial component pivots on the barycenter, the Earth, and keeps coming back to the equatorial plane, just like you\u0027d have orbits precessing around the spin axis or the orbited body. Thirring himself, while inadvertently providing a geocentric model, showed how all the forces unresolved by Newtonian, centrifugal, coriolis, etc, are present in the same way in a rotating universe with a central Earth due to that axial component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I think trying to explain the Lense-Thirring effect as frame-dragging is pretty much just another attempt to save face, giving a space-time cause to something that can be explained with a purely physical cause if you admit an absolute frame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the context of the discussion here, we\u0027re considering the option where General Relativity is completely left out of the picture, since we\u0027re saying there\u0027s an absolute reference frame. IF there\u0027s no absolute reference frame, then who is stationary and who is spinning around is merely a choice of reference frames. I think you\u0027re complicating things, because if GR is valid, then that has to be valid too. However, Sungenis claims even geocentrism with an absolute rest frame in the form of an anisotropic center still works even in GR as a mirror image, with the Lema\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ADtre-Tolman-Bondi metric, with Earth in the center of the sphere, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou are going to tell me that\u0027s the microwave background, aren\u0027t you?

Let\u0027s say we can establish a reasonably recent status quaestionis from this 2006 study by Bell and McDiarmid on the SDSS catalog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603169\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603169\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it concludes some of the peaks are selection effects, it acknowledges they can\u0027t account for all of them. Then we have Schneider\u0027s study of 2007, claiming all of the peaks in the 2006 study were indeed selection effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0806\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0806\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, we have Hartnett\u0027s study of 2008, claiming that Schneider et al. actually also introduced another selection effect when filtering data, and there\u0027s indeed a periodicity in the SDSS quasar redshift data. However, he saw a correlation between that and the zConf parameter in the SDSS tables, and his conclusion is that whatever their cause, they are fundamentally connected, so it\u0027s safe to assume that the remaining peaks are indeed another selection effect, to be properly identified, but probably originated in the algorithm used by the SDSS to define the zConf parameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3833.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3833.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s still far from solving it as a blip. Since I couldn\u0027t find any response to Hartnett, I decided to investigate the correlation myself on the SDSS public database. Curiously, the zConf parameter that correlates with the peaks is the redshift estimate confidence. When you plot the fourier frequency for the whole database, the peaks aren\u0027t significant, but as you increase the estimate confidence, filtering data out, the peaks become more and more accentuated. At this point, the obvious question is, what\u0027s really wrong with that correlation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s indeed a redshift uniformity in reality, then it will become more proeminent as you increase the confidence of the data and remove noise. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with that. Obviously, there could be something wrong with the algorithm determining zConf, but it\u0027s quite a coincidence. If the confidence factor has a correlation with the result, you don\u0027t like the result, you throw doubt on the confidence factor? That\u0027s almost like making the universe looking like everywhere is the center when some observations shows you are in the center and you don\u0027t like that. I\u0027ve seen that before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, it\u0027s worth mentioning that Hartnett first submitted his study in 2007 and published it in 2008 with the title \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRedshift periodicity in quasar number counts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, but actually he doesn\u0027t mention the conclusion that this is due to a correlation with the zConf parameter anywhere. As a matter of fact, his conclusion is that there\u0027s significant periodicity, regardless of the interpretation, the exact opposite conclusion. He changed it in a 2009 revision. The issue seems volatile enough even for a single author. Sungenis quotes the first revision on his book, so I\u0027ll even ask him if he\u0027s aware Hartnett reversed the conclusion and what he has to say about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xxx.tau.ac.il/pdf/0712.3833v2.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://xxx.tau.ac.il/pdf/0712.3833v2.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, even if quasar redshift quantization is just a blip, you still have similarly geocentrically oriented phenomena in galaxies, in spectroscopic binaries, in globular clusters, in planetary orbits, in the CMB, etc. If everything is a blip, that\u0027s quite a blip.

Neutrinos are out, they are too light (and would also be hot). Black hole remnants are out, IIRC.

It operates on a finite interval and assumes the data is periodically repeated outside that interval. The redshift histogram, evidently, does not wrap around. We do not know as many quasars with Z = 6 as we do with Z=1. That is the smaller problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem is that, as the data is not normalized against anything, it mostly is a bulk between Z=0 and 2, the area where we have the best chances to actually detect Quasars. The Fourier transform of any such bulk will show maxima at frequencies corresponding to odd multiples of the inverse bulk width. That is just a simple math fact. Take a simple step function (or triangle if you like), Fourier transform it, and you will see those peaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am saying here, bluntly, is that the claimed periodicity is not even a statistical blip or selection effect.

You can\u0027t prove that empirically because you can\u0027t separate a cognizable object from the cogniscent subject, yet, you carry that separation all the time. When you face a phenomena where you actually have to consider the mind having separate existence and the act of knowing as an union between the cognizable object and the cogniscent subject, you\u0027re doomed to fail. Frankly, I don\u0027t know how else to explain it to you. Unfortunately, most people with a scientific education lack the same degree of philosophical training, and they learn the materialistic metaphysics more by osmosis, than by being formally exposed to it, which would also teach its shortcomings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my own personal experience (I used to think like that too), you only get out of that through some sort of cathartic experience. You can\u0027t just reason your way out, because you tend to reason in those terms, like you\u0027re doing here. We call that an epistemic closure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simplification, but maybe it helps. Consider the classic dilemma, if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Your answer probably would be that it does, because the tree will still disturb the air in the same way and produce the same waves in the atmosphere, regardless of anyone being there to hear, right? But disturbances in the air in the form of waves arent\u0027t sound! They are the quantifiable and measurable properties of the phenomena a conscious entity experiences and calls sound, but they are not sound itself. They are completely different things and there\u0027s a chasm between the two that can\u0027t be easily transposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same way, is an apple still red when nobody is watching? Again, you\u0027d probably say yes, because regardless of anyone watching, the apple would still reflect light in the same wavelength, but again, color is one thing, photons of a particular wavelength being reflected are another entirely different thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I guess you\u0027d probably thinking of telling me that sound and color are just illusions, that they don\u0027t really exist, and guess what? I\u0027d have to tell you again that this is precisely what thinking in terms of res extensae means. Maybe you\u0027d ask me to give scientific evidence that they are not just illusions, but in order to provide scientific evidence, I have to reduce the phenomena to their quantifiable properties, and once I do that, it\u0027s obvious the phenomena we\u0027re really interested is outside the scope of science. Once someone begins to think that if something is outside the scope of science then it simply doesn\u0027t exist, that\u0027s what we call scientism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is a simplification, but in a sense, the whole problem with QM is that you\u0027re expecting the tree to fall and make a sound also when no one is around to hear it, but that obviously doesn\u0027t make sense. When no one is around to hear, the sound only exists in terms of res extensa, in terms of its quantifiable properties, and QM already follows that. The dilemma isn\u0027t really a dilemma at all, because it\u0027s self-contradictory.

That\u0027s why Newton couldn\u0027t explain centrifugal and coriolis force, because he always considered only isolated systems. It only appears when you add the mass of the universe revolving around, and it appears with an axial component.

Since it was thought that General Relativity would fill all the gaps from newton\u0027s laws, Thirring himself thought he would find a relativistic explanation, and he did, but not realizing that to reach it, he also found a newtonian explanation in an Earth-centered universe.

Third, that seems too fundamental to be overlooked by people who were looking for a solution to the problem for decades. If the problem is a fundamental error in the analysis method, I\u0027d expect most studies to agree on the results, and then some study reveal that embarrassing error. That\u0027s not what happens.
