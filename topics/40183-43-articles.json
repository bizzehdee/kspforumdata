I have tried to get them as good as possible. But remember the Thermal Nozzles don\u0027t cost what they say in the description. Once you place the part the real value will show up and be charged. Also the Plasma Engines might seem wrong. (the smaller ones are more expensive then larger ones) but the smaller ones have the Most ISP vs the Bigger ones.

So maybe its to expensive for those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also make your own missions with custom contracts if you wish. Try it out and give me the heads up on what it cost and stuff.
