Since I like Kerbin a lot, and often do science missions that require me to travel very long distances, I designed a high-speed 3 engine bird, called the Traveler (needs a better name, I think):\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://static.dyp.im/Thbz3OBkGP/cf405a7380dfd38f29c6ed6a9586d229.png\u0022]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]https://static.dyp.im/Thbz3OBkGP/large/cf405a7380dfd38f29c6ed6a9586d229.png[/IMG][/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow it flies okay, can recover from any kind of stall (including spin), has a lot of power, and at 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch and 10,000m altitude it can cruise at 500m/s with a range of around 3500km, almost enough to circumnavigate Kerbin. It even has a emergency parachute. Part count is exactly 30, so I don\u0026#39;t even need to upgrade SPH yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only problem is that 5 minutes into cruise mode, it starts overheating. First, the engines, then random parts all over. If nothing is done, engines explode after around 20min or so.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI thought the smart thing would be to add small radiators in a way that would add as little drag as possible. However, radiators are the first to overheat, and in the end, seem to be doing nothing to prevent engine overheat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have not yet unlocked precoolers or any of the fancy stuff. I know I could just throttle down, but that would defeat the purpose of the plane.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny ideas on how I can keep the engine temperature down at low tech level?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:53:56Z","Content":"\nThrottling down does sound like the best option. I\u0026#39;d speculate you can go to 80-90% throttle and that will do the trick, any speed drop will be small.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aluc24","CreatedById":152712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:57:55Z","Content":"\nI tried throttling down one notch, and it brings the speed to 400m/s, requiring higher pitch-up, ruining fuel economy due to unsustainable altitude.
