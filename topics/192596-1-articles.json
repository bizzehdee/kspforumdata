Hmmm, sandbox mode ...\u003Cbr\u003E\nO.K. Apparently in sandbox mode the deployed science does not transmit.

My experience is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOn Kerbin: if you set up the station close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, then the discarded boosters will gather the full science over time. (Even if it is in small increments.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn small-ish planetoids without atmosphere (Mun, Ike, and smaller), just crashing obsolete parts (the transfer stages for trans-Munar or trans-Duna injection, old landers, etc.) into them collected the full science.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDuna and Eve were a larger problem: on Duna I got it by crashing a streamlined rocket from its Kerbin transfer close-ish to the sensor. Eve was the usual pain in the posterior: anything from the orbit either explodes or gets slowed down to terminal velocity in Eve\u0027s souposphere. Winged cruise-missiles that filled up to 315 t total mass by mining on Eve, and then were steered to impact close to the sensor only gave a few percentage points when doing it without \u0022cheating\u0022. When I did the impact at 4x physics warp I got the full science...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done the Joolian moons, Moho, or Eeloo yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-24T11:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197939-ahhans/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197939\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197939-ahhans/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@AHHans\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much for the very detailed response!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
