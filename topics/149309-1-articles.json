I for one would love to have a mode where I could play with my friends, set-up an array of space stations, re-stocking said stations so everyone had stepping stones to go further out in the solar system, being able to establish\u00A0communication up-links\u00A0ahead of your friend launching a rover mission to Duna....and so on. The possibilities are endless, but resources are obviously not. Especially at the moment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we need more in the game before MP becomes a must have, maybe. I think they need to implement some of the mods as permanent features of the game, such as TAC life support,\u00A0Remote Tech and many other realistic mods that would make the game challenging for a group of players to tackle. Imagine having to send out a rescue mission to save one of your friend\u0027s crew from freezing in space due to lack of power, or giving your friend access to your mun orbiting station because he burned a little too much fuel during landing an now he can\u0027t get back home. Maybe I\u0027m crazy, but that\u0027s the stuff that I think would make the game exciting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Also what if you could build on\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E on other planets, and in order to do so you would need to ferry\u00A0the resources (at least some) there in order to build it?
