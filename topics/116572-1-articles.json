My mothership doesn\u0027t have enough delta-v to make it out there all in one go, so I\u0027m planet hopping, refueling the craft along the way. This has worked okay so far, and I\u0027m currently en-route to Vall. The next step after my pit stop in the Jool system is transferring out to Sarnus, where I will top up the tanks again at Eeloo. Only thing is, I can\u0027t figure out the Jool --\u003E Sarnus transfer window. Is there any way to calculate this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Assuming that both planets are in circular orbits:\n\nLet\u0027s define some terms:\n\nt1 = the orbital period (length of year) for planet 1\n\nt2 = same deal for planet 2\n\nth = Hohmann transfer time (i.e. half of an ellipse)\n\nAssuming that you know t1 and t2, you can calculate th as follows:\n\n **t****h** **=** **(****(t****1****^(2/3) \u002B t****2****^(2/3)) ^ 1.5****)** **/ sqrt(32)**\n\n\u0022take t1 raised to the 2/3 power, add t2 raised to the 2/3 power, raise the whole shebang to the 1.5 power, and divide by square root of 32\u0022.\n\nNow that you\u0027ve calculated th, you can work out the phase angle for your launch window. I\u0027m assuming here that planet 1 is the inner one and planet 2 is the outer:\n\n **Angle = 180 - (360 \\* t****h** **/ t****2****)**\n\nThis angle is the amount by which planet 1 should be trailing planet 2 at the time that you launch.\n\nJust to show an example, imagine you\u0027re transferring from Kerbin to Duna:\n\nt1 = 426 days (one Kerbin year)\n\nt2 = 802 days (one Duna year)\n\nPlugging in the equation above, this gives us:\n\nth = 301 days\n\nAngle = 180 - (360 \\* 301 / 802) = 44.5 degrees\n\n(meaning \u0022launch when Kerbin is trailing Duna by 44.5 degrees\u0022)\n\nJust to check our math, [http://ksp.olex.biz/](http://ksp.olex.biz/) gives the same answer, so looks like it works out right. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo to solve your problem, just plug in Jool\u0027s year length for t1 and Sarnus\u0027 for t2, and there ya go.\n\nIf you want to know \u0022how long until the launch window happens?\u0022:\n\nThe interval between launch windows, ti, is given by:\n\n**t****i** **= 1 / (1/t****1** **- 1/t****2****)**\n\n(for example, in the Earth/Duna case, ti = 1 / (1/426 - 1/802) = 908 days.)\n\n...so if you look at the map view and see \u0022how many degrees off am I from the launch window\u0022, just take that, divide by 360, and multiply by ti to get the time until launch.\n\nFor example, if you\u0027re going from Kerbin to Duna, and you see that Kerbin trails Duna by 100 degrees right now: well, the target angle is 44.5 degrees (per above discussion), which means you\u0027re 53.5 degrees off, so the time until the window is 908 \\* (53.5/360) = 135 days.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T20:17:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T01:56:34Z","Content":"AFAIK the [Transfer Window Planner](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93115-1-0-x-Transfer-Window-Planner-v1-3-1-0-%28July-19?highlight=transfer\u002Bwindow\u002Bplanner) mod will calculate windows for modified or added planets."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:33:54Z","Content":"so will [KSPTOT](http://bit.ly/KSPTOT), you just have to ask it to generate a new bodies.ini file in the File menu while the game is loaded in the flight scene"}]}
