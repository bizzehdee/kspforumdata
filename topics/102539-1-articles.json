Just ensure that each engine has its own fuel supply (with the same amount of fuel) and that tanks are placed in symmetry. If you must, you can use decouplers to strictly forbid fuel flow (and many parts allow you to disable crossfeed, which will accomplish the same goal). Fuel lines can help as well (to a point anyway). Uneven thrust limiter settings will cause uneven consumption as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T17:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recomend pulling the fuel into a different source, than pull it to the front of craft.
