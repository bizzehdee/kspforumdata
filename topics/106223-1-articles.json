I used KER to check, and the dV values are the same between the two (~1500dV), so I have to wonder what the culprit is here. It could be the engine power nerf (it\u0027s a Rockomax 48-7S, which took a massive hit in thrust), but I\u0027m wondering if anyone else has had issues like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEngines were nerfed, the Mun\u0027s gravity did not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower thrust means more losses to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers have lower Isp, which also means less dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the thing, though: the losses due to gravity on an airless body should be minimal with an efficient landing sequence, even with lower TWR. Indeed, the best fuel margins I managed were around 2% with that lander in 1.0, slowing down horizontally at periapsis and only having to fight gravity for 1.5km. That doesn\u0027t really add up, particularly since a similar level of fuel use with the previous version of that engine handled over 5km vertical speed killed. The ISP was not changed for the engine at all, as I noted with the dV rating for the craft being identical between the two versions. A TWR drop from ~5 to ~2.5 should not result in a 15% increase in dV required to land. That pretty much just leaves the Mun\u0027s gravity as the culprit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the 48-7S got a hefty hit to Isp as well... 300s now instead of 350s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter check the stats in the VAB - Kerbal Engineer may simply be calculating it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably the engine still.
