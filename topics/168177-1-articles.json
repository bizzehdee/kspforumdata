Sure enough, any angle of attack other than zero is a detriment to this craft\u0027s performance. It needs to be kept pointing as close to prograde as you can get it to get any speed beyond Mach 1 out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could get it to orbit though, with (I think) just over 4500 m/s delta-v remaining (4505 / 8680 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and 110 / 1320 OX).

Didn\u0027t exceed more than 4 degrees angle of attack, but steadily climbed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think my AP was at or near 50 km when the Rapiers cut out. The two front tanks had oxidizer switched off; I think this was for a boost at Duna takeoff.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Prograde Hold and use full Nuke thrust until AP hits 75 km.
