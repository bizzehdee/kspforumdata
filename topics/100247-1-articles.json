Could someone lock the old one?)\n\nKSP is crashing as soon as I click Start Game on the main screen. My computer completely hangs and only mouse input works, nothing else. I can\u0027t Alt\u002BTab or type.\n\nHere\u0027s a video of the situation. I\u0027m sorry about the quality, I needed to record it on a camera because I couldn\u0027t use a screen capture utility.
