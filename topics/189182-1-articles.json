I\u0027ve tried verifying the game, reinstalling completely (and verifying again), and sacrificing a goat to the Kraken, none of which has resolved the issue. My install is completely unmodded, and I\u0027ve never subscribed to a ksp workshop mod. Also the game starts in a tiny window which I have to manually fullscreen (EDIT: fullscreening in the launcher didn\u0027t help the issue) , but the menu buttons don\u0027t work in either state. The menu buttons will highlight normally when moused over, but don\u0027t do anything. When I try to select them with the arrow keys and press enter, the button stays grayed out.
