(Not for slow hovers with a VTOL vehicle.)

Use the number for the highest valued propulsion installed, which must be active during the flight under the bridge. The propulsion scored must be the primary motive power at the time of the passage, so simply sticking a couple of Seperatrons on a prop plane doesn\u0027t score 700 points. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T06:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhh, there\u0027s already a very similar challenge going on, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53489-Bridging-the-research-gap-Challenge-%28AKA-flying-under-the-bridge%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ojimak\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
