The only problem is, I\u0027m having trouble getting my ship to that other ship. I still don\u0027t understand the concept of what happens when you click on the other ship and click \u0022set as target\u0022 besides the fact that it tells you its orbital plane\u0027s intersections with your own. Is there any way to go about doing this, by perhaps synchronizing your orbit with the other ship\u0027s orbit? Or is there an easier way to do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T14:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wrote a tutorial and made a video about just that: Launch, rendezvous, and docking.

These are your \u0022intercept\u0022 points, the points where the orbits of the source and target crafts cross one another. They\u0027ll also tell you what the distance between the two craft will be at those points. Your job is to get that value down...within 1.0 km if you\u0027re just doing a rendezvous, all the way to zero if you\u0027re going to try to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also see two markers labeled \u0022An\u0022 and \u0022Dn\u0022. These are the ascending and descending nodes, respectively; when your reach the ascending node, your craft\u0027s orbit will begin travelling northward of the target\u0027s and vice versa. For a successful rendezvous, you want this to be zero in all cases - and you\u0027d prefer it to say \u0022NaN\u0022, which means \u0022Not Applicable Node\u0022 (I think), which means your orbits are aligned spot on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s how you get to a rendezvous:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Note the locations and altitudes of the target\u0027s apoapsis and periapsis. When you launch the source craft, you\u0027re going to want your source craft\u0027s orbit to have as close to the same apopasis/periapsis altitudes/positions as you can manage. I find that waiting until the target is about 450,000m uprange of KSC helps, but you can play around with that value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launch and get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Evaluate how well you did. Start with the ascending/descending nodes. If the value isn\u0027t zero, you\u0027re going to have to adjust the inclination of your orbit. Assuming you\u0027ve launched eastward (heading 090) like all good Kerbonauts should, you want to aim southward on the horizon if you\u0027ll come up on the ascending node first and northward if the descending node is coming up first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When you reach the node, perform a slow burn (unless you\u0027ve really botched the launch and have a node of 15 degrees or more, then floor it). Get the value as close to 0.0 as you can. If the node starts pulling well away from your ship, stop the burn - if you\u0027re still not at zero at that point, try again later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Meantime, when you come up to your first apsis, aim prograde and make a slow burn, and watch the effect it has on the intersects. If the value increases, stop, turn around and burn. Keep burning until the distance starts going back up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Keep doing this when you hit the nodes and apses. Eventually you\u0027ll figure out which way you need to adjust your orbits to bring the value down. Bear in mind that as long as the distance between the two craft is narrowing on its own, you don\u0027t necessarily have to do this every time you reach one of these points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) If you get close enough to the target, your game may automatically switch you over to \u0022Target\u0022 mode on your velocity display. Unless you\u0027ve got a close rendezvous on your intercepts, I\u0027d manually switch it back over to \u0022Orbit\u0022 mode. You can go back to Target mode once things are getting close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Once you\u0027ve got a close pass - within a kilometer, preferably within 0.5 kilometers, switch over to Target mode. Your gauge will now display your craft\u0027s velocity relative to the target. You want this to be roughly 1 meter per second per 100 meters range to the target; if you\u0027re travelling faster than that, aim retrograde and make a slow burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) When you\u0027ve closed to 2250m, you may notice the game shutter ever so slightly depending on your machine; that\u0027s the physics engine picking up the other craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) I\u0027ve already written up something on how to do the final docking today, if you need that. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/40645-Help-With-Rendezvous?p=522811\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post522811\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the link\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck; let us know how things turn out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T15:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENaN means \u0022not a number\u0022 - effectively zero \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
