What things should i use to work out how to build my rockets precisely, to work out how much delta-v they need to be bringing with them to get to and from their destinations, i am also going to have to practice docking and attaching in orbit because i really want to try out station science as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all this is going to be quite difficult for me, having only ever played KSP casually on and off.

Its a very useful tool to have. Also, are you using B9 and Ferram Aerospace as well? I ask because Ferram can make things more difficult for you because of realistic flight physics and the whole aerodynamic failures option (you can turn that off btw so you do not have to worry about your rockets exploding out of nowhere because the stress became to great) and as for B9, that pack adds a ton of parts that you need to get familiar with at first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend to start slowly, build some easy rockets with stock parts to get the science for better tech, keep in mind that Kerbin also has biomes that you can explore for science.

Overhauls the aerodynamics and makes launches much more engaging. Bad design or bad flight can cause loss of control in FAR. If you have aerodynamic failures on then your craft can even be ripped apart by aerodynamic stresses; if you want things more forgiving turn failures off. A side-effect of FAR is it does reduce the delta-V required to orbit, meaning launchers have bigger payload fractions - a smaller rocket launches the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings are recommended, though not essential, with FAR. Procedural Fairings are easy to use and very powerful. If you\u0027d rather have the constraint of fixed-size fairings, try KW Rocketry or 0 Point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Solar System changes the solar system. Various \u0022configs\u0022 are available. Full RSS is just that, our own solar system. With the stock parts you get very small payload fractions, further mods are generally recommended. 6.4x is the Kerbol system made larger, and gives payload fractions like real-life rockets when using the stock parts; personally I dislike the way it flattens the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIDS (Kerbal ISP Difficulty Scaler) lets you make the engines more or less efficient.
