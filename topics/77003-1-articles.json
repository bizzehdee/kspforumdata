Also, there\u0027s lots of times where it\u0027s just needed to put a part where it belongs. I don\u0027t understand this anti-debug mentality. Yes, the debug menu is technically cheating, but if you think about it, in actual construction there\u0027s a certain amount of cutting and welding that occurs. So no, I don\u0027t view it as cheating. What I view as cheating part \u003Cem\u003Ehacking\u003C/em\u003E. Using the debug menu to put 30 fuel tanks in the space of one IS cheating. Not crossing a pair of fuel tanks in a radial attachment, or sinking a light into the surface of a vessel to make it appear flesh with the surface. I have had people literally point at my designs and yell \u0022PART CLIPPING\u0022, then look at me in a disgusted manner. Honestly, I think we all do it to an extent. Everyone will deny it. But we all have those bits of \u0022Non-debug part clipping!\u0022 Where things that can\u0027t be replicated appear mysteriously on your craft:huh:. So, I would request that everyone stop and think.
