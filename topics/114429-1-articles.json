Right now we all have to download mods individually, a process that takes a long time and can have problems. My idea is that, with the permission of the associated mods\u0027 developers, I bundle multiple mods together into a modpack that requires only one download but brings everything from all the inside mods. When one of the mods updates I will update the modpack. Obviously, we all play this game slightly differently, so my modpack, if it becomes a real thing, may only be suited to certain types of players. So, is this possible, and how could I do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have their permissions, I don\u0027t see why not.

Admittedly this will only work with those mods which support/are supported by CKAN, and there are apparently a few mods out there which CKAN still has problems with. That being said (I think I like this phrase), I use CKAN to maintain my installs, and on my current game have 100 mods installed and updated by CKAN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELGG\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T08:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween CKAN, KSP-AVC, and the incredible ease of mod installation in KSP, ModPacks are unnecessary, and just cause headaches for the mod developers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to look at how the previous modpack threads turned out btw \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T08:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, your best bet for a \u0022modpack\u0022 right now is to use CKAN to install your required mods, and then just distribute your CKAN installed list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel like you need to tweak mods, create your your own mod with module manager configs and the like, and distribute that as a separate CKAN-managed mod that\u0027s included in your list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T09:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo recap the other thread: the main problem would be versioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re now hardwired to a specific version of that other mod. If it needs updating, you need to update your pack as well.
