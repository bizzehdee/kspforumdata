Because I already said that to new players, a dV readout will neither mean a lot nor will they see the relevance between that and attaining orbit. It\u0027s safe to say that people answering the poll already know what dV means, and besides, if 86% of voters know what dV means, then, using your logic, 14% of voters also know what it means. It seems that the people who understand dV and do not want it implemented in stock are in the minority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is not trying to simulate a real-world solar system or space agency. it is a tongue-in-cheek game, giving gamers a glimpse into space exploration without bogging them down with tons of science, math and numbers.

For people who don\u0027t understand dV and orbital mechanics, they don\u0027t have to be bogged down by numbers (there\u0027s not really that much maths involved... if your rocket has 4.4km/s dV, then you can pretty safely achieve orbit. However, see my previous points about things going wrong, knowing what 4.4km/s dV actually means etc etc) and the people who want it, they can have it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s not simulating real life or a real solar system, but it\u0027s basics are grounded in reality (if you orbit a planet with a G of X at a height of Y, you will travel at Zm/s etc) so there must, fundamentally, be some way of displaying basic real orbital physics. It is literally just more information. You\u0027re given Eeloos physical characteristics before you ever even have a chance to go there so why aren\u0027t you told how much dV your rocket has? It\u0027s like saying, with absolute certainty, that \u0022Pluto has a diameter of X, a gravitional constant of Y, an atmosphere of Z atm, a sidereal day of A, that it has B number of moons\u0022 without even seeing pictures of it and in the same breath, saying \u0022well, to be honest, I don\u0027t know exactly how far this rocket can travel...\u0022.

In my opinion, we should be showing it to new players, even if we withhold other stats, to encourage them to learn about this incredibly important aspect of spacecraft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, DV is an important one, but as I see it, the first nodes up until unlocking the DV readout, even if it was only the second or third node, can be unlocked without knowing what DV is, or WR for that matter. Just moar boosters and more stuff in general should get you that far. It did for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe fact that we already have a delta V measure for maneuvers makes the lack of any other reference to delta V a bit puzzling.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWell as I see it delta-V is a fundamental parameter of the manouevre node. The manouevre is defined by the amount of delta-V and the direction it\u0027s applied in. The game has to have the node delta-V to work, even if it hid it from the user. By contrast the delta-V of a rocket, though hugely important, is a derived parameter from the engine specific impulse and ship mass ratio, and the game doesn\u0027t have to calculate the ship delta-V. That\u0027s why it\u0027s not unreasonable to have the current situation where you have manouevre node delta-V\u0027s but not ship delta-V\u0027s. Not that it means the game should \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E that way, but it accounts for the behaviour.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I see it, any reason not to have it can just be countered with, \u0022that\u0027s a load of bull\u0022 or just \u0022don\u0027t use it.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t use them\u0022 was not generally accepted as a counter-argument against the claim the ARM engines are overpowered.
