His family\u0027s eyes and hopes were on us. Our organisation - with its dodgy facilities and well-meaning (albeit stupid) employees - had barely skimmed the surface of space; this would be our greatest challenge yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop scientists and engineers collaborated to construct our flagship craft: \u003Cem\u003E\u0027RESCUE 1\u0027\u003C/em\u003E.

After a near-disastrous launch (thanks to the engineers\u0027 \u0022great tweaks\u0022) Jeb once again found himself in orbit, battling gravity and his limited understanding of orbital mechanics. His bravado muted, this time he directed his attention fully to the task of saving Sean. So fully, unfortunately, that he wasn\u0027t paying attention to where his elbows were, and - \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBOOM!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E - he accidentally progressed to the rocket\u0027s next stage.

Is this moral?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1jLCRgh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESean gazed into the increasingly familiar black. A speck was taunting him again, trying to tease hope into consciousness\u003C/a\u003E. He wouldn\u0027t let it. It weaved back and forth, here and there, smaller and greater; like a stalking mosquito. He wished he could hear its buzz - he would let it come close and drink if only to break the damnable silence. This one\u0027s persistence began to frustrate him - how far had dehydration gone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speck grew closer. Could it be? Surely not. It grew closer still. He blinked in disbelief, and fired up the jetpack with trepidation - his training hadn\u0027t covered this. If he ran out of fuel... it didn\u0027t bear thinking about.

Even Sean had to concede that they were right - a rescue mission just wasn\u0027t feasible. They were broke. Almost bankrupt, in fact - the rescue attempts had bled them dry. Worse still, they didn\u0027t have the technology to get Jebediah home; to even attempt a rescue would first require a huge investment in their facilities. Where would the money come from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA radical new idea was proposed - what if the craft didn\u0027t explode every time? What if we made a plane that could land \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E exploding? No-one much liked the sound of that, but desperate times call for desperate measures. The road was rough; we flirted with bankruptcy for weeks as prototype after prototype crashed into the ground - it quickly became clear that no-one knew anything about planes. Sean piloted every test flight they would let him, nearly costing him his life on multiple occasions, but nothing could break his resolve. He had to believe they would get it right eventually - they just had to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerseverance paid off: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rump6qS.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe plane \u003Cem\u003E\u0027BRAVERY\u0027\u003C/em\u003E was born\u003C/a\u003E.
