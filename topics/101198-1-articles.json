So I was blasting some stuff to bits with BDarmory mod and then i found out that some of the pieces of the rover I blasted had gone through the earth and into an underground ocean I was like \u0022... how did this get to the ocean?:confused:\u0022 And then I realized it was underground. It\u0027s defiantly water it makes plashes. My dad calls it the \u0022Underground River\u0022. Anyway what I was wanting to see is if anyone can make a boat and get it down there and move around. I really want to see your creations:D. I don\u0027t know if this is possible the only pieces I got through were just a 1x1 structural plate.
