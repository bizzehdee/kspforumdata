So I was blasting some stuff to bits with BDarmory mod and then i found out that some of the pieces of the rover I blasted had gone through the earth and into an underground ocean I was like \u0022... how did this get to the ocean?:confused:\u0022 And then I realized it was underground. It\u0027s defiantly water it makes plashes. My dad calls it the \u0022Underground River\u0022. Anyway what I was wanting to see is if anyone can make a boat and get it down there and move around. I really want to see your creations:D. I don\u0027t know if this is possible the only pieces I got through were just a 1x1 structural plate. But i did get two down there.\n\n-------edit-------\n\nI found out thats i bug for small things so nvm.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T07:48:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PSOliver**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T10:23:43Z","Content":"Nope, falling into the subterrian ocean is caused by a minor glitch last I checked, you can\u0027t get a complete ship down there.
