For each science experiment you should collect some preacious data, like g force, rotation period, distance to kerbin or to KSC, pressure, temperature, sun light time, etc. for having the possibility to calculate the parameters from a mission, for example, if you have the TAC life support mod you will need to now how much electricity you must have according to kerbal\u0027s needs of oxygen when there is no sun light and you can\u0027t generate power. Also for other things like designing your spacecraft and have an idea of how much fuel will you need for making your trip or how will pressure afect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbes would get really important for example at duna, so you can gather data about the period, size and atmospheric pressure and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think? It isn\u0027t too much effort to impliment that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T16:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYesssssssssssssssss.
