I didn\u0027t know this and I was paying L300.000 per kerbonaut by now.\n\nThat gave me the plan to set up a rescue and training program.\n\nMy plan is this in short: you accept an contract, launch the rocket, catch the kerbal from let\u0027s say Kerbin orbit and then continue (all in one flight) to the Mun, land on Minmus and just touch Kerbol orbit for a moment and land and recover on Kerbin(to get 16,75 XP (Kerbin orbit 2 XP, Mun orbit 3XP, Minmus landing 5,75XP and Kerbol orbit 6XP).\n\nMy question is this: do rescued kerbonauts, from the moment they are in your rescue vehicle, start gaining XP? (of course I know they have to go to KSC at one point to get those stars)\n\nThanks in advance!!"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:45:59Z","Content":"Yes.\n\nThey will return with a full star (Kerbin Orbit = 2)\n\nIf you land anyway, plant a flag for one additional XP."},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:54:15Z","Content":"Good! Thanks! \n\nI know but it is not neccesary and it only applies to one kerbal per craft and costs more time to do so"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T12:55:22Z","Content":"Usually if I rescue someone from Kerbin orbit, they are given 2XP on landing due to having orbited Kerbin, so yes I think it would track their experience if you sent them off to other bodies rather than returning to ground immediately.\n\nInteresting idea, though note that not all stranded Kerbals start in a nice, low, equatorial orbit of Kerbin now..."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:00:46Z","Content":"Yes, I rescued three kerbals in kerbin orbit, did a fly-by of the Mun, landed on Minmus and returned.
