At 223m altitude on Eve every stock engine I looked at had an ISP below 200 with the \u0022mammoth\u0022 engine topping the list at 198.3 ISP. Some engines were abysmal though like the \u0022swivel\u0022 at only 64.6 ISP and 40.4 kN thrust. The SRBs were the worst with ISP numbers in the 30s and 40s and thrust numbers that are only 25% as good as when at sea level on Kerbin. Even the \u0022aerospike\u0022 engine (189.5 ISP, 100.3 kN thrust) seems like a poor choice.\n\nAll of this seems to point towards needing a really huge ascent vessel with a lot of \u0022mammoth\u0022 engines to get you up the first 20-30km. The downside is that landing something that big or even flying it there from Kerbin will be all that much harder, plus you need for all that size to be aerodynamic if you want to control it at all. We may only need 7500 m/s DV \u002B/- to get to orbit on Eve now, but getting that much DV seems to take a bigger rocket in 1.0.x than having a 12km/s rocket did in 0.90.\n\nDoes this mesh with what you guys have found so far with Eve ascents in 1.0 or am I just doing something very wrong here?\n\nP.S. I wrote down a lot of numbers on paper for ISP and thrust when I did my testing at 223m and 900m altitudes on Eve and I could post them her if you guys think it would be useful."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T06:37:29Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t always have to be a huge rocket. You can use a plane with long-burning engines, or an ion glider. Using natural lift will save on TWR hassle, and ion gliding gets rid of atmospheric worries. The new fuel cells can be an exemplary source of power.\n\nOf course, if you do find liquid engine solutions, it would be great to hear from a professional, such as yourself."},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T07:15:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E P.S.

Moreover I wanted to have at least 2 bays close to the terrain level, one for the rover and the other one with a pod to allow for an almost ladderless ship. I kept the extra ISRU as a ballast cause I did not want to stretch it too much in the sense of height putting just one ISRU at the bottom. The landing footprint is already pretty small for such a tall lander. \n\nMainsails may experience hard times to lift you off the sea level if you fail to go supersonic as soon as possible, meanwhile if they are your second stage and you already reached 10000m they are wonderful. After 35000m you can safely go with anything with a TWR of 1 or even slightly less.\n\nDo you launch it full or empty? Did you test it on Eve yet?"}]}
