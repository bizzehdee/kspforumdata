Its a pretty strange story though. So back in July 2011 or something like that, i found out about a game called KSP, so i downloaded the demo of it to check it out. It was pretty cool, and i got addicted to it really quick. I found out about mods and then i became a real KSP boi.\u00A0Even though i did not know how to play KSP properly. But then, some day. I bought the real game, and i found out that the latest update was 0.16, and when i played the game, i was like:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EOooh look at all the new parts. Oh! You can EVA now? Thats sooooo cool!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0And i got pretty hyped. And in KSP 0.16, i reached my first orbit, it was not that stable, but it still went into orbit with a PE above ground. And i also remember my first Mun encounter, wich made me afraid that whenever i do another mission, i would miss the Mun encounter. But then, somewhere in 2014, i reached my first stable orbit, wich i dont remember doing. And later that year, i found out about Dark Multiplayer, a KSP mod wich allows Multiplayer to exist, wich lead to my first ever Munar landing without mechjeb. The lander was called \u0027\u0027Asparagus I\u0027\u0027 because it was also my first try at asparagus staging. But then, in 2016, stuff started to get weird. So i flew by some planets, and built a couple of station, you know, the basic stuff. But i started an account on the KSP forum, wich inspired me to do almost impossible tasks, like building a VSSTO, even though i had a Jackspeticeye kind off skill in the game. But that was succesfull, wich is mind-blowing. And because of the KSP forum, i started to like the game more and more until it became one of my hobby\u0027s. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61954-majorjim/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002261954\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61954-majorjim/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Majorjim\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0really inspired me to do things that i think i cant do, and the strange part is that all the thing i thought were impossible, were possible. Look at this VSSTO i made a while back:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wpT6bBI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wpT6bBI.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first thought it was impossible to make. And it was hard to make, but learning from your mistakes and stuff like that helped alot. Everybody who is new to KSP, should take a look at the KSP forum i think, especially in the spacecraft exchange (i dont know how to spell that lol). Because it makes players more skilled, and have alot more fun in the game than killing poor innocent kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T13:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually made the Mammoth 4 in 20 minutes and it works too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinchaser","CreatedById":160817,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T14:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I\u0027m glad the forum community has been helping you so far.

When i first came here it was a little different, because there were no haters or bullies. I used to talk on YouTube, where you find alot of different people talking about different topics. But because of YouTube drama and all that useless garbage, i left that website. So then i started talking and making friends here. The good things about the KSP forum is because it is 96% KSP related things, wich is awesome, because i love KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T00:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy belated birthday!
