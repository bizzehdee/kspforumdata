The planet also includes several very craggy and rocky gray mountains that appear as if they havent been eroded, but rather crushed and smashed with a giant first.

The planets orbit is extremely eccentric as if something took away its gas giant layers (hint, a yellow green gas dwarf from my mod) and there are strange salt crystals growing all over its surface which give the impression fo the planet being covered in salt grains. The planet also has several rocks scattered and a generally \u201Cpounded\u2019 and \u201Cdead but once alive\u201D feel to it.

This planet has terrain that would remind one of wrinkly, mount-everest-esque mountains, with crinkly \u0022leaf-like terrain\u0022, as if the planet is covered in leaves and wrinkly mountain spikes. The entire planet is largely composed of a coal-like substance made of pure carbon, that forms all of these mountains and gives the planet a giant coal lump feel to it. The entire planet has rare craters that are full of dust and soot that covers most of the inside of these craters. Most of the planet has some amount of this dust and soot, making the planet appear \u0022dusty\u0022 and \u0022dirty\u0022. The planet is black to a point where it almost blends into space, making it extremely hard to see from a distance as the only way you can tell that you have reached the planet is by looking at a lack of stars. The planet is covered in vast swaths of pure diamond crystals, cut and smooth. These diamonds cover wide ranges of the planet and are almost perfectly smooth and clear, save for massive diamond crystals with crystalline looks covering massive portions of these diamond plains. All in all, these plains cover 40% of the planet\u0027s surface and are visible during the night as they reflect light very well. There are many, many anomalies on the surface of the planet, mostly consisting of giant graphite shards that stick out of the planets surface and look almost as if they were literally taken from giant pencils. These graphite shards range from tiny to the size of the smaller diamond plains, and are pretty widespread in some areas and rare in others. The craters tend to concentrate in the poles, although they are very rare altogether and this is not noticeable. It is also possible to see white craters that look as if they are covered in chalk, which come from other planets which have contaminated this planet with their foreign materials. The planet is about 2.2\u00A0kerbins in mass and 1.24\u00A0kerbins in radius. The planet has a surface gravity of 3.5\u00A0Gs owing to its extremely high density. The planet has a thin atmosphere of Co2 that is colored black, with frequent soot gusts covering parts of the planet. The planet\u0027s clouds are few and far between, and seem to consist of shards of graphite that have been released into the atmosphere and are colored dark grey. The planet has an eccentric and inclined orbit with a periapsis between moho and eve and an apoapsis between kerbin and duna. The planet\u0027s atmosphere seems to have been stolen by the hycean world and the super venus, which are also in my mod, as it has a very small atmosphere for its size. The orbits inclination lies at about 15.5 degrees, far above the other planets save for the other planets in the mod, and it has played a significant role in the history of the Kerbolar system, being responsible for the super venus, the vulcan analogue, Moho, the gas dwarf and the hycean planets\u0027 atmosphere.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0A hycean world with planetary rings. This world\u0027s terrain is all oceans; with these oceans having an aquamarine tint, almost as if it was a tropical planet. However, this planet is far from tropical. It has massive ice caps over the poles that a very reflective and extend down much farther than Kerbin\u0027s. The terrain under the oceans is extremely deep and hard to reach, and consists of abyssal plateaus with random ridges filled with hot magma underneath. The abyssal plain also occaisonally has mountains made of craggy rock reaching out of the depths; however, these mountains are far to deep to reach the surface. There are also many horrific terrain features that remind one of skulls at the bottom of the ocean; and strange sounds are reported to be heard down there. The planet is covered in an extremely thick cyan atmosphere at about 4 atm surface pressure and decently large; said atmosphere has hundreds of silica clouds covering every inch of it, from top to bottom. They look like cirrus clouds and are slightly grey, and spin extremely fast at speeds of ~5000 mph, about five times the speed of winds on Neptune. These clouds are like saws in the sense that they can cut through craft with ease due to them being composed of silicate shards. The planet also has a radius of 2.3 Kerbins and a mass of 1.88 Kerbins, giving it a slightly less density than Kerbin. The planet has four moons; all of which have their own section. The planet\u0027s gravity is about 1.56\u00A0Gs, which is disproportionatley small for its size due to low density. The planet\u0027s rings\u0027 compostition is mainly made of rocks and dust, although traces of metal have been found, namely iron, copper, and strangely, neodymium. Current theories suggest the neodymium came from another planet or even another solar system, although these theories are generally regarded as foolish. The hycean world has significantly influence the orbits of Kerbin and Duna, as well as the orbit of the Carbon Planet and the Clthonian Planet. The hycean world also seems to have a deep crater hidden within its ocean depths; which formed due to a planetary collision millions of years ago.
