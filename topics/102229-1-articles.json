Where would you choose to set up a permanently-manned colony off Kerbin? Not just an outpost/base that you rotate crews, but a permanent settlement on another world.\n\nMy first choice would be Eve- it\u0027s relatively easy to get to, there\u0027s a substantial atmosphere for aerobraking, parachuting supplies/equipment/colonists to the surface and flying aircraft, plus plenty of sights to see. It makes exploration much easier if you don\u0027t intend to bring the crew back to Kerbin. I think Laythe is a good option too (if a little far away) due to the large quantities of water, oxygen and some sort of sandy deposits. Duna (Ike included) has its advantages too.\n\nAnyone brave/stupid enough to try for Moho or Eeloo?"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:57:43Z","Content":"Laythe makes the most sense for a permanently manned colony, due to the water, atmosphere and \u0022sand\u0022.

Definitely Eve. It\u0027s the easiest place to get to and land on outside of the Kerbin system, and the relative frequency of transfer windows makes it easy to keep up a steady stream of resupply ships and new equipment.\n\nHowever, if I need to bring the kerbals back eventually, I\u0027d probably go with Ike or Laythe. Ike, because it\u0027s easy to land and take off from, and its proximity to Duna allows for delta-v savings on the way in (and on the way out if you\u0027re clever with your transfer burns).

Logistically, the proximity to Kerbin alone is a great advantage over everyone\u0027s favorite, Laythe. Remember, just because it has oxygen doesn\u0027t mean Laythe is any less hostile to imported life- the air is still toxic, the planet is still cold as hell, and since there is no plant growth, there is just as much topsoil (none!) on Laythe as there is on the Mun. The potential to purify oxygen from the atmosphere doesn\u0027t outweigh the fact that for a full colonization, you\u0027d have to import everything else necessary to break down and refine the natural minerals to grow plants. At that point, you\u0027re well on your way to a self-contained CO2/O2 cycle anyway. And it\u0027s even easier than that to ship raw resources back to Kerbin from the Mun than from Laythe, making the venture self-funding as well as self-sufficient, the Mun\u0027s lower gravity and lack of atmosphere make it a better location for stockpiling and shipbuilding, closer proximity to Kerbol and again no atmosphere is much better for solar power collection\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 the advantages are endless.\n\nAnd then I vote LAYTHE because it has better POSTCARDS.

If I want to have fun though, find a massive F class asteroid and colonise it.\n\nThis ^^^, and to echo other points in here regarding Laythe:\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Water (in theory could lead to fuel generation right?)\n\n2) Atmosphere thick enough to aerobrake and fly in, but not too thick to make drag an issue.\n\n3) Oxygen in atmosphere assists in life support and jet engine/RAPIER function, meaning efficient SSTO sorties to and from orbit.\n\n4) Gravity is comparable to Kerbin, only 20% less. Ideal for long-term habitation and aircraft/spacecraft efficiency.\n\n5) Possible resources closeby in the rest of the Joolian sector. Various types of moons and biomes mean more types of resources that can assist in self-sustainment.\n\n6) For the same reasons as the previous pro, many opportunities for scientific research around Jool and her moons, meaning higher payoffs in the form of contracts, funds, and reputation.\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Unknown radiation hazards in the Joolian sector as stated above by Sanguine.\n\n2) Very little landmass that is scattered across the planet, long-range expeditions would need air or surface craft to travel.\n\n3) To get to Laythe on the innermost orbit around Jool, you have to dodge a gauntlet of gravity SOI\u0027s that could sling your ship out into deep space, another moon, or Jool itself.\n\n4) VERY far from Kerbin compared to other destinations."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T17:01:29Z","Content":"Upon further consideration, I think I would actually start a colony on Kerbin, seeing as how there isn\u0027t one yet!\n\nAnd the KSC cluster of buildings doesn\u0027t count as a colony.
