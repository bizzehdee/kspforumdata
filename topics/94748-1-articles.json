On a program as top secret as the B-2, you don\u0027t just write \u0022TOP SECRET STEALTH BOMBER\u0022 in the accounting books, so they chose to call it \u0022Aurora.\u0022 Its been a few years since I\u0027ve read it so I\u0027m not sure if this was in Lockheed\u0027s or the government\u0027s ledgers, but I am leaning heavily towards the government\u0027s. Of course you can just say the men in black made all that up and told Ben Rich to say it, but I think Occam\u0027s Razor comes into play here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit for content: Rocketscience101 - There are no current manned aircraft with cruise speed in the range you are asking about. I think the reason for this is that we don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E them to operate in that speed range. Sure, it would be nice to do NYC to London in less than 2 hours. but would you pay $500,000 a ticket? Concorde topped out just over mach 2 because when you go faster, the skin friction increases so much that traditional aluminum loses its strength. Then what about the (expensive) titanium SR-71 you ask? Back when it was being developed, spy satellites didn\u0027t exist and atmospheric recon had to be done. To go to mach 3, they chose to use titanium, then realized they had no tools that were strong enough to use with it. They literally created their own titanium milling procedures and made all their parts themselves. Now, the SR-71 was actually on budget if I recall, but it was considered such an asset to national security and the Russian Threat that money was not an object in its construction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, unless there is a significant breakthrough, the physics of pushing something that fast while in atmosphere loses out to slowing down, or biting the bullet and going (sub) orbital and accepting the added complexity for vastly improved performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T22:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Meecrob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T11:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA derivative of Skylon\u0027s SABRE engines could be feasible for use on an all-atmospheric passenger jet called LAPCAT-A2.

In a sense, we are very similar to being back in the late 20\u0027s-early 30\u0027s trying to break the sound barrier. Back then we needed new engines, aerodynamics, engineering...well pretty much a level up in all our technology at the time. These things were improved upon because there was a need for them in order to achieve what we wanted to do in fields other than aviation (IE commercial/military, and not NACA/NASA experimental flight). Currently, I don\u0027t see a need, but I do like to think that is because the people who are developing the technology aren\u0027t playing their cards yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
