The confusion exists. I said media policy because Squad is notorious for haphazard statements across various media. Casual customer\u0027s should not have to watch videos and search through twitch archives and wikis to figure out what is going on. Nor should they feel it necessary to ask here. On the homepage should be a statement: \u0022This is the latest release and this is what\u0027s happening with the next\u0022, followed by an explanation of why some people appear to be make vids from a newer version. Look over at steam and you\u0027ll find many people confused about which is the \u0022stable\u0022 release (.22) which is latest (.23) and wtf is this nasa \u0022patch\u0022 on youtube.
