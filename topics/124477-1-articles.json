Then it struck me how much better it could all be if **some** contracts included parts rewards. Science could still be fit in there but it would not be used for unlocks. In some video game models you do x then you get y which makes doing x easier next time. The contracts could be simple to complex. Rescue someone and get a new astronaut. Recover a part and be able to use it. Fly to x and get a part to make it easier next time. The pay for parts tree with science... could still remain... but optional....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T18:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is already a thread for it : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132958-Economic-Mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132958-Economic-Mode\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I see this coming back again and a again, a lot of people want this \u0022economic mode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T18:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like is a combination of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have science to unlock the tree.

Its a shame because experiments could really be some of the most fun parts of the game. The grind really is an issue, and Im sure sure it will be addressed at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
