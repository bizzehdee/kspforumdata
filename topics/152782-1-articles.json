So even with value of 3 wheels are prone to skidding especially at low speed. from my experience high friction limit is good for low g bodies so you can control your vessel more effectively especially when climbing hills. (i don\u0027t find \u0027flippability\u0027 a problem since imho I expect from real world physics and also when steering carefully or driving straight you\u0027re fine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) pre 1.1 unity had something like wheel weight value which was great for me since it prevented wheel spinning naturally (i used to bump it to high value which worked automatically like traction control), but I guess new physx got rid of this value and I have to tweak traction control values now for no-spin wheels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I can\u0027t get into the sweet spot of high damp ratio and high ride height (or high loading ratio) since all those values seems to increase fSpring values and when fSpring gets above 30 (in this case) it starts to freak out (weird range of values) and it ends up in a bouncy wheel effect (bouncing vehicle into air etc). Personally I prefer big damping value and medium to high ride height / loading ratio since it evens out high speed driving on uneven terrain and recovering from landing after bigger or lower jumps. Big loading ratio is also nice for heavier industrial rovers so the springs aren\u0027t compressed to the max and can do some hops damping work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) another nice to have would be to have selectable wheel groups - something like in pre 1.1 KF code, so you could tweak values for all wheels in the same group in editor or in flight.

I.e. when driving out or onto runway (small slope) even with slow speed they bounce of terrain or get stuck and explode. changing wheel collider to capsule or sphere doesn\u0027t change anything. You can replicate that just making circles on the runway driving into runway side slopes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) I feel it would be good to have a steering limit written as a curve that depends on speed somewhere in the future \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) sometimes changing colliders from ray to sphere causes the wheel to go up (to look right again I had to use offset 0.5) and then it stops behaving normally (can\u0027t turn properly and then becomes bouncy and itchy) example setup when this happens to front wheels:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022od0Y44w.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022615\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/od0Y44w.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9a) something is weird with flipping the vehicle with ray or capsule colliders. I simply cannot flip the vehicle naturally turning hard with max friction. What I mean is that the vehicle comes to about 30 degree flip and then the flip just stops there unnaturally. The effect is similar to games when your roll is artificially reduced so you can\u0027t flip it (I think WoT used to have this before physics overhaul). vehicle Pic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DCz1ecQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DCz1ecQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9b) the same vessel that is much lighter (without fuel in tanks) behaves weirdly as well - rolls to about 45 and then is blocked by some imaginary roll force then. It can be overcomed by turning even harder so there\u0027s something like natural flip to 45 degrees - block at that range - flipping further if more roll force is given. Maybe it\u0027s because the wheels apply force to the body? I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10) decreasing loading rating to a small value does something weird to steering of front wheels - they understear heavily no matter what speed or whether they exceed friction level or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit2: tried similar tests with most recent dev version and results are similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yah again great work fighitng that long with the broken physX of unity 5, one has to be amazed (not) how much they fubared wheels physics that worked great in unity 4 :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T12:38:52Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T16:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222870590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152782\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480592739\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129319\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022riocrokite\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, riocrokite said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid some quick testing and here are some thoughts: (edit: tested version = 0.9.0.2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yah again great work fighitng that long with the broken physX of unity 5, one has to be amazed (not) how much they fubared wheels physics that worked great in unity 4 :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the feedback.\u00A0 Much of that is either known issues, recently fixed, or nothing I can do about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start, you should read the post I made last night about tweaking friction; it solves many of the problems you had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Those are debug controls and will be going away entirely in the near future.\u00A0 Don\u0027t rely on them, they were intended to help me tweak friction curves and give data for testing.\u00A0 Overall sideways friction is greatly increased in the dev builds from last night.\u00A0 Generally, I thought the U4 wheels had \u003Cstrong\u003Eterrible\u003C/strong\u003E sideways friction and rolled vehicles far too easily, so I hope that my wheels aren\u0027t anywhere close to that; however what you are seeing in the 0.9.0.2 build is... not correct either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) WheelMass still exists, but is a config only setting.\u00A0 Technically I could open it up to user config, and might.\u00A0 It does pretty much what you would think; makes the wheel more resistant to torques, so each unit of torque applies less rotational speed (though the same net force), and results in better wheel response to motor input, less easy to break the drive wheels loose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Your not going to.\u00A0 Due to limitations in integration, high damping rates or high ride heights will cause problems with the physics.\u00A0 There is literally zero that I can do about this as I don\u0027t have access to the unity physics integration sub-steps; I only have access to FixedUpdate.\u00A0 Trying to get the vehicle to ride at the top of its suspension will never work right; it drives the spring forces too high and will cause bouncing.\u00A0 Raising the damper ratio too high will result in jitter due to the low simulation frequency.\u00A0 The wheel physics want 1000\u002Bhz, but KSP/Unity only gives them 50hz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Thinking on it a bit, and might do something like that; but these modules are not intended to replace KF, which will still have all of its old features/functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Noted, yea, they shouldn\u0027t steer in the stowed state (stowing does disable the wheel collider / physics updates).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) Sounds like a spring/ride height configuration problem.\u00A0 Would have to see the craft and wheel setup.\u00A0 Setting up the load rating, ride height, and damper value properly is \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E for these wheels.\u00A0 Failure to do so will result in bad results.\u00A0 Sadly I cannot do it automatically as the proper values are different on a per-craft/vehicle basis, nor do I believe it is proper for a wheel to magically change properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Its already in there, and enabled by default for all wheels.\u00A0 However it needs to be customized on a per-wheel basis, which I have not the time (or need, or deisre) to implement.\u00A0 The PR button is that way ==\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/compare?expand=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/compare?expand=1\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 (curve starts at 10m/s, 100% output, down to 50% output at 30m/s).\u00A0 (I use a flight stick for input, so fine analog input is not a problem for me; steering curves actually get in my way as I expect linear steering response regardless of speed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.) Sounds like you had the sphere colliders/spherecast hitting the vehicle somewhere else/another part.\u00A0 They are spheres with radius of the wheel, so if they would contact the other bits of the vehicle at all in their suspension sweep, they\u0027ll exert force to the vehicle itself.\u00A0 TL:DR -- known problem with sphere casts as they are often much wider than the tire; they solve many problems, but bring with them problems of their own.\u00A0 That is why the sweep-type option exists; a single setting is not correct for every wheel or use.\u00A0 Would have to load the vehicle up to examine clearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.) Sounds like a combination of the friction problem I cleaned up last night, along with one of the suspension quirks that I haven\u0027t yet removed (it decreases suspension output with the dot of the angle between the hit normal and suspension angle).\u00A0 Will be removing that quirk as I have found that yes, it interferes with proper force output when \u0027about to roll\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10.) Sounds like you decreased the suspension too far and hit the bump stop collider.\u00A0 If your wheels are at max compression / hitting bump stop, you will get incorrect force output as it is impossible to calculate the spring force unless the body is fully supported by the spring; if you are on the BS collider, you\u0027re not on the spring.\u00A0 Intentional effect -- don\u0027t overload your wheels, and your friction will be correct \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 (also part of this is that same friction tweak I mentioned last night).\u00A0 Also, as you accelerate, the mass distribution shifts rearward, reducing available friction from the front tires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote, if you want to try dev versions, you need to grab from the dev4 branch (plugin here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/blob/dev4/GameData/KSPWheel/Plugin/KSPWheel.dll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/blob/dev4/GameData/KSPWheel/Plugin/KSPWheel.dll\u003C/a\u003E ).\u00A0 I would suggest dropping that plugin into your install and giving some of the friction tests another try; you\u0027ll probably be pleasantly surprised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the physics problems I can do nothing about.\u00A0 Wish I could, but sadly, nothing I can do given the limited interface I have with the Unity/PhysX code and the super-low simulation frequency in use.\u00A0 Seriously, try the code in the Unity editor at 1000hz and you can just watch 90% of these problems disappear (no more jitter at high damp ratios, no more bounce from high spring rates or ride heights).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T16:11:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T17:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoooo!!!

a few more module features to implement, and a few more physics-related problems to try and sort through, but the majority of features and functions are in place and working as intended (or as good as it can given the integration limitations).\u00A0 Hoping to have things mostly wrapped up in the next week or so, and from there on development will move to a \u0027maintenance mode\u0027 focusing on bug-fixing and stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that others can do to help the process would be to outline what you think are reasonable load, max rpm, and torque limits for all of the various parts.\u00A0 Some of them I\u0027m quite stumped as to what their intended range of uses is, such as the airplane landing gear (how much mass should the largest gear support, maxed out?\u00A0 How about the large, medium, and the rest?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T19:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T06:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E if you could post a \u0022lemp fix\u0022 to adjustable landing gear using your awesome shadow magic you would be a hero, many people in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E community relied on these to build with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd perhaps your mod could become the new standard for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheels if your willing to have them become so. ...drifting planes down runways due to wheel \u0022bug\u0022 issues is heartbreaking when your trying to avoid \u0022reverts\u0022 in a hard core RP-0 playthrough\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArkaelDren","CreatedById":57992,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T09:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing to really add as I haven\u0027t tried this well needed Mod. \u00A0Why this has to come from the community, from people that have RL jobs exc, is a complete mystery to me. \u00A0I\u0022m absolutely ticked\u00A0off at the lack of professionalism from companies producing games these days. \u00A0Thank you very much for this attempt and I\u0027m sure completion of this Mod at some point. \u00A0I\u0027m a huge fan of exploration with rovers on all the body\u0027s we have in KSP and Mods that create more fun . \u00A0I tweaked some of Rover\u0027s wheels, as well as the stock wheels to be much more compliant like a \u0022Rock Crawler\u0022, but you can only get so far until it starts becoming unmanageable. \u00A0Looking forward to using \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003EKerbal Foundries\u003C/span\u003E pack with this. \u00A0Now to end this post, people with real lives, busy\u00A0lives, turn out better work than the paid teams that claim to be professionals. \u00A0I\u0027m a bit older than 95% of this community so I have a bit of a different perspective on this. \u00A0Not to say I know more, or am somehow wiser, its just that I have watched the decline over the last 20 years and its just a crock of Bull Droppings, or Human waist, or maybe greedy a$$ hats.

There are a number of fudge factors in the post itself which could be tweaked if it turns out to produce results which are comedically bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think max torque is a useful place to start. Max power is, which should be roughly proportional to part mass - changed if we feel less or more of the mass of a part might be the motor (for example, track vs. wheel parts). Electric vehicle motors are approaching 10 kW/kg _but_ that is the motor alone. A Telsa S has a maximum of 568kW power output on circa 460kg of drive bits (motor, inverter, differential, wheels, brakes, suspension, rack and pinion but _not_ the battery since that\u0027s a separate part in KSP terms too). Now our parts are engineered for aerospace, but they\u0027re also engineered for off-road travel with superbly robust suspensions and parts; we might perhaps get 1 kW/kg on wheels and 0.75 kW/kg on tracks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(What we decide a kW costs in ElectricCharge is another question, but in terms of determining part performance we need to know kW).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext is the motor\u0027s maximum efficient RPM. Larger motors typically have a lower maximum RPM because the centrifugal force generated increases with the size of the rotating parts. A Tesla motor runs at a maximum 16,000 RPM, but that is high for EVs and that is the absolute maximum. I would suggest that a part the diameter of an ordinary motor car wheel (70cm) should run at 8,000 RPM and then making it scale inversely with part linear dimension - twice the size, max 4,000 RPM, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we can determine the maximum motor torque. The maximum motor torque is that delivered at 3/4 the maximum efficient RPM and full power. (Where does the figure of 3/4 come from? I have just eyeballed some torque v. speed curves and made it up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext is to decide a nominal maximum operating speed. If the part isn\u0027t tiny (smaller than the wheels on a real-world 4x4), this should be more based on perceptions of the part\u0027s intended usage than anything else - tracks generally slower than wheels, etc. If it is tiny the maximum speed should probably be further reduced. (This is the only really subjective part of this process).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext is to determine the default gear ratio. We know the nominal maximum operating speed and the diameter of the wheel, so we can tell the wheel RPM at maximum speed. The default gear ratio should be such that at the nominal maximum speed, the motor is running at its maximum efficient RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we know the default gear ratio we can divide the maximum motor torque by that to determine torque delivered to the wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe user should be able to alter this default gear ratio in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, down to about half or up to about double the default value. This will either increase the maximum torque but decrease the effective maximum speed, or decrease the maximum torque but make it more viable to exceed the nominal maximum speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMotor performance is as follows (based on the actual gear ratio):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we are below 3/4-maximum-RPM, deliver maximum torque. Calculate power used based on RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we are above 3/4-maximum RPM but below motor max efficient RPM, deliver full power. Calculate torque based on motor RPM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we are above motor maximum efficient RPM, multiply maximum power by (1-(2* excess RPM / maximum RPM)), minmum 0. At 150% of nominal maximum RPM, the motor can deliver no power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about rolling resistance? I wrote about this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121236-pluginparts-kerbal-foundries-continuation-latest-19g/\u0026amp;page=12#comment-2526709\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ebefore\u003C/a\u003E. A potted summary is I think the force at the wheel contact point should be 0.08 times the weight on the part (ie, the current force on the suspension, but read on), 0.1 times if the part is tracked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd to the current force on the suspension 10N per kg of the part to account for losses internal to the part - even on Gilly, grinding the tracks around takes work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the springs are bottomed out, double the rolling resistance force (we can\u0027t know exactly how much mass they are supporting, but it\u0027s probably too much).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf part speed is below 1 m/s, multiply the rolling resistance force by the speed. (This neatly means 0 force at 0 RPM). This is the only fudge for speed - normally it\u0027s not necessary because work done against the force will rise proportionately to speed anyway. This just prevents phantom forces at very low speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the part is going above the nominal maximum speed, increase rolling resistance by multiplying by (1\u002B excess speed/nominal maximum).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven wheel diameter this can be turned into a torque term to be applied counter to the direction of movement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a worked example (intermediate values have been rounded).

Maximum power is 200kW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s made for roving not racing so I will assign it a nominal maximum speed of 12 m/s. (This is not so restricting; by gearing it up, the user will be able to go at 24 m/s at full power and get somewhere between there and 36 m/s. IME the old KF parts topped out at about 20 m/s.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur wheel is 10/7 as big as the typical motor car wheel so the maximum motor RPM will be 5600.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe maximum motor torque is delivered at or below 4200 RPM, corresponding to 9 m/s with default gearing. The torque at the motor will then be 454 N m. [1]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 1m wheel at 9 m/s makes 9/pi revolutions per second, 172 RPM. The default gearing is a circa 24:1 reduction. The maximum torque at the wheel axle in the default configuration is 11111 N m. (This seems like a huge number at first, but it\u0027s not for a heavy offroad drivetrain, which is what we\u0027ve got - and we\u0027re turning large wheels reducing force at the contact patch. It\u0027s huge because we have a powerful motor geared down to provide high torque at low speeds. Four of these beasts (800kg) would accelerate a 5 tonne vehicle at just under 9 m/s/s from a standing start [2]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this default configuration, from 0 to 9 m/s the part delivers 11111 N m. Power consumption rises from 0 to 200kW linearly with speed. Above 9 m/s, power consumption stays at 200kw but torque drops off to (200kW / wheel revolution rate) [3], to 8333 N m at 12 m/s. Above 12 m/s power will start to also drop off - at 15 m/s power is only 100 kW and torque is now (100 kW/ ((15/pi) revolutions per second), 3333 N m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the user had doubled the gear reduction in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they\u0027d get an impressive 22222 N m of torque... but only up to 4.5 m/s, where torque would start to drop off and power will start to drop off at 6 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they\u0027d halved the gear reduction, they get\u00A0 5556 N m. However, that is delivered up to 13.5 m/s, and power only starts to drop off at 24 m/s. They do however take an increased rolling resistance term from 12 m/s upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about rolling resistance? Suppose four of these are mounted on a 5 tonne vehicle, but we are on Tylo, where the surface gravity is about 8 N/kg. If the mass of the vehicle is currently evenly distributed, 1250 kg rests on the spring on one part, producing a force of 10kN in the spring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe add to this the gravity-independent term of 10N per kg of the part itself - 2kN, for a total of 12kN. We multiply by 0.08 to get 960N. At speeds above 1 m/s and below 12 m/s (the nominal maximum speed), this will apply a torque of 1920 N m counter to the direction of movement. This seems to be of about the right order of magnitude. It won\u0027t trouble the default gearing producing 11111 N m, but the maximum-speed gear reduction is clearly going to struggle as it approaches 24 m/s (4167 N m torque) with the rolling resistance term doubled for overspeed to 3840 N m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] This is the least obvious derivation. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wentec.com/unipower/calculators/power_torque.asp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is a perfectly good calculator; or one can type \u0022You have: 200 kW / (4200 revolutions per minute)\u0022 \u0022You want: N m\u0022 into the UNIX program \u0022units\u0022; or one can know that 1W at 1 revolution per second is 1/(2 * pi) Newton metres of torque so 200kW at 4200 RPM (70 RPsecond) is 200000 / (2 * pi * (46 2/3)) N m = 454 N m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[2] An implication is that there may want to be a user facility - not restricted to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E - to cut maximum torque at low speeds, so that keyboard users don\u0027t constantly do wheelies because they have no choice but to floor the throttle. What I\u0027d suggest is that the user can input a limited torque for use at 1 m/s and below, and torque then rises linearly between 1 m/s and 10 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[3] At first glimpse this doesn\u0027t make sense because torque seems to be independent of gearing. It is - in the range where the motor is operating at full power and performance is limited by that. Gearing changes where that power limited range starts and where the motor power starts to drop off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-03T01:53:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice writing \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123074-damerell/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022123074\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123074-damerell/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@damerell\u003C/a\u003E!
