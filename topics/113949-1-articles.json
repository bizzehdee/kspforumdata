However, I\u0027ve also had some difficulties\n\nI\u0027ve tried adding some more cloud layers to the Ascloud.cfg file, attempting to add a second layer and snow at the poles, but anything past the first (default) layer seems to get ignored no matter what I do\n\nAs far as other feedback, [this](http://i.imgur.com/ABDEMsl.jpg) is what the planet looks like with the default clouds. I wasn\u0027t quite a fan of the sparse look of it, so I went and fiddled around a bit with it. I came up with [this](http://imgur.com/a/Qf3gV) setup, achieved by editing the height of the clouds to 2500m and using the eve1 texture. The rationale behind it, is that I tried to roll with the unique component of this planet: an atmosphere that gets incredibly thick down in the cracks. So I made the clouds appear only in said cracks, fading in from 5000 meters, which is the point where the atmospheric pressure spikes. I am still fiddling with it, as I\u0027m not sure I like the default color though..\n\nA bit more feedback, I feel like the orbital map texture is really low res, which is a shame because the planet up close is really quite a sight\n\nIf I can figure out how to add more layers, I\u0027d like to share this setup with you\n\nP.s. bonus picture from before I started adding clouds: [kruel rising in the cracks](http://i.imgur.com/60XHfIY.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Amedee","CreatedById":134429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T19:35:04Z","Content":"Hi there!
