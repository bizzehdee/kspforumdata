I have Interstellar Extended and Deadly Reentry, FAR, procedural parts, USI, KIS, infernal robotics, and several smaller mods. I read the wiki and had no need for radiators with any small vehicles made of mainly small stock parts. Went to the moons and collected all the science, no radiators needed. \u003Cp\u003EThen I launched a large station station made of a lot of USI parts, with Rhino engines and no radiators.

But it\u0027s always 0. The K and MW values on radiators rarely change and if they do it\u0027s so very little. It also seems like the temp on adjacent parts conduct heat extremely slowly, so maybe very little of the heat is reaching the radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have ideas on what\u0027s wrong?

Every stock engine will explode, although the skipper does it in 2 minutes when the others take maybe 8-10. None of the KSPIE radiators do very much, only increase a few K. The only ones that help are the deployable stock radiators. Their temperatures increase and 1 medium radiator extend the time it takes for engines to blow up by maybe 10-20%, but their waste heat bars still don\u0027t move. Was able to get engines to run indefinitely with infinite fuel and enough stock radiators. Also tried more mixing and matching radiators with the my USI station and it\u0027s kind of similar result. I made a stock station and it didn\u0027t need any radiators at all. So I\u0027m assuming you are right, that the group of mods are messing with the heat system.

This is actually very simple, with the craft just thrusting prograde until on an escape trajectory. Because the low thrust of ion engines means it takes so long, it\u0027s not exactly critical to start this type of maneuver at any specific point in the orbit, with corrections instead being made by vectoring the craft\u0027s thrust slightly off of prograde. It\u0027s probably not the most efficient because it can\u0027t take much advantage from the Oberth effect, but that doesn\u0027t matter as much with ion propulsion. IRL wearing out the acceleration grids on the ion thrusters is often more of a problem than running out of fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter escaping the gravity well of a planet, Ion engines use what I like to call an \u0022accelerated Hohmann transfer\u0022. This is basically a normal Hohmann transfer orbit, but it uses the low continuous thrust of an ion engine to speed up the transfer. This is the type of transfer that those \u002240 days to mars\u0022 proposals use. I don\u0027t have much information on this type of transfer, to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last one that I know of is called a brachistochrone trajectory.

It\u0027s far faster than any kind of Hohmann transfer orbit, but it requires a propulsion system that has both (relatively) high thrust, and very high specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrachistochrone trajectories are quite a bit easier to plan and fly than most other transfer trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, point your ship at where the target will be in a few days, thrust until you\u0027re halfway there, turn the ship around, and thrust until you reach the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjustments will be needed depending on thrust level, relative velocity between start and destination points, distance between start and destination points, and anything that might need to be avoided along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSPI, the magnetic nozzles are best used for Brachistochrone transfers, because they allow you to engage time warp while thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also makes them great for asteroid tugs. And they only get better with larger asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an E-class asteroid, being able to time warp while thrusting has the side benefit of getting rid of any wobble that the ship might have experienced from putting hundreds of kN thru a single Klaw connection, and it doesn\u0027t require that much thrust in the first place.
