MJ only seems to want to work with RCS on, otherwise it acts as a completely dead stick. Sometimes, I have to toggle RCS off, then on, to make MJ react. No movement on the pitch/yaw/roll pins until I do the toggle. This typically happens when I undock from my fuel station, and start to use the auto-land function. For example, if I turn on RCS after undocking, I back off manually from my fuel station, and then if I turn off RCS, tell MJ to turn retrograde with Smart ASS, I get a dead stick. The craft doesn\u0027t rotate, and the P/Y/R icons don\u0027t move. If I manually rotate, everything is hunky-dory, but MJ is just dead. If I toggle RCS on, MJ wakes up immediately starts to rotate the tug. Turn off RCS while its doing the maneuver, dead stick. When I use the auto-land feature, it lands as expected, (I don\u0027t remember if I have to toggle RCS on descent to wake MJ up) I hit the action group (Brakes toggle - Figure this would work since I don\u0027t have wheels on the tug) to kick off the mining gear, and then wait. RCS is usually manually turned off at this point not waste fuel as the SAS is able to keep the craft straight, or I\u0027ve landed on a flat enough area to not worry about it. Once mining is completed, I auto-launch to a 25k orbit. MJ launches the craft, does the initial ascent, gets onto the right trajectory while burning, all the way up and starts turning at about 3k up, but on ascent if RCS is off, once it shuts down the engine to wait to get to AP, I get a dead stick again until I toggle RCS on, then it wakes up, reorients, then time-warps and gets into the orbit. Nothing is assigned to the RCS action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of other things as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ve got the ActionGroupManager installed, and have used it to assign the ABORT button to undock the tug from the station. There are no other assignments to ABORT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With RCS turned OFF on the station, tug docked or not, MJ is still able to rotate the station to the orientation I want. The P/Y/R icons move as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Both the station and the tug are robotic. The station has SEVERAL robotic control modules. No Kerbals installed. The tug has way over 3,000 electrical charge, with a single RTG to ensure an \u0022always on\u0022 state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular tug has its days numbered.

I\u0027m not doubting you, but have you got a reference for that? I wonder if a mod could be written to verify that a root part is selected, and if not, find the command pod, and make it active. At least THAT\u0027D be better than a dead stick.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been mentioned quite a few times up the thread. Also the issue where when two ships get close enough for docking (where you can select each other\u0027s docking ports) you\u0027re unable to right click on command (pod) or control (docking ports etc) parts to get the control menu until going to space center then back to the space view. I didn;t run into that one until I tried to rendezvous two ships in Eve orbit, loaded from the same craft file. Now it happens quite often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with auto selecting when more than one control capable part is present on a craft is selecting the right one. Should it just auto select the one closest to the front *and* aligned with the thrust vector? What about ships where not all the engines or control parts are aligned on the same vector?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best fix (aside from Squad fixing it) is for MechJeb to be able to detect that no control/command part is set as the active one then popping up a warning like it does when docking autopilot is enabled and control is NOT set to a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first encountered this with my kethane satellites around duna and Ike after upgrading from .22 to .23. the satellites wouldn\u0027t change orientation, nor wout their thtottles work, until I set the OKTO2 to control from here. Every ship now I have to explicitly set a control part when the ship it\u0027s on is separated from the main ship, even when there is only one part with command and/or control capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an oddity with MechJeb and control where it can still control the orientation of ships via reaction wheels even after all the electric charge is gone. RCS and throttle don\u0027t work but the ship can still be flipped this way and that. I haven\u0027t tested every part individually with reaction wheels, might just be some in the ReStock pack, but no charge should be no control, no how.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T07:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mystique\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mystique\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFound very strange thingy during docking, can someone else try to reproduce it?\u003Cp\u003EMothership and lander both have MJ. Mothership was left in KILL ROT mode after undocking lander. When lander returned (and I think it started when I targeted docking port), mothership started to respond on lander\u0027s controls, like pitch/yaw/roll (thanks Kthulhu not throttle). It was definitely responding on lander\u0027s key input and it stopped when I switched to mothership and turned it on stock SAS.

When it happens, you\u0027ll probably have to switch to another craft/scene to unload the afflicted ships.
