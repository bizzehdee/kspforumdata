Just something to get used to, I guess. Personally I used double line breaks in my posts on the old software far more often than singles, for paragraph spacing, but of course YMMV.\n\u003E \n\n*Double spacing* is a typewriter thing. Real typography is virtually never double spaced, and if Word does it, it\u0027s just another example of Word adding new features without being able to do text properly. \n\nI made my judgement based upon the claim up the thread that line spacing was defaulted to double, however. A quick look at actual text shows that this is not the case anyway, and it is only double-spacing on a carriage return (line break). This is NOT \u0022default double spacing,\u0022 though, that implies a global leading setting of something like 200-240% of font size, so that even flowed text would be double-spaced (which would be awful to try and read). Bottom line is that the forum flows text at normal spacing, and a line return adds a line.\n\nThe last paragraph, actually double-spaced (to see how awful real double spacing would be):\n\nI made my judgement based upon the claim up the thread that line spacing was defaulted to double, however.
