Gone. Was really looking forward to using this mod, which I know I can still use it in 1.6.1 as I have a working install. But there will presumably be no more support or updates for the mod, and with it\u0027s ARR license, well that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156312-andrewdrawsprettypictures/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156312\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156312-andrewdrawsprettypictures/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@AndrewDrawsPrettyPictures\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Even though I just discovered your mod recently, I really did\u00A0enjoy the idea of it and am in awe of the amazing work you had put into Extrasolar.
