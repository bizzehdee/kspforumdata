A rocket is going to orbit and you go to use the RCS and then you see the RCS jets firing through the payload fairing. Surely the system should be that only the current stage RCS should fire or alternatively any control surface or RCS that is inside a fairing should have NO control or activity until the fairings are blown off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to have to manually disable the RCS on the upper stages that are hidden inside the fairing (well, using action groups that is). Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to have only the current stage RCS working by default and let you turn on the upper stages RCS only if needed. Inside a fairing, the RCS should stay off until the fairings are blown off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T11:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr,RCS should use fuel only from the lower stage.
