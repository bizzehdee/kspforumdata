I think this is because I wanted my rockets to \u0022look\u0022 cool. But as I started to get a feel for the VAB and piloting rockets, I started putting things through various quality control checks and tests. For example, on landing missions I\u0027ll make separate files for the lander and payload sections. With each section, I\u0027ll do tests until I\u0027m reasonably confident they will do the job. Once I\u0027m happy with their respective designs, I\u0027ll make a sub-assembly of one and add it to the other. I\u0027ve adopted this mentality with all my projects now and rarely do I encounter failure during the actual missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how do you guys do it? Do you just build something and hope for the best when you hit space bar? When you have something that almost works, do you simply launch it over and over until it does? Or do you critically analyse things, read the mission logs when there are failures, and employ reliability engineering techniques when something is flaky until you have a reliable design?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T23:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1812overture]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xKgSl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
