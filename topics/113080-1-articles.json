It has multiple antennas, docking ports, solar panels, RTGs. And that condition was marked as complete when I launched. Now that it\u0027s in orbit of pol, it is saying incomplete.\n\nCould the fact that it docked with an older ship to refuel have reset the launch date somehow? Is there a way to fix this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T15:09:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by phunk**"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:59:29Z","Content":"Yes, contracts don\u0027t like that.
