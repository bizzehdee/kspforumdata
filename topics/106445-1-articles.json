So I\u0027ve put that thing together, limited the thrust to 92% which is where they wouldn\u0027t overheat in 0.90, hyperedited to a 125 km orbit and hit \u0022Z\u0022\n\nFourteen minutes later, the jet fuel tanks blew up\n\n![amec7l.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/amec7l.jpg)\n\nNow, I think there are issues here anyway.

Radiators are absolutely neccessary.\n\nHmmm, what makes you say there needs to be a \u0022heatsink\u0022, as in a solid object that absorbs heat? There\u0027s no necessity for such a thing. Anything cooler than the heat source will absorb heat, and that something can be nothing (as in vacuum).\n\nThe ability of a substance to absorb heat is defined by its specific heat. The higher the specific heat, the more energy it absorbs to change 1 degree of temperature (whether F, C, or K). Specific heat can be defined as at a constant pressure (Cp) or constant volume (Cv). So let\u0027s look at specific heats.\n\nLandbased nuclear reactors are cooled by water. This is a closed, constant-volume system in the reactor. This water absorbs heat from the core, loses it in a heat exchanger, and goes back into the core. The heat exchanger heats up another water system, which turns to steam, spins turbines (losing heat), then goes through the big cooling towers (a type of radiator) to lose the rest (which is most of it). So, in this case, the ultimate \u0022heatsink\u0022 is the atmosphere surrounding the cooling towers. As concerns what happens in the reactor itself, the elevant measure is the Cv for water, which is 4.19 kJ/kg K.\n\nNuclear engines are cooled by hydrogen, which expands out the nozzle to prodcue thrust. The engine runs at a constant pressure to achieve a given thrust. The relevant measure then is the Cp of hydrogen, which is 14.32 kJ/kg K. The heat sink is the surrounding vacuum, into which the exhaust carries off heat.\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that hydrogen is 3.4 times better at absorbing heat than water. And that\u0027s saying a lot, because water has about the highest specific heat of anything commonly available at ambient conditions. But the problem is, liquid hydrogen has a density of only 70.85 kg/m^3 whereas water is 1000 kg/m^3 by definition. Thus, you can put 14 times more mass of water than you can liquid hydrogen in a tank of a given size. But because hydrogen is 3.4 times better at absorbing heat, that tank of water can only absorb 4 times as much heat as if it was full of hydrogen.\n\nSo at the bottom line, hydrogen is far from \u0022pathetic\u0022 as an absorber of heat. Sure, you do need \u0022olympic swimming pools\u0022 of it, but that\u0027s why those real rocket designs shown by Brotoro have so many friggin\u0027 huge tanks.\n\nAnd here we run into a problem with the game, not hydrogen. Stock KSP doesn\u0027t have an LH2 resource, so has no proportionally huge LH2 tanks. Instead, we\u0027re just using \u0022liquid fuel\u0022, which we suppose is kerosine that can be used by both jets and chemical rockets. Kerosine, FWIW, has a Cp of only 2.01, half that of water. If you want LH2 tanks, get the Near Future mod and you\u0027ll have your \u0022olympic swimming pools\u0022, plus nuke engines that use it and a patch to make the stock LV-N use it, too.\n\nSo take from this that nuclear engines are designed to handle the heat they make, and can indeed use LH2 for that purpose because it actually works pretty good. And the real NERVA XE was ready for flight testing when the politicians pulled the plug on the space race. So let\u0027s have no more of that. In real life, the system works without overheating.\n\nNow, back to the real issue, which is that the LV-N is broken. It does NOT need radiators, it needs its ridiculous and unrealistic overheating problem totally taken out, knocked in the head, and buried in an unmarked grave."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:08:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Umm... *yes*, that\u0027s why I said there must be some radiator in that design somewhere.
