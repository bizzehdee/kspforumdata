These cores can expose this extra hardware as a \u0022virtual\u0022 core, but that core shares resources with the \u0022real\u0022 core, meaning that depending on what is going on, the \u0022virtual\u0022 core may or may not be able to be utilized fully. That\u0027s why your mathlab code didn\u0027t run any faster, because it either wasn\u0027t multithreaded, or if it was, the threads were competing for the shared resource (which is, I believe, generally an FPU, or Floating Point Unit, which does floating point math, and which KSP would use heavily...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022 data-cite=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnity 5 introduces multi-threaded physics.
