Obviously these launch windows would be fairly rare so some kind of tolerance would need to be included, to allow people to GA more regularly at the cost of efficiency via imperfections in lunar angle at the given window. Also, even more rare windows could be achieved by using a double GA from munar GA into a minmus GA, assuming all of the planets/moons are aligned correctly, for me this would be the holy grail of gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently trying to GA probes into interplanetary intercepts but because the windows for an accurate GA are quite very small, I tend to end up spending almost as much dV trying to fine tune my orbit into an encounter as I would if I just flew direct from kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T10:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the option to plan a complete missions trajectory in mission control before launching would be really nice and could include this in a graphical way. Just pull some nodes and see, what happens during the mission... However it could kill those little surprises you get during missions... Something like this must be thought through really carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T14:04:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be under mod requests, as it is not under what is planned in the game.
