Terrain set to low, Antialiasing off, minimum settings except rendering at simple. Getting 12 fps. I get higher framerate on lower performance gpus like the intel I3 - HD graphics 4000. There is no logical reason for ksp on near minimum to use more graphics power than battlefield 4/arma 3 on full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: AMD A10 5800k OC 5ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: MSI r7 265 OC 1050mhz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 8gb, 4gb allocated to KSP 32 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS: Windows 7 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStats: GPU usage - 100%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU usage - 6% \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eallocated RAM usage - 1.2 GB/4GB \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaging file usage - 0GB/32GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForce Opengl results in lower frame-rate than default DX11.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo crafts launched, clean save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Switching from FSSS x4 to EDSS x12EQ seems to have increased framerate. But it still should be alot higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: It seems that Post process anti-aliasing is using alot more gpu than it should on a simple game like ksp. The ksp version of anti-aliasing is just blurring, basically unusable. I found the best combination of looks and performance is Adaptive multisampling with edge-detect 24x \u002B EQ. It still is using a ridiculous amount considering that games like battlefield 4 uses less for much higher graphics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows a way to anti-alias KSP without completely killing the gpu please reply. I know its a beta and its not optimized but even ARMA 3 runs better than this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T00:52:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kokowang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T19:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also once had a problem like this.
