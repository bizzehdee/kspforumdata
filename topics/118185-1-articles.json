If you can splashdown, and especially if you can move around on the water or in the air afterwards, somewhere like the Mediterranean would give you access to a broad array of natural biomes and potentially access up the Nile to access subsaharan Africa, while presenting minimal landing hazards. Keep in mind that a pre-human Europe would be just about as interesting as Africa, whether we\u0027re talking prehistoric megafauna or simply modern era biodiversity minus the existence of humans (Europe had lions in recorded history, keep in mind!). Another good site, particularly if sea or sea/air travel are viable, is anywhere around the Indonesian archipelago. Really significant biodiversity on the islands themselves as well as geological activity, access to Australia (self explanatory), access to Asian mainland not too distant. With underwater survey equipment, Marianas Trench is also not far distant from this corner of the world, as well as the fact that you\u0027d have access to both Indian and Pacific Oceans, which are distinct from each other without being separated by continents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, Panama is a great site for a terrestrial landing. Assuming you can cross the jungle, you have land or air access to two oceans with a natural separation greater than almost any on earth, so this has strategic as well as biological significance.

Two continents, two oceans, geologically active, equatorial access, pretty much all you can ask for for either science or colonization.

A coast line is viable as a secondary source of food if crops fail, seeing as you can fish with the way more than abundant fish and seaweed. The coast has a shipping ability to transfer resources. The coast also has rocks and minerals for settlements, and water for drinking if you brought a purifier with you.
