I\u0027m not sure how that would turn out. All that matters to a wing is pressure altitude when it comes to the coefficient of lift attributed by the atmosphere. If that pressure altitude translates to anything close to Earths 29.92 inches of barometric pressure at Earths sea level, you should be fine. The higher the pressure altitude (the less molecules per square inch) the less effective wings will become, and the LARGER your wings will have to be (OR faster) to have the same lift. But it\u0027s not an exact science due to all the different types of drag that comes with more speed or more weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my (un)professional opinion, I\u0027d personally say an airplane would be a lot less efficient on Mars, but I don\u0027t know how the weaker gravity and colder air will affect a wings ability to lift an aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Czman007","CreatedById":22578,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T17:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jebbe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jebbe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried on Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have, you have have a lot more lift than you need on Kerbin.
