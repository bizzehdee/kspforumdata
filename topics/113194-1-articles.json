The ISP or MPG as you put it just goes through the floor under any sort of atmospheric pressure. This is an easy pitfall. Right-Click on an engine in the parts list for more information and pay attention to it\u0027s ISP at sea level (I_ASL) and in a vacuum (I_VAC). 1st stage engines should have I_ASL of 275 or greater at sea level. Later stages should be I_VAC 320 or better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) KER is a great mod. To begin with the info you want to pay attention to is TWR (thrust to weight ratio) and DV. You need TWR to get off the pad and DV is how much useful work your built configuration can manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Accent speed. You want a TWR of 1.1 to 1.3. If you over-engine a craft you\u0027re both wasting DV hauling up engines that you don\u0027t need and flying too fast in atmosphere that\u0027s too thick. The overpowered rocket is also likely to have stability issues. If you\u0027re using an engine that can throttle, TWR of up to 1.5 is acceptable as long as you throttle down a bit around Mach1 (~350ms) to about 75-80% until you\u0027re above 10km. The key to an efficient accent is to match terminal velocity. Faster and you fight air resistance too much. Slower and you\u0027re basically spending some of your fuel hovering by eating time. For this reason Solid rocket boosters are acceptable to get quickly up to speed (TWR ~2) as long as they are discarded before you overspeed (You can also limit their thrust in the VAB to keep TWR down). It\u0027s tricky to tell the terminal velocity, but if you get re-entry heating on ascent you\u0027re definitely going too fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Ascent angle. There\u0027s a bit of an art to this. I nose-over to 10 deg at about 100ms and try to aim for 45 deg by 15km, 70 deg by 30km and hold that until my apoapsis breaks atmosphere. Then I shut down engines and circularise at Apoapsis of about 75km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Burn efficiency. The most efficient place to change apoapsis is to burn at periapsis. Similarly to change periapsis burn at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T15:08:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T14:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too consider Mechjeb a valuable learning device.

The overpowered rocket is also likely to have stability issues. If you\u0027re using an engine that can throttle, TWR of up to 1.5 is acceptable as long as you throttle down a bit around Mach1 (~350ms) to about 75-80% until you\u0027re above 10km. The key to an efficient accent is to match terminal velocity. Faster and you fight air resistance too much. Slower and you\u0027re basically spending some of your fuel hovering by eating time. For this reason Solid rocket boosters are acceptable to get quickly up to speed (TWR ~2) as long as they are discarded before you overspeed (You can also limit their thrust in the VAB to keep HER down).

Add a bit more for piloting errors, and you end up around 4000 dV to get to low Kerbin orbit (LKO). As your piloting skills improve, this number will decrease a bit. If you\u0027re using a lot more dV than that to get into orbit, then you need to examine with a critical eye how you pilot yourself into orbit. \u0022But how do I calculate my dV?\u0022 Well, you can look at the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation and crunch some numbers (I would recommend doing this a couple of times by hand to fully understand what\u0027s going on), or you could one of the game modes to compute it for you. MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer Redux come to mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do something once you\u0027re in orbit, you will need more than 3500 dV. There are a number of dV maps available that tell you how much additional dV you need to get from one celestial body to another. For example, to go from LKO to a low Munar orbit, you will need around 1170 dV. This is in addition to what you used to launch yourself into LKO originally. When you plan to modify your orbit by placing a maneuver node, a bar appears next to your navball telling you how much dV that maneuver will cost. I have a contract satellite rocket with a dV of around 6500 that I use to complete pretty much any \u0022position a satellite\u0022 contract that is around Kerbin, Mun, or Minmus. In some cases, I can complete two or more contracts with the same satellite. I also have in orbit around Kerbin, just waiting for a good transfer window for Duna/Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How do I design a rocket that has more dV?\u0022 dV is related to the Isp of the current rocket stage and the current wet and dry masses of the rocket (wet mass is the rocket\u0027s mass including whatever fuel it currently has in it, dry mass is a rocket\u0027s mass excluding the current stage\u0027s fuel). So to end up with a higher dV you need to use an engine with a higher Isp, or make the ratio of wet mass to dry mass larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso important is TWR. If your thrust is less than your rocket\u0027s weight, you are not going into space today. In the Vehicle Assembly Building, each rocket engine lists its thrust at sea level on Kerbin (ASL) and in space (Vac.). When designing a rocket to get off the launchpad, use the ASL thrust values to determine TWR (Kerbal Engineer Redux appears to compute TWR using the Vac. number instead for some reason... maybe I missed a setting somewhere). The engine thrust values are listed in kilonewtons (kN). To compute your TWR, you need the weight of your rocket in the same units of kN. To obtain this, take your rocket\u0027s mass in metric tons and multiply it by the gravity of the celestial body you\u0027re on (9.81 kN/ton for Kerbin, I believe). Then simply divide the rocket\u0027s thrust by its weight, and you have TWR. If it\u0027s greater than 1.0, you can get off the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring launch you are fighting two things -- gravity and air resistance. The less time you spend getting to orbit, the better... you use less dV to gravity on your way up if you go quickly. \u0022So why not just make my TWR something like 10.0 then?\u0022 Well, there\u0027s that other thing -- air resistance -- that you need to worry about. Air resistance increases as your speed increases, and (generally speaking... others will correct me, I\u0027m sure) does so roughly as the the square of the speed increase... double your speed, and air resistance goes up by a factor of 4. A TWR of 10.0 would get you to supersonic speed before you reach 1000m off the launchpad, and you will experience a very strong drag force as a result. You end up using dV to fight the air resistance. As you ascend through the atmosphere, the air density decreases and so does the air resistance; getting out of the lower atmosphere before really piling on the speed helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you end up with a balancing act... you want to get to orbit quickly so that you don\u0027t use up too much dV fighting gravity, but you also don\u0027t want to get moving so quickly that you use up too much dV fighting air resistance. Tweaking your TWR up or down affects where you are in this balancing act.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this experiment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a very simple rocket... a Mk1 Command Pod with a Mk16 Parachute on top, powered by an RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Rocket Booster. In the Vehicle Assembly Building, right-click on the booster and set the thrust limiter to some value. Go and launch this test rocket straight up and see how high it goes. Then change the thrust limiter to some other value and repeat the test. You will find that you can get vastly different maximum altitudes, depending on what you set the thrust limiter to. You are effectively dialing up and down the rocket\u0027s TWR. Note that the rocket\u0027s dV remains constant at 650 m/s, no matter what you set the TWR to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I did this experiment, I got the following results\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ELimiter 100%, TWR 8.70, dV 650 m/s, 4457 m max altitude\u003Cbr\u003ELimiter  10%, TWR 0.87, dV 650 m/s, 895 m max altitude\u003Cbr\u003ELimiter  25%, TWR 2.17, dV 650 m/s, 5595 m max altitude\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the thrust limiter set at 100%, I observed supersonic shockwave effects on the rocket before it even reached 1000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why did you end up with nearly 900 m for a max altitude when the launch TWR was less than 1.0? Shouldn\u0027t it have stayed on the launchpad?\u0022 Well, it did... for quite a while. As the solid fuel burned off, the rocket got lighter and lighter, and eventually the TWR climbed above 1.0, and up we went! Of course, around 2/3 of the fuel was burned sitting on the pad, fighting gravity and losing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turned out that for this rocket, a launch TWR of 2.17 (thrust limiter at 25%) provided the greatest max altitude. Setting the thrust limiter even 0.5% on either side of 25% resulted in lower max altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three of these cases used the same 650 m/s dV, but the 2.17 TWR case found the minimum amount of dV lost fighting gravity and air resistance for that test rocket. TWR values higher than this ended up losing more dV fighting increased air resistance, while lower TWR values lost more dV fighting gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent rocket designs will have different optimal TWR values for getting up out of the atmosphere and into orbit. There is no single perfect TWR number. For example, while the test rocket above liked a TWR of 2.17, my standard LKO tourist rocket would flip around backwards mid-flight if I tried to give it that TWR. It prefers a launch TWR around 1.35. People frequently toss around values between 1.2 and 2.0. Testing is the key here. Also worth noting is that your TWR constantly changes during your ascent, as you are burning fuel and thus losing mass. What started off as a TWR of 1.4 may well end up as a TWR of 3.0 by the time the fuel runs out unless you adjust the throttle somewhere along the way. Don\u0027t let your TWR get too high until you are out of the thicker parts of the atmosphere, or else you will end up going too fast and air resistance will teach you a lesson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo getting to orbit is a matter of sufficient dV and a TWR that gets you to orbit quickly, but doesn\u0027t go so fast that you lose a lot of dV moving air out of your way. Then all you need to do is follow a nice ascent profile (piloting skills). The ascent profile gets you up and out of the lower atmosphere promptly, so that you can start going faster, sooner. A nice ascent profile starts off vertical and ends with the rocket in orbit, travelling horizontally, all in one continuous smooth turn. As with TWR, different rockets will require different ascent profiles to maximize efficiency. Some are better off beginning the turn very early, while others need to go straight up a little longer before turning. It has a lot to do with the distribution of mass and drag sources on your rocket. Others have already posted a common ascent profile that works for lots of rocket designs (straight up to around 100 m/s velocity, then turn 5-10 degrees off vertical, and continue turning further and further, aiming for 45 degrees at about 15000 m altitude). By about 50-60 km you should be nearly horizontal, putting all your dV into increasing your orbital speed (going sideways rather than going up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to PnDB\u0027s suggestion to describe your rocket (maybe post a picture).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroadly speaking, if you\u0027re having trouble getting to orbit, it could be a design problem or a piloting problem, and if you don\u0027t know which it is, I can see how that would be really frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try to narrow it down... post a ship, get a critique.

The top stage has a Mk1 cockpit; Science Jr.; a service bay with two Goo Containers, two Barometers, and two Thermometers, along with a Z-200 battery and an Inline Reaction Wheel thinger); a heat shield; and landing micro-struts to soften the impact / prevent the Science Jr. from blowing up. All of that\u0027s topped off with a basic antenna, a Mk16 axial parachute, and two Mk2-R radial parachutes. The \u0022Get into orbit\u0022 stage has a FL-T800 fuel tank (or equivalent) and a LV-909 Terrier engine. Finally, two more FL-T800s and an LV-T45 Swivel Engine, four stabilizing winglets, and four Thumper SRBs (sometimes set to all fire at once; sometimes set to fire a pair, jettison, fire the next pair).

Using two radially-mounted Z-100 batteries instead, no barometers (this is in career mode and I hadn\u0027t unlocked them yet), and no landing struts. The upper stage fuel is the KW SA-2 LFT tank, which holds 216 \u0022units\u0022 of liquid fuel, making it just slightly less than an FL-T400 \u002B FL-T100, sitting on top of the usual LV-909 Terrier. The lifting stage is a KW SA-4 LFT plus another SA-2 LFT, which between them have 648 \u0022units\u0022 of liquid fuel (compared to the 720 \u0022units\u0022 above from the two FL-T800s).

Here a powerful engine could be very useful, however an engine like that will probably be too heavy to bring up to 50\u002B km, so don\u0027t worry about atmospheric efficiency once you go above 35 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still having problems, post screenshots of the craft in VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T15:51:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tutike2000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T16:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PnDB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PnDB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(Kerbal Engineer Redux appears to compute TWR using the Vac. number instead for some reason... maybe I missed a setting somewhere).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust click the \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 button at the top of the KER window in the VAB to make it simulate atmospheric conditions.
