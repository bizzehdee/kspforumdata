Make docking ports rotate to exact 90 deg, so we can always have pretty looking space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Stock fairings and heat shields, I know aero fix is not going to happen soon, but how we can show KSP for friends, that are very new to space flights, without pretty rockets? Newbies have no idea about space planes, for them space exploration is all about rockets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I would like to see in next few versions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Planning flights like in post above and some kind of alarm clock for better control over multiple flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. More parts... more tiny parts, right now we have only two fuel tanks in that size, would be great to have spherical tank like for mono propellant and tiny jet engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore parts between sizes 0.625m and 2.5m, because of cargo bays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore manned capsules with different shapes and features, some may have RCS fuel some not, some may have build-in other features like solar panels on one side or chutes. Something like Boeing bigelow would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Life support, I read great idea how to do this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96434-Morale-and-Efficiency-How-to-fix-OPness-of-one-man-craft-and-many-other-problems\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96434-Morale-and-Efficiency-How-to-fix-OPness-of-one-man-craft-and-many-other-problems\u003C/a\u003E Of course in hard mode kerbals should die after some time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I have no idea what mechanic it would need, but it would be great to have control over few crafts at same time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example we can build Falcon 9 like 100% reusable rocket, but we can\u0027t reuse it because KSP won\u0027t let us to land with 1st stage and at same time reach orbit with 2nd stage\u002Bpayload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing is with Virgin Galactic White knight two, if we want to land our payload won\u0027t reach orbit, if we make orbit White knight two is going to fall almost like rock and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is because of physics engine unload crafts that are farther than 2.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MattW93","CreatedById":114195,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T11:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMission Planners. It\u0027s always frustrating to get a craft into orbit and then not know whether it\u0027s in a good position to reach, say, Duna. Real missions are planned well in advance so they know exactly how hard to burn, where and when. Other things I would like to see include life support. Also cameras to put on unmanned vehicles so you can actually get a look at the planets over which you\u0027re flying using the IVA mechanic. Maybe they could include some kind of science gain, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
