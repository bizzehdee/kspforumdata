I try to look around my craft and cannot move very far so I have to move the whole lot up... THEN THE CAMERA ZOOMS OFF and I can\u0027t get my ship back in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, the VAB is WAY easier to use. What is with the silly invisible walls that make plane building a chore instead of fun. If you are putting together big planes it gets to be a right pain in the bum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPLEASE tell me there is a mod that lets you expand the Spaceplane hanger. I tried searching here but they still haven\u0027t fixed the search engine. Worse. Search. Engine. EVER!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously peeved atm because the I just want to put together my VTOL and every time I try I come across weird stuff that I never see in the VAB. The camera control is really bad. What I don\u0027t get is why does it happen in the SPH and not the VAB. At one point I was zooming round the hanger and I wasn\u0027t even touching the controls.
