It gives an external motivation to go to new places, new activities to do at those places, and provides an excellent experience for newer players by avoiding overwhelming them with parts. The science/tech tree mechanics are still relatively unpolished, but they do provide a different sort of challenge for new and experienced players alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox mode is also fun for many players. It provides the freedom to take on any mission out of the gate, using any parts in the game. It is more satisfying for those that find the science system \u0022grindy\u0022. The challenges are those the players set for themselves, which to some is a virtue of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode benefits from some sort of progression as the player climbs the tech tree, and so benefits from increasingly better parts unlocking over time. Sandbox has everything available from the start, and so benefits from all parts being mostly balanced against each other. It would seem like these two ideals are mutually exclusive, or at the very least contradictory enough that it is difficult to satisfy both camps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my main question is: Can both Career Mode and Sandbox Mode be balanced simultaneously with the same parts and game mechanics?

I\u0027d say that large parts should perform somewhat better, if only because it\u0027s bad for game performance to have to use clusters. However, neither should it end up better to use a massively overpowered engine for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give an example, let\u0027s say I want to propel one orange tank with a TWR of around 2. Four LV-T45s will do that nicely and give 5,140 m/s of (vacuum) delta-V. A Skipper and two Mark 55 radials will give 4,840 to 4,970 m/s, depending on how much I use the less efficient radial engines, which isn\u0027t too bad. A Mainsail is massively overpowered for this job and the dV drops to 4,630, which is how I\u0027d expect things to be; the Mainsail\u0027s a silly choice for the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I put the new KR-2L engine on, and get 5,200 m/s of delta-v along with three times the thrust I need.

The range of things can be extended without the new parts outclassing the old, for example you can unlock at one extreme the Mainsail with high TWR but low Isp, and at the other extreme the nuclear and ion engines with massive Isp but dreadful TWR. Both expand the possibilities of what you can do but neither render other stuff obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s qualitatively different additions to the tech. Aircraft parts, docking ports, landing legs, rover wheels, RTGs, and so on.

Some people feel that there should be parts that are strictly better than other similarly purposed parts, so that they can be exposed in a progression as the tech tree is ascended. This results in the parts mix being unbalanced in sandbox and the career mode endgame as there are parts that are literally outclassed by their later counterparts.\u003Cp\u003EThe question could be boiled down to: Are strictly better parts required to maximize the enjoyment of career mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that perspective, the ARM update was a waste of time, as it improved neither scope-completion nor balance.

Parts that unlock more possibilities and/or are more \u003Cem\u003Econvenient\u003C/em\u003E on the other hand, I think are required, which is what we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, convenient simply equals bigger. For example, the starting sizes of engines and tanks do well for missions with the single kerbal command pod and with some ingenuity and experience, you could probably send that poor kerbal anywhere in the Kerbol system with them. But then you start unlocking other options, say the three kerbal command pod. That\u0027s good because you open up more mission types, say Apollo style Mun landings. But the three kerbal pod doesnt work so nicely with the smaller fuel tanks. It can certainly be \u003Cem\u003Emade\u003C/em\u003E to work but it\u0027s more convenient to use the Rockomax sized parts. Or, if you\u0027re prepared to sacrifice some convenience (e.g. clustering) you can get better performance (or at least more finely graded performance that\u0027s tuned for the payload at hand) by mixing up \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure where the new parts fit with this progression - havn\u0027t had a chance to play with them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T18:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERemember, once there was only sandbox, and we spent just as much time debating the balance of parts then.
