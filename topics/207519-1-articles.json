And as the same mass occupies by 2..3 orders of magnitude greater volume, the gas pressure will be significantly lower, and probably not enough hot to make\u00A0fireball be opaque and supersonic, and thus to run a shockwave.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, probably it will look like a transparent glowing spehere, a burst of wind, and a bright gas cloud from the surface, causing a secondary shockwave, stronger than the thin air motion, but much weaker than on the Earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe said about the radiation stays same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlikely a mushroom cloud will appear, as the air is too thin to form a stable toroidal cloud.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore probably, a huge toroidal dust cloud will just cover the whole area and dissipate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Venusian atmospheric pressure should make the classic fireball 4..5 times smaller, but the total energy stays same.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the \u0022air\u0022 density is much greater, the same air mass, which can be pushed, occupies much lesser volume. So the shockwave energy will likely dissipate at several times lesser distance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlike the ocean of water (which is incompressible), the gas is compressible and viscous, so the shockwave energy will be quickly turning into the energy\u00A0 of gas friction, and heating the \u0022air\u0022 up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the smaller fireball caused by the X-rays absorption, together with smaller shockwave area, should form a bubble of hot but subsonic air, compressed enough to be glowing and release the total energy as light and partially X-rays.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the objects at GZ would suffer from high pressure, but as they are Venusian object, they anyway should be enough strong to withstand 90 atm = 9 000 kPa.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe best shelter on the Earth () are 300..500 kPa strong. Minuteman silos are 2 000 psi ~= 10 MPa strong.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it will be ok with the Venusian objects, except with the one being hit directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe total energy being mostly released as light, will heat up the Venusian surface... Oh wait... Heat up the Venusian surface???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mushroom cloud will form, but as the air mass will take away its energy much quicker, will be much lower.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the same time, it will be cooling much slower due to hot air around, so probably will turn into several hot clouds lifting up and dissipating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA gas giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbsqWozEBBw?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-07T08:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2022 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-03T14:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat mark on Jupiter from Shoemaker-Levy looks a lot like the bruises I got from getting hit by paintballs at close range...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-03T15:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure there would be no significant differences between a neutron bomb in a vacuum and in an atmosphere.\u00A0 If anything, the bomb would be worse as none of the neutrons would be absorbed by the atmosphere.\u00A0 Such bombs are a bit specialized, damaging life and little else, so you would have to have significant life (like a population) to even notice the damage of the bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"awsumguy76801","CreatedById":212243,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-03T18:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut shoemaker levy 9 was a comet which caused impact energy millions of times of the biggest nukes we have. im saying what if you were to drop a tsar bomba on jupiter or saturn or the ice giants. would the mushroom cloud expand down because there is no ground so it would be like a double mushroom cloud going both up and down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-03T18:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224111002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649010140\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212243\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022awsumguy76801\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, awsumguy76801 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut shoemaker levy 9 was a comet which caused impact energy millions of times of the biggest nukes we have. im saying what if you were to drop a tsar bomba on jupiter or saturn or the ice giants. would the mushroom cloud expand down because there is no ground so it would be like a double mushroom cloud going both up and down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFireballs rise because of the immense heat inside (hot air rises).

the table, and highly probably still are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA long (meters) and thin (millimeters) metal rod with the nuke energy applied from one end, makes its X-ray radiation coherent and reemits it from the opposite end in axial direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s an X-ray collimator.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA bunch of many rods (around the targeting telescope inside) emits a bunch of thin rays mixing into one thick ray, and can hit/heat a target at ~1 000 km distance..\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I have a 1980s Soviet book from my schoolhood with elementary calculations.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast years I have been occasionally watching pdfs with more detailed and advanced things far beyond the elementary ones from that book.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany (most?) of them metion both X-ray and gamma lasers, as mostly the temperature defines the spectrum of emission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the hit range of such device of reasonable (for 1980s tech) mass and dimensions is about 1 000 km, while ICBM trajectory is ~10 000 km long, LEO sat semi-orbit is ~20 000 km long, and HEO sat is ~36 000 km high, this means that an X-rays warhead in many cases should be first delivered to the target proximity like any other warhead, rather than just float in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso this means that it doesn\u0027t need a close fly-by and a proper flight heading, it should just pass in hundreds of kilometers from the target and rotate with the telescope into its direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I believe, such X-ray/gamma laser warheads are the most probable hi-tech star wars until the humanity invents an Existence Improbability Field and Virtual Annihilation Resonant Ray making them traditional weapons obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn turn , laser or not, the initiating nuke sends the energy in all directions, so mostly wastes it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, in 1980s they were often painting a hedgehog of rod bunches around the nuke, to use its energy on several targets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s maybe a good idea against a dense cloud of warheads, but hardly for far and standalone targets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a directed nuke is an efficient source of energy for this device.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what is the directed nuke?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s exactly what the whole Orion project had grown from, is based on, to be propelled by and armed with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth berillium pusher/filler and tungsten membrane are heated by the shaped nuke explosion and concentrate the energy in the required direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust in Orion and Casaba it\u0027s used to send a mechanical hit towards the pusher plate and the target respectively, while in the X-rays laser it should heat the rod bunch from the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I believe the X-ray laser is another twin project of the Orion and Casaba, and the only thing changed is the suspended pusher plate ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(As obviously nobody will spend hundreds of nuke charges for the reasons of pollution, cost, and proliferation in case of the ship loss, probably it will be implemented only in MiniMag Orion version, a century later.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlsoas the obvious tendention based on the raising accuracy is to use as lower yield as possible, the same Casba/Orion things are probably studied for hit a ground target from top and distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
