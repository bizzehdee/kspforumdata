For example, I\u0027m playing through New Horizons mod right now, and there are a lot of new worlds with atmospheres, and it\u0027s hard to keep mental track of which ones are oxygenated. I have to go open the .cfg file to figure it out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether an atmosphere has oxygen or not is pretty important, right up there with height and pressure.
