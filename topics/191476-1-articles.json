The \u0022Spring/Damper\u0022 settings could be too stiff or too soft. My suggestion is to fiddle around with the settings a bit, make the spring strength and damper strength higher or lower (on all wheels!) and see if you find a setting that works. Right now my guess is that the spring strength or the damper strength is too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-09T19:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for these answers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni did not change the initial settings of damper and springs, it\u2019s the default game settings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u2019ll try them both and look at that barometer stuck on one wheel!
