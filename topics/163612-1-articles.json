When I launch the Mk3 shuttle cockpit, the game does not revert at launch - it hangs getting\u00A0stuck at loading back\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Subsequent reverts on other ships don\u0027t work from that point on. Typically at that point, I would need to remove *all* the saved ships from the game, not just the one with the Mk3 shuttle cockpit and restart which will restore functionality until i try to launch the shuttle cockpit again. I don\u0027t have any ships a few bytes in size\u00A0lying around - a cause identified on other threads. The log stops spitting lines with no error so I can\u0027t trace it. With no error in the log... I am in the dark here. I guess to justify posting... I need to ask a question... Anyone experienced this? A more technical question I guess will be ... what could go wrong in the sequence of loading back the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E during a revert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-23T18:36:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2017 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by pp3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
