Modern turbofans are spectacularly efficient and of course, you wouldn\\\u0027t see many long-haul flights if those aircraft had to carry their oxygen with them. A rocket running on liquid oxygen and RP-1 (which is basically kerosene, so very similar to jet fuel) requires 2.7 times (by mass) as much liquid oxygen as fuel. Plus, insulation to help keep it cool - you don\\\u0027t need that for kerosene. So, if you want to try and build an atmospheric flight vehicle, its fair to say that you can legitimately improve fuel economy by a factor of 3.7 (pretending you have no oxidizer in those fuel tanks). In addition, one could reasonably go to a factor of 5 or 6 to compensate for the differences in thermal efficiency between a rocket and a turbofan engine. If you\\\u0027re making a fighter plane improve your fuel efficiency by maybe a factor of 4 because a turbojet is not as efficient as a turbofan by a long shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have \u0027atmospheric flight only\u0027 versions of a couple different fuel tanks that do not change in mass as they empty - in the interest of fairness I just set their dry mass to their wet mass - this keeps my flight characteristics consistent throughout my burns.
