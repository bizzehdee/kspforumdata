I noticed this upon landing a science lab vessel on Minmus. The vessel seemed to be spinning very slowly. At first I thought it was just a minor physics issue. Then I switched to my rover and right away I knew something was wrong because the surface seemed so slippery and difficult to control. It might be the same issue why my lab was spinning. I\u0027m not sure if it has something to do with gravity but I managed to launch and land a vessel on Minmus pretty much normal. There\u0027s nothing out of the ordinary with regards to\u00A0gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/3XcWx8H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink to the video\u003C/a\u003E of the issue (mods were removed in the video).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/5mk5UOw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo on the Mun\u003C/a\u003E. I reverted it back to 1.11.2 and for some weird reason the bug is still there even though I never came across it prior to 1.12. I was trying to press W and the vessel was flipping like it\u0027s in a vacuum. I\u0027m absolutely sure that\u0027s not normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/og68fia\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evideo before the issue\u003C/a\u003E.

I\u0027ve also tried it in Kerbin and it looked like\u00A0the rover was acting weird as if it was a rocket. I tried switching\u00A0the control point\u00A0forward, up, and reverse still nothing. When I press W\u00A0it pitches and tumbles\u00A0instead of accelerating forward. I\u0027ve tried cutting off the reaction wheels and overriding the traction\u00A0but still no luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m super desperate hope you guys can help me with this annoying issue.
