Though there are no such parts, I have found a way to build them, to an extent. The key is the pivot ability of the grabber, all you need to do is link lots of small grabber segments together and you can make a rather fun flexible chain.

You see the game tries to correct the jets based on center of mass to move the ship as directed. So as the arm swings the same key will trigger different jets based on the angle of the arm. The result is that the RCS is no better at controlling it than the reaction wheels. The good news is that only putting the reaction wheel on the end works well. Still difficult to control because the game isn\u0027t treating it as an arm, but an extension of the ship - it doesn\u0027t get that activating the trust in a given way will just swing the arm instead of the whole ship.

The result was. . . interesting. If you enable SAS they flail around like mad. My ship was very low mass so it did not fair well. There is far too much torque in the arms for a small craft to handle (it just spins as they flail) but mounted on an asteroid or very massive ship they would do well. Interestingly, to deploy them in space you need to accelerate into them, not too fast or they will fail to connect, but if you do not accelerate the segments will simply drift away.\u003Cp\u003EI just wish it was possible to dock two ships without sharing control.
