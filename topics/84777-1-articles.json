Can the welded structure be integrated into the ship file so that when the ship is loaded the welded parts are accounted for and loaded as a welded structure?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo expound, welding right now is based around creating individual parts and their cfg\u0027s. The problem with this is that those welded parts can be improperly processed creating more parts that the user need to be cleared out of the players game directory. Further more, with the creation of each part the game need to be closed down and restarted depending on the mods the player is using. This makes welding time consuming and cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it rather hard to believe some of the things I have observed. Like the station I am building...I find it hard to believe that Squad would not put in some kind of pause in the physics for a body at rest. A station in orbit that is at rest (Stable orbit with out any outside influences) should not have physics calculated for it...it would be in homeostasis, and that state should only be recalculated when an event changes the objects state (Rotations, Acceleration, Mass Change, addition of elements).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny way...I got off track.
