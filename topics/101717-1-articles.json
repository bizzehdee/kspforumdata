A given fuel tank can carry x kg of fuel per 1 kg of its own mass. This represents the upper limit of what a rocket can theoretically achieve; practically, the limit lies even lower because you have to add mass from things that are not fuel tanks, such as engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know real life tankage fuel/mass fraction numbers, but I know them for KSP. Ingame, most tanks let you bring 8 kg fuel for every 1 kg of tank mass. Now, this is actually quite a bit worse than real life tanks, especially for liquids, but still. Look at this number, and now look at the table above, understand that hobby rocketry fuel is closer to the 200s end of the scale than the 250s end, and despair. This is why you don\u0027t do SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmount of fuel per 1 kg of stage dry mass at various Isp values for ca. 5 km/s dV (two stage to orbit):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 11.9 kg at 200s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 10.4 kg at 210s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 9.2 kg at 220s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 8.2 kg at 230s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 7.4 kg at 240s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - 6.7 kg at 250s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we\u0027re getting somewhere that appears in the realm of the possible. The solid first stage of ESA\u0027s Vega rocket carries 12 kg of fuel per 1kg of dry mass. If you had a solid fuel of 200s specific impulse, it would not be possible in two stages (there\u0027s additional dry mass in the form of decouplers, interstages, flight control systems, fairings and the like that aren\u0027t factored in here for a first stage). On the other hand, if you could do 230s, you might have a realistic chance. With 250s, it would definitely possible. Still, I\u0027m not sure an amateur can get their hands on something that good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you\u0027re filling your stages with an even 9 kg fuel per 1 kg of dry mass (slightly better than 220s Isp). Let\u0027s further assume that the second stage has a dry mass of 20kg, including the 100g payload, the staging equipment, the electronics and everything (I have no idea if that figure is utter BS or not \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). Then your second stage weighs 200 kg, of which 180 kg is fuel. Your first stage then has these 200 kg as its payload. You need 1800 kg of fuel to lift that. But assuming that your tankage\u0027s best fuel/mass ratio is 12 kg per 1kg tank mass, those 1800kg are going to add another 150 kg dry mass to the first stage. To lift those, you need another 1350kg of fuel. Which is going to add more dry mass. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately you\u0027re going to have to add another 600 kg of dry mass and the 5400 kg of fuel to lift it to the first stage, on top of the 1800 kg already budgeted. Total mass of the first stage is now 8 metric tons, of which 800 kg is tank dry mass plus the entire second stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay lunchbreak napkin math \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After some thinking, I have concluded that a 20kg dry mass second stage is indeed total BS. it would need to be heavier.
