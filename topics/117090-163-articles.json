And interesting find regarding CLS;  I\u0027ll make note of that to do some investigation.  They may be doing some config-based parsing for docking ports, and not finding any in the config for those parts, bomb out somewhere.\n\nSolar panels -- indeed; they do not persist their rotation at all.  Known issue/intentional implementation simplification.  Though, would be fairly easy to track their -last updated- position and reload that; but doesn\u0027t account for any of the time that you were away.  Could possibly do a forced re-orientation on them during part-initialization to line up with the current sun angle if it is not occluded, else persist the last-updated position... hmm... will keep that in mind during my upcoming code cleanup pass.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 59 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I found some good info about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS.

The legs were broken by Unity5, as were the colliders that many of the parts used (due to no more support for non-convex mesh colliders); my choices became to remove the broken bits and release what was left as best I could (which is what I did), or remove all of the parts entirely until I had proper time to rework them (which would likely be sometime during the winter/next spring).\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be away too long.

If I think that I\u0027ll need more time than that I\u0027ll work on finding someone to maintain it in the interim, but doubt it will be needed.  Mostly I need to de-stress for a bit, and finish up the work on the wheel-replacement so I no longer have that hanging over my head (lack of working wheels; that will help substantially with my motivation, and time).\n\nI would release what I have ready... but I\u0027ve already done that in the form of the prototype station parts; with being away camping last week close to nothing new has been done with them.\n\nIn the meantime if you guys run into any problems please post them up on the github issue tracker to help keep things organized (as I may not be watching the thread much for a bit).  That will make sure that I see them and they do not get lost/forgotten in the interim."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-12T19:13:29Z","Content":"If I could I would pay you a couple of beer.
