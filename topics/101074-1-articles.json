I jump into the debug and I get a constantly scrolling error of \u0022Look rotation vector is zero\u0022 on and on forever. I have to force quit the game using Alt\u002Bf4 and can then pick up somewhere else using a quick save. The quick save will take me back to the station, which should be a problem right? but it\u0027s not a problem immediately. It seems that this only happens after a while (possibly Debug getting too large with repeat entries)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick google search found this but honestly coding is a bit out of my element. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/397425/look-rotation-viewing-vector-is-zero-error.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/397425/look-rotation-viewing-vector-is-zero-error.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following mods are active while on this station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDark Multiplayer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote tech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet me know what else I can do to try and recreat this problem. and thank you for having a look, any information is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T04:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a texture replacer incompatibility with something - I had it last week.
