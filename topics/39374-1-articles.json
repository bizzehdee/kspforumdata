No weird edges or anything to cause drag on one side. What I notice is that during the gravity turn, it wants to roll hard right. It spins to a point and then stops. There is no separation at this point either so its not that bug coming into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried so many different configurations. Extra ASAS units in the center rocket. ASAS on the liquid boosters. ASAS on both center and liquid booster. I feel like whats happening is that the game wants one of those liquid booster to be on the bottom, kinda like the keel of a ship. I\u0027d really like it if this thing would go up and act like a real rocket though, having those boosters separate safely to the sides instead of risking crashing into the rest of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost probably, the problem is because gimbaling engines don\u0027t have roll control, and because to steer this big rocket, torque is just insufficient. As you said, the boosters tend to be on sideways configuration during the gravity turn, it\u0027s more stable this way.

Usually when I do similar designs, I place four winglets on the core booster and two on each side booster, and those tend to give me the stability I need to prevent things from rolling unexpectedly in the lower atmosphere, and probably those would help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Travisfv","CreatedById":63966,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, coming from the Total War: Rome II forum at twcenter.com, you have to be defensive.

I had six on my bigger variant of this for the center and three on both boosters. I only went smaller to see if that changes the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my whole reason for this design is that separation comes at about 15-20 km up in the air. It keeps debris from falling on KSC, is a strong rocket (minus the spin), is perfect for crew changes on a Space Staion, and finally it can lift a lot of weight on my bigger version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm, did you try disabling the gimbals on the boosters? They could cause some instability and produce the roll you see. Else, you could try going with the flow and manually rolling the rocket this way during the vertical portion of your ascent. You could even rotate it yourself in the VAB so that the boosters are already sideways, it might already give the craft it\u0027s stable orientation for the gravity turn and prevent additional roll.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Travisfv","CreatedById":63966,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDisabling gimbal on the boosters made the rotation worse, but the winglets in that configuration helped a bunch.

She launches as close to perfect as she can get.
