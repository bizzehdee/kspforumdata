I didn\u0027t buy it especially for the game. on the other hand, I was curious to see how it would perform in the game when Squad announced the trackIR support. and as you pointed out, it need a bit of thickering and fideling around to be trully comfortable using the device. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I have this since 5\u002B years, I had plenty of time to find response curves that fit my needs in flightsims, and I am use to move my head to move the camera so I can be relatively acurate, but a 3d mouse should suit your KSP needs way better. I have to pause the hardware in several ocasion as some tiny movements of my body have repercussions in the game, which could be disorienting when you try to set up maneuver nodes for example\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psychopoak","CreatedById":58162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T16:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyep, as Stoney3K said, it\u0027s works perfectly once you fly IVA and that\u0027s mainly my way to use it. it is also cool to use while docking to a station for instance, but it loses a bit of its purpose as the windows are usually tiny on spaceships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand on 3rd person, it can help to orient yourself while approaching a station. When you control camera with the mouse, movements are centered on the ships. but if you use a T-IR, it grants you a whole new range movements centered where the camera is, not on the ships which once again is helpfull but not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor those who want to give it a try, there are free alternatives like FaceTrackNOIR, which works like a T-IR but all you need is a webcam. it is not as powerfull and reliable, but it gives a taste of what to expect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T00:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI picked up a SpaceMouse today and it\u0027s only partially working.
