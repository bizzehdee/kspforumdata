I know those cause drag, but I\u0027m not sure how else I\u0027m supposed to get the fuel from the wings to the engines without directly attaching the engines to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The center of lift seems to be a bit high compared to the center of mass. Is that why I\u0027m having difficulty pitching up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m not sure if I have enough engines, or if I went overkill with them. Same with the wings and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Mk3 Cockpit is likely redundant with the probe core, I\u0027m aware.

As much of a fan as I am of spaceplanes, I never use spaceplanes to orbit \u0022things\u0022, only \u0022stuff\u0022.

Personnel transport and supply runs are flights that are done pretty often, while you will hardly ever need to orbit a chunk of space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Spaceplanes limit the size and shape of what they carry, which hampers your construction in orbit.
