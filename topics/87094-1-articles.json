I\u0027m about to start a real 0.25 career mode attempt and I\u0027d like to actually try with mods this time around (I almost always play stock). I\u0027m also concerned that the more mods I throw in, the greater the chances of compatibility screw-ups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably going to be using Editor Extensions and Kerbal Engineer Redux, which (from what I understand) have both been patched to work with 0.25. I\u0027d also like to use Distant Objects Enhancements (0.24 compatible) and maybe throw in the B9 pack. But I feel like I might want to throw in the B9 one afterwards... Would that cause problems, if I played the game for a few weeks without it, and then throw it in? Would that break my saves due to the influx of all those new parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itsme86","CreatedById":59895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T16:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a pretty excellent list here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommunity Mods and Plugins Library - Sticky\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T16:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an official list being updated regularly over here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95750-Official-Mod-Compatibility-Thread-for-25\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95750-Official-Mod-Compatibility-Thread-for-25\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as bringing in new parts are concerned after starting a save, I\u0027ve brought in a couple of mods (Procedural Fairings 3.10 and Kerbal Engineer Redux 0.6.2.11) and all I had to do was \u0022buy\u0022 the parts from the tech tree - no save-breaking on my end.
