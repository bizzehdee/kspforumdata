Visited about all planets and moons and played with a lot of add-ons. The community is pretty cool too, though they can be kinda touchy at times. Interestingly, there are some people who despise KSP for its simplicity or other reasons, but I must say I enjoy both games - they are certainly different in styles and should not be compared in every criteria. That being said, they are quite similar, too (by watching KSP evolve it actually drifts closer to an Orbiter style full simulation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, kind of interested what the KSP community thinks about Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T20:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, KSP got publicity from the Orbiter forums.

And certainly something I also enjoy very much. But I don\u0027t think something like this should be implemented in Orbiter (it would be nearly impossible anyway). Afterall, spaceship assembly is a *bit* more complicated than portrayed in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after all, you can actually create spacecrafts in Orbiter, but then you\u0027d be modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I also enjoy with KSP is the casual and comical focus. Jebediah always semms to say \u0022wheee!\u0022 and flag planting animations etc make it just joyful and remind you to not take everything too serious. I certainly will fire up Orbiter again (was absent for a while cause dan steph\u0027s site and downloads were down and couldn\u0027t install it again) but for the casual fun mission I don\u0027t wanna miss KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Btw, sorry if this is too \u0022off topic\u0022 in this forum but I felt it belongs here more than in the KSP general discussion.
