We rushed 1.0 out for business reasons and it had a bunch of problems that have persisted through to 1.0.4 and that\u0027s annoyed many in the fanbase - though we know there are those who will seemingly be annoyed whatever we do. 1.0.5 has been an improvement and is still in afterglow of the release hype-er-nova but that\u0027s going to cool. Existing players clearly want the game to run better, with fewer bugs and less performance, but we believe that sales will be boosted more by cool new features. Sales of KSP on PC are slowing and we suspect it might be meeting saturation but we hope we can still reach more people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.1 was supposed to be a big deal for the existing players, but that\u0027s been delayed and delayed again. That\u0027s why we brought out 1.0.5, but there\u0027s only so much Cool Stuff it could have with the engine limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward, on the programming side of things, we need to make a decision soon: Do we bring in new coders? The existing team are clearly having trouble porting KSP to Unity 5, but there\u0027s the adage that adding manpower to a late project makes it later. NathanKell has done good work but he\u0027s not quite what we need. Getting Flying Tiger to work on the PC version is a contractual and legal mess and that\u0027s a non-starter. In the event we opt to hire one or more new developers with Unity 5 expertise. We hope that with strong management from our new producer progress on the coding side of 1.1 will pick up, but we worry that maybe we\u0027ve got too many people trying to hack on the core code. The code really wants a decent refactor to make it easier to fix bugs and add features in, but there just isn\u0027t time to do that, that\u0027s a job to kick into the long grass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is critical because we also need to look at the visual side of things. Parts we have covered; any of Porkject, Necrobones, or Ven will do a great job of overhauling the rocket parts to a high standard. We also develop some art style guidelines for them to try and improve consistency. We expect much if not all of the parts overhaul to be done for 1.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planets and the environment are a bit trickier. There\u0027s been a lot of great mod work in that area, but somehow we feel it would be better to have our in-house artists work on it. Call it a gut feeling. This work will take longer and it\u0027s not likely to make 1.1, but probably 1.2. Unity still limits us and the newly revamped planets and moons are set to look awesome, but any player who spends a bit of time will realise they\u0027re still as samey as ever. But this doesn\u0027t really matter - the *gorgeous* screenshots sell the game. This revamp may be our last chance to reconsider the size of the Kerbin system, but we leave it as it is - it\u0027s familiar and while it may cause some gameplay oddities, changing it would cause more trouble not least wreaking havoc on saves and player craft designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the big one: multiplayer. Because that is a whole untapped market of potential customers, who so far have seen that KSP is single-player only and turned away because of that. After KSP 1.1 is out, we need to devote a lot of efforts to getting multiplayer in. That will mean that the bugfixes and performance improvements the existing fanbase want will be slower coming, but the boost from Unity 5 can be ridden on for a bit and we hope to keep a steady incremental stream of updates coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the longer term we need to decide where we want to go as a company. Mojang\u0027s approach of keeping on refining their single big title then selling up and retiring without money worries worked great for them, but we don\u0027t know if it\u0027s right for Squad. Maybe we can come up with some new games instead. That is a question for the future though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA concluding note. This is not necessarily what I, as a player and fan of KSP, want Squad to do. This is what I would do if I was in charge at Squad. The chief \u0022conflict\u0022 as it were is that we existing players aren\u0027t directly making revenues for Squad, it\u0027s the possible new customers who are. Hopefully others can appreciate this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T03:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of know what I would do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unity 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Classical soundtrack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- IVA sound effects such as alarms, shaking, communication between mission control and the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1.8 meter rocket parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Gendered docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Implement a simple morale system based on happiness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Varying kerbal weights and having those weights actually take effect onboard a vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals have different appearances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Moving around in IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simple life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simple radiation (well radiation is fairly simple already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simple muscle atrophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Habitat parts to combat all three bad things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- System that makes it so you can simulate gravity to combat atrophy without the need for special parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals don\u0027t like being cooped up in tiny pods for 3 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals like getting luxuries like books and letters and fresh food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Things can get broken and kerbals can fix them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Science overhaul\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tech tree overhaul and mod support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More variation on fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals wander around the space center, and some gather around to watch rocket launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bugfixing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBrisbyMouse","CreatedById":80175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T03:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat IS it with you guys and CLOUDS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T03:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022marc40k\u0022 data-cite=\u0022marc40k\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EImpressive.

That\u0027s like saying stock scale is more boring than Toy Solar System. (Hint: It\u0027s not). The point in having Kerbin be full scale is so that the designs for spacecraft are more authentic, things that could actually function in the real world. Maybe include a 1/10 Full scale mode for an option to go back to the pre-rescale stock system. Heck, while they\u0027re at it they could include an optional Real Solar System mode.
