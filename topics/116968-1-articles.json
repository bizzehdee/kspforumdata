Then you need to run the ground scanner\u0027s analysis in each biome you encounter. This will allow the NBS to show hotspots instead of just flat average values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharpy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharpy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan I pack the narrow band scanner into a hoverpad and just fly around over the area I want to scan...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYes you can! But the NBS map needs to be refreshed manually with a click, so piloting a hover-thing at the same time would be difficult and exciting. That\u0027s a great way to cover the whole area marked by the orbital scanner.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not that great a pilot, so I usually do it the slow way: mount the NBS and ground scatter to my mining crawler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou gave me an idea! Here\u0027s what I should have done: put the NBS on a tiny scout vehicle that can dock with your mining rig. That way, you get the best of both worlds, and your scout can refuel too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T16:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you kindly!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
