Easiest way to check: put one on a command pod and test it on the launchpad."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T13:09:40Z","Content":"The NBS works on the surface and just above it no problem.\n\nThe ideal combination, in fact, is a vehicle with both the NBS and the ground scanner. The NBS\u0027s map will show you hotspots in the local resource distribution and the ground scanner will tell you when you\u0027ve moved right on top of them.\n\nTo make this work, you 1st need to do the orbital scanner\u0027s survey (which is useless in itself but required to have anything show up on the NBS display). Then you need to run the ground scanner\u0027s analysis in each biome you encounter. This will allow the NBS to show hotspots instead of just flat average values."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:31:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can I pack the narrow band scanner into a hoverpad and just fly around over the area I want to scan...\n\nYes you can! But the NBS map needs to be refreshed manually with a click, so piloting a hover-thing at the same time would be difficult and exciting. That\u0027s a great way to cover the whole area marked by the orbital scanner.\nI\u0027m not that great a pilot, so I usually do it the slow way: mount the NBS and ground scatter to my mining crawler.\n\nYou gave me an idea! Here\u0027s what I should have done: put the NBS on a tiny scout vehicle that can dock with your mining rig. That way, you get the best of both worlds, and your scout can refuel too."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T16:04:12Z","Content":"Thank you kindly!"}]}
