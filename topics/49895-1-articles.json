(At least, it was true in 0.21, I haven\u0027t actually tried it in 0.22 yet, but I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s the same.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, instead, you use two of the tanks that are half the size of the big brown tanks, then you get the same weight and fuel capacity without the overheating. So in my heavy lifter designs, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m doing: I\u0027m using doubled-up tanks in place of big brown tanks. This works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s a terrible inconvenience. For large and complex designs, it requires more structural supports to keep the tanks tied together, increasing weight and drag. And the increased partcount makes the physics more complicated, slowing the frame rate and increasing the chance of structural failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any construction tricks that would allow me to use mainsails with the big brown tanks, and still run them at full thrust?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT* Answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Supposedly they changed this in 0.22 so the mainsails don\u0027t overheat as badly.
