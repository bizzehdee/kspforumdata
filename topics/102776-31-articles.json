If you experiment with the placement of small things like SAS/batteries/probe cores etc... you will find that the placement and even overuse of radiators will have no effect. At certain times these parts can seemingly out of nowhere explode, if you use the debug options and have a lucky quick-save you can see that they instantly jump to temperatures 4-5x greater than the hottest part on the craft and explode. Some people in the forums suggest lowering the conductivity factor for the heating until this is fixed.
