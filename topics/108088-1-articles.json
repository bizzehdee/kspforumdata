I\u0027m playing normal career with no reverts and no quicksaves, so trial and error is a rather expensive option for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a couple ships that I\u0027d like to be able to send to Minmus and then return to a low Kerbin orbit. The return stage is pretty much capsule shaped as far as drag is concerned, the heatshield covers up anything that\u0027s behind it. Does anyone know a good altitude to set the periapsis at so that the craft doesn\u0027t end up landing, but doesn\u0027t require more than 1 or 2 aerobraking passes? I tried it and 33.9km, and that gave me a reentry. I know that every craft creates different amounts of drag based on what\u0027s facing the airstream, but it seems like anything that\u0027s roughly capsule shaped should have similar drag characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, when the heatshields are facing slightly off-center of prograde, they produce lift. Are they any benefits to having the lift vector pointing a certain way? For example, if the lifting force is facing up, will the pass through the atmosphere produce less drag because you don\u0027t descend nearly as fast? And will the lift component create a significant amount of lift related drag, so that the apoapsis after passing through the atmosphere is much lower than a directly prograde alignment?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T21:54:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adinfinitum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much dv do you have to work with? If you can add a little burn to your aerobrake you can always fine tune the Ap by burning retrograde while your in the atmosphere.

I wouldn\u0027t go any lower than 45, since even if you get the Ap to LKO you\u0027re going to have to burn prograde to bring the initial side back into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this higher atmosphere (above 40km) your crafts direction isn\u0027t going to affect your drag or orbit significantly - there\u0027s very low air presure. Once you get lower, pointing your craft \u0022up\u0022 (blue on the navball) is going to slow you down, and \u0022down\u0022 (red on the navball) is going to speed you up. I find this particularly important just before you start to experience the serious re-entry heat around 20km, you can try to slow yourself as much as possible, then once your ship is on fire, you usually just focus on keeping it straight to reduce the damage (if it\u0027s a problem for your craft design). Usually I find 15t and under need no shielding if you bring them in under 3000 m/s @ 100% heat settings in a reasonable descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T18:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile craft with similar front-shapes (ie. craft built behind a 1.25m heatshield) will have the same drag, increased mass will mean that deceleration from drag will be reduced due to the increased inertial energy from the extra mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einduced drag from lift isn\u0027t going to reduce your AP significantly compared to regular drag. One of the benefits of reentry lift is that you can guide your capsule toward a target (such as KSC) and due a much more precise landing. You can use lift to control your trajectory, but if you don\u0027t have some way of seeing what your trajectory will look like depending on what actions you take, there isn\u0027t a whole lot you can do to do precision aerobraking especially with the lack of knowledge about the exact flight characteristics of your vehicles in stock 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this case I had about 25m/s dV.

I doubt I had enough dV to actually do that, but I don\u0027t want to add more than a couple hundred dV when I tweak my craft, to keep costs down.

Drag produces force, and force = mass * acceleration. So with a given force due to drag, if you have less mass (like a tiny probe/satellite-shaped object behind a huge heatshield) then your acceleration (or technically deceleration in this case) will be greater. The ratio of mass to drag is basically the ballistic coefficient (mass/[drag coeff*cross sectional area])... for a given drag profile / AoA, higher mass results in higher ballistic coefficient. High ballistic coefficients result in craft that slice through the air with less deceleration, while something with a low ballistic coefficient behaves more like a ping-pong ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to experiment to figure out what\u0027s required.
