The default \u0022look ahead\u0022 view, obviously, and then a \u0022look left\u0022, \u0022look right\u0022, \u0022look up\u0022, and so on. A POV hat could handle this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera in KSP is a slewable, absolute position control with three degrees of freedom. POV hats don\u0027t work very well here, since they are generally just \u0022on/off\u0022, they have no graduation. In other words, you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E set a POV-hat-left input to pan the camera left around your craft, but it will only be able to do so at one fixed speed. If you want to quickly pan 90 degrees there\u0027s no way to do that. This may not sound so bad... until you try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome HOTAS devices these days, such as the one I use, include a nipple cursor which does have graduated input, but these are difficult to set up with KSP.
