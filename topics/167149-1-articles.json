But still.. it functions as intended! The server increases the amount of \u0022extras\u0022, such as bandits, etc based on how many players you have with you. So it increases the difficulty through numbers.\u00A0 If there are supposed to be 2 bandits with one player,\u00A0 then there will be 4 if you have 2 players, 6 bandits if you have 3 players, etc... however, quest giving \u0022named NPC\u0027s\u0022 will not be copied, neither will dragons, Only the typical garbage NPC\u0027s will be multiplied. If you kill a dragon, everyone gets part of the soul. Every player will be dragonborn... Players will be able to revive each other after battle is concluded, or you can choose to resurrect at the Temple of kynerath in Whiterun if your buddies can\u0027t get to you.\u00A0 Also, You don\u0027t have to stick together. You can go different directions.. I can go do dark brotherhood quests while you are doing the mage quests..Later,\u00A0 If I decide to go do the mage quests, then it will allow me to do them as well, and you can even come and help me, even if you already did them, as the requirements will still be unfinished for me.. It\u0027s a pretty impressive system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yfVY3b2QNs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-03T15:30:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2017 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Talavar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
