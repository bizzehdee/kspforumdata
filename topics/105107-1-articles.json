Such as the batteries, they\u0027re infinitely rechargeable, supply a constant voltage regardless of charge, are capable of unleashing any amount of power at a given moment, and charging is independent of the current and voltage being supplied. Reality just isn\u0027t like that. (Now yes, there are things you can do to mitigate this stuff, at the cost of more power, but w/e)\n\nWe also have the power-engineering related issues; everything should be consuming electricity. Pumps, engines, pods, transmitters; and the energy consumed should be proportional to usage; so if a pod is triggering maneuvering controls, it should be consuming more energy than if it is drifting through space.\n\nOf course, this stuff will balance electric charge, but also add in more features that people probably don\u0027t want to think about."},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:24:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, it kinda is: There is always a best thing for a very special purpose, and that purpose can be very specific.

There won\u0027t ever be some magical engine blowing everything else out of the water. Yeah, maybe an EM drive would do that if we had it now in a sufficiently advanced version. We just don\u0027t, and there will be a bunch of alternatives in the future, as well as some unsolvable issue. \n\nTake KSP: A nuke does indeed trump everything else in space-travel.

Also, by using superconductive materials on the Em drive we can get TWR\u0027s that approach sane values for point thrust maneuvers instead of duration maneuvers. If Em drives work, they may just be the best thing ever. \n\nSide note, the internet is claiming that Em drives distort space time?\n\n[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=36313.1860](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=36313.1860)\n\nif so, Em drive \u003E literally everything since fire"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T06:50:15Z","Content":"Real life is not balanced.
