IT really helps when it\u0027s far away or in a tough spot to see, because when you\u0027re flying, you HAVE to know what direction it is facing, otherwise you\u0027ve VERY likely going to crash it.

But I think playing games like KSP involving quick responses sort of helps with hardwiring control like with the quadcopter. When you have 8 different directional controls, it\u0027s tough. I\u0027m sure RC planes are tilough in their own ways too.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"syfyguy64","CreatedById":47714,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T02:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get scared flying it, and it doesn\u0027t have Jeb to save it, so I only had about 4 minutes in total flight time since I bought it...
