I was wondering if there has been any indication as to how the game will represent constant acceleration trajectories in the UI. Planning maneuvers in KSP 1 is pretty straightforward with the maneuver planner nodes. Will they be able to keep this simplicity with constant acceleration maneuvers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-28T05:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224158460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221658952574\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136892\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nsgallup\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, nsgallup said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow the game will represent constant acceleration trajectories in the UI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably with arrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-28T07:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see two options for the UI (not saying these are the ones we\u2019ll be seeing).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne, the systems are separate and you create a different kind of maneuver node, and you specify what direction to thrust in (either something variable like prograde or normal, or a specific heading) by dragging arrows (and sometimes \u201Clocking\u201D the heading) and then it shows you the new trajectory.

The thing is that players might want to burn at a low throttle for a long time instead of at max thrust for a shorter time (because while KSP 1 assumed that all of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E happened at the same point, that system will need to decide how fast the trajectory is curving) which means extra slider #1, and then players might want to continue burning, say, prograde to spiral out of a planet, so there needs to be a way to toggle between constant and variable direction, so that\u0027s extra toggle #2. With everything already in the maneuver node system, it wouldn\u0027t be much more complex, but I proposed splitting it anyways to make it less complicated than the original KSP 1 maneuver node system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-28T14:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224158661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221659012931\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, then again our targets will be hundreds of millions (if not billions) of kilometers in diameter and we can always adjust course closer in where errors aren\u0027t as big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving to manually plan correction burns mid flight is frankly pointless busy work for the player, it serves no gameplay purpose since it is solely the result of inaccurate controls in KSP 1.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can almost guarantee you that whatever solution they implement for planning and burning won\u2019t make that manual step necessary. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-29T11:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChildren of a Dead Earth features limited delta-V and long, low-acceleration trajectory changes as a core feature.
