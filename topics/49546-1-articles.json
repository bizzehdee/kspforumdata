Now the demo doesn\u0027t come with wheels or any way to control a ship except in the 1 man capsule, so I had to try something creative. So I decided to do more of a skimmer/hopper \u0022rover\u0022. I threw some RCS tanks under a capsule, added some legs and a SAS control and was ready to roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept now I had to figure out how to get it there. My first thought was to add it to the side of my \u0022standard\u0022 small Mun lander. Unfortunately RCS tanks don\u0027t attach to radial decouplers. So I had to put it inline on the ship. So I added it under what is normally my small lander. Added four fuel tanks to act as landing legs. Added engines and landing gear, braced the tanks and crossed my fingers. After some testing on the launch pad, reconfigured the \u0022rover\u0022 so it didn\u0027t interfere with the tanks of the main ship tested again, liked the results and went to step 2, build something to get it to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter repeated handling problems with a large asparagus launcher, I settled on a kinda hybrid asparagus. With stacked tanks in a hexagonal arrangement. It flew, it did the job, but didn\u0027t control well. (it was later discovered that I had left off a SAS module from the main ship. It also should have had it\u0027s own RCS system.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/57g6ibxlt/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/57g6ibxlt/screenshot12.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we\u0027re on our way.

It was very top heavy as the center return ship still had a full tank. In hindsight I should slapped some legs on it and jettisoned the outer tank legs after the \u0022rover\u0022 was dropped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/l88rvavhd/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/l88rvavhd/screenshot10.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd our bad luck continues. With out a way to test the \u0022rover\u0022, too late it was discovered to be unstable. It needed more and differently placed RCS nozzles. I also would have raised the attachment point of the landing legs to lower the center of mass of the \u0022rover\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/3ywwafv1d/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/3ywwafv1d/screenshot11.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that (and a couple of tries) I got the return ship off the Mun and returned to Kerbal. It\u0027s with a sad eye that we now close down the KSP (demo). But also with a joyful heart we open KSP, the full game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Question, how do I insert pictures so they\u0027re not so small on the page?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
