I use Kerbal Construction Time and the simulated flight flies fine, but as soon as I try to fly a built plane pieces just start falling off it.\u00A0 I know it\u0027s not the plane design because at the same time I see explosions happening on the Launchpad where nothing is sitting, and which is about a kilometre from my take off point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have previously flown propeller aircraft in the current career and they were unaffected. I suppose I could do a backup and start experimenting with workarounds using different plane designs to see if it makes any difference, \u00A0though its tedious with KCT installed. I\u0027m kind of hoping this a known issue that has a fix hiding somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n{UPDATE}\u00A0 Ok, it seems if I load the game and fly the plane all is well.\u00A0 It seems only to explode if I pilot another vehicle first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-03T21:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2016 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Chippy the Space Dog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
