Especially if your science progress consists of varied tiers between the different categories. A common tactic people use, is researching for all the science parts (mostly on the bottom rows of the tech tree), which also unlocks several wheels, build a rover with a TON of scanning equipment, and then make a trip around the space station doing research on each building and some other small areas, the Kerbin grasslands, the nearby shore, and finally drive their rover into the sea and scan that too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to use the small gear bay, there is an issue with it\u0027s collider preventing this objective from triggering.

Anyway, in career mode, even playing in hard mode, you should always costumize play mode and allow quick saves, not only because of player mistakes, sometimes silly mistakes, but which happen because we are only one person taking care of multiple missions at the same time and, in real life, there\u0027s a whole crew just to handle one tiny sattelite of probe ( of course, with a lot more things to be concearned of than in ksp, but that\u0027s another story \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ); but also because the software has glitches, and it is quite distressful to loose a lot of time and game-money to a glitch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Especially when flying to the Mun, which is close, or Minmus. For farther targets you\u0027ll be stuck anyway since you\u0027ll be doing a lot other missions while enroute. My suggestion is, always fly with backup hardware, extra fuel, etc... I saved long duration missions, more than once, by having a \u0022go around\u0022 alternative in my pocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand, if you have \u0022just enough resources\u0022 to complete that elusive contract then...
