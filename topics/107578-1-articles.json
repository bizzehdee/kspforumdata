I used to always stick my atomic engines far away from my hab modules but no with 1.02 I want to place heat shields up front for aerobraking (wether I need them or not, it seems more realistic that way and looks awesome) This also means I need my fuel tanks up front or all the mass in the back flips my ships in hard aero braking maneuvers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, since you now have to stick your atomic engines directly to a large heat sink like the fuel tanks this means I need the engines up front too.

The real safety risk regarding atomic rockets is if somehow the radioactive material were to escape containment, like say, a during catastrophic launch failure. This is a major reason why atomic rockets haven\u0027t been launched into space yet; launch failure could mean dangerous radioactive material spread throughout the upper atmosphere.
