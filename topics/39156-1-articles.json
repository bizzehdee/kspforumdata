At first it was kind of funny to read \u0022not much is known about this part. Hope it doesn\u0027t blow you up.\u0022 but now its getting old especially when you actually would like to know what the part does. Even more so with the amount of mods that add 100 parts it would be nice to know what each part does instead of that crap. I\u0027m sure no one else agrees but for the noobs out there I think knowing what each part does is better then the funny factor.
