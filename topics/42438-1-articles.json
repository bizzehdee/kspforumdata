They seem to think they already know a lot about them despite most evidence about them being fairly indirect and observational from considerable distances and not based on up close and exhaustive observation or actual physical samples. Just based on what I know about geology (an undergraduate minor) that seems rather speculative at best. Imagine if geologist tried to infer the composition of even a small portion of the Earth based on observations made with telescopes from great distances. Yes, I know that basic models could be built that would offer reasonable guidelines, but those models would also miss a great deal of the exceptions and \u0027diamonds in the rough\u0027 so to speak. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki page is pretty sketchy but it sounds like there are broadly three main types: carbonaceous (the most common); silicate and; \u0022other\u0022 with the metallic ones I think belonging in that last and least numerous (they think) category.
