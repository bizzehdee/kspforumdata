I believe a part of the perceived issues have to do with the prominence it currently has to us as a new feature and in the absence of the rest of career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly because it\u0027s a brand new feature we\u0027re all diving into this, trying hard to earn the points as fast as possible to explore the feature and because we\u0027re all so very good at the game we\u0027re burning through it. This will be very different for the new player, who\u0027s primary problem is to build an adequate ship to get to orbit, just like we once did. The focus for this player will experimenting with ships. Science will be there alright but the player won\u0027t be as occupied with it like we are now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in the future science will only be one part of a much larger career mode. This will reduce its prominence and some of the debated aspects of the mechanic will matter less or will be actively mitigated by other game elements of career mode, like economy and missions. These other elements will force constraints on the player and set goals aside from the ones the science element now provides and they will likely intertwine with the science system in multiple ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI in no way want to prevent discussions, suggestions or criticism about the science system; there\u0027s plenty to discuss and there are things I, at this point, think should be implemented differently, but I believe we should be at least somewhat careful with statements like \u0022it should be completely redone\u0022 at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy two cents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
