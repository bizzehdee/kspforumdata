But the very bottom end of the throttle\u0027s range still registers as the engines being slightly on. I have to manually kill the throttle by button/key and be very very careful not to bump the throttle lever. Sensitivity and deadzone affect the movement curve but 32767 is still not-quite-0. I wonder if -32767 doesn\u0027t quite hit 100% either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roothorick","CreatedById":80635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T23:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPartial workaround:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn jstest-gtk, deliberately miscalibrate the throttle to be off by one, so center reads one step negative (which is \u0022up\u0022 because the axis is inverted in hardware).
