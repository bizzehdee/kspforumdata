It\u0027s your ship that\u0027s at fault, it\u0027s not stable/rigid enough. It all depends on how well your ship is built, if it\u0027s in atmosphere, your thrust, just to mention a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you explain a bit further what problem you\u0027re having? Maybe a screenshot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Farmer","CreatedById":71519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T22:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for speed I think it\u0027s limitless as I recently had a ship doing 15km/s relative to kerbol on an inbound from eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for acceleration on takeoff you are capped by the atmosphere but once clear of that its whatever your ship will take. On that same eeloo mission I did a hard aerobrake coming back to kerbal and the ship and kerbal survived 14.5 G\u0027s of deceleration for a sustained period. That\u0027s about 140m/s of deceleration although I\u0027m reasonably certain my launch stage would break up under that stress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T23:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about speed in basic, is that in vaccum, it puts 0 stress on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to see this in action, is when you are docking 2 ships in orbit. Or just flying 1 ship around another one. While the relative speed is low, you have to remember that both ships are still in orbit, and moving at 2km/s (if you take LKO). You don\u0027t notice this, because both ships go at the same speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same way, is there no stress on a single ship by going any speed (in vaccum). All parts go just as fast, so it\u0027s not like the heavy fuel engine sticking out of the side is going to stay behind and start flexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you start accelerating though, than stuf does get stressed. Because of inertia (mass wants to keep going in the same directly in the same speed), the part that has the engine trys to go a little faster than the rest. At this point, the joints start to stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to be able to accelerate faster, simply make stronger ships. Small, compact stuf can take alot, long ships that branch out to the sides will flex if you put to much thrust on 1 point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T00:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour main problem is at the end of gravity turn or during circulation, now you have an mainsail and almost empty fuel tank below your craft. You have also lost the struts from boosters to upper stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the problem is that the fuel tank below upper stage collapse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to Jool or other places you would typicaly use nuclear engines, they don\u0027t do much trust. Aerobraking is also pretty safe, probably as it brakes all the parts at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly time I had problem outside of launch was an 150 ton ship with 1500 kN trust pulling an 200 ton miner. the miner brake apart at the large monoprop tank who is weak so 0.5 G at an fully loaded tanker was to much, four struts solved the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
