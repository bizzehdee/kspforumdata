Ultimately, the economy, manufacturing, and transportation of stuff is what I\u0027m interested in most and just adding that kind of industrial and logistic side to the game would be more than enough for me to be interested alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I\u0027ve also been wondering how the ground nature of the resources could be used to improve the ground gameplay of KSP, which has always been a bit lacking and unnecessary. Just something to have fun with on the side but no real purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you think it\u0027s possible resources could be used to make the ground gameplay both necessary and fun? I don\u0027t expect it to match this, but what I\u0027d look to as the absolute best example the game could strive for, is Snowrunner/Spintires. If they could figure out a way to add even a little bit of that to the driving game of KSP I think that would be fantastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t even know if that\u0027s possible though. Could such difficulty be added in a low gravity environment, where in KSP vehicles can\u0027t really get stuck in the same way they do in the mud and snow of Snowrunner? Can it be done on the massive scale of KSP planets, without being one or two handcrafted sites on an otherwise massive boring world. Can KSP do that kind of gameplay without merely being frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the first problem to solve is, why not simply use landers and rockets. Maybe to encourage the use of rovers, some resources could be placed in caves or overhangs. There could be steep cliffs and deep valleys. There could be tall rock spires or other obstacles around the resource, easier to drive around but hazardous to land in. So they could encourage landing nearby on nice flat land free from obstacles, and then find a route to drive over to where the resources are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I was just interested in starting a discussion about what could possibly be added to make the experience deeper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I don\u0027t really expect it to be too in depth, whatever is done has to be able to cover the massive area that are full sized kerbal planets.

This way you can miss the target with some margin. More of an issue with bodies with atmosphere. On Moho I was able to land withing 300 meter of target, on Duna 3 km is good.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut 300 meter still require wheels.
