Its default set to 0.998. And the loadDistance and unloadDistance settings in PlanetList.cfg needing change dont stick.

I\u0027ll keep playing around.\n\nI\u0027m seeing a problem similar to [@Cratzz](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157974-cratzz/).  It starts when I go to a vessel I already had in orbit around a body.  Went to it through the tracking station.  When I come back to KSC, that\u0027s pretty messed up, too.  I did recently install New Horizons, but given the similar problem here and the visual nature, I\u0027m trying here first.\n\nLet me know if any logs would be helpful.  This is the newest version, 0.0230.  I have EVE (plus probably 40 other mods) as well, not sure if that\u0027s a contributing factor.  However, I didn\u0027t see this until the Scatterer update.\n\nCheers,\n\n-BS\n\n![JzWLlhk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JzWLlhk.jpg)\n\n![1Kf9XGf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1Kf9XGf.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-25T03:53:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2016 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by barfing\\_skull**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T03:48:44Z","Content":"I\u0027d just like to say thank you\n\n![JjtsZ9C.png](http://i.imgur.com/JjtsZ9C.png)"}]}
