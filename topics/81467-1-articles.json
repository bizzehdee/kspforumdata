The paper describes the design and construction of the rocket, all of it using off the shelf materials, the different tests performed (2 thrust measurements, 7 static tests in total, 5 failures) and problems one might face when deciding what to build it with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also got an euler approximation of the differential equation that describes the motion of the rocket under aerodynamic drag, taking into account changes in the drag coefficient as a function of mach number and the change in air density, as well as simulation of the rocket engine using external software (its called burnsim), I do not know if this would be enough for the paper to get published though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachute deployment is pretty basic right now (just a simple timer, run and light the candle in a given time frame), but I am trying to improve it, my biggest problem is that the 6dof imu that I am using is pretty flimsy, and considering that the rocket will experience around 30gs ( if the pvc can withstand the 8.5 mpa that is) I doubt it is a good idea to put it on a rocket. Anyways, I just wanted to know what you guys though and if this could be considered a half serious thing or it wont be published at all, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T23:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably help to know in what scientific journals you hope to get published in, since that would provide a large amount of examples to show you how your paper should be formatted and how technical it needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T00:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs someone who has contributed to one scientific paper myself, it\u0027s not so much how \u0022technical\u0022 the language has to be, but what \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E knowledge your paper will \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Econtribute\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E to the overall body of a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eparticular scientific discipline\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientific papers are published through conference proceeding and/or scientific journals, and are vetted by a review board of experts in the field.
