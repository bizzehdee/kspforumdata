As for 3, I\u0027m extremely sure it\u0027s not air drag, but I will eventually do this anyway to satisfy the skeptics, and it\u0027s easy to do. 4... investigating. It depends on how much money I\u0027ll be forced to spend (if any) and how heavy the batteries for powering the gyros will be. Just loosening the cords is such an easy fix, but as with 3 it\u0027ll be done eventually no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Decided on a name change to \u0022M Thruster\u0022.

Stuff starting to come together again. So apparently remote controlling something as energy consuming as a screwdriver is an expensive affair. Hundreds of dollars at least. It will be done eventually, but for now I\u0027ve decided to go with the solution you see in the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of 2 very thick, short and rigid power cords coming out a side of the machine, I have 4 slim, long and flexible cords coming out the middle of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should probably draw this, but these long cords will be connected to a static pole on the side of the machine, allowing the cords to hang in a long arch. This means that however the machine chooses to move, the cords will have a lot of slack allowing for this movement. It\u0027ll be able to twist and wobble however it wants, and the cords will interfere minimally compared to before at least. Also, because of the pole, my own hand movements won\u0027t be able to interfere with the machine directly. The cords will be attached to the pole \u0027after\u0027 my hand so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the twisting I\u0027ve started doing work on gearing the 2 gyro arms in the middle, as you can see with the gear in the picture. All I have thus far is a rough blueprint in my mind though, and my usual mechanic is apparently busy fixing a submarine for the Swedish government (crazy I know) until next month. I\u0027m lucky to even know him. Anyway, I could go to a company and do some work there, but those are also very expensive, something like $70-80 an \u003Cem\u003Ehour\u003C/em\u003E, and I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll take at least 2-3 hours to do what I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso have plans on trying to extend the wires it hangs from, but this is a small town, and I haven\u0027t yet found a suitable place. 17 meters will have to do for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally I\u0027m going to eventually seal the machine in a plastic case of some kind just to eliminate air drag as a factor. Seeing how many people think the EmDrive (the microwave thruster NASA recently tested) is being propelled by air, it\u0027s just a matter of time before someone demands I seal the machine anyway. It\u0027s an easy job though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think? If the machine deflects this time, would that be good evidence to you? This is of course assuming the analysis shows a solid deflection from the starting point, and that nothing indicates that the cords interfered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T05:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by M Drive\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M Drive","CreatedById":105619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T22:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInput plz?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
