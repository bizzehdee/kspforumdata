This would not do! So I used the new SAS icon thingies to point the ship in the radial inward direction...and then waited an inordinate amount of time while the stock SAS system overshot the mark, came back, overshot again, etc., until it finally settled on pointing in the correct direction (MechJeb SmartASS quality, this is NOT).

Once the periapsis was out on the opposite side of Kerbin (indicating a prograde capture trajectory), I turned off the nukes and used RCS to fine tune the aerocapture targeting (watching MechJeb\u0027s landing prediction numbers to get the desired post-aerocapture apoapsis).

I like to keep the aircraft landing area as free of lag as possible, so I don\u0027t like to leave these piles of heat shield debris laying around there. I could just remove the debris from the game...but it\u0027s more fun to imagine that our plucky kerbals would repourpose the equipment, and that they have tools on hand for basic cutting and bonding of parts. So, imagine along with me and Photoshop, that the boys disassemble the heat shield debris and drag its parts over near Base2/5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K6ue0FC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K6ue0FC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some minimal rearranging of the structures, and with the help of all the other kerbals gang-pressed to haul on the lines and such, Dansen arranged the debris into a structure to serve as an extra greenhouse. Kerbalnaut Dansen went back to college for a degree in Biology/Botany, and he will be experimenting with growing things on Laythe (he has some flimsy greenhouse structures that came down as parts in Base 5 that he\u0027ll be assembling (you can imagine them in future images of the main Base area)...and he will use some of the spare greenhouse plastic to enclose the area between the structural plates of the debris-greenhouse. Because Laythe Base is located about a degree north of the equator, the plates are tipped slightly southward so that no sunlight is blocked from reaching the space inside. And the big tanks will serve as water tanks, once Dansen gets around to hauling the water (with the Fuel Fido) up from Fido Bay, and running it through the purifying systems in Base 5.

Corfrey, Merfred, and Rodmy will be doing the bulk of the piloting for the crew, but Nedmy is also a pilot, and Dansen and Lembart also are pilots...but their main work on this mission will be as the doing biological and medical science. The pilots also needed to be checked out on the Airedale and ShoreLab vehicles so that they could haul around the scientists as needed. Example below: Merfred has landed the Airedale with passenger Tomster aboard at Base 3 located on Fredoly Island so that they can check out the Base and Fido equipment there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kms5mL0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kms5mL0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran into a little problem with the Airdale: The hatch to the single-kerbal crew cabins on the sides of the Airdale now say that the hatch is obstructed, and won\u0027t let the kerbal get out. This used to work just fine. The hatch lets kerbals in -- just not OUT. I tried raising the nose of the plane by lowering the nose gear, but that didn\u0027t help. Did Squad mess something up when they were tweaking the ladder physics? Anyway...the work-around is to transfer the passenger from the cabin to the front cockpit (once the pilot gets out) and then they can exit from there.

Cause is unknown, but the Science detectors registered weird gravioli and radiation effects at the same time, so I\u0027m having Henrey look at that. But the main problem is the comsats...they\u0027ve all lost high gain lock. Looks like they are slowly tumbling.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedmy: \u0022Could all their OKTO2 probes have gone bad as well?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorfrey: (over the comm system) \u0022Lembart, I checked the OKTOs like you wanted. The control circuits in them are fine, it\u0027s just the reaction wheels that are malfunctioning. I\u0027m running remote diagnostics on the BirdDogs, and all their OKTO2s are showing the same problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELembart: \u0022I can still get a link to Kerbin with the Base high-gains.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedmy: \u0022OK. Advise them of the problems. Can we contact Merfred and Tomster on Fredoly Island without the comsats?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELembart: \u0022Um...We\u0027ll have short period links to them when Laythe Station passes over...assuming its systems are OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hbP9nyI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hbP9nyI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it went. As it happens, I mostly lucked out when it came to the roles assigned to the New Crew kerbals by their names under the new system in Beta 0.90. I\u0027ve already edited the Traits.cfg file so that pilots and engineers have the same skills (since I\u0027ve always used my kerbalnauts as pilots that could also repair wheels, re-pack chutes, etc.). After Beta hit, Nedmy, Merfred, and Dansen are now Engineers, while Corfrey, Rodmy, and Lembart are all Pilots (having the re-educated Dansen and Lambert remain as pilot/engineers is fine with me...they can forego the Science bonus that a kerbal trained from the beginning in Science would receive). And while Henry the oceanographer came up as a Scientist, Tomster the geologist unfortunately came up as a pilot. So, I have changed his name to \u0022Tomsterr\u0022 and the game now agrees with me that he is a Scientist. When changing your kerbal\u0027s names, remember to do a global find-and-replace in your Save file, because active kerbals are mention in multiple places in the file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the comsats: The small comsats in the Jool system all use OKTO2 probe cores for stability, and when Squad removed the reaction wheel torque from the OKTO2 in version 0.90, all my comsats can no longer orient themselves. Bugger. PLEASE Squad, could we get minimal reaction wheels restored to OKTO2 probes in version 0.91?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... It turns out that the Laythe comsats all have Junior docking ports on them (see below), so refurbishing them will be a matter of sending out a ship to Jool that can rendezvous and dock with each comsat, then disconnect a docking port and a small reaction wheel module (and another docking port) to remain attached to each of the comstats. Sadly, this is not the case for all the other comsats in the Jool system (around Vall, Tylo, Bop, and Poll) where I used separators instead of docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lBqqBkL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lBqqBkL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedmy: \u0022So we have to wait a year to get our comsats fixed? Are we supposed to curtail our surface exploration missions in the meantime?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC CAPCOM: \u0022Negative, Laythe. You have some vehicles in Laythe orbit that are equipped with high gain antennas, and we will send up software patches that will allow them to fill the role as comsats until the communication satellites can be refurbished.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed. One such vehicle is BA Tug 1 that carried the new Fuel Fido and Fuel Stations A, B, and C to Laythe. It still contained a fair amount of fuel (which was eventually going to be off-loaded at Laythe Station before BA Tug 1 would be returned to Kerbin), so for now it would be boosted into high orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oTxf7El.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oTxf7El.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe BA Tug circularized its orbit at 950 km, pointed its high gain antenna toward Laythe, and started its new job as a makeshift comsat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rkT3cfk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rkT3cfk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m7f0fMX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m7f0fMX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother payload in Laythe orbit that had a high gain antenna that could be repurposed into a comsat was the GasStation on top of Laythe Train 3 (which had brought the Airedale plane to Laythe). There was still a lot of fuel in that Tug Train, so the GasStation was separated with just one of the Tugs...which then boosted the GasStation out to 950 km (requiring 348 m/s of delta-V).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xa5XwhC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xa5XwhC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ta0TNfv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ta0TNfv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GasStation comsat was placed in a 950 km circular orbit (requiring another 279 m/s of delta-V) roughly 160 degrees away the BA Tug comsat, where it took up station as the other makeshift comsat.

The payload on top of the BA Tug not only consists of the Mallard sea/spaceplane, it also has a second Fuel Fido that can be dropped somewhere on Laythe when needed, and a collection of fuel tanks to pad out the mass of the payload. The fuel (along with the excess fuel in the BA Tug) will eventually be transferred to one of the orbital fuel depots.

Then Corfrey performed Part Two of the test and started a more gradual 10-degree climb under full throttle. By the time he had reached 24 kilometers, moving at 1820 meters per second, dawn had broken as Kerbol rose above the eastern horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RNwNOyz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RNwNOyz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings got interesting at over 27 km and a speed of 1940 m/s when the camera view rotated 90 degrees, indicating that the periapsis must have risen to near 20 km.

Meanwhile, Corfrey had been continuing to accelerate at full throttle.

The ride out of the atmosphere knocked the apoapsis down to 546 kilometers. The Mallard was not in orbit, however, because its periapsis was still only at 28.3 kilometers. Also, don\u0027t be fooled by that fuel indicator -- the front fuselage tank was disabled before takeoff to keep the CoM forward, so its fuel is not registering on the indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bvyAh5b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bvyAh5b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the Mallard approached its apoapsis, Corfrey plotted a burn that would lift the periapsis of the plane\u0027s orbit up to the 80-km level of Laythe Space Station. This burn would take less than 41 m/s of delta-V to officially put the sea/spaceplane into orbit...but Corfrey did NOT perform this burn, and instead just coasted through apoapsis and headed back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IUyTGDC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IUyTGDC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the Mallard approached periapsis, predictions showed that it would be slowed quite a bit by the passage through the atmosphere, and would end up landing short of the BAIF Ocean... So Corfrey fired up the turbojet again to counteract the drag and hopefully stretch out the trajectory into the BAIF. But, once again, he overdid it, and ran his apoapsis up to 683 km before he could get the engines off. It\u0027s actually pretty easy to overshoot once the apoapsis starts running up fast. So...in the right-most part of the image, we once again see the Mallard heading up into space with Manley Crater in the background (the apoapsis dropped to 487 km as the plane was leaving the atmosphere again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EH7JWOE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EH7JWOE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorfrey: \u0022Mallard to Laythe Base.

The initial landing prediction was far short of the BAIF, so the turbojet was fired up as needed to push the indicator out into the BAIF Ocean...then the throttle was cut (and the plane was even pitched down) to keep the landing point from running away too far as the turbojet spooled down. Eventually, it worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iq0lSHk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iq0lSHk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more time, Corfrey passed Manley Island (the icons show the location of Manley Base), but this time at only 39.3 kilometers and gliding along at 1775 m/s.

The BAIF Ocean is a huge expanse of empty water.

Instead of going around for another periapsis pass and targeting for a return to Laythe Base that way, he instead waited until he reached an altitude of 178 km, and then used the Mallard\u0027s rocket motors to decelerate for a reentry and landing at Laythe Base. That retro burn required 133 m/s of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c8mMYjb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c8mMYjb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the Mallard coasted through space, passing over Jebidiah Island, the view went all \u00222001: A Space Odyssey\u0022 on me, so I snapped a picture.

The retro burn in space had used 30.3 units of oxidizer (therefore 24.8 units of fuel)...so that\u0027s 27.5% of the spaceplane\u0027s LFO inventory for the rocket motors. That means that the remainder of the missing fuel from the center tank (43.7 units...about 11.2% of the total liquid fuel supply) was used by the turbojet during the flight home from BAIF. The 98.23 units of fuel missing from the front tank was used during the parts of the flight prior to landing in the BAIF ocean. That\u0027s all pretty good gas mileage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RgOBVXV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RgOBVXV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: In the image above, I noticed yet another anomaly at this point -- there is a small gap between the cockpit and the front fuselage tank. Looking back, I see that it\u0027s been there for the whole flight...and I see the same gap behind the cockpits of the BirdDogs and the Airdale. I assume this is caused by the recent re-work of the Mk1 Cockpit. I just hope the kerbals don\u0027t notice it, or they might refuse to fly those planes anymore. Oh...and I also hadn\u0027t commented previously on the way the rudders of the Mallard sort of float in the air behind the vertical stabilizers...this was caused by the recent re-work of the spaceplane parts, and I can\u0027t be bothered to go into the files and hand-edit all those control surfaces closer to the fins. Again, I expect the kerbals will have a sort of \u0022blind spot\u0022 effect when looking at them, and they won\u0027t notice the gaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur hero of the day poses with his ship after the successful mission, below. I know that I was impressed by the plane\u0027s performance...but then, the Mallard prototype DID manage to make two consecutive SSTO flights to orbit without refueling back on Kerbin, so I guess I shouldn\u0027t be surprised.
