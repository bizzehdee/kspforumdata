I had no idea of the new features until I installed it to my .22 which until then was stock only. My previous uses of the mod were merely to winch down rovers from landers and also link my crafts/modules in my Duna base (ended up in a huge explosion when the winches retracted one day).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have been looking at what could be done with those containers in my new career mode. I have pretty much unlocked 90% of the tech tree by now and starting to just play around instead of science hunting (although I will still continue on a slower and more realistic pace). Not going to make bases as of yet but plenty of apollo style missions all over the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my 2 current ideas are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- assembling a small rover from parts stored in containers after landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- assembling a small science station on the ground instead of having everything on the lander itself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill gotta go in the config files to add the parts I want to be grabbable but I have set new goals to myself and cant wait to start designing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to all of you who are using this mod, what have you come with? please show pictures!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T09:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 09:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by merlinux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gailardia","CreatedById":84773,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T20:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this isn\u0027t exactly with containers, it is done with the ability to pick things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/541848004381848444/413F0405161B8E10F027F7E3A58F6937AC63F524/\u0022 alt=\u0022413F0405161B8E10F027F7E3A58F6937AC63F524\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
