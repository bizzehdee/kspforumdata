AWESOME!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i want to do: Have added mods for empty command modules, main command pod detaches from the secondary with a kerbal in the secondary. the controls and stage stacking for everything attached to the secondary command pod seems there but none of the controls respond. i would guess because the code shuts those down after detachment from the main command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this possible to do? seems like it might be and I\\\u0027m just going about this wrong. haven\\\u0027t seen other posts for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a secondary lander craft while the main stays in orbit even without docking and they could EVA back to the main pod would be amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMadGameplay","CreatedById":20225,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T15:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is because the mod for the empty command modules act as a strut that can carry crew but has no controls.
