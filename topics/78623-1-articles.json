Please let me know if anyone else agrees or disagrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003ELost in translation:\u003C/strong\u003E I know this doesn\u0027t really impact the gameplay of .24, but I am curious why the contract descriptions are, at times, almost unintelligible. It is not so much bad writing that is to blame, rather it seems more as if the paragraphs were written in another language and put through a translator program. The syntax is odd and words are in places that just don\u0027t make sense. Is this caused by a random descriptor generator? If not, I\u0027m sure you could find a fledgling writer to work for next to nothing to at least polish the entries before submission (ahem, cough, cough, ahem). Everything else in the game and on the forum is written well by the devs, which is why I am so perplexed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003ELanding Gear: \u003C/strong\u003E This isn\u0027t really a critique specific to .24, but I am still wondering why jet engines, wings, fins, winglets, intakes, and the Mk 1 Command Pod are all unlocked (at least for me) before the wheeled landing gear. I was given a contract to test the jet engine and I had to make a VTOL with LT-1 landing struts (looked somewhat like the Pogo plane from real life) in order to make something that would get off the ground and land again in one piece, which doesn\u0027t seem to flow logically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003Cstrong\u003EHardcore mode/too much money?\u003C/strong\u003E I just found out this morning that a hardcore mode was available as an option, but I definitely think implementing this option in a more obvious way might be a good idea. I\u0027ve actually never reached a point where I was low on funds (but I do use the revert option quite a bit; I know that makes it easier but it\u0027s just so hard not to!). Maybe varying difficulty modes could be implemented, but so far I feel the challenge could be a little greater, at least for those who have been playing Kerbal for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003Cstrong\u003EProbes/unmanned flight:\u003C/strong\u003E I still don\u0027t see much use for the probes/satellites in the game. Would it be possible, perhaps, to start out by requiring the player to send unmanned flights into space first before unlocking the capsules? This would more accurately mirror a real life space program progression system and give purpose to those oft unused probe pieces (at least for me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it so far. I know this is the early version of the contracts system (the first in fact!) and more tweaks are, I bet, on the way.

I think it is like that because the test contracts are more or less completely random. So it goes something like \u0022insert random engine\u0022 or \u0022insert random part\u0022, \u0022insert random flight condition\u0022, \u0022insert random height condition\u0022 etc. so that\u0027s why the grammar might be a bit off sometimes. Only the unique missions like landin on Mun, reaching orbit etc. are completely handwritten and correct. I guess they will fix it in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Yes I agree about that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I personally think the new options for perma death and deactivating the revert to and quicksaves/loads is a good first step. But yeah they could maybe add those at the beginning of the career to choose different career settings which you cannot change after you have started the career. I suppose they will eventually add such career settings. I used to use the \u0022revert to\u0022 and quicksave features quiet often before, but I guess it was more a convenience before. But now with funds, it makes total sense to be able to lose rockets and money. Reverting back to launch feels like cheating now to me because otherwise you would never lose any money at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. That\u0027s something for you if you activate the perma kerbal death. So before sending out valuable Kerbals like Jeb \u0026amp; Co to their doom with an untested rocket. You can test the rocket remote controlled. But I agree there aren\u0027t much practical advantages yet for satellites or probes, well at least not without mods. It\u0027s different with mods of course. But I agree that it would probably be nice to have to tech tree changed so that the command pods will be unlocked later in the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T14:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

HarvestR said specifically that the descriptions are \u0027procedural\u0027 and sometimes may actually make sense. I\u0027m pretty sure they know they are goofy, and maybe they\u0027ll do a bit of work on them at some time in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As for landing gear, the node you are talking about is aerodynamics, and the wheels are in survivability I think. So your complaint is really that you can build an entire plane SANS wheels with one node, and perhaps it would be smarter to push the pieces into proper categories or just shove wheels in with the rest of them. Personally I agree, why is a jet engine in with wings instead of engines? Honestly, the tech tree isn\u0027t perfect (far from it) but everyone has a different idea of how it should progress. To keep this response short, it seemed like the original plan was to have you unlock nodes with science and then purchase pieces you could then use to build craft in the VAB. I still think that\u0027s a more logical method and would actually tie in well with funds but I\u0027ll save that for another post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Funds are far from balanced, and revert basically removes any real Kerbal-related pay issues. For now, if you want that same challenge you just have to fight the urge to revert. Keep in mind, however, that if you need to repair a ship because you did something dumb pre-launch, the recovery is 100% anyways so revert to VAB isn\u0027t a big issue under those circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As people have mentioned, there are reasons to send unmanned but it\u0027s mostly personal preference. The major issue is simply that it is cheaper to send a Kerbal on any mission, and more lucrative. Probes require a constant intake of electricity, Kerbals require nothing. Probes cannot do crew or EVA reports, collect data from science modules or repair broken parts. THIS is why probes have no purpose. If Kerbals required life-support, it\u0027s very likely solar panels and batteries would be a very attractive alternative. Restricting the player to unmanned missions first is not really the issue, because it doesn\u0027t address why the player is sending Kerbals to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T15:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe language is a bit tricky.
