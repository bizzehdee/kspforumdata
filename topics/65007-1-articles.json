This is especially true when testing structural integrity, as it is very difficult to predict the safety levels of rockets, and it will quite often lead to an exploding ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to have a command module dedicated to testing rocket designs. This would work the same as all other command modules, however it would prevent reputation being lost if the rocket explodes. In order to provide balance, science equipment could be disabled on crafts with this module, so that you couldn\u0027t use it as a method to explore without repercussions for failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem that this wouldn\u0027t solve is the financial cost of testing rockets. It would be very costly to build a ship twice, but this problem will be present whether or not testing modules are involved. The only financially viable system that I can think of, for any sort of testing, would be to have a specific budget included in contracts that are handed out, which could only be used for testing, or some sort of sponsorship application when planning your own missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T02:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting concept... here\u0027s my two cents:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of having a Testing Module, perhaps probe-controlled rockets would carry less of a reputation loss than the death of a Kerbal.

You could still obviously have a large number of reverts if you wanted, but I would imagine that when career mode is fully up and running, most people would have second thoughts about using autosave and revert flight as often, because it is a form of cheating.
