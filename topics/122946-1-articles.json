The streaming feature always assumes that there is currently no game running in fullscreen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried other games (namely the Witcher 3) and they worked fine. When i press ALT\u002BZ in the Witcher 3, the streaming overlay will popup over the game instead of minimizing the game to the taskbar. It feels just like for example the steam overlay. and i can activate the streaming in witcher 3 no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if somebody maybe has the same problem and maybe has a solution for it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: someone on reddit pointed me to this thread that had the solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114935-KSP-1-0-x-0-90-windows-true-exclusive-fullscreen-shadowplay-and-gsync-solution\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114935-KSP-1-0-x-0-90-windows-true-exclusive-fullscreen-shadowplay-and-gsync-solution\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T04:44:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maxdreamland\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efound a solution for the problem\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
