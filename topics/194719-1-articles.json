As in, you hit space, it flips?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the probe core upside down or sideways? If you try to hold prograde and your probe core is upside down you\u0027re going to be sad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, the only thing I can think is it\u0027s got heavy engines (and lots of them) in back and a big draggy bubble out front, so it would naturally want to fly backwards. See the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E sphere way down on the bottom of the craft. That\u0027s bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can fix that by making it taller and having a top stage that doesn\u0027t get used until you\u0027re high up, or even in space. That fuel up top will help keep your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward.
