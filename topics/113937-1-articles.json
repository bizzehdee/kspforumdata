Hitting the wrong target or whatever. But all going well, your space junk explodes, and with luck, nothing remains.\n\nI know there is a mod to remove space junk, but its just totally unrealistic.... click a button and ALL junk vanishes. To me, space junk is a problem that any planet will have to deal with eventually, and Earth is beyond that point now, but with K.S.P. ... we can think ahead.\n\nAlso, if multi player is ever bought to KSP stock standard, then you could have fun, in a war, blowing each others ships out of the sky. (sure, makes it hard, but you could have a setting where the only things the ICBM can target is junk... (debris) so that would ensure its not all just a shooting war...\n\nAnyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T02:53:39Z","Content":"Would be cool.

Although a nice mission to set up is going up with a full de-orbital package. This is either hooked on object in EVA or in later tech levels has a grabber claw or KAS harpoons. Once connected a quick burn will destabilize the orbit of the junk. In more advanced stages of the game these de-orbit packages are probes that can let go and return to orbit again to be used on another intercept mission."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T08:16:17Z","Content":"Actually, from a realistic standpoint, launching a rocket to destroy space debris will only produce more debris."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:58:52Z","Content":"Creating more debris, possibly... unless the modder could write a dll or something that actually does remove (destroy) anything with say 200 feet of the explosion. \n\nAs for cost, of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. as for career mode, you could be given a mission to destroy space junk, and have to develop better targeting and the like.\n\nTo me, this would be the easiest most realistic way to remove space junk. Sure, you could do it the time consuming way... but that would get to be a drag after the 500th junk clearing mission.\n\nLasers would be good... to a point. Maybe both missile and lasers.\n\nEarly on in my game, when I had hardly any mods loaded, I\u0027d have to send stuff up using massive rockets, and those stages are still in orbit. I\u0027m trying to keep the game as realistic as I can without cheating, so just removing the junk wouldn\u0027t be realistic. My motto for KSP is that all actions have consequences. That is why when My Jeb was killed, I did not bring him back to life. So.... there is space junk... keeping it realistic... I could plant explosives on the junk, but that would be tedious, and to some point, launching a rocket might actually just replace some junk with what is removed. \n\nAgain, keeping it realistic... this would be the best option. Besides, China tested a satellite killing missile recently, Russia has them and although they would deny it, I\u0027m betting the USA does as well.\n\nDid I mention it would also be fun.... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:19:20Z","Content":"Actually in my current career I leave all the junk. When I have nothing better to do (i.e. waiting for another transfer window) I use klaw to catch the debris and either deorbit them or bring them down for recovery. I wish we had a robotic arm like in Space Shuttle to actually catch something and deposit it in the cargo bay. I tried to create something like that using KAS and IR but it was far too cumbersome for me to actually handle that thing.\n\nThis strategy helps keeping my LKO relatively clean (especially since I started adding a probe core, a battery and separatrons for deorbiting). It gets harder to manage junk on the Mun and Minmus orbits. Never bothered with the junk around other planets though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T12:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:42:15Z","Content":"I hate to be THAT person, but an ICBM is an Inter-Continental Balistic Missile, so that wouldn\u0027t particularly be an ICBM."}]}
