Hitting the wrong target or whatever. But all going well, your space junk explodes, and with luck, nothing remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is a mod to remove space junk, but its just totally unrealistic.... click a button and ALL junk vanishes. To me, space junk is a problem that any planet will have to deal with eventually, and Earth is beyond that point now, but with K.S.P. ... we can think ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if multi player is ever bought to KSP stock standard, then you could have fun, in a war, blowing each others ships out of the sky. (sure, makes it hard, but you could have a setting where the only things the ICBM can target is junk... (debris) so that would ensure its not all just a shooting war...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T02:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be cool.

Although a nice mission to set up is going up with a full de-orbital package. This is either hooked on object in EVA or in later tech levels has a grabber claw or KAS harpoons. Once connected a quick burn will destabilize the orbit of the junk. In more advanced stages of the game these de-orbit packages are probes that can let go and return to orbit again to be used on another intercept mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T08:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, from a realistic standpoint, launching a rocket to destroy space debris will only produce more debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreating more debris, possibly... unless the modder could write a dll or something that actually does remove (destroy) anything with say 200 feet of the explosion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for cost, of course, there is no such thing as a free lunch. as for career mode, you could be given a mission to destroy space junk, and have to develop better targeting and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this would be the easiest most realistic way to remove space junk. Sure, you could do it the time consuming way... but that would get to be a drag after the 500th junk clearing mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELasers would be good... to a point. Maybe both missile and lasers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly on in my game, when I had hardly any mods loaded, I\u0027d have to send stuff up using massive rockets, and those stages are still in orbit. I\u0027m trying to keep the game as realistic as I can without cheating, so just removing the junk wouldn\u0027t be realistic. My motto for KSP is that all actions have consequences. That is why when My Jeb was killed, I did not bring him back to life. So.... there is space junk... keeping it realistic... I could plant explosives on the junk, but that would be tedious, and to some point, launching a rocket might actually just replace some junk with what is removed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, keeping it realistic... this would be the best option. Besides, China tested a satellite killing missile recently, Russia has them and although they would deny it, I\u0027m betting the USA does as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I mention it would also be fun.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually in my current career I leave all the junk. When I have nothing better to do (i.e. waiting for another transfer window) I use klaw to catch the debris and either deorbit them or bring them down for recovery. I wish we had a robotic arm like in Space Shuttle to actually catch something and deposit it in the cargo bay. I tried to create something like that using KAS and IR but it was far too cumbersome for me to actually handle that thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis strategy helps keeping my LKO relatively clean (especially since I started adding a probe core, a battery and separatrons for deorbiting). It gets harder to manage junk on the Mun and Minmus orbits.
