As soon as I pressed the key the ship exploded. I loaded my quicksave which happened to be from before the ship was fully assembled. When I entered time acceleration while flying one of the sub assemblies to the larger ship, it accelerated to 5x normal speed, then immediately cancelled with the message \u0022cannot time accelerate while ship is under acceleration\u0022. I had zero thrust set and RCS off, but through kerbal engineer I could see my apoapsis increasing as if I was at full thrust. When I selected full thrust the ship continued accelerating at the same rate with no increase in acceleration. I was also unable to rotate the ship at all, and selecting a setting on the SAS did nothing to the orientation. I tried shutting down engines, disabling RCS, disabling reaction wheels, and nothing changes it. As the ship was 2 parts docked together, I undocked them to see if it was a specific part that was causing the issue. Half of the vessel began accelerating away perpendicular to the original trajectory uncontrollably while the other half stayed accelerating in the same direction it was previously traveling. I exited to the space center to try and reload the vessel and experienced the same results. I tried another vessel to see if the problem was only with the one ship and when I attempted time acceleration the same thing happened with the new vessel, and it accelerated at the same rate as original vessel, even though it contained no fuel, different engines, and had all systems turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is my save file being corrupted or if its an issue with mods, and I am wondering if anyone has any ideas. I am using 0.90 with various mods installed, though I have modified nothing in a very long time and have played for hours on various ships without having this happen before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
