But as it is, I can\\\u0027t get it far enough away that it looks straight, because if I do, then it appears outside the VAB walls. Another likely-unsurmountable problem is the fact that if the origin passes through the ground, it explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know the extent of the new plugin system? Were the vanilla landing legs built as a plugin?
