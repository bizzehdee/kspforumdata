MemoryLabel: Texture\n\nIf you\u0027re insistent on running in Windows, there\u0027s no reasonable way around using a memory management mod like ActiveTextureManagement. The 64-bit Windows builds were always tremendously unstable and do not actually effectively solve the memory problems.\n\nThat said, the crash dumps you posted are both 1.0.4 crash dumps, and 1.0.4 is not distributed in 64-bit. Once again, if you\u0027re using the hacks to run in 64-bit, you should ask within the 64-bit hack community for support. The log you posted separately appears to be from an entirely crash-free run of the game, so I\u0027m confused as to its relevance here."},{"CreatedByName":"Hatsune_Neko","CreatedById":67460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:55:07Z","Content":"i have it setup on steam to run Launcher.exe with the options set to run KSP on 64bit. so its not a hack. \n\nthough i may have forgotten to re update that option after the updates. it might have reset the launch path i set for it.\n\nand i did double check on that, it did indeed remove my custom launch option so i could use the 64bit version.\n\nso instead it was running the 32bit version. my bad."},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:57:04Z","Content":"Yep; no more 64-bit.
