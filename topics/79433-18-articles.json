They all use the stock modules. If ckan was not installing the config files the engines would not be in the game at all. It can\u0027t \u0022half\u0022 install a file and still have it show up, it just wouldn\u0027t be there. I looked at the ckan install script and there is nothing obviously wrong with it. I am going to have the ckan people take a look at it as well but I don\u0027t really expect them to find anything. If you guys could be more specific on exactly what is going wrong with it and check the difference between the manual install and the ckan one it would help. For instance, is there a size difference?

I poured over all config\u00A0files, cross referenced with the other files. I now believe it was with how FAR, RO, and RSS were installed. With FAR installed via ckan, the rockets would not do a gravity turn, straight up until out of the atmosphere, then I could turn. Cleared cache and installed FAR manually, works beautifully. RO just didn\u0027t do anything, manually or ckan installed. RSS screwed over my entire game. Maps were all out of wack, KSC was in the middle of the ocean for example. I\u0027m an OS X user, still running 1.0.4, yes I confirmed the proper version of RO/RSS. No, I didn\u0027t use the highest resolution RSS terrain textures.

The verniers are already at a thrust WAY above what they should be to counteract air resistance(35kN or close instead of 3kN like IRL). The rocket is too aerodynamically stable so it is going to fight you if you try and move off of prograde. You need to set a proper flight azimuth immediately on launch and let gravity pull the rocket as the verniers are really only good for roll until the air is almost gone. This takes a lot of practice to get your starting angle just right.
