This put me into a low orbit around the Mun with around 371 m/s of delta-v remaining to get home. This flight was done in a fresh save so I actually had the Mun lined up nicely. If it hadn\u0027t been lined up I could have waited a while in orbit until the orbital paths crossed. I\u0027m placing a maneuver node close to where my orbit meets the Mun\u0027s orbit on the \u0027front\u0027 side of the Mun (if you considered the Mun a vehicle moving forward in orbit). Next we drag out the pro-grade vector to break Mun orbit. Like I said before an easy way to do this is to take the available delta-v and create a maneuver with slightly less then that (so maybe 360 m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PIBfbHX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PIBfbHX.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/svCttxf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022svCttxf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O0RLFv8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O0RLFv8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the maneuver is in place we start moving it forward until we find the \u0027sweet spot\u0027 where it dips low into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere or even disappears into the planet.

Incredible work, thanks!\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: THought I did forget to mention I use TAC Life support so I can\u0027t just wait around for the paths to cross. Also, I want to ask if it is economical to ditch that much of your ship like that? I mean, that much money wasted from not being able to reclaim it must be a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily the Mun is tidally locked to Kerbin, get the launch right and you won\u0027t have to wait.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T03:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragonchampion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragonchampion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I want to ask if it is economical to ditch that much of your ship like that?

It was a two stage lander because I wanted the ascent part to match your reported delta-v. If I had used a normal Mun lander then some of the fuel would be burned during landing, make it impossible to plan precisely how much fuel (and delta-v) would be available for ascent. I considered having drop tanks or shifting fuel around after landing but it was just much more simple to spec out an ascent ship that matched your delta-v and then throw it on top of a transit/landing stage and add a launch stage that was equally simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Or4uam0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Or4uam0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELuckily the Mun is tidally locked to Kerbin, get the launch right and you won\u0027t have to wait.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually overlook that. Of course if I had landed somewhere else near the poles, maybe 90 degrees east or west, then I would need to wait several days while my orbit shifted in relation to the Mun to get the cheapest return, though I am somewhat convinced now that with 1000 m/s available you wouldn\u0027t need to wait, just find the best fit for that orbit and go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC life support makes things more complicated, since a low delta-v return can take more then 24 hours. I\u0027m not sure how tight it was on your ship, but playing BTSM getting to and returning from the Mun in a short amount of time is very important since every minute you are consuming precious power and batteries add a lot of weight at that stage in the game (I\u0027ve got it under 10 hours for the entire round trip in order to get it under the mass limit for certain tech levels).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T04:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Dave Kerman: i have a quick question about your explanation on the previous page. since you are on the prograde side of the Mun, why not: launch north @45 degrees until your apoapsis is ~8km, then burn at the horizon until you get the desired Kerbin periapsis? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eintuitively that would seem to me to be the more efficient method (and also a bit faster), so i assume that i am missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T04:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Dave Kerman: i have a quick question about your explanation on the previous page. since you are on the prograde side of the Mun, why not: launch north @45 degrees until your apoapsis is ~8km, then burn at the horizon until you get the desired Kerbin periapsis? \u003Cp\u003Eintuitively that would seem to me to be the more efficient method (and also a bit faster), so i assume that i am missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone correctly it could be faster, I\u0027m not entirely sure it would be more efficient if we are thinking about the same thing. I went south partially because I felt it was more intuitive but also because it provided the space to break things up into nice clear pieces. Without mods (like PreciseNode) getting around in KSP can be less then accurate, sometimes even frustrating. Using the stock maneuver node interface is far from accurate and while a player who already knows what they are doing can compensate and even make manual corrections mid burn it doesn\u0027t help someone who has not done that kind of maneuver before and is trying to learn from an example. For that reason I did it without combining steps or making intuitive adjustments (that could only be made by someone who already knew how it worked) to get things perfect. Stock KSP control is imperfect so any instructions or plans need to accept imperfection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T05:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDone correctly it could be faster, I\u0027m not entirely sure it would be more efficient if we are thinking about the same thing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, thinking about it further i don\u0027t think it would be any more efficient. it was just one of those thoughts where i didn\u0027t entirely realise that we are dealing with orbital velocities in a vacuum. like getting out of orbit by burning towards the planet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
