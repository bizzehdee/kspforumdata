In fact, they almost never even mention an update for console. But when they do mention a console update, they usually mention it in a very small paragraph in a random post about something completely unrelated to a console update. All they talk about is PC updates. I think it\u0027s more than obvious that they care a lot more about their PC fans than their console fans. The PC version is playable unlike the console version which is filled with game breaking bugs that literally make the game unplayable and nearly impossible to progress in career mode. You\u0027d think that they\u0027d prioritize a console update, but no. Clearly it was just a cash grab because anyone who played the game for anymore than an hour could clearly see that it\u0027s worse than a pre-alpha beta.\u00A0If they are actually working on an update, then it better fix every single bug in the game because this is unacceptable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-22T19:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bit of preemptive moderation here since this is a contentious topic: The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

If it implied in the sales and promotion literature that KSP console version was a full working game and not an in development product, then the purchasers have every right under UK consumer law to request a full refund,\u00A0 and don\u0027t think that just because Squad or their affiliates are a company based in the US \\ Mexico. that in some way they are immune from this condition, they are not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Example a short time ago i purchased a product from a business based solely in the US, it wasn\u0027t budget by any means, and fully and in great detail represented itself as a complete package, upon delivery\u00A0 and first use it became apparent that this product. far from being the wonder tool it was supposed to be ,\u00A0 was a mishmash of stolen ideas and half completed functions, in short\u00A0 it was to use the British parlance a pile of crap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after calming my enraged wife ( it was a not insubstantial sum to waste)\u00A0 and investigating, i discovered that i was not alone, I also discovered that as I had purchased the item via a credit card that I actually had some teeth. Contacting the credit card company initially by phone and then in writing to provide evidence of the contract etc ultimately resulted in them fully recovering my investment and that of several others. Why? all because it was not, under UK definition, fit for purpose .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i don\u0027t know for sure how KSP for consoles was represented to it\u0027s customers in the UK,\u00A0 but i reckon that if any of them paid by credit card that under UK law they would stand a very good chance of getting a refund.\u00A0 That\u0027s certainly one solid way to express dissatisfaction and one that will be felt in the pocket and reputation of the companies involved\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor clarity i state i have no interest either way i don\u0027t own a console, never have , likely never will, wrecked hands make those controllers torture devices,\u00A0 I just think that the whole thing stinks and does remind us that despite our familiarity with Squad, KSP, etc\u00A0 they\u0027re still just a company who wants to make cash above all else, and to my mind there\u0027s no difference between a burglar and a company that picks your pocket by less
