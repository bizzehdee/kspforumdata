ORS has a permissive license (I can derive and go to town provided I include the correct notices). Kethane does not.

I have less of an issue with depending on things like FireSpitter, ORS, etc. where the licensing is more open than in extending walled gardens where you have to be careful of licensing rules.

To be completely honest my preference would be for Karbonite to not depend on Kethane or ORS, for the same reason I don\u0027t want to look at scansat integration. I despise mod dependencies. One of the biggest issues I have with KSP mod development ATM is how many mods depend on mods X Y and Z also to work rather than just functioning on their own, but thats an issue for another thread. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E It was just that by depending on kethane you\u0027d be depending on 1 other mod, as opposed to ORS \u0026amp; scansat both, and the two of those combines still not giving as much functionality as just Kethane dependency. That\u0027s all I was getting at. Not trying to be a wall. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of things about the whole compatibility/new planets/karbonite vs kethane functionality debate that I think need to be keep in mind at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Neither kethane nor Planet Factory have been updated for 0.24.2 and neither seem to have a licence which allows anyone else to update them in the author\u0027s absence at this time. Neither of them are truly functional, though some people do get some mileage out of PF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Resource maps for new planets won\u0027t be an issue in a world where there is a popular and widely used resource gathering system based on ORS. They just have not to date because it wasn\u0027t entirely necessary. That being said, maps were made for at least a few planet packs to accommodate interstellar so... its really a non issue. The content will be made based on what people use and the demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Karbonite and Kethane aren\u0027t really incompatible. Like you could run both at once just like you may already do now with kethane and interstellar. They simply are not compatible in that they share no systems and will not talk to each other or integrate.
