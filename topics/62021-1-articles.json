I assume you\u0027re okay with modding, since you\u0027re using MechJeb. My advice: Get KW Rocketry. Their engines are much better. By which I mean they are more specialized, not that they are simply overpowered compared to stock. And they have better sounds, too, less OH GOD EAR ****!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve done that, basically divide your rocket into two sections: Launch and Mission. Build the Mission stage first, though it will itself be divided into transfer and lander stages (more on that later.) Assume you\u0027re starting from the very edge of LKO (you won\u0027t be, set MechJeb to at least a 100km, preferably a 200km launch,) and count up your dV requirements. 680 \u002B 180 = 860 to do your Hohmann transfer to the Mun, 80 to correct, 230 to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlan for the \u003Cem\u003Eworst.\u003C/em\u003E And by that I mean plan your transfer stage to get all the way to a circularized orbit of the Mun and then turn around and go home \u003Cem\u003Ewithout jettisoning anything.\u003C/em\u003E So count it back again: 230 \u002B 80 to get back to Kerbin\u0027s SOI, 180 \u002B 680 to get to low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives us a number of 1,170. Don\u0027t stop there, though, if you\u0027re making a shot at one of the satellites of Kerbin, you want an inclination change buffer. Make it at least 1,500, preferably 1,800 or better, and no matter what you do, if you find yourself cutting down to the mathematical wire, turn around and head home. You don\u0027t want to find yourself planning impromptu rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, your lander stage itself will need a lot of dV. Fortunately, it\u0027s light, so what would barely qualify as an engine and fuel supply for a transfer stage qualifies as beefy for a lander. The bare minimum, for a Mun landing, is 1,160, unless it\u0027s a one-way trip. Again, see my advice about not planning impromptu rescue missions: It\u0027s very possible for a planned two-way trip to become a one-way trip by accident. \u0022We ran out of fuel\u0022 should not be one of those accidents, however, so plan that stage with at least 1,500 dV \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E. You may want to hop up and have a look at another biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, the launch stage. Once everything\u0027s together, this sucker should have a minimum of 4,500 dV. You won\u0027t need much buffer on this, if you\u0027re using MechJeb, since it can put you into the orbit you want on exactly 4,500 dV with a ridiculous degree of accuracy. If it doesn\u0027t have 4,500, you\u0027re automatically scrubbed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, you want light-weight, high-atmosphere-ISP engines. You won\u0027t be in atmo the entire time, of course, but again, don\u0027t cut it down to the wire: if you have 4,500 atmo DV, you definitely have all the DV you need to get into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, build it from the top-down. Build your lander stage first, and don\u0027t plan on bringing any part of the damn thing home. It \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E fully possible and practical to build a lander capable of landing from low Munar orbit, doing a few biome-change hops and then returning to the mothership as a single stage. There are advantages and disadvantages, though the biggest advantage is that if you do so successfully, you can easily vamp the lander\u0027s fuel tanks and RCS tanks for any remaining fuel. Every little bit helps, especially when you don\u0027t actually have to bring the lander\u0027s mass home with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, you\u0027re planning to fly the satellite of your choice (more on that later.) You\u0027re going to go down, do some Science (Science!) and come home. Ideally, you want to bring a lot of Science with you. You know what you \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E need to bring back? Those heavy goo containers, and those even-heavier Science Jr. materials bays. I didn\u0027t realize that at first and made a stupid lander designed to take off, do science, return to the mothership, transfer the kerbonaut back, and then jettison the landercan and fuel tanks, leaving the Science Jr. and goo tanks still attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can leave those on the Munar surface to increase your DV. attach them radially, have your Kerbonaut cuddle up to them, rightclick on them, take the Science out of them,get back in and discard them. You also don\u0027t need landing legs on your return trip, so if you\u0027re going to decouple something, might as well attach the things you won\u0027t be needing to the heaviest things you won\u0027t need. So build it low, squat, radialize the engines and radialize the Science! bays onto the engine pylons, and radialize the goo onto the Science bays, along with the lander legs. If you\u0027re so inclined, of course. It\u0027s just my way, but I like to plan my landers and mission stages as if everything is going back with me. Remember, the only cost to taking fuel home with you is the cost of going up in the first place, and fortunately the Kerbal race are so space-happy that KSP currently enjoys unlimited funding. (Enjoy that while it lasts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the short version: Build from the lander down. The lander needs 1,500 dV. The transfer stage needs 1,500 as well, though I wouldn\u0027t go without 1,800 minimum myself. And the launch stage needs 4,500. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you don\u0027t meet these numbers, don\u0027t launch.\u003C/strong\u003E Or if you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E launch, use a probe core in there somewhere and have your learning experiences \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E a Kerbal\u0027s life on the line. You can always do what the Apollo program did, take it one step at a time, test each step and come home before moving on to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my personal trick for launching heavy payloads? It\u0027s as simple as it is reliable. Build \u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E, not down. Radialize, radialize, radialize. Six identical rockets firing at once will give you far, \u003Cstrong\u003Efar\u003C/strong\u003E more dV than those six firing in sequence, jettisoning when the stage above them is complete. And if you have to use a dozen or two dozen fuel stacks to get you up, so be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep it simple. People here swear by asparagus staging and mixed engines. I\u0027ll have none of that, personally. If it works for you, go for it, but my strategy is identical engines connected rigidly all the way. Even if it lags, so what? You\u0027ve got MechJeb, input lag and lag in general are no concern of yours. Launch the sucker at the sky, set of MJ to auto-stage if you attached SRBs (just remember that SRBs are bottom stage \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E,) and go make tea if you have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing: that much mass doesn\u0027t adjust its course easily if your only sources of control are fins (which do no good whatsoever above the atmosphere,) and the reaction wheels in the mission and lander stage. Put some reaction wheels in the lower stages. KW has a nifty one that can be radialized around a Rockomax fuel tank as two halves though using regular old inline reaction wheels works just as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, launch from as high up as possible. Attach rocket holders to the bottom of your rocket, hold shift or control (I forget which does which; alt copies the part,) as you click on the bottommost bit of your rocket, lift it as high up in the VAB as you can, attach the rocket holders, set them to decouple when the first stage launches. It\u0027s not much, but every little bit helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t forget to check \u0022Limit to terminal velocity.\u0022 Going past terminal velocity isn\u0027t doing your DV any favors, even if getting atmospheric re-entry effects going \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E is hella sweet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-03T17:04:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2014 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowDragon8685\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T18:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2 tips for you; if you havent already done it, try Minmus first.
