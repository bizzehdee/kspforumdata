So, i make the decision to eject and use the rescue and return pod to save my kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI burn and burn in the RR and after slamming into Jools atmo causing a dramatic aerobraking i\u0027m left in the pod on a bad orbit thats intent on slamming me into Jool sooner or later. Again i burn to circularise my orbit so that i can send a rescue for the rescue return pod (which failed to do it\u0027s job in this case) and i run out of fuel.
