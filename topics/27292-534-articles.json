Indeed it\u0027s one of the unlocks that enables a single launch Kerballed Mun landing and return in the 18 ton / 30 part limit. (The other option being the node with the 48-7S and fuel lines, both widely accepted as godly parts.) So the turbojet on a 90 science node seems rather early.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI followed that thread with great interest. Using FAR and KIDS(far-\u0026gt;stock atmo) the basic jet is good to about 10-12k without wings, then the thrust gets so low it will start toppling over, it will cut 1500dV from the launch making it a lot lighter, for a disposable launcher. But yes, they are highly exploitable(I guess AJE might fix that, but I think FAR/KIDS is enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont like using jets for rockets, so mostly its for my enjoyment. Unlocking them at teir7 seems way to late(seeing as you get Aerospike and Rapier at the same time) moving them down to supersonic flight or so makes for a more fun progression, for me atleast, and I moved basic jet to start node(along with wings etc for aircraft). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T10:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts a (almost) wrap!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer in 23.5 ended with the Jool expedition picking up the out-of-fuel Duna expedition, sending the robotic miner to refuel from Ike, taking the lander for one more trip to vist Ike and spent a while in Duna\u0027s orbit to wait for a window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEager to deliver the science data as soon as possible, Jeb stuffed everything into a Mk1 pod and separated from the Explorer III with a Kerbin PE of 20km, while Bob steered the ship into a orbit parallel to the station in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Explorer III - while not 100% perfect - performed admirably!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Will have to upload some pictures at last.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an ion probe - that will most likely lack power for anything so far out - is still out there and might catch a flyby at Eeloo ... or not, will see next Saturday, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime I am trying to get my .90 to work again as I want it to.
