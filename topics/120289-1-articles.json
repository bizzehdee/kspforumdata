So in the LHC they are now giving protons 6.5 TeV, this is alot more energy than they placed to see Higgs. We can actually see how big the protons are, we know the mass but not the size. You need two protons to do this, and you are lookin for the non-elastic radius. But since the collision can only be refernced from the TeV vectors, the energy doubles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis strikes me as a bit odd, but maybe not. In my 40 year old verision of physics, the length of the particle increases. But here they show that also the crossectional area increases, not as quickly. So i am wondering whether this is due to E = hv, that the proton is not traveling in a strait line, but that the amplitude of its vibration and frequency simultaneously increase. Is this infact a consideration that if something vibrates really fast the the tangential motion vector would also undergo dilation therefor causing the particle to get fat. Is this a not a non-conservation of energy, or do we simply ignore length shortages because they are too difficult to measure? And of the article has its measure of don\u0027t know or not explained?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find your analogy disconcerting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T01:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECollision cross-section has very little to do with size of the particle.

Since you don\u0027t seem compelled to explain it, I prefer the primary literature, and you like to devolve into \u0027only respected Particle physicists are allowed\u0027 platitudes then I think Its better that i do get it from the published lit anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i told you the truth the original copyright date on my physics text is from 1980 and at its writing it wasn\u0027t comprehensive, and out of date past 1960s. So at this point I know to ask where this is pointing. I can read the primary and secondary literature just fine, thank you very much, but I have to know where they are coming from.
