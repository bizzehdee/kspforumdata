I think the idea that having unlimited resources by the endgame isn\u0027t solely KSP\u0027s issue. Similarly, in KSP2 even if we implement a resource system we will run into that problem by the end. The issue with KSP\u0027s fund system is that it\u0027s scaled wrong and getting it takes a lot of grind. The only way perhaps you could keep funds or resources relevant all the way into the endgame would be by increasing operational costs to say, launch a rocket or create a new colony, to keep in step with your resource output.

KSP2 promises gameplay that could plateau more like the way Cities Skylines or Factorio does, in which you can essentially build and build until your computer grinds to a halt. But that\u0027s just a layer. Much as I love building sims at its real heart KSP is about exploration--reaching that next planet. Early on Nate spoke about the most important driver being the unknown, and ultimately thats true--the game really shouldn\u0027t feel \u0027beaten\u0027 until you\u0027ve explored every moon and planet in the game, which with interstellar could be years and thousands of hours. So I think having some prominent tally showing which worlds have been visited by probes or footprints or colonies creates a nice benchmark for committed completionists.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThats not everyone though. This is just me guessing, but I\u0027d be willing to bet most players are going to treat completing the tech tree as the main goal. I just think the way gaming culture goes folks respond to rewards and once all of the shiny new toys are unlocked they\u0027re going to play around with them a bit and then start thinking about starting over. Colonies and deep exploration will stretch this but I think the devs could view completing the tech tree as a mean end state. The way science is distributed and gathered and processed is going to be absolutely critical to scaling that end-game to interstellar exploration. They\u0027d be wise to withhold those last crazy antimater engines and reactors and colony mega-domes out until you\u0027d explored and developed science infrastructure on least a few bodies in another system. At that point resources begin to take a backseat. You\u0027re still going to need them especially when setting up shop and growing around Debdeb, but at that point I\u0027d like to see more complex and challenging puzzles around what fuels make the most sense in specific situations. Throughout the progression resources should be critically important, but its not about just heaping up mountains of metals and methalox that you\u0027ll never be able to use, but carefully allocating your investment of energy to balance a small suite resources in the proportions that you need. Of course you can overbuild and brute force if you like, but you might be wiser to be efficient and push toward more leaner meaner vessels and better tech.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-03T16:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2023 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 3\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-03T16:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224308367\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691077841\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, but KSP isn\u0027t really a strategy game I think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that KSP2 could very much be a strategy game once one reaches the colony stage, or at least perhaps I am just biased because I enjoy strategy games a lot.

In KSP 1 resources deplete for asteroids but not on major bodies, where you can pump infinitely without ever running dry. I sort of suspect this to be the same in KSP2 mainly because different players will chose to timewarp over very different scales and to make it so a colony dries up suddenly for one playstyle vs another seems unnecessarily restrictive. I also expect the focus to me more on the actual engineering of colonies (like vessels making sure your inputs and outputs are all nicely balanced) than on a complex economic sim. Sure, you\u0027ll be able to ship resources from one colony or mining site to another, but its still just resource inputs and outputs. I that case it doesn\u0027t really matter if one player wants to putter around the inner planets and another player wants to warp all the way on a standalone Jool mission. Resources will top off whatever tanks you have available. You could of course keep building more, but but if you have plenty to do your next mission why would you? I suspect over time most players will either grow to serve their needs or just grow for aesthetic reasons. If the thing they\u0027re really chasing is buying new parts on the tech tree or better yet reaching the next horizon resources become just a tool to that end, not an end to itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-03T18:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224308101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691000213\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200461\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K33N\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, K33N said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite what an \u003Cstrong\u003Eextremely\u003C/strong\u003E vocal and passionate group feels, career mode is by far the most popular way to play the game and late game career is where the main KSP gameplay loop is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need the random mission generation and the constraints imposed by money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played almost exclusively career mode\u2026 and I think it was barely functional.
