I\u0027d like to be able to build all sorts of stuff (huge ships, stations, outposts, W/E) in space after launching the pieces into space separately.... without having a pair of docking ports every twenty feet.\n\nI haven\u0027t used the Sr. docking port yet, but the smaller ones are pretty wobbly and unsatisfying. And the big one is pretty heavy. If there isn\u0027t a way to do it in the stock game, is there a mod for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T20:55:49Z","Content":"IF you\u0027re asking about welding parts . . . no. There is no mod, no stock functionality, nothing. Honestly, you can launch/dock some pretty big sections together if you have the lifter capabilities. The hard part is that KSP docking ports (even the seniors) are wobbly because they\u0027re thin and light and often sandwiched between massively heavy components.\n\nThere are mods that add docking ports made of unobtanium. They\u0027re stupidly heavy but because mass factors in KSP\u0027s joint strength calculation, it improves docking strength significantly."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T20:59:00Z","Content":"Kerbal Attachment/Inventory System and Extraplanetary Launchpads allow you to do this.
