There is no mod, no stock functionality, nothing. Honestly, you can launch/dock some pretty big sections together if you have the lifter capabilities. The hard part is that KSP docking ports (even the seniors) are wobbly because they\u0027re thin and light and often sandwiched between massively heavy components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods that add docking ports made of unobtanium. They\u0027re stupidly heavy but because mass factors in KSP\u0027s joint strength calculation, it improves docking strength significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T20:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment/Inventory System and Extraplanetary Launchpads allow you to do this.
