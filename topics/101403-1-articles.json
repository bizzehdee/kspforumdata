Specially for the new player that has never been there and seen the planet (hence, should be stock). When I started playing I tried my best not to look at them before I got there. Worked at the beginning but once I learned how to properly do transfers I just wanted/needed to look at them closer so I could get a better intercept, so the last planets I visited was a so-so experience I think."},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:03:31Z","Content":"I really love the idea.. I thought of that when I started playing the game too.. Here is my best achievement for now in this..\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Ds6lw)\n\nI started working on this at the same time I was playing around with SCANSat for the first time.. I finally came to the conclusion that the best approach would be great to have scansat images as planet textures if SCANSat is available, or use the lowest resolution depending how close the player gets a manned ship / unmanned with camera probe into that.\n\nI\u0027d like to also introduce the idea of update the planets information according to experimental research.. why showing if a planet has atmosphere or not, or the gravity if we never sent a probe to check for it?\n\nNow that I see some interest is around, we might want to have a brainstorm, isn\u0027t it?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:13:23Z","Content":"Hmm...idk, while this is potentially a good idea, it would make telescope mods like [CactEye2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105660-0-90-CactEye-2-Orbital-Telescope-BETA-5) pretty boring and not making sense. I mean, if I have a powerful enough telescope, I should be able to visually see the planets and bodies from where I am, right? And isn\u0027t it how we figure out a lot of things within our solar system? Pointing telescopes and other instruments at places from Earth and see what data we get from them. And heck, someone with really good eyes would probably be able to make out some details of the moon at the right time. I would save the probes for more advanced things that require on site interaction like resource scanning, which is coming soon to stock game, and SCANsat data for detail mapping of a planet, allowing me to plan bases and such.\n\nMaybe instead of making it a probe-based things, we would need it to be a telescope-based. Sending a probe to a place without having a telescope to check it out first, and without camera on it, would mean you are flying blind. But if you have already examine it through your available technology it would be possible to see things, albeit in low res.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T16:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:27:43Z","Content":"I agree with this Idea, considering that I want to create a plugin and some parts for hunting ksp Extrasolar planets, like that of Kepler, or smaller ones that are about 10cm^3, and yes, I want to be able to randomly generate \u0022systems\u0022 that will then create sky biomes and when you point a telescope at them, then do science, there will be a science random science experiment for each."},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:37:48Z","Content":"It should make a difference with \u0027what is visible\u0027 and what is not..

The same principle applies for other bodies (depending on a config, obviously), but I like the idea of retexturing the bodies with information from cameras/scansats or eva visualisation, lets see if it is useful or not.\n\n![pQlimjB.png](http://i.imgur.com/pQlimjB.png)\n\nWell, if it has an atmosphere it may happen that the surface will not be known because it is covered, and mass/gravity even the orbit (distance etc) could be approximate, but exact values might not be guessed from regular \u0027observation\u0027 unless a special event happens.\n\nI think a good idea could be to provide more information of the bodies according to the tracking station building level and the tech tree, BUT, if the player gets a probe close to a body he might not need to upgrade the building or the tech and get the information on-site. Additional parts like cameras (custom or using CactEye2) can also add information to the knowledge base, and that info may require having a camera pointing a body for a whole kerbal year.\n\nI will have to install CactEye2 again to get a better idea on how is it now.

I\u0027ve seen people releasing planets for PlanetFactory promissing an update to integrate with Kopernicus when it is finished, but then two posts later they realise that Kopernicus seems to be limited in how they create the planets/systems/etc..
