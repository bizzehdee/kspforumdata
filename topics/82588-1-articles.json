So easy, it\u0027s pointless for me to explain just how easy it is! For my first 500 hours of KSP, I never entered the spaceplane hangar, feeling that I would be disappointed, based on my expectations of what flight should be. Turns out I was wrong, and even the stock aerodynamics model is incredibly fun, and building a jet that can take off and orbit the planet is immensely satisfying. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T15:11:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Voculus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T13:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to make a space plane.

The lack of landing guides (you know, an ILS) may also take some getting used to, unless you want to build such a system manually. A flag or base at both ends of the runway makes a good ILS for alignment (especially if you add more markers - one at 1 km, one at 5 km and then every 5 km after that out to say 30 km or so), doubly so if you name the flag/base after the distance to the runway because you can then use it to figure your approach glide slope and tell if you\u0027re too high or too low. Since you\u0027ve got a flight sim background, the specifics of the actual landing should be old hat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
