They have only a tiny view cone, but when you are far enough away from the planet/moon you still have a good fraction (or even all of it) in your field of view. Then you can drop a waypoint marker on it from KerbNet and use that to navigate a lander / rover / whatever there.

It turns out the field of view was indeed exceptionally small when standing on the ground. When I took off vertically from the surface, the question mark appeared. For some reason, the location seemed to get more accurate as I got higher though. And it also seems the field of view does not update correctly, as I got a larger change in the terrain scale when I closed and reopened the kerbnet map than when I just clicked \u0027refresh\u0027. Also, the field of view doesn\u0027t seem to be 10 degrees at all, but more like half of that... In any case, I appreciate your reply. In conclusion: it seems land-based rovers are useless in detecting anomalies, so I\u0027ll just go send a couple of high-altitude rovemate satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-19T10:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223787591\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193981\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589882476\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Monty\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Dr. Monty said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason, the location seemed to get more accurate as I got higher though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s because the KSP-internal markers are below the ground.
