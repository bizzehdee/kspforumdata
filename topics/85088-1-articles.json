But sometimes you have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter another round of rootbeers, Jebediah still was not drunk. He gave up on trying to drink away his problems. Problems being the passing of his father, Charlo Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sighed as the bartender walked up to Jeb. \u0022You\u0027ve had a lot to drink, I\u0027m cutting you off.\u0022 Jeb nodded. \u0022I\u0027m not drunk anyway, I\u0027m not going to \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E drunk.\u0022 Bartender told Jeb to track his fingers, and when he passed the test, he left Jeb alone. Jeb walked out of the bar, for the long walk home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was raining, something that didn\u0027t happen a lot where Jeb lived. Jeb ignored it, he\u0027d endured worse in his life. Jeb heard a cry for help in the alley nearby. Jeb ran in to see what was the matter, and saw that a woman was being kidnapped. The two kidnappers dragged the bound Kerbal along the floor. As Jeb watched the kidnappers push the girl through a door, he followed with interest. He carefully snuck through the door and observed with interest. The gag was removed from the girl\u0027s mouth. Jeb noticed the peculiar red color of this kerbelle\u0027s hair. \u0022Whit dae ye want wi\u0027 me?\u0022 The Kerbal shouted. You, Emmany, are essential to our plan. \u0022Hoo dae ye kne mah nam?\u0022 \u0022It doesn\u0027t matter. What does matter is that we know that you saw the event occur.\u0022 Emmany\u0027s eyes widened. \u0022Waht even\u0027t wouldya be talkin\u0027 aboot?\u0022 At this point, she noticed Jeb. Jeb held his finger agaist his mouth. \u0022shhh.\u0022 He whispered. Jeb started to go find a phone, then he saw a gun pointed at Emmany. He clearly had to act fast. He ran right up to the two criminals and punched them right in the face. The gun flew out of the kidnapper\u0027s hand, and Jeb got into a brawl with the two criminals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Emmany found that one of her hands was free. Carefully untying her arms and legs, she grabbed the gun. \u0022Stop rieght noew! Ah dunnae kne whit in Kraken\u0027s Blazes is happenin\u0027, but it staps noo!\u0022 The criminals stopped, as Jeb bashed their heads into eachother. Emmany pointed the gun at Jeb. \u0022Noo yoo\u0027d best be gettin\u0027 it ay haur!\u0022 Jeb Left the unconscious bodies and ran away. Emmany tied the two criminals against a chair, and called the police.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe headlines for the next day day read \u0022Mysterious Hero captures insane criminals!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow between you and me, Emmany did see the man who helped rescue her, again. But Jeb had become clean shaven, and less dirty, and he wore different clothes than he did in those depressed days. Jeb had to go through therapy and forgot that day completely. The two kerbals are both Astronauts now, but neither have any idea that they\u0027d met eachother years before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETomoly and the Tragic Failroad\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWIP\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESynopsis: A Kerbal finds a horribly run-down railroad yard and tries to save it from becoming a junkyard.
