A few questions for you, although some are more about adding experience traits in general:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I add a new trait and DO NOT have KerbalStats I assume will \u0022regenerate\u0022 professions for Kerbals in an existing save. So if a user installs my mod with a new trait and KerbalStats at the \u003Cstrong\u003Esame time\u003C/strong\u003E, professions will be reshuffled. If they install KerbalStats first, start KSP and save, \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E install my mod, things will be happy. Can you think of a better way, or will I just need to have \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EBIG RED TEXT\u003C/span\u003E warning users about this?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDo you plan to have KerbalStats do anything with the professions of the starting 3 when starting a new game. Specifically, I\u0027m concerned that adding a new profession would change what \u0022the 3\u0022 start with - although I haven\u0027t yet tested this - maybe Squad has magic to handle this already.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027d like the profession that I\u0027m adding to not come up automatically for new recruits (it\u0027ll be assigned in a different way, through code). Any chance you\u0027d have something in KerbalStats\u0027s profession module to prevent a specific profession from being assigned automatically to a new Kerbal? Or will I end up needing to code this one myself?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T10:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m pretty certain adding both mods at the same time will randomize the professions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe big three (four when 1.0 comes out) are hard-coded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA little tricky, but probably doable.
