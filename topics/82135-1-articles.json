Long ago when the first men walked on the moon, and it is taking us more than 50 years to return. The first men walked into space, and all we can do is go to LEO. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an outrage. Those who walked on the moon, and those who saw them, are dying. They are a dying group, they have aged 50 years or more since we last set foot, on our closest celestial neighbor. It has been to long, since the promises of those who hoped and believed, they to would see men living on the moon, and exploring Mars, and Jupiter, and even Saturn. Never did they believe, that after 50 years, we still would be nowhere closer to the ultimate goal. To those who chose to \u0022play it safe\u0022 I am truly sorry. Because those who can\u0027t expand, those who aren\u0027t afraid to take risks, those who are willing to face the consequences, and reap the reward, they are the ones who will claim space and the planets and stars for themselves. Not those who sit behind their desks and wait for someone else to do it. It took 10 years after the birth of the space age, before we landed on the moon. We were focused, we were ready, we were willing. But since then, we feel that what little crumbs of knowledge, and the bragging rights as the first are good enough. But its not. Who will remember a people who had a new land in the palm of their hands, and they threw it out of reach, who will remember those who had taken the first step to finding the answer, to learning more for their nation, for their world, but gave it all away. Who remembers the man who lit the first fire, but put it out because he feared it. This is the direction the world is going. Space is there, waiting ready for anyone who is willing to brave its challenges. It is finally time to set aside these petty borders, these imaginary lines that \u0022protect\u0022 men from themselves. Its time to focus on a new age, of exploration, of expansion, and of hope. An age without war, but peace, and cooperation. Only when we realize that the borders do not exist, that the flags we make, the evil we fight, is only within our heads. Only when the Earth is truly threatened will we understand why we must expand out. Why we must explore, why we must survive, and challenge.
