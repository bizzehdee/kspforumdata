Alternatively, add more/better scientists. Can\u0027t explain why your research rate is so apparently low though.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T14:40:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, you get more science per day the more data you stuff in it - when you get close to the 500 data limit, you\u0027ll maximise the rate of return.\n\nI didn\u0027t realize this when I first started using the Mobile processing lab, and was also wondering why the rate of return was so low.

Kerbal scientists don\u0027t seem to mind that their program manager puts them in competition with each other, studying the same samples and reports over and over. Who knows what they might come up with? \nData is data, whether new or old. A lab remembers what it has studied and won\u0027t accept the same thing twice. But you can run as many labs as you have Kerbal scientists to staff them - and patience to put up with all of that running around ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThe easiest local job is Mimimus. Low gravity makes it easier to hop around biomes / regions, farming for science. Kebin science data has a poor multiplier, it\u0027s just there to get you started."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T23:19:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A Lab landed on Eve will generate more science then one in orbit around Kerbin, yes. A lab landed on Kerbin will generate science at a 90% penalty rate, so I\u0027m told.\n\nAlmost completely wrong. True: there\u0027s a 25% bonus if the lab is in the same situation\u0026biome as the data it\u0027s processing. That is, science from *in space low around the Mun* will yield 25% more data if the lab is currently in space low around the Mun. There\u0027s also a smaller bonus for being landed while processing. If you are anywhere else, you will get the standard amount. There\u0027s no bonus to processing science from the Mun on Eve. However, there is a huge malus if you are on the surface of Kerbin.\n\nBut all of these only affect *processing*, that is, feeding data into the lab. The rate at which the data is then converted into science is not, *rpt not* affected by location."}]}
