Unreasonable payloads use the 80MN charges. Large cities and small continents use the 400MN charges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see retaining the tiny cap-gun 0.88MN charges. It\u0027s occasionally handy to have a low thrust option. I could have used some in setting up my Jool aerobrake, where the 3.5MN charges were giving me about 6 m/s change, and I wanted to make some 1 or 2 m/s changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that 2MN and 3.5MN are close enough that for gameplay purposes, they\u0027re interchangeable. Not sure it\u0027s value added to retain both, and unless the 2MN charges have an extreme efficiency advantage, I\u0027ll always pick the 3.5\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 10MN charge may loft small payloads (though why you\u0027d use Orion to launch a satellite I\u0027m not sure), or be useful for low-impulse in-system maneuvers. Though again, from a gameplay perspective, unless they\u0027re much more efficient I\u0027m likely to select a denser \u0027fuel\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 20MN charges seem good for launching reasonable payloads from Kerbin, they make the \u0022throttle setting\u0022 meaningful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 80MN charges would loft a large payload, or be the major \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv contributors to an interplanetary crossing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 400MN charges exemplify a core KSP principle. Namely, \u0022Moar explodey!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind, the Orion basically needs a \u0022rough\u0022, \u0022normal\u0022 and \u0022fine tune\u0022 charge, scaled to the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a reasonable to reasonable-large scale mission within the Kerbal system, I would probably load one layer of 20MN for ascent, one layer of 80MN for accel to and decel at the target, a few 2MN for little nudges and a few 0.88MN for really fine corrections. Fill in the rest with charges appropriate to the mission objectives, but my guess would be mostly 20\u0027s and 80\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Jool mission packed mostly 3.5\u0027s, and I expended the majority of those accelerating to Jool intercept, and then correcting my terrible orbital inclination after the flyby. More 20\u0027s and 80\u0027s would have been welcome (I had a couple multiple-minute burns at full throttle on the 3.5\u0027s).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-08T18:54:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2013 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T19:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis does bring up the question of fuel density. The mass of the devices is scaled as realistically as possible for each charge (barring the 20\u0027s, which I just guessed at). However, there are the same number of devices in the 2MN magazine as the 80MN and 400MN magazines. Making their fuel density much different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel mass is critically important to mission design and engine/fuel selection. But volume is also important. The way things are balanced right now, as a mission planner I\u0027d want to use the 400MN charges whenever possible, just so I could send the most \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv with the mission. Not only are the 400MN charges more than 4x as efficient by mass (the 2MN get 25,316 kn/t whereas the 400MN get 108,695 kn/t), they\u0027re also 200x as efficient in volume. (you can fit 24,000MN of 400\u0027s in one standard size magazine, or 120MN of 2\u0027s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that in reality, much of the device\u0027s mass is casing, wiring, conventional explosives, safety, and other inert stuff, and only a small fraction of its mass is blutonium.

It takes just over 13 of the 400MN charges (I used 14 for 5,600 MN total). More loss to atmospheric drag, and the 14th charge didn\u0027t give me a nice pretty circle.
