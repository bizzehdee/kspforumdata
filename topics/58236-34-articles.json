With the engine config file so that my engine masses, etc. were fixed now with the 3.75 m tanks I was testing with it was possible to make a NERVA get higher delta-v than a chemical rocket. But it would still take a somewhat ridiculous number of tanks because the full mass/dry mass ratio for the tanks (type=Cryogenic) was only about 7:1. So I went into the tank .cfg files for Real Fuels and changed one of the big KW tanks over to type=BalloonCryo. This gives a full mass/dry mass closer to 80. With a tank like this it is now possible to build a nuclear rocket stage using the NovaPunch 2.5 m NERVA which is quite comparable to the projected real world NERVA stage. The stage as a whole (engine \u002B tanks) has a full mass/dry mass ratio of about 10 and will give a 100 tonne payload a delta-v of about 3500 m/s. This takes 21 tanks (!). This may seem like a lot but as far as I can tell from my reading it is fairly consistent with a real world NERVA which would have carried about 150 tonnes of liquid H2, would have been over 10 m in diameter and over 40 m long. A chemical rocket stage of the same gross mass gives this payload only 2500 m/s. To get the same delta-v with chemical takes about 20% more mass, although it results in a stage of much lower volume (only 6 tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you are using real fuels without stretchy tanks and you care about building nuclear rockets then you should go into the config files and give yourself a BalloonCryo tank. Of course you should probably just use stretchy tanks and I wish I could get it to go with the other mods I\u0027m using without hitting memory issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dirt_Merchant","CreatedById":69465,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T18:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent catch on the RCS FX plugin fix.
