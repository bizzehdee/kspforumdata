Some experiments can only be done at certain altitudes, others at all altitudes. Certain experiments can be repeated in each biome, others are global. Some experiments combine all of these traits and are biome-dependant in specific situations, global in other situations, and not available at all in yet other situations. I expect that you are simply missing a good chunk of science because you don\u0027t yet know all the possible situations in which to trigger experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo help with learning this, I recommend the ScienceAlert addon. It sits in your toolbar and notifies you with sound and animation whenever there is an experiment available that you have not yet collected for this situation. You can then click the icon and choose the experiment to be taken without having to hunt down the part on your craft (great for things stored in bays). Obviously this doesn\u0027t work if the experiment is occupied (an untransmitted report sitting in your thermometer for instance), so make sure you either transmit, or EVA with a kerbal to remove the data, or simply bring several copies of the experiment so you can perform it in different situations. Also be aware of the slight inconsistency with how the stock game handles EVA reports: a Kerbal on a ladder of a landed vehicle is considered flying. Which sometimes causes ScienceAlert to display that you have an EVA report to take on a landed vehicle, but when you go on EVA, the notification disappears (because until you let go of the ladder you are no longer considered landed, and you already took the inflight report earlier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, maybe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130202-What-are-some-good-strategies-to-most-quickly-get-through-the-grindy-part-of-career-mode?p=2110403\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2110403\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis writeup I did a few days ago\u003C/a\u003E might help you out, even though it was meant for a slightly different purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo improve the ability of your rocket to pitch before unlocking the AV-R8 winglet - that depends on what you want to achieve. If you are unable to keep your rocket from flipping, mount 4 basic fins at the very bottom of your rocket. If you are unable to steer because the rocket goes straight forward and doesn\u0027t want to turn, you need to accelerate less violently (thrust limit SRBs during building, or throttle down liquid engines in flight).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T11:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoboZoom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoboZoom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, on another note... what\u0027s the best way to get pitch authority with a rocket in the early game?
