I was able to get the Big Pig into orbit around Minmus, and have docked a Kethane refinery to it. A Kethane miner transports 8,000 units of Kethane up to the Big Pig.

Will it ever actually get anywhere? Should I thrust-limit the Skippers and let them help dance this mess around, or stick with just the LV-N\u0027s?

While the calculations show that thrust-limiting the Skippers on the bottom stack to 2.5% would be ideal, the lower limit on thrust-limiting Skippers seems to be 5.5%.
