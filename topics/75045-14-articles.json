But is not a prof that the ITER is a waste of money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the cost of safety in a nuclear reactor. I already give a lot of numbers that proff that Wind\u002Bstorage can be in the same range than nuclear (without extra shield), so if your solution is make them expensive, I dont see the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that shield and sabatoage measures (also not perfect), just help to sleep better. But even if you are able to stop an fighter airplane, it does not mean that you can stop a bunker busted missile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly one of this missiles and you put France on their knees. Of course I dont think that this would happen never. Nobody would risk to do this (today) for retaliation which may trigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the fact that there are not safe, remains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPD: in all this discussion I congratulate you for the great way to sell the CANDU reactors, I am not sure if even the salesman can do it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peadar1987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022peadar1987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell if we\u0027re to stop global warming, then we kind of have to just leave them in the ground.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not a real way of seeing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll fossils fuels had an increasing cost to day, just becouse they had a constant demand with a limit amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if that demand decrease (more electric cars, less fossil plants, etc) but you still had the resources, then the cost decrease.

You need some huge pieces of equipment to actually recover that energy, because it\u0027s quite high-entropy, low-temperature stuff.\u003Cp\u003EYou really need a gas turbine as your topping cycle to get high enough temperatures to do anything useful.

But you can almost upgrade all thermal plants (or a least the ones with would last more) to capture co2, or add them some cogeneration process (you dont need an turbine for this, just a heat exchanger)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately, this won\u0027t actually increase the efficiency of the cycle, it merely has the potential to reduce the cost of the heat exchangers by improving their efficiency.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not complete true, heat exchangers does not have always the maximun work rate.

Not doing it was an absolutely shocking oversight. However, recovering more heat from thermal power plants isn\u0027t as simple as just adding more cycles to the end of the process. Each cycle you need a larger and larger turbine as the density of the working fluid goes down, for diminishing energy returns. You can mitigate this a little by using different working fluids in the bottoming cycles, but there is a limit. The maximum efficiency you can really get with a bottoming cycle is about 20-25% unfortunately.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want distilled water, you use sea water in a open cycle (instead close), why you need an extra turbine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want heat homes with your remaning high entropy heat, why you need an extra turbine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003EMODERATORS: If someone break the rules, please penalize only that person please.
