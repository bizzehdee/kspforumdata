If the centre of pressure is behind centre of gravity, the object is dynamically stable and will right itself after being deflected from a straight path through air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractically this means: Yes, you need to put vertical stabilizer to the rear or the craft, typically as far rear as you can to achieve best results. If you need more yaw control force, then you might want to use two vertical stabilizers, each with their own rudder. That will stabilize the craft in relation to yaw axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame principle applies to pitch stability and, to some extent, roll stability. Roll stability is achieved by putting the wings above the centre of gravity with means of dihedral angle or simple wing placement such as in Cessnas and many other general aviation designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, pitch and yaw stability are far more important in my opinion than roll stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-12T05:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat causes the snapback on pitch control?

You\u0027re using control forces to deflect the ship from the position it wants to be at in relation to airflow. When you release the control forces, it starts to swing back, and it enters a harmonic oscillation around the balance position unless you prevent that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why analog controller \u0026gt; digital controller in atmospheric flight. And in flight general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet a joystick or gamepad, then when you use elevators or rudder, gradually let it move to centre position which prevents the craft from entering a pilot-induced oscillation (which is what happens when you try to correct the \u0027snapback\u0027, but you overdo it, and it swings back to another direction). This is easiest to prevent with analog controller, and smooooth hands with control inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
