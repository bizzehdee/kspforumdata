The windows version downloaded on that computer in less than an hour and a half. That is, of course, no use to me as it isn\u0027t worth playing on that computer in the first place. Instead I devised a plan to download the OSX version on that computer, then transfer it with a USB to the iMac. Turns out when downloading the OSX version I had all the same problems as before.
