Ohh, ive also added a new option to lower recoil for a weapon (say if someone made a recoilless rilfe they could use this) so my new cinematic weapons do not actually induce recoil and they fire really slow so you get those long drawn out broadside ship on ship shootouts. Ill upload some pics of it in action once i effin finish it. As much as i wanted to, im having major issues with adding more teams to the game, id like to have 4-8 teams optional, but for now i guess itll have to be 2 teams, with their own team colored tracers that change as you change team, and a few other fixes like rebalancing weapons (god those lasers are OP, now they are more in line with what i envisioned them to be good at, very accurate, but short range and lowish DPM compared to any other cannons), as well as the addition of the new option that allows you to lower the recoil of a particular weapon by a percentage in its .cfg file (useful for recoilless or energy weapons or whatnot) as an option (defaults to 100% recoil as stock mod if unspecified).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and there are also slightly different hit effects that im still working on, which will change based on what you hit. hitting the ground will have something similar to right now, hitting a vehicle/ship will give some sparks in teh color of the round that hit it (im still having issues with teh colors atm), so if you get hit by a blue tracer itll have a blue parky effect, and it has a different effect for recoil as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, im making the team tracers optional (menu button) since the way it looks is im guessing not for everyone.

Since the vulcans have a looping audio clip, its false so it starts playing when you start firing, and stops when you stop firing, instead of playing the clip on every bullet fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuzzle flash isn\u0027t tied to an animation, so the fixed vulcan doesn\u0027t need a fire animation.
