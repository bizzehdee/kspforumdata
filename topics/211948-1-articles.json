Since i did have a crew pod along with the spacecraft that was to be deployed in said orbit, i\u0027m now in the undesireable situation of having 3 Kerbals stuck aboard a crew pod in that same orbit. I know i made a huge mistake (but realized it too late). The mistake being the fact, that i\u0027ve forgotten to add any engines to the crew pod mentioned earlier that would\u0027ve enabled me to de-orbit that pod.\u00A0 So i\u0027ve found myself with a crew pod that i\u0027m not able to get back to kerbin.\u00A0 Any recovery craft i\u0027ve built so far have faile by either flawed structural integrity or by simply falling short of the desired orbit and encounter point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any kind of solution to this problem, that would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: the capsule in question is just a capsule with an inflatable heat shield (which is deployed). Also, the orbit it is in (just like the spacecraft that was to be deployed) is elyptical with its apoapsis further away from Kerbin than the periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/TjEFbrc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s an image of the Orbit the pod is stuck on\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(yes, the 2nd orbit is the one, my recovery crew recently got stuck on)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-10T15:20:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2023 03:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Raiku_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProviding additional information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-09T16:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we\u0027ve all found ourselves in a situation like this.\u00A0 Either no engines or no fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you can do, if you have the ability to go on an EVA, is use the Get Out And Push procedure.\u00A0 Have a kerbal go on EVA, and use their jetpack to push the capsule retrograde until you get your PE under 70km.\u00A0 EVA propellant is effectively infinite, as it is refilled when you get in the pod.\u00A0 Just don\u0027t let the kerbal run out while you\u0027re out there!\u00A0 I usually push until the kerbal is down to one unit left (out of 5, IIRC), then get in the pod and back out again to refill the jetpack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything under 70km will eventually bring you back down, but the lower you get it, the faster you\u0027ll deorbit.\u00A0 Pushing will be most effective at your AP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-09T16:12:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224229881\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211948\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221675958240\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225430\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raiku_\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Raiku_ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny recovery craft i\u0027ve built so far have faile by either flawed structural integrity or by simply falling short of the desired orbit and encounter point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need to know how to rendezvous two craft in orbit, here\u0027s a very helpful guide on that topic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2995758276\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/189763-illustrated-guide-to-docking/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-09T17:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums -
