MechJeb seems to be horribly confused by fairings. I\u0027m constantly flying around with the system telling me my current stage\u0027s delta-V is zero, usually because the next stage contains fairings. Autostaging just stops when it gets to them, too, although that may be intentional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it just says my delta-V is zero when there are no fairings, though. Again, nothing to do with KW -- happens pretty often with rockets with no KW parts as well. Not sure what causes it -- I\u0027ve had identical probes both have working delta-V displays or not, depending on the launch vehicle (which has now been left behind, so why the now identical probes have zero delta-V in one case and not the other is unclear but apparently related to their history and not their now identical current configurations). I suspect it might have something to do with the \u0022root part\u0022, which changes sometimes depending on how I launch particular probes. MechJeb was completely flummoxed by my Jool MapSat package (sending half a dozen probes on one vehicle), and even after separating so they were now perfectly indepedent, single-brained bog-standard space probes, MechJeb could not autostage when the lower stage ran out of fuel, and displayed delta-V of zero for every stage and as the total. But it seems to randomly bug out on perfectly normal things, too, from time to time, so I dunno...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-10T08:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2013 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dweller_Benthos","CreatedById":15418,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T12:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Innuce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Innuce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo simple fix.

I\u0027ve attempted numerous landings and get the same results: I get to about 700m off the surface, all is going well, everything is lined up and on target, then I get a burst of power from the engines and the craft starts rotating left, right and finally in complete circles with sporadic engine bursts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s strange this happens on Pol as I\u0027ve just been landing on Bop fine, with the same craft, as well as other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple of other bugs I\u0027ve noticed are that sometimes MechJeb time warps past planned maneouvers (usually when warping at the fastest speed), sometimes MechJeb burns past the end of a maneouver (I wonder if this is due to the \u0027smooth throttle\u0027 option not cutting out quick enough on bigger engines), and sometimes the burn starts too late - instead of half the burn before the node and half after it does say 90% after (this i think is to do with staging and MechJeb thinking there\u0027s more engines active than there really is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using v2.08 and the latest KSP (2.20).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, I love the plugin.
