This tool will temporarily release the block established by valve and allows you to download games through the steam console again. It\u0027s a fairly simple procedure by changing a value in your RAM of the running steam instance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWindows will warn you to execute this program since it is not singed and therefore not trustworthy for windows. I\u0027m not going to tell you to run this tool as well, you have to decide on your own if it is worth the risk. Since the source code for the tool is hosted on github as well, you can take a look at, if you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you decide not to run it, I\u0027ve wasted you time and there is nothing else I can do for you, sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you decide to run it anyway, we can continue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, you have to launch steam if it isn\u0027t running already. Then run the SteamManifestPatcher. It will open a CMD promot which shows you the changed value and if the operation was successful.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow we have to open the steam console: open a run prompt in windows (press win \u002B R) and type in \u0022steam://open/console\u0022 (without the \u0022\u0022), press enter and steam will open it\u0027s console.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the input field of the console, type:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003Edownload_depot AppID DepotID MenifestID\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(of course you have to put in the IDs you\u0027ve noted before)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: If you want to download version 0.90.0 for windows, this command would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\ndownload_depot 220200 220201 1535792782041218707\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything was done correctly, you\u0027ll see the a red text in your console which is basically just what you\u0027ve typed in, and below\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\ndownloading depot 220201 (xxx MB)...\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0027ll not see any progress bar for the download and steam will not notify you when it\u0027s done but you can see the network activity in the download section of steam. This kind of download is usually very slow, so don\u0027t expect to load at max speed, more like 300kb/s.
