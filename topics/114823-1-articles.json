After Cooper leaves the station, he makes his way towards the wormhole, he enters it, and loses a landing leg. He shrugs it off and continues towards Gargantua. He has flashbacks of the many events in the system, which distracts him, and makes him freak out. It\u0027s been 4-8 months at this point, and his life support decreases. TARS suggests that he cuts down on his rations, but Cooper insists. After a close pass of Gargantua to get ramped up to Pantagruel. He doesn\u0027t know that due to the lack of shielding on the Ranger, he was exposed to cancerous amounts of radiation. At about Mann\u0027s orbit, TARS finds out that Cooper has cancer, but he doesn\u0027t tell Cooper for unknown reasons. As he nears Pantagruel, the cancer starts to affect him drastically. The radiation from the star makes the cancer even worse, and due to low life support, Cooper nears death. 5 years after leaving the station, and closing in on Edmund\u0027s (now Brand\u0027s), Cooper dies due to cancer. TARS lands at Brand\u0027s habitat, and wakes her up. After an emotional reunion, and TARS telling her about Cooper, Brand becomes depressed and kills herself. TARS and CASE now manage the colony, and 20 years later, a colony of 300 people start setting up humanity\u0027s new home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think? I made this up on the spot, so it\u0027s not the BEST, but I think it would make a great sequel should anyone do one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T01:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou expect a movie that shoehorned a possible romantic relationship between two people who showed zero romantic interest in each other to kill them before them even getting together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. It\u0027s more likely that Coop and Brand would fight genetically engineered dinosaurs while riding transforming robots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T01:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the point.

A small dialog change would have made the movie less stupid. Change the idea of people as batteries to people as neural networks used for their computing power. Throw in a line about the (wrong) notion that we only use 10% of our brains being true, because the computers are stealing the other 90% for their own use. Done.
