I\u0027m just not sure you\u0027d necessarily save any delta v by doing it. As far as I can see, most of the delta-v cost of reaching Tylo is actually going to be due to slowing down enough to avoid being flung out of its sphere of influence. By passing close over Jool, you can exploit the Oberth effect to lower that speed faster so you only leave Jool with enough energy to get to Tylo and not to fly out of Jool\u0027s sphere of influence altogether (this came up in the previous video).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could, as I understand it from other mission reports, also theoretically save delta-v altogether by performing an aerocapture in Jool\u0027s atmosphere, although that\u0027s a bit less predictable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
