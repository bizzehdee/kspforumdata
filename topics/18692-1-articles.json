I have a few questions and comments. As many of you are extremely educated and focused in the field of spacecraft and how this game models them and are also adept at coding and modifying code that has already written, I turn to you for advice. I currently use MechJeb and it helps me considerably. I also have NovaPunch\u0027s mod as well (frikkin sweet) and I am attempting to use the PowerTech, RemoteTech, Zoxygen, EPS, and Kethane mods. i congratulate all the men (women?) that have taken the time to write, model, and share these mods. I am having a bit of trouble with the satellite network relay system from The_Duck. I have launched a few satellites into orbit and they are stable and in my tracking center. When I attempt to use the remote capsule I always get an \u0022Out of Contact\u0022 on the relay message. When I check the pathway on the map there is no connection to KSC even with serveral satellites in view and oriented properly. I am attempting to use the Powertech Communications Satellite with the auto orient and auto solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre powertech and remotetech not compatible? Do I need to add a different antenna or dish? Do I need to edit a .cfg file to do this? If I need to edit a .cfg please let me know detailed instructions because I am not as adept as some people with coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf more information is needed to determine where I am messing up let me know and I will attempt to deliver the necessary intel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks folks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaGinger\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just my first issue, there will be more to follow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cant wait for .17!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T20:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi DaGinger, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be best to ask in the respective threads, in case others have had the same issue, or even search those threads for your problem to see if it has come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think the two mods may be interfering, try removing Powertech and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaGinger","CreatedById":44408,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T22:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought about that but the \u0022How To\u0022 section I figured would be my best bet.
