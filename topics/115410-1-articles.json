That makes them part of game-play.\n\nIt\u0027s in the same screen as the values which tells my why my frame-rate sucks, ruining my game-play experience.\n\nThey don\u0027t seem to be being used even when the frame-rate is struggling to get to 30 fps.\n\nMakes me think along these lines... \u0027odd those figures never seem to change. Even when the game is struggling to keep a reasonable FPS - no change. That\u0027s odd. I\u0027ll ask about them in the forum. Maybe they should be changing and the devs might want to know; that on my system, they are not.\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"jaredkzr","CreatedById":73023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T09:07:18Z","Content":"What are your specs? It\u0027s usually a cpu\u0027s single thread performance that is bottlenecking KSP. Memory is usually a non-issue unless you\u0027re heavily into modding on the 32-bit program.\n\nEdit: Went and ran my own test with a 200 part ship. With my own pc (See sig for specs), I consistently achieved around 40fps and had a heap size of 0 MB. This shows that fps and heap size are not connected in any meaningful way. Performance issues will likely stem from another source, most likely that being the cpu.\n\n![ZvRBmT7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZvRBmT7.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T09:20:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jaredkzr**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:03:14Z","Content":"Those values are meaningless. You have proved nothing other than the values on your system are also at zero.\n\nMine was a large space-plane on it\u0027s way to orbit so I suspect that it isn\u0027t just the number of parts.\n\nI have an I7 processor so it\u0027s unlikely a processor power problem. Witcher 3, Everything on full. No problem.\n\nWe KNOW KSP has problems. We KNOW it has memory leaks. Mine still crashes when 16 gigs are full.\n\nIt isn\u0027t even about my Low Frame Rate; as I said, we KNOW KSP has problems in that area.\n\nI noticed it again when checking the performance values in the debug window and so I though I should bring it up. As I have already explained in my previous post.\n\nI merely wanted to broach the subject of these values NEVER changing. Have you seen them change in ANY situation?\n\nWe didn\u0027t write this software. We don\u0027t know if these values are even still connected to anything. They could be surplus to requirements.\n\nBut if they are still connected and are supposed to change then maybe the devs should be aware.\n\nIs my post, my reason for posting, the thought processes behind the posting clear enough now?"}]}
