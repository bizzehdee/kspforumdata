It\u0027s usually a cpu\u0027s single thread performance that is bottlenecking KSP. Memory is usually a non-issue unless you\u0027re heavily into modding on the 32-bit program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Went and ran my own test with a 200 part ship. With my own pc (See sig for specs), I consistently achieved around 40fps and had a heap size of 0 MB. This shows that fps and heap size are not connected in any meaningful way. Performance issues will likely stem from another source, most likely that being the cpu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZvRBmT7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZvRBmT7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T09:20:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jaredkzr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose values are meaningless.
