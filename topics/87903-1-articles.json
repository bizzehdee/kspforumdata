The space program should have name and the launches should be associated to some space program to keep a statistic of this program for a may be future building called the space flight museum. The complexity of the space program should be limited by current prestige cost of a program and start with simple ones and rise during the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts should be assigned to a particular space program and Should be more complex like build a two stage booster capable of sub-orbital flight with dummy payload reenter. Could present a multiple objectives which requires a multiple launches. Example for rocket lifter project\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: research and test 1st stage engine on ground \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: research and test 2nd stage engine on ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: research and test decupler and both engines in flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED: research a nose cone and test reentry with dummy payload of 10 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: take some useful payload to the orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo undertake a contract you must pay a certain amount of prestige, to limit the numbers of programs you can participate in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch system will be tweaked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need a prestige to unlock a space project. Each vertical of the research tree will have project which will utilize the parts from that vertical (not necessary all parts). You can advance to the next vertical after you finish successfully the previous project. This adds the complexity as you advance thru the tree becouse more parts are present at each next vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the admin building you will pay a research team which will spent a fix amount of research point per hour to finally research each single part you select from the tree (maybe a research queu will be good idea). Each research team will cost you and amount of money per hour and you can speed up the research rate by pay more teams in the admin building if you have a money or you can use today\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s existing commitments from admin building to tweak the research cost and speed. Fulfilling the contract/project steps objectives will earn you the resources for continue in the research and in the program. Finishing the program will give you extra prestige and resources to research all the remaining parts in the tree vertical which was not needed directly for the space program objectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally this approach can be a beggining for a scenario based play according to a real US or USSR early space programs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you think would you like to play according to this rules ? Would there be any moder to challenge this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
