Random dump of advice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo get some background. Any decent classical mechanics book should have a chapter on gyroscopes. Read that. If you don\u0027t know how precisely we think they should operate, you can\u0027t tell what observed behavior is anomalous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can, find out about why it is believed that momentum is conserved. K^2 is correct in that it is a direct consequence of the translation invariance of the laws of physics. However, the proof is not without context. It assumes the Lagrangian framework of theoretical mechanics can be applied. If it can\u0027t (*), then translation invariance may hold without conservation of momentum. Every theorem has prerequisites, and those are your potential loopholes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of building a complete propulsion system from nothing, try finding anomalous behavior in the individual isolated components first. The combustion engine was not built prior to understanding combustion, electric motors were only built after people developed a solid understanding for (electro)magnets. I\u0027d start by trying to replicate Eric Laithwaite experiments on the lack of centrifugal force. The basic one (as seen on the TV lecture) has been falsified, but in his patent application, he writes about gyros with fat rims giving better results. I haven\u0027t seen those repeated yet, though I have to admit I haven\u0027t really looked much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to understand our objections. If your device rattles and jumps around, people will say it is propelled by friction, and they probably will be right. If you put it in a box to prove it\u0027s not propelled by making wind and have it produce lift, people will say it is a hot air balloon. Simple solution there: Turn it around and make it pull down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen developing new ideas, think a bit about how the effect you expect would influence known systems. The whole Earth in its orbit (for big masses). Electrons in an atom (for high rotation rates). Those work as we expect them to, so if your idea says they should do something different, it\u0027s probably wrong and you should look elsewhere first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor proving that it\u0027s not friction against the ground that drives your device, your own suggestion is probably the best: put it on a floor that is itself mobile. You only need to make sure there is less friction between that second floor and the real floor than between your device and the second floor. If you use an air table or rail, you have the problem that any tilt will produce thrust via uneven airflow. The pendulum test can only give good results if the device does not shake too much, and you need to be able to reliably track the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*) and boy would we be in trouble then.

And I have to admit I thought we just assumed reactionless propulsion was impossible because every form of propulsion known to man requires it, so absence of evidence would apparently be evidence of absence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for building theories, it\u0027s really not my fort\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9. If you look back a few pages I did post a theory of my own, but I\u0027ll admit it\u0027s amateur hour. It basically states that it\u0027s an \u0022over-reaction drive\u0022. The resistance the gyros provide on their way back to their starting position will be interpreted as increased weight, meaning that as the wagon and gyroscopes move towards one another, the wagon will move further than it did as they were moving away from one another because the gyroscopes now are \u0022heavier\u0022 (or at least provide more resistance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Would we be in trouble if this was the case, with quantum mechanics and all? If it somehow exploits a \u0022bug\u0022 in physics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the whole idea behind the M Drive is the have the gyros precess forward as forcably as possible (high rotational speeds on both the gyros and the modified drill that precesses them), then force them back with even more force (decreasing the rotational speed of the drill and have the springs pull them back), working against the gyros as much as possible, hopefully shifting the center of gravity. That\u0027s the whole idea behind the M Drive really. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s enough to call even a theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there\u0027s a problem with making my machine move vertically, instead of horizontally, that being that the center of gravity always fluctuates. If I were to hang it on a pulley with a counterweight everything would shake violently (going up and down), not to mention the gyros would have problems precessing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You just proved your pseudoscientific prowess.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas merely pointing out that we can\u0027t know how much we yet do not know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-20T14:43:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2014 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by M Drive\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T15:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat you see can\u0027t easily be explained away by known science.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the video you say it can\u0027t be explained by \u003Cem\u003Eyour current understanding\u003C/em\u003E of science, and you have admitted you don\u0027t know much about science.
