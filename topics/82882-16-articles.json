Not sure if anyone other than Wave has bothered, but I\u0027ve played the career mode start to finish, max tech tree, then a Grand Tour of the planets. Did the same with the original KSPI, and I\u0027ll say the new version is a HUGE improvement. Original was a lag monster as soon as the ships got complex enough to be fun, and full of bugs (Reactors shutting off for no reason, microwave power super glitchy, various useless parts, crazy upgrade system, etc). Also a ton of options that were made quickly obsolete by the next tech tree node. There are a few balance issues in Lite, and a few bugs Wave hasn\u0027t gotten to yet, but that\u0027s what the github bug report is for. I for one am more than grateful for the hard work Wave has put in, basically for free, to make my favorite mod playable again.

I did judge this mod a little (or a lot) unfairly and hastily, if not before playing it at all then at least before really thinking about all the changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still don\u0027t really agree with the fission buffs and the particle bed/molten salt thrust/ISP tradeoffs, and the removal of KTEC generators, charged particles, tritium breeding, and water tanks really cramps my style a lot. That said, though, the fusion/antimatter rebalance makes a lot more sense than I originally gave it credit for since the Kerbol system is so small compared to real life, and all of the bug fixes and new features really do improve the game a lot. I look forward to everything WaveFunction says is going to get added/re-added, too, and in the meantime, I imagine that most of my main issues could be fixed with a config edit or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks, WaveFunction!
