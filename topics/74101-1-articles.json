This is basically going to be a story-free version of my piece of writing called \u0022Mission to Duna - Saving the Hope\u0022, with all the proper mission-report stuff in it. That means that the journey of the \u0022rescue ship\u0022 in the story will be documented here as if it was a regular mission. The same pictures will be used. Here\u0027s the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81988-Mission-to-Duna-Rescue-the-Hope\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emain story\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Real Background of the Story\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the \u0022story\u0022 of the Hope WAS intended to be an AAR on it\u0027s own. HOWEVER - when it entered Duna\u0027s SOI, the Kraken attacked it. For the sake of the story, the plot was modified and a second ship hurriedly built in orbit by me. It\u0027s waiting in orbit now actually, waiting for when I decide to start the story for real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdates will come every week (hopefully... exams are coming up...)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
