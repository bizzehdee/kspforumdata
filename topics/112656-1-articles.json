I tried disabling crossfeed, turning off rcs, sas, doing little burns, rotating ships, switching to other ships and back. The only thing that worked was decoupling the tank which the docking port is attached to causing the ships to separate, then unblocking the docking port. But I can\u0027t land the ship with this missing tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cstrong\u003Escreenshot\u003C/strong\u003E attached\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cstrong\u003E.craft file or save files\u003C/strong\u003E (save folder attached [default.zip])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EATTACHMENTS LINK:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zvfzow2dlz0eax7/AAAzHdv3qB1C73zcaM8Y5Jo9a?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/zvfzow2dlz0eax7/AAAzHdv3qB1C73zcaM8Y5Jo9a?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
