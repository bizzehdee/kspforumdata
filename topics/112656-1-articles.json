I tried disabling crossfeed, turning off rcs, sas, doing little burns, rotating ships, switching to other ships and back. The only thing that worked was decoupling the tank which the docking port is attached to causing the ships to separate, then unblocking the docking port. But I can\u0027t land the ship with this missing tank. \n\nA **screenshot** attached\n\nA **.craft file or save files** (save folder attached [default.zip])\n\n**ATTACHMENTS LINK:** [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zvfzow2dlz0eax7/AAAzHdv3qB1C73zcaM8Y5Jo9a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zvfzow2dlz0eax7/AAAzHdv3qB1C73zcaM8Y5Jo9a?dl=0)"}]}
