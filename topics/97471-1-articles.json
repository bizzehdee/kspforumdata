Is this related to the unity engine this game uses? Or is this seperate from the issue KSP has with a single core maximizing and slowing down the game? I\u0027m surprised they haven\u0027t tried to add hock a small way to alleviate the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gettig so tired of building my plane to even moderate practical specs and having my one core hit 100% and the game freezing up while I move and build.. Even a slight spreading out of the game over my cpu would massively increase performance. I rely on jets and higher air intakes volumes for my ship designs require large numbers of air intake along with solar panels for my Ion engine clusters(50,100,150 total engines,etc). My smallest version uses a 66 Ion engine setup for long term travel using an attempted 1:1 0 gravity thrust to weight ratio for making the ion efficient for the longer interplanetary burns. I would be nice to be able to do this more reasonably! 8) Unfortunately, I like MK2 over MK1 and I don\u0027t want to downgrade. 8(\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T20:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T21:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know much, but I think that Unity doesn\u0027t have problems with multithreading.

Some more modern games that support the hardware acceleration are the Batman: Arkham series and the Borderlands series, these games have settings for enabling PhysX hardware acceleration and can only be enabled on Nvidia GPU\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_with_hardware-accelerated_PhysX_support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea list\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T22:40:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
