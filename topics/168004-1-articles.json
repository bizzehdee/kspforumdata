I also removed a little bit of mass here and there, used smaller parts where I could, and lightened the load as much as I could while still being reasonably comfortable to a six-kerbal crew. Aside from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, I have DMagic\u0027s EVA Struts in use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I just cheat this monster into orbit, I get slightly more than 3500 m/s according to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s estimate. Enough for Duna and back. If I launch it as intended, the first module containing the Mk1 crew cabin and engines will have in excess of 7200 m/s. But then I start piling on modules, and the estimated delta-v doesn\u0027t seem to change once it\u0027s fully assembled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one of these out at Duna in a career play-through that has slightly less than half of its fuel, and has landed the rover package on Duna\u0027s surface. Yet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E thinks I still have 3700 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, the Iktomi II, in Duna orbit, has 257 parts, 56.57 tonnes, and 1866 / 4800 Liquid Fuel. This is the ship that already dropped off its rover kit. Supposedly I have over 3700 m/s. Assuming one unit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E = 5 kg, that\u0027s 9.330 t fuel, making dry mass 47.34 t and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = 1397 m/s. Enough to get home, barely, if I\u0027m careful with Ike and Mun assists, or I could dump a lot of hardware first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the Defrahnz, in Kerbin orbit, is prepared for departure to Eve. This has 306 parts, 75.92 tonnes, and is fully fueled at 4800 / 4800 Liquid Fuel. Supposedly I have just over 7400 m/s, but in reality with 24 t fuel I have only 2980 m/s. At least this craft could reach Gilly and land on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E alone, and refuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E not taking into account the added mass of modules as I assemble this thing?
