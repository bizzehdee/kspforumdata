I was shocked and angered at how badly the physics worked. If you have to make up the rules of gravity in a game, I thought, you\u0027re doing it wrong; considering that gravity is a simple inverse square attraction law. (And also the Moon is in a totally different place from the planet)\n\nI don\u0027t recommend Space Agency. If you want a Mobile KSP, SimpleRockets would be far better.\n\nThen, today, while looking for an image, I stumbled upon this article. This person was attempting to modeling the way more internally confusing model of orbital motion found in Space Agency.\n\n[http://www.wired.com/2013/05/how-do-you-model-orbital-motion-in-a-game/](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/how-do-you-model-orbital-motion-in-a-game/)\n\nSo that was a bit cool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T21:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T22:16:14Z","Content":"Yeah I hate those physics, but it is a fun game. I love all of the RL rocket parts and ships, and the ability to dock/translate/manage air/electricity/fuel and stuff.\n\nIf you want full realism, try Space Simulator for iOS.\n\nIt is like Orbiter on your iPad. You get a full solar system, and Apollo\u002Bthe space shuttle. It is moddable so they will add addons too very soon, and then you can fly ships to Titan."}]}
