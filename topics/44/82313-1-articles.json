It takes about 30 minutes of bus to go from the central station to the airport, I have to be there roughly 1h before the gate closes, then it takes roughly 1h to land in Paris, half an hour to get out of the airport, half an hour to go to the center.

For shorter trips, the train is way faster than the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue with train is capital cost: it\u0027s absurdly expensive to build tracks. So you need to have a lot of travelers (or care about CO2 emissions, I\u0027m looking at you USA) for it to make sense. That\u0027s why high-speed trains are only found between large and close cities, and it\u0027s only where these high-speed lines are getting saturated that we will see faster trains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, the Tokaido Shinkansen (TOkyo-Osaka line) transported 83 million passengers, which gives an average of 9400 passengers an hour, or a little more than 11 A380 per hour (assuming everybody in economy). The train in these conditions is not only cheaper and faster, but more flexible (a train every 5 or 6 minutes at rush hour). And it\u0027s not a surprise Japan is investing a lot in Maglev and wants to build a maglev line between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly when Maglev lines start to get saturated will we see serious interest in vactrains.
