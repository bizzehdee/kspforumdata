In fact, the Copernican model was no more accurate for predicting the positions of celestial bodies than the Ptolomaic model was. Observations that started to shatter geocentrism were the observation of all the phases of Venus by Galileo, which didn\u0027t fit into the Ptolomaic model (though Tycho Brahe\u0027s geocentric model accounted for them.) But the real killers were Kepler\u0027s laws of motion, which gave far more accurate predictions than either the Copernican model or any of the geocentric models, because they accounted for eccentricity. Kepler, for instance, was able to accurately predict a transit of Venus, which had never been done before.
