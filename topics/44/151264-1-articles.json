We seem to advance the most in our knowledge of new technology, the we feel it is at our advantage. The space race, Soviet Russia, \u0026amp; The United States, one of the greatest times of knowledge and advancement of technology. The Russians were so determined, as were the Americans. They both each changed the world. Going to space has brought us great things, such as artificial limbs, and MRIs. It happened to fast and so quickly! But now here we are, in 2016, you would think that we would have gotten much further than where we are now. Sure we \u0022had\u0022 the space shuttle program, and we have rovers on mars. But the money that was funding all this exploration and learning is very slim right now. The United States Government currently funds NASA with barely 1% of their government currency. They \u0022retired\u0022 they shuttles, we no longer have money to go to the moon, or send our own astronauts\u00A0to the ISS by our rockets here in the US. We have our allies in Russia to thank for helping us maintain our joint operation on the ISS. Sure we have the no SLS Orion... but if you ask me, all this is just laziness to me. I hope more private companies like SPACEX help us with this, as well as Russia. Because the united states government has given up on science. If we continue our research of microgravity in space, we have a whole new playing field to understand the things and nature that we work with, and live in. I just don\u0027t know how, or where we are headed currently. Another issue is the cost for rocket fuel. Getting to space is no easy task at all! We should be using the funds we have left here in the US to find a new way to get us into space. Im talking about thinking out of the box in a massive scale. Im sure many people have talked about this and ways of doing it. But frankely money is the main issue. And I just don\u0027t want to see the only advancement in technology to be in phones and cars. I hope to put an end to this, I want to learn and find a way to get us back into space like we used to, but better. My goal in life is to change the way we think about space and we get there. Im open to any comments and suggestions, to what you guys know/think about this contraversal subject. Thank You.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T12:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA noble goal :-) Make it so !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that data, technology and in a way moral is missing to judge whether it\u0027s feasible/possible to make the visions real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat comes to my mind is that your overlook spanned only the last 2-3 generations, for us westerners relatively peaceful.

We already live in the best place we\u0027re ever going to find in terms of gravity, atmospheric composition, atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation, and on and on. The only thing that\u0027s kind of difficult here is getting to orbit. For a colony to\u00A0grow to self-sufficiency, it\u0027s going to have to match Earth in enough of those essentials and offer enough advantages that a lot of people are motivated to\u00A0choose to go there and stay there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s part of the reason why I\u0027ve started to conclude that to really live in space, we\u0027ll need\u00A0O\u0027Neill cylinders with complete\u00A0functioning\u00A0biospheres powered by solar or nuclear.\u00A0If we can make it to that point, then suddenly there\u0027s both a workforce and a market for mining asteroids and manufacturing in space. The residents of the cylinders will want materials to make replacement parts, consumer goods,\u00A0habitat expansions, etc., and they\u0027ll be well positioned to acquire them, so they\u0027ll have a natural incentive to expand humanity\u0027s space footprint exponentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut until then, until there\u0027s a vital human force\u00A0sustaining and\u00A0driving the development out of pure self-interest, any other human spaceflight is trying to force it prematurely, in a way. Yes, NASA could be super-funded to embark on the century-long project of building a sustainable Mars colony, but what if the funding gets cut a few presidential administrations down the line? Not only would the project itself be halted, but now someone has to decide whether to mount a rescue mission, and we\u0027ve got nothing to show for it.\u00A0If we were already at the point where space activity as such was profitable, it\u00A0wouldn\u0027t be as\u00A0big of a deal, because other sponsors would want the colony for more reliable reasons. But when NASA/ESA\u00A0is the only game in town, it may be for the best that they focus on\u00A0laying the groundwork by sending robots to look at Ceres and discover that Mars is covered in perchlorates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T14:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, while I do find space travel fascinating... humanities future looks sketchy, and we need to solve other things before solving problems of low cost access to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* sustainable CO2 neutral energy production\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* halting population growth\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* protecting the remaining ecosystems\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* implementing economic systems that disrupt the current system with a feeback loop that exhibits bistability: a fancy way to describe a system where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, right up to the breaking point and the poor can get no poorer (ie they can\u0027t survive at any lower wages)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Solving basic fundamental social issues that promote anti-intellectualism and turning away from science in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts pretty hard to think about colonizing mars given the political power of a group of people who think the world is less than 10k years old, or that global warming is a hoax.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T14:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222870699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151264\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480602606\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Solving basic fundamental social issues that promote anti-intellectualism and turning away from science in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would argue that manned spaceflight is one way of countering that.
