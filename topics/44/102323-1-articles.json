Usually they maintained quadripedal stance, but they switched to bipedalism when they needed speed - in case of predator attack for example. Bipedalism is taxing to a body, but it is efficient mode of locomotion. Take a look at us, humans - we are well suited for long distance running at steady pace. Only few other species (some dogs for example) can keep up with us. Some african natives still hunt this way - they pursue their prey relentlessly for hours, to complete exhaustion until it can\u0027t move anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:40:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It has two *strong hands*.\n\nAnd cuticles to die for..."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:57:15Z","Content":"Yeah, doesn\u0027t look like a habitual biped, more like capable of bipedal locomotion."}]}
