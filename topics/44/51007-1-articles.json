First off, I\u0027d think a group of students launching a satellite\u0027s cool as hell. But, their project has a pretty admirable goal.

Yes, our ability to collect data has grown exponentially with digital imaging and computer image processing, but being able to see a historical record to use as comparison\u0027s pretty important.
