What kind of research paper would have to come out, and who should publish it, to make you reconsider your stance? To come to the conclusion that maybe those sources you mention that debunk the EMdrive were in fact wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not asking this because I\u0027m a fervent fanboy of the EMdrive. In fact I have doubts that it\u0027ll ever amount to anything beyond a laboratory novelty... but then again, I am not a physicist. I now preciously little about all these things thrown around as possible explanations for why the test article produces thrust. It is not my place to decide whether it works or not; trained scientists are going to do that. The only thing I\u0027m completely convinced about is that the phenomenon of this thing will be completely unraveled sooner or later, the thrust signature and the mechanics behind it fully explained. At that point, we will know whether it was a dud that relies on interaction with the test stand environment, or whther it actually turns out to be a reactionless drive. Either way, I will be fine with the result (though admittedly, having a reactionless drive would be the more exciting outcome).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the way this kind of thing should be approached. The scientific method asks us to be critical thinkers, and that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. But it also asks us to be open for any new idea, no matter how outlandish, as long as we can prove it to be valid. We cannot arbitrarily discard an idea just because it is unlikely, or doesn\u0027t align with our own preferred worldview. As long as there is work left to do, the jury is still out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T11:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere;s not much to pick an choose from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chinese paper\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA \u0022nasa\u0022 study that wasn\u0027t done in a vacuum, where one of their controls failed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA german study where their only control failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyawn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T13:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuys, the guy making the drive is going to launch a few cube sats with a few prototype engines to test the thing.
