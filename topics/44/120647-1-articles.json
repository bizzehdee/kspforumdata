A star that formed because of a suppernova of a carbon/iron rich star might have stronger magnetic feild than a generation 1 star. I think the major issue is field strength and proximity. If the field strength id high and proximity is close then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat seems more strange to me is why close binaries form in the first place, but then drak matter may be part of the problem. As dust and hydrogen aggregate drag should orbitally degrade velocity and proximal densities should collapse around a point mass, leaving trivial amounts of mass to form the planets. It is plausible that the magnetic core prexisted the star nucleation event, and nucleation occurs as a magnetic process. The PROBLEM is that turbulation in a star should destroy most solid masses, so if magnetism is humongous then maybe solid cores persist throughout the whole process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how many times a new star has been built on a neutron star?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
