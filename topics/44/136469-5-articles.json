Until today, no tall buildings are break-even on the topic of energy consumption vs generation. Electricity is the main problem. My main POV is solar panels, because wind turbines is just too massive of mass and too small of production to even justify large buildings. Houses can be built spread enough that making the roof out of PV or even using a solar water heater and bottles of water through the roof for lighting would cause it to break even, at least on the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo understand my point, we need to take a look to the\u00A0simultaneity coefficient;\u00A0demand, storage and prediction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn a single house, your consumption time of goods or services can not be well predicted on moment and amount. If you want to generate your own electricity to fulfill all your needs, then you need to take into account that most of your consumption may be at late hours, then take into account all the time that you are on vacation or\u00A0in your house with extra friends, that force you to overstate your power and storage needs. You need to buy an inverter, a charge regulator, solar panels all retail, which increase the cost of the product and installation cost.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen you need to make the same calculation for all the other goods and services you can share, but in the community case, no all the people is on vacation or with friends or using a service at the same time, you have an average consumption and\u00A0storage needs, so if you add\u00A0internet, water, some common tools or products that everyone may need, etc.. \u00A0You save a lot of money.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that is not the end, ecologic designs at big scale are cheaper, a building has even benefic in air circulation or temperature management, I can talk all day on benefits vs single houses.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso each building does not need to generate its own energy, as you mention on building area for solar panels.. \u00A0You can have few, but always big scale generation is more efficient than small scale (in case\u00A0you dont have huge losses on\u00A0distribution and distances), but that only counts for really\u00A0big distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
