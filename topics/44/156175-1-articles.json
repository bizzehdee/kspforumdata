Three seconds is plenty to weigh something that comes to a rest almost instantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the product cannot come to rest quickly enough to be weighed, then perhaps an impact sensor can be used. If the product is always dropped onto the sensor from the same height and position (as it exits the conveyor), then you can calculate the mass of the product from the impact force the sensor reports. This assumes the product is not ultra-fragile (can survive being dropped from a few centimeters without any deformation or other damage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that help?
