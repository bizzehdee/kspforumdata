Nothing smells.\u0022 - contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station that Jerry Linenger relates in his book about his time on the facility. Linenger says that due to the age of the space station, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe cooling system on board had developed a plethora of tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired\u003C/strong\u003E, that permitted the constant release of coolant, making it unpleasant to breathe the air on board. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the clean air he had been breathing in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside Mir, he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air.[37]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-10T23:14:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2013 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T23:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nexustrimean\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nexustrimean\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no immediate danger to the astronauts, in fact this same area has had amonia leaks before. it was repaired in 2010.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich was years after the leak developed and they rerouted around the leak, if I remember correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T23:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, let\u0027s hope that SpaceX can send a dragonload of coolant and spare parts up asap. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, Antares has yet to try sending actual payload to space- they only tested their Cygnus mass simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T23:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, let\u0027s hope that SpaceX can send a dragonload of coolant and spare parts up asap. \u003Cp\u003EIf not, Antares has yet to try sending actual payload to space- they only tested their Cygnus mass simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does it have to be SpaceX?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erkha343","CreatedById":1957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T23:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, let\u0027s hope that SpaceX can send a dragonload of coolant and spare parts up asap. \u003Cp\u003EIf not, Antares has yet to try sending actual payload to space- they only tested their Cygnus mass simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace X is not working with NASA right now you know, if anything they would send it in a Soyuz.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T00:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy does it have to be SpaceX?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment only Souyuz and SpaceX Dragon are able to service the ISS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Antares did have a successful flight, I haven\u0027t heard anything since then- their craft might not be able to reach the ISS yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-11T00:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2013 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OdinYggd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T00:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OdinYggd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt the moment only \u003Cstrong\u003ESouyez \u003C/strong\u003Eand SpaceX Dragon are able to service the ISS. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point.
