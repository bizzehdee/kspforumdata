Someone may have mentioned this already, but boosting to a higher orbit before then boosting to a retrograde orbit could actually be cheaper. Consider this little thought experiment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-V to put yourself on an escape trajectory is about 41% of what\u0027s required to fall into the sun. So let\u0027s say you put yourself on an almost escape trajectory. So close to an escape trajectory that by the time you reach apoapsis, the delta-V to go retrograde is negligible (a few m/s). Then all that\u0027s left to do is to fall back to periapsis and recircularize (which costs another ~41%). So in total, you could put yourself in a retrograde orbit for about 82% of the delta-V cost of actually completely nulling out your motion and falling into the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this cost is limited by how long you\u0027re willing to wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you work out the math for this transfer you can find that the total delta-V cost of this maneuver as a fraction of the \u0022twice the fall into the sun\u0022 delta-V, you get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV = 2 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV\u003Csub\u003ESUN\u003C/sub\u003E * ( sqrt(2 * (R\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B R\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E) / R\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E) - 1 )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere R\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E is the periapsis radius (the original circular orbit radius) and R\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E is the apoapsis radius (how high you place your apoapsis in the transfer).

Someone mentioned an Eve assist, which I am not sure about because it is so deep inside Kerbol\u0027s gravity well (maybe a gravity assist ninja can try it out and see what kind of gains we\u0027re looking at) but I have no doubt it can be done very much more efficiently than just burning twice your orbital velocity backwards.
