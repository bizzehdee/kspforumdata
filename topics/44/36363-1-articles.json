End of the day the easiest way is to use omnidirectional on these things, but this needs fairly high power levels even for LOW data rates. (some systems the low gain telemetry system is using comparable power to the high gain system, even though the data rates are worlds apart) The last possible solution is phased array antenna on one side, which should make 180 degrees of view possible in theory.
