Seeing as this community includes modders and people with more than just a minor interest in such things, I tried to get photos of lots of the small details that you can\u0027t find easily except on the real thing. Unfortunately I arrived too late in the day to get the bus tour so no good pics of the VAB or any Saturn V \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mnw5W\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Walked through a shuttle mock-up (I wasn\u0027t impressed, wanted to see the real deal, but no way). We were also out to the launch complex/pads, LC-39. I can tell you a 1-day visit isn\u0027t nearly enough time.
