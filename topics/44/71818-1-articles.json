Your power budget will likely depend on ability to keep solar panels aimed at the sun, when the sun is available. Magnetic attitude control systems need to know how your orbit will interact with the Earth\u0027s magnetic field.

It turns out that if you toss a small lump of aluminum, fiberglass and copper into Low Earth Orbit, without much in the way of active thermal management, it tends to stay within -40 to 120F, where electronics mostly keep working. A typical cell phone will probably continue to function in space (except for the display) as long as you strap on a heater to the battery and some solar cells.
