Same with lateral balance - You will need to load very symetrically and wont be able to tolerate much imbalance. In a passenger setting this means few to no movement can be tolerated in flight. There is also the issue of vertical accelerations experienced during roll manuevers by passengers on the outer extremes of the cabin. As they are so far out from the center of rotation, it will be quite the nauseating and uncomfortable ride - made worse by the lack of outside references - every turn will be a barf fest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a tail also mean that the wing will not be able to take full advantage of the high lift devices typically used in most commercial aircraft for takeoff and landing - which means that its runway requirements, comparaed to an aircraft of similar performance, at anywhere near comparable weights, will be extraordinary (in a bad way).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
