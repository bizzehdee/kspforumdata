And you would only drop out of warp once you were nearby another star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means you would have to already have your momentum heading for the place you want to end up. Otherwise you would end flying at warp forever until your vessel runs out of power and is stuck in interstellar space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInertia drift would matter for a ballistic course,\u00A0depending on how efficient and how much thrust sublight engines provide, and how fast FTL is. One LY per hour is good, but dealing with hours of inertial drift after dropping out of warp is either solved with high thrust/high efficiency sublight engines OR using the translocation drive to get much closer to the planet of choice without acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it was an interesting concept as it brought back the danger of spaceflight in a setting that was very much space opera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nearly adapted it for my own work, setting mass lock distances (where ship can drop out of hyperdrive) at whatever the raduis of the destination celestial body times light seconds max or less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for our sun, you could drop out of warp about 4 light seconds away, which would still make it uncomfortably bright. From there it would take 15 min to spool up the drive to warp again, and then you could do a drop near earth. Since earth\u0027s diameter is much less than a light second, you could drop in one earth radius away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet I didnt use it since I wanted to justify scifi ship designs where acceleration pulls you back toward\u00A0the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that I needed ships that would NOT have to use constant acceleration to reach their destination. It is only a matter of 15 min between every jump. Weightlessness is not so bad for such a short time period. Thrust only really would be needed for space rendezvous\u00A0or landing on planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, you really\u00A0should have decks on a ship like\u00A0an office building if you have to rely on\u00A0constant acceleration to get close enough to your destination to try landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-15T20:33:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2019 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-15T22:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is partially why Battletech has such a good jump system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can technically jump anywhere in space but gravity causes issues.
