This means that the exhaust velocity is higher when the jet aircraft goes faster, to an extent.\n\nOn the ground, relative air speed is not hundreds (or thousands) of kilometers per hour, it\u0027s much less."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:59:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Jet engines are so efficient because they use the air, which already has velocity, to oxidize the fuel.

On an jet turbine the hot air is exhaust, yes you use it to produce steam but its not an perfect process.\n\nIf weight is more important than fuel use you don\u0027t have the second steam stage, this is used for mobile or emergency/ standby turbines. \n\nNice to have on an cold day or then an major plants are down."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T22:59:43Z","Content":"Yeah I also imagine that, but still.. you get drag with the air... maybe at that speed the airflow becomes turbulent so it does not add so much drag.. but I guess the efficiency is measure on work \u0022distance achieve with X amout of fuel\u0022 not sure, I dont remember.\n\nThe only thing that I know, is that for low speeds airplanes, the most efficient is a fuel cell, and at higher speeds, a jet engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T23:57:16Z","Content":"If you really want to know how jet engines work, check out a channel called [AgentJayZ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh57rwk3ySElDpzgCDLh9KA) on Youtube.
