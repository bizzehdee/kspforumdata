An airship colony, filled with normal, breathable atmosphere, would naturally float high in Venus\u0027s clouds right at the point where atmospheric pressure is 1.0 atmosphere. With this setup, there\u0027s no need to design a vessel that can withstand a withering 90 atmospheres of pressure, or even the engineering challenge of preventing the inside air from venting out (as you must do in normal spaceflight in a vacuum). And at that altitude, temperatures on Venus are a balmy 32 degrees Celsius. The main problem, of course, is preventing the sulfuric acid from eating straight through your colony.\n\nOf course, it was the Russians who came up with this idea. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![o-CLOUD-CITY-VENUS-facebook.jpg](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2314054/images/o-CLOUD-CITY-VENUS-facebook.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:30:31Z","Content":"Speaking of airships, [check this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104177-Nasa-is-considering-a-Manned-Mission-to-Venus-before-Mars%21) for its proposal video."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T02:31:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you think we can ever land on the second planet from the sun\n\nSure.\n\n Landing is the easy part. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:41:06Z","Content":"Venus is very hot and the pressure is 90 times that at sea level on Earth\n\n![llxny.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/llxny.jpg)\n\nIf we freeze it out then the pressure drops.\n\nOnly problem is this:\n\n![llxvf.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/llxvf.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:52:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If we freeze it out then the pressure drops.\n\u003E \n\u003E Only problem is this:\n\nWell, most of the heat is due to the greenhouse effect from the atmosphere, not proximity to the sun."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:57:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, most of the heat is due to the greenhouse effect from the atmosphere, not proximity to the sun.\n\nAyup.
