It\u0027s indeed a good blog post and I recommend everyone who\u0027s interested in spaceflight to read it. But I wasn\u0027t terribly convinced by the \u0022multi planet colonies = life insurance\u0022 argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe article correctly ascertains that we don\u0027t really have to worry about asteroid strikes, gamma ray bursts or supernovae etc. The timescales are just too damn long. The main reason we need life insurance for our species is due to our own actions. Nuclear war, genetically modified diseases, runaway climate change and unforeseen impacts of new technology. But the article never properly explains why we need to go to Mars to protect our species from this. Obviously Mars would be better than the Earth from a safety standpoint, 225 million km is a nice safety distance. But building a few well insulated pockets of humanity deep underground would be orders of magnitude cheaper and be almost as good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s kinda like buying insurance for your house. For 1k/year you can get fire insurance or for 100k/year you can have fire\u002Basteroid\u002Btsunami insurance. The latter is obviously better from a safety standpoint, but can you justify spending that much money for only marginal safety gains? Obviously we need some kind of insurance, but should we really go with the luxury package?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX is aiming to bring down the cost of fire\u002Basteroid\u002Btsunami insurance, which is really cool. But I\u0027ll have to see it before I\u0027ll believe it. Sure, you can cut some costs via vertical integration and reusability. And I have no doubt that ULA and other launch companies are overcharging. But I have a hard time seeing costs drop by a factor 100. The fundamental physics of spaceflight just don\u0027t add up to cheap orbital access. You\u0027re always going to lose some parts of your rocket and you will always need a whole boatload of reaction mass. You can\u0027t bend the laws of physics by tossing enough technobabble at them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, the article has the same problem as the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAI post on WBW\u003C/a\u003E: it is hopelessly optimistic. Both in spaceflight and AI development things look very promising if you only look at the big picture, but once you get down in the nitty gritty you run into a myriad of big problems. The problems aren\u0027t necessarily insurmountable, but they\u0027ll take time. A lot of time. So his timeline is at least twice as fast as mine. Manned Mars flights in 2030? Rather unlikely, but I reckon we have a good chance at seeing one around 2040.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T11:23:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T12:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat blog gave me this site:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait until the day we see that number goes to 2 digits regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T12:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally TL:DR;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially as it\u0027s mostly (longwindedly written) stuff that we\u0027ve already discussed at length on these forums.

Besides, who knows how long you could be trapped underground from whatever calamity forced you there in the first place. On Mars, nothing short of the Earth exploding into fragments that reached Mars and force them underground could keep them from being able to continue to expand into space if they wanted.

There are a wide variety of known extinction level events that could happen too quickly for a majority of the vaults to be useful. Gamma Ray Burst being one, and currently an extinction level asteroid strike. We still quite suck at detecting asteroids these days, particularly if they are approaching from the southern hemisphere in any appreciable way. In the last 15 years there have been something like 20 asteroid strikes in the kiloton\u002B range on Earth that the only reason we know they happened is because of the system in place for detecting nuclear tests.

Gamma Ray Burst being one, and currently an extinction level asteroid strike.

In the last 15 years there have been something like 20 asteroid strikes in the kiloton\u002B range on Earth that the only reason we know they happened is because of the system in place for detecting nuclear tests.
