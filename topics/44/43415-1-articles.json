I didn\u0027t mean to imply it was a trial run for a manned mission, but a test of accent technology and orbital docking On a body other then the earth or our moon. I just am not so excited with a manned mission to an astroid , even though the ion powered part is awasome, as humans will not escape the earth moon system.
