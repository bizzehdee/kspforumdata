The test launch window is June 2-12. Weather - wind in particular - isn\u0027t looking great for June 2, and if it won\u0027t change (although forecasts suggest it will) there is a second two-week launch window starting from something like July 7 if I recall correctly. Last year, LDSD took off on the first opportunity of the second window, but this shouldn\u0027t be the case this year.\n\n**Why?**\n\nThe LDSD features two breakthrough technologies: a supersonic inflatable aerodynamic donut-shaped decelerator (or airbrake), or SIAD, and the Supersonic Disksail Parachute, which has more than double the area of the Curiosity rover\u0027s parachute. These devices potentially will help us deliver double the current amount of payload \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 1.5 metric tons \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC to the surface of Mars. They also will greatly increase the accessible surface area we can explore, and will improve landing accuracy from a margin of approximately 6.5 miles to a little more than 1 mile.\n\nTechnically, the SIAD is already flight-qualified to fly in Mars\u0027 surface. However, the 2020 rover probably won\u0027t use it because NASA has already designed an EDL without it (although things could change), but the mission after that, the one that will collect the 2020 rover\u0027s samples and bring them back to Earth, will probably feature the SIAD.\n\n**How?**\n\nAt launch time, a giant balloon will carry the test vehicle to an altitude of 120,000 feet (37,000 meters). After release from the balloon, a solid rocket motor Star 48 will lift the disk-shaped vehicle to 180,000 feet (55,000 meters), during which it will accelerate to supersonic speeds. Traveling at about Mach 3, the vehicle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inner-tube-shaped decelerator, called a supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator, will inflate and slow the vehicle. Then, at Mach 2.35, its parachute will inflate and gently carry the vehicle to the ocean\u0027s surface.\n\nIn last year\u0027s test flight, SIAD worked flawlessly, whilst the supersonic parachute was torn apart shortly after deployment. Nevertheless, as you can see in the photos, the vehicle did manage to land without any problem.\n\n**Pretty pictures:**\n\nThe LDSD being recovered after last year\u0027s flight.\n\n![2-ldsd_sfdt1_recovery-0404.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2-ldsd_sfdt1_recovery-0404.jpg)\n\n![10-ldsd_sfdt1_recovery-0515.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/10-ldsd_sfdt1_recovery-0515.jpg)\n\n![LDSD-TV_Star-48.jpeg](http://blogs.nasa.gov/ldsd/wp-content/uploads/sites/248/2015/05/LDSD-TV_Star-48.jpeg)\n\n![ldsd-test-diagram.jpg](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ldsd-test-diagram.jpg)\n\nAnd a spectacular video of last year\u0027s ride:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9yRWhu0UGYw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T10:55:23Z","Content":"Is I the only one who think of KSP 1.0 supersonic parachutes here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:02:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is I the only one who think of KSP 1.0 supersonic parachutes here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNo although the way the first one ripped up as soon as it was deployed reminded me of the way my chutes just destroy themselves on deployment in KSP at high speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T13:19:57Z","Content":"**Update**\n\nMission managers have postponed Tuesday\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s scheduled launch of a high-altitude balloon carrying NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) test vehicle because of unfavorable ocean conditions.
