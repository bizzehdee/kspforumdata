Waste means heat, and heat means a lower rate of fire. Basically to work a laser, you shine a light on it, any photons of the right frequency cause the gain medium to become energised, but it will eventually drop down to its ground state. A laser uses a \u0022resonance cavity\u0022 to trap photons going the right direction, while letting those going in other directions escape. The really nifty thing is that a photon going in the right direction can trigger the drop to the ground state, resulting in a photon with identical phase and energy to the photon that caused it (The \u0022stimulated emission\u0022 part of laSEr).
