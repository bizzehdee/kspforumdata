The enormous downmass capacity would also be useful for space mining and manufacturing.

At first stage MECO, the engine mounts detach from the tank, deploy an inflatable heat shield, and reenter, and lands on parachutes.\n\u003E \n\nI was responding to your statement that Energia could carry 100T to LEO. I responded that it could only do that when expendable, and with a upper stage, so it was cheating. It was not supposed to be reusable.\n\nAnd what you propose would basically be a reusable SLS with a hypergol upper stage. BTW, Hypergols are not cheap anymore due to enivronmental and handling costs. And any design that needs NTRs is a unrealistic dream. I know KSPers love NTR, but still...\n\nToday, you\u0027d just use a SLS w/o upper stage (IUS would be used for MEO, GEO, and planetary robotic missions, while Exploration Upper Stage is used for manned lunar and asteroid missions.) with 2x F-1C Dynetics-esque boosters. These would land vertically via smaller landing engines (which can also serve as booster verniers). The SSMEs would be reused Vulcan-style, with helicopter recovery, while the core would be expendable. Even then, since Dynetics \u002B SLS Block I could launch 120T to LEO, you would have a lot of payload capacity left over. So much, you might be able to just put a massive inflatable heat shield on the core, then return both the tanks and the engines via parafoil and horizontal landing on a runway. The deorbit burn would be done by disposable small solid motors. The boosters can\u0027t be reused like this since you would need jet engines to do so, and those would increase the complexity enormously.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The Shuttle Orbiter cost about 4% of the total program cost, so the post-landing costs hugely exceeded the cost of a single vehicle.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Note that for 60T to LEO, you\u0027d need 3 Shuttle launches, so that\u0027s 4.5 billion. A slightly spiffed Delta 4 Heavy would do that in 2 at 1/4 the price.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If FH costs are as claimed, it would take a single FH, plus a regular F9 launch, a ~29X savings. Even using the per launch figures for shuttle that ignore most of the actual costs, shuttle would still cost more. Any Shuttle V2 would need to be an order of magnitude cheaper to operate than the original to be even in the same ballpark.\n\u003E \n\nActually, FH is only capable of ~50T to LEO disposable, and the payload fairing is too small and the upper stage engine with too low of a TWR for sending 50T to LEO in practice. Realistically, you\u0027d need 2 FH-R for 60T to LEO.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 52 minutes ago, shynung said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, it does. I\u0027m wondering out loud what kind of design would suit that purpose well.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, even though I\u0027m using the word \u0027Shuttle\u0027, I\u0027m not implying a winged return vehicle. The thing doesn\u0027t have to come back in one giant vehicle. Stuff like fairings and fuel tanks can be thrown away - the returning parts are engines, crew cabins, the expensive stuff. Costs are down to maintaining the engines and manufacturing new tanks and fairings.\n\u003E \n\nActually, fuel tanks are about 45% of cost (excluding avionics). They are cheap in terms of mass-to cost ratio, but not in actual cost. However, disposing tanks are a good way of getting the most payload out of a RLV, while keeping costs down as much as possible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 minutes ago, Emperor of the Titan Squid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What if we pack the wings with fuel?
