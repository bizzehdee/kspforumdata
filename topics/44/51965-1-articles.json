After having discovered KSP from scott manley\u0027s channel this summer, i\u0027ve absolutely loved to play it. I am thinking of contributing to this awesome community with my ship designs, and perhaps opening a youtube channel dedicated to KSP playthroughs. But anyway, enough about me, lets go on to the topic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I noticed a couple of things after reading the wikipedia page on the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application) late 60\u0027s / early 70\u0027s NASA research project:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHoly guacamole, why arent these things in use today? they can realisticly reach 800-1100 seconds of specific impulse. I guess its because of the \u0022N word\u0022, but the risk seems limited seeing as these engines are wrapped in carbonfibre and heat resistant composites. Land based nuclear applications seem a lot more risky to me, considering earthquakes and tsunami\u0027s and all that (COUGHfukushimaCOUGH).\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal space program is mentioned in the \u0022in fiction and pop culture\u0022 section. Yay KSP!\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn comparisson to reality, the 60kN thrust of the LV-N atomic rocket motor in KSP is severely underpowered. I understand this from a game balance standpoint, but cant the game be balanced in a more realistic way? I mean, the last prototype NERVA engine produced 334 kN of thrust at 380 S isp (atmosphere) and with 850 S isp in vacuum. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust like in game, NERVA engines in real life also have issues with overheating. Contrary to the KSP mechanics however, the thrust and fuel efficiency of real NERVA engines increases with temperature with no theoretical limit. This makes it a careful balancing act of reaching high temperatures in the fuel expansion chamber, without causing the whole thing to melt or explode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how can the LV-N atomic rocket motor better resemble the real thing without being overpowered? Well, i thought of the following possibility:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMatch the thrust and isp of the engine with the NASA prototype (so 334 kN and 850 S isp).\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake the engine thrust drop to 150 kN at 380 S isp at sea level. This matches reality since rocket engines dont only lose isp, but also thrust inside atmospheres.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGive the LV-N an even stronger tendency for overheating, especially inside the atmosphere. It could for example only function at 50% thrust at kerbin sea level without exploding. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake the thrust of the LV-N rely on its level of overheating. So, at 0% overheating it produces no thrust. At 80% overheating it would produce 80% of its maximum thrust.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, this would make the stable thrust of the LV-N at sea level:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E150 kN * 50% * 80% = 60 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may seem a little complicated, but thats about how I understand these engines to work with real world physics. The whole change i described above would make LV-N\u0027s just as crappy at sea level as they are in KSP now. But it will give them progressively better thrust at higher altitudes just like the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. NERVA engines also dont use any liquid oxygen for thrust, since there are no chemical reactions involved. However, I dont know whether this is possible to balance in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. This could also give the opportunity to add a new module to KSP, the \u0022Cooling cycle\u0022 or \u0022Heat dissipator\u0022. This could dissipate a certain amount of heat from engines on your ship, allowing you to run them at higher thrusts without exploding. In order for these to be balanced, they should be progressively weaker as you slap more engines onto your ship. Furthermore, the module could be quite heavy or a strong electricity drain. Or it could require its own reserve of coolant (like liquid helium).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.P.S. I also read something obscure about a NASA project called LA-NTR. Im assuming this stands for \u0022Liquid oxygen Assisted Nuclear Thermal Rocket\u0022. They function the same as NERVA engines, but they have the possibility of injecting liquid Oxygen as a sort of \u0022afterburner\u0022 effect. This tripples thrust, but drasticly reduces fuel efficiency. This type of engine could be interesting in KSP aswell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm really curious as to what you guys think of these possibilities. Do they fit within KSP, and do they give us mad kerbal rocketeers some more awesomeness to play with?

NERVA engines were only ever intended by NASA to function as upper stages, firing only once in space. NASA also believed that if a launcher blows up, the engine would remain intact due to it being incredibly tough and heat resistant. They might have actually given the engines their own parashutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see though, how radiation shielding is a big issue. Its not like you can slap a bunch of layers of lead on there, because thats way too heavy.
