Adding velocity to you and changing your direction a little... but since it is moving away from you and your direction of travel is in approximately the same direction as it then you have a net gain of velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you cross in front of the object... you get pulled toward it and the direction of your travel changes a little to be more retro grade... thus reducing your velocity relative to the object the both of you are orbiting. Such as Kerbin. This could effectively slow down an object into a closed orbit... but it is highly likely to encounter the Mun again and more adjustments made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe asteroid in question is being acted upon by an outside force \u0022gravity\u0022 just as effectively as if you had strapped a rocket onto it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick and dirty image I whipped up to hopefully help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bLIxsVE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bLIxsVE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T02:49:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FITorion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T04:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like this has morphed into a discussion of gravity and orbital mechanics.
