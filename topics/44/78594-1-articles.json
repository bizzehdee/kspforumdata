The way Enigma was constructed meant that the same machine and the same \u0022code\u0022 (initial settings) could be used to code and decode. That is practical on the battlefield; you don\u0027t need to lug around separate machines for sending or receiving, or set them up differently for sending or receiving. It also meant though that a letter could never be encoded to itself (e.g. an \u0022a\u0022 could never be encoded as an \u0022a\u0022) and that turned out to be key in deciphering the messages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, Enigma was not as secure as the Germans thought although this posed a problem to the Allies: acting upon \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E information intercepted Enigma traffic revealed would signal to the Nazis that their communciation was compromised. The fact that the German forces never realized Enigma was broken shows that this was handled successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CleverWalrus","CreatedById":11812,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere i work (IT department of a pretty big worldwide insurance company) we use AES encryption for most of our stuff, recently the security office decided to move on from 256 bit keys since, eventually, they could be broken with enough \u0022effort\u0022 in a few years from now and to start using 1024 bit keys that should last for a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnigma \u0022today\u0022 is a joke, for 2 reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the key is too simple for avoiding a mere brute force attack to succeed;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the algorythm behind it is not \u0022matematically proven\u0022, i mean, if you know how it works it\u0027s very easy to break it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T20:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, the Brits were basically able to crack all Enigma communications (with the help of the knowledge of the Polish secret service) without capturing any devices. The name \u0022Enigma\u0022 was well chosen though; cracking the code meant figuring out many aspects: the encoding of each of the code wheels, which ones were used, and what their initial settings were.

Keeping the system secret isn\u0027t inherently awful for military purposes (for starters, if you have strong cryptography, it prevents your enemy from having that strong cryptography), but the entire security of a system should be provided by an easy-to-change key; the security of cryptography is worked out assuming that everything but the key is compromised. Indeed, modern strong codes generally publish the algorithm to the world, allowing anyone who wants to to try to find vulnerabilities. If someone finds a vulnerability and is public-minded, or wants to claim a bounty posted by someone who is public-minded, or wants fame as the one who broke that cryptosystem, then the flaw is announced and people move away from the system.
