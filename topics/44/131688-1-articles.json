I\u0027ve also noticed that some of their 757s have weird registrations that incorporate the fleet number of that plane. For example, ship 6704 is registered \u0022N6704Z\u0022 and ship 6717 is registered \u0022N67171\u0022. Some of their 737-800s follow a different registration format, with N as the prefix and then a four digit number that is the fleet number of that plane, followed by a random letter. For example ship 3741 is registered \u0022N3741S\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike Delta, American\u0027s planes\u00A0also follow the \u0022N \u002B 3 digit\u0022 format (with suffixes\u00A0AA, AN, or AC, etc..) with some exceptions. I\u0027ve noticed a MD-83 registered \u0022N474\u0022 with 474 being the specific fleet number of that jet. American\u0027s former A300s also followed an \u0022all-number\u0022 registration format composed of an \u0022N\u0022 followed by a five digit number. American\u0027s A319-115 aircraft also seem to follow an interesting fleet number format that varies in term of a general pattern. For example ship 001 is registered \u0022N8001N\u0022 and ship 003 is registered \u0022N93003\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSouthwest\u0027s planes mostly followed the \u0022N###WN or N###SW\u0022 format (where the #s stood for numbers), but this has changed recently. Apparently Southwest shifted their registration format to a format not unlike Delta\u0027s 737-800 format. New planes that come into the Southwest fleet are registered with \u0022N\u0022, plus a four digit number that is the fleet number, and a random letter. All Southwest 737-800s use this registration format, and certain 737-700s (new ones starting from the ones that came from AirTran) are registered this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrior to the United/Continental merger, all United planes followed the \u0022N###UA\u0022 format, where the #s are numbers. Continental, however, decided to use an all number registration format with N followed by a certain 5 digit number ( I think the last three digits make up the fleet number and the first two digits are random numbers). Haven\u0027t figured out why this happens. It might be that if Continental registered its planes like everybody else, their registrations would follow the \u0022N###CO\u0022 formats, where the \u0022CO\u0022 could be misinterpreted as \u0022C0\u0022, which would not make it a valid registration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour thoughts and opinions are welcome guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T17:03:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Delta_8930\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T23:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the US tail numbers are N-numbers, yes.
