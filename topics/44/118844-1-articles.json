But how likely is that actually to work out in the end? I\u0027ve always been a bit skeptical of the whole concept but I\u0027m not all that familiar with the details, so I\u0027m hoping somebody more knowledgeable can shed some light on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the economic parameters of the situation as I understand them. Please correct me if I\u0027m wrong:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SpaceX of course designs and builds its own rockets, as do its competitors. However, some of its competitors are using off-the-shelf components while SpaceX is all custom. So even without the landing system, SpaceX spends more on basic rocket design and production per rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In addition, SpaceX wants to reuse a few rockets repeatedly instead of continually building new ones. Therefore, it cannot use mass production and assembly lines to reduce unit production costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SpaceX has invested huge amounts in R\u0026amp;D for its booster landing system, an expense its competitors don\u0027t have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The mass of the landing system is such that SpaceX rockets need, IIRC, about 20% more dV than a disposable rocket to launch the same payload to the same orbit. This means that a new SpaceX rocket will cost at least 20% (and almost certaily somewhat more) than a comparable disposable rocket, without even considering the sunk cost of the landing system R\u0026amp;D and it being all custom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SpaceX also has higher operating costs per rocket. While its competitors just build and launch, SpaceX also (tries to) land and refurbish. So that\u0027s extra cost per launch in terms of parts and labor, plus transportation, administration, and other incidental expenses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you spread the R\u0026amp;D cost over the number of SpaceX rockets built, then a SpaceX rocket is ludicrously expensive compared to a disposable rocket, on top of being more expensive to design and build,\u0022over-engineered\u0022 for the payload it carries, and more expensive to operate per vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The only ways to reduce the per-rocket cost of SpaceX is for it either to build more rockets, or to reuse the few it has so many times that, over the long run, eventually its competitors will spend more bulding new rockets than SpaceX already has. The 1st isn\u0027t an option for SpaceX because it rather defeats the purpose of reusable rockets. The second is totally dependent on the volume of business SpaceX can generate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Nobody in the commercial rocket business does much volume because there isn\u0027t that much stuff going to space. SpaceX hopes to grow the civilian side of the space market by offering much cheaper rides (the \u0022if you build it, they will come\u0022 theory), but AFAIK there isn\u0027t a huge crowd of stuff already waiting impatiently on Earth for an affordable lift, so I doubt the existence of such will increase the market size significantly. On the government side, various laws and policies dictate a more-or-less equal share to outside contractors. Thus, SpaceX will probably always have essentially the same slice of the same pie it currently has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this paints a rather bleak picture. Because its rockets are unavoidably so expensive relative to the competition, SpaceX must be operating at a considerable loss per rocket, despite it claiming a net positive cash flow from contracts and recent investments by Google and Fidelity. IOW, it\u0027s highly leveraged and keeps delaying an IPO. There are also several elephants in the room:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Market Size\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs already mentioned, SpaceX necessarily depends very heavily on a high volume of business, much higher than currently exists. Will the market grow enough to sustatin it? Apart from communications and weather-related satellite companies, who on Earth really needs to go to space? Unless there\u0027s something with huge consumer demand on Earth than can only be produced in space, I just don\u0027t see the launching business growing just because getting to space suddenly becomes (relatively) cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Whether Refurbishing Will Really Work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course assumes boosters can be landed successfully, but I figure SpaceX will get that part eventually. However, the only previous example of a reusable space vehicle, the Shuttle, cost so much to refurbish, despite decades of striving for improvement and 136 launches to spread costs over, that it would have been cheaper just to use disposable rockets. This was, in fact, known up front but at the time the Shuttle came along, the only way to get Congressional funding for space at all was to sell the know-nothing politicians on the chimera of reusability. Whether SpaceX can do any better is possible but seems unlikely. Either way, at present the viability of the entire SpaceX concept is still a huge unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Possible Losses of Contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX tauts that it has contracts worth billions for many future launches, but surely these contracts, like all others, contain penalty and revocation clauses. A run of bad luck, or discovering that some engineering obstacles take more effort to overcome than anticipated, could well result in loss of business. Then what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at the bottom line, I don\u0027t see a rosy future for SpaceX\u0027s current business model. I figure that the most likely outcome is that SpaceX will eventually, like others before it, abandon the idea of reusable rockets as economically untenable and become just another rocket company. Junking the landing capability will allow bigger payloads and reduce the cost per rocket, but the money sunk chasing after reusability will never allow it to charge drastically lower prices than its competition, and probably not lower at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any reason to think otherwise?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T16:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood points.

Yes SpaceX is devoting a crapton of money and effort into their R\u0026amp;D on the rockets and that cost will end up eating into their profits. But remember, every rocket has gone through that to some extent or another, it\u0027s largely just a question of accounting to find out how it got balanced. ULA sort of cheats and tries to get the government to pay the R\u0026amp;D costs of everything it does, and then once the rocket is done they base their prices as though assuming they need to recoup the R\u0026amp;D costs. *eye rolls*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne test that could likely give a good idea about how well a refurbishment program would work, that I am not certain if SpaceX has done or not (I assume they\u0027ve done things that are \u0022close enough\u0022 for now) is basically rig up one of their rockets for the static fire tests and let it go through the motions of rocket use, fuel burnout, stage separation (which incidentally does not include explosive bolts, SpaceX uses some form of piston, hydraulic I believe), etc. Then try to refurbish it.

Fabrication of parts in the machine shop isn\u0027t what kills you, it\u0027s all the manual assembly time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts fab is highly amenable to automation, whether you\u0027re talking milling machines, hydraulic presses, composite panel fabricators, painting robots, etc. All these things need is a small staff of CNC programmers and otherwise minimal human intervention. And once you buy such a machine, you\u0027ve spent that money and won\u0027t spend much more on the machine ever again whether it runs or not. It\u0027s a fixture of your plant just like the building it sits in. So these machines make batches of the same parts so as to minimize set-up changes. This is a relatively fast process and usually runs well ahead of assembly. Because of this, you can get by with a few general-purpose machines that can make all your many different parts in batches synched with the order of need by assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all these parts have to be assembled into subassemblies and finished products, and this is not very suitable to automation. So people put all the parts in jigs, fasten them together, run the wiring and plumbling, etc. Certain aspects of this can be automated, at great expense, but the bulk of it will always remain manual. And therefore slow, much slower than parts fab. There are only 2 ways to speed up assembly: 1) overtime and/or running multiple shifts (which means a MUCH higher payroll expense) and 2) learning curves. But learning curves only have effect if the same people keep doing the same thing over and over without much gap in between. IOW, high-volume or mass production. If you have staff turnover, or a significant break in production, then you lose all or most of the progress you\u0027ve made towards reducing assembly time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the peacetime aerospace industry, the volume of product required in a given period of time is hardly enough to keep 1 shift busy. It\u0027s even worse in the rocket industry. Therefore, overtime and extra shifts are only used as emergency measures, trading budget for schedule to overcome previous delays, and then only in cases where the penalties for missing delivery dates are worse than the added manpower expense. After all, the extra staff of migrant workers brought in temporarily for a 2nd shift has no prior experience on the project so is starting at the beginning of the learning curve and thus gives you rather less than a 100% increase in assembly speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the objective in efficient assembly is to keep 1 shift working continuously enough to get the benefit of the learning curve. This saves you both time and money because you have to have at least 1 shift anyway, and the faster this shift gets, the fewer manhours on the clock needed per product and the less likely it is that you\u0027ll have to resort to overtime. But this only happens if you keep building stuff. If you don\u0027t build very much stuff very often (as with a small fleet of reusable rockets), then you\u0027ll never get any learning curve benefit and your production costs will always remain nearly as high as for building the 1st prototype. OTOH, if you\u0027re making a constant stream of disposable rockets, your costs get lower with each one due to less manhours spent building it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile it\u0027s probably true that SpaceX could lower costs somewhat by just focusing on lowest possible cost disposable rockets, their listed launch prices are already pretty low compared against competitors.

This is not a strategy for the short- or medium-term, but only the long-term. The assumption is that when (or if) they perfect rocket recovery, and IF refurbishing turns out to be VERY significantly cheaper than bulding a new rocket, then they will no long have much in the way of production costs, mostly just operating expenses. These will be somewhat more per rocket than the competition, but within the same ballpark, so at that point, they essentially stop spending money relative to the competition. Meanwhile the competition continues to spend money on building disposable rockets, so eventually they catch up with whatever money SpaceX has already spent. The longer it takes SpaceX to land boosters reliably, and the more expensive refurbishing turns out to be, the further into the future this break-even point will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing that day is already so far into the future that it might as well never happen. BUT, the technology developed along the way would be a very valuable product in its own right, assuming it actually can be made to work. So, it could well be that SpaceX\u0027s real plan is to sell this technology to its competitors, thereby recouping the development costs, and getting out of the launcher business itself except for Musk\u0027s personal projects like going to Mars. Either that or SpaceX will decide it can\u0027t be made to work in an economically viable manner and just give up on reusability.

High costs also meant that there were fewer commercial launches, meaning that fewer boosters were being produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, a contracting system called \u0022cost plus\u0022 was introduced. The rationale was that corporations must not be allowed to earn great profits from government contracts. Therefore instead of submitting a fixed price bid for a contract, corporations must document their internal costs in great detail and then charge a fixed percentage on top of that as profit. Under this system, the overhead staff who document these costs greatly outnumber the staff who do the actual work! Since the corporations get a fixed percentage of the total cost as profit, they have an incentive to keep costs as high as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy contrast, SpaceX have every incentive to make their rockets cost as little as possible. One way they have achieved this is through strict control of supplier costs, with everything done in-house if at all possible.

Any excess mass added to the first stage to make it re-useable will drop away during staging, so the overall performance penalty is minimised. By contrast, making the upper stage re-useable requires hauling extra mass all the way to orbit, which directly reduces the payload mass that can be lifted. Every kilogram of thermal protection system or landing gear that gets hauled to orbit is one less kilogram of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key question for SpaceX will be how cheaply they can prepare their recovered first stages for their next flight, compared to the cost of simply building new ones from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T18:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Torquemadus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Torquemadus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt may seem odd that SpaceX rockets are so cheap, and that SpaceX can afford to do so much R\u0026amp;D.
