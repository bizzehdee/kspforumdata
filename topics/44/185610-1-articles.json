A new study of the M7 ultracool dwarf known as Teegarden\u2019s Star using the CARMENES radial velocity instrument has revealed TRAPPIST-1 probably isn\u2019t\u00A0a fluke.

Even if they did, Teegarden\u2019s Star is in the zodiac constellation Aries, and was not observed by NASA\u2019s TESS mission.

Teegarden b, which is only 5% more massive than Earth, has an orbit of 4.9 days that gives it an insolation 1.14x Earth. This is well within the synchronous rotator inner limit of ~1.45 flux, which is caused by cloud cover forming on the day side of tidally locked exoplanets and helping them withstand higher insolations without going through a runaway greenhouse effect. However, the planet is rotating/orbiting so fast that dayside cloud cover won\u2019t be able to form thanks to the Coriolis Effect. Teegarden b, therefore, finds itself in a similar predicament as TRAPPIST-1d, which can only be potentially habitable if its albedo is at least 0.3 (roughly the same as Earth, so it\u2019s probably quite achievable due to 1d\u2019s high water content).

In fact, it\u2019s almost an exact twin of TRAPPIST-1f in terms of insolation (37% that of Earth), mass (1.11x Earth), and orbital period (11.4 days). It is well within conservative outer limits for the HZ and outside the 10-day inner limit where the Coriolis Effect starts to destroy dayside cloud cover. The one problem Teegarden c has is how low its insolation is. Combined with the likely cloud cover on the star-facing side, it\u2019s a concerning possibility that the planet has ended up too cold to be Earth-like. This doesn\u2019t exclude a Europa-like scenario, but it makes the planet somewhat less exciting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, not all hope is lost.

However, the entire night side could be warm enough for liquid water, leaving any life without access to photosynthesis unless there are small lakes or rivers in the terminator boundary. Teegarden c could resemble a more typical Eyeball Planet, with only the immediate substellar point being too hot (400 K at the max) for liquid water. Between 30 and 75 degrees from the substellar point, temperatures are conducive for life, but afterwards it drops below 270 K and could result in a night side ice cap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"caballerodiez","CreatedById":190290,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T13:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstronomers have discovered a potentially habitable exoplanet around Teegarden\u0027s Star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTeegarden is an old red dwarf star 12 light-years away in the Aries constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe exoplanet found, called Teegarden b, has a minimum mass almost identical to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt orbits within the star\u0027s habitable zone.
