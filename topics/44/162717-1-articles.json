It had to keep its nose between 37 degrees and 43 degrees in order to maintain both adequate TPS coverage and adequate aerodynamic control; outside that narrow window, it would either have plasma impingement on unprotected areas (leading to burnup) or stall of its control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the Shuttle had to have a very good subsonic lift-to-drag ratio in order to make an unpowered glide-in landing. Even though its hypersonic lift-to-drag ratio was much lower, the lift at hypersonic entry was enough to\u00A0reverse the descent completely while it was still bleeding off velocity. If you\u0027ve ever flown a plane in KSP, you know that pitching your nose up to 40 degrees at speed will almost immediately result in a climb. Capsules don\u0027t have this problem, since they invariably have L/D ratios far lower than 1, but the Shuttle did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd therein was the problem; the Shuttle couldn\u0027t afford to stall during entry or it would lose aerodynamic control authority. Control authority is a function of lift, and lift is inversely proportional to both airspeed and air density; if the orbiter started climbing while losing velocity, lift over its\u00A0control surfaces would melt away and it would stall and tumble out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince banking points the lift vector away from the radial direction, controlled banking allowed the orbiter to maintain a steady descent angle (to avoid stalling) while still keeping the nose at 40 degrees. The rolling back-and-forth was used to maintain heading, though depending on initial orbital inclination it used longer curves in one direction or the other to produce changes in heading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: All that to say, because the entry and glide angle windows\u00A0were so narrow, the deorbit burn had to pretty much be in the exact same place every time (for a given inclination) in order to come down at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-30T21:49:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2017 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-01T13:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thank you for the re-clarification.

Orbital velocity is much higher in KSP. Mk3 parts can handle re-entry from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E at a wide range of attitudes and have pretty much equal thermal protection on all sides. If \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E was higher-velocity and Mk3 parts had TPS only on the underside, requiring a fixed high-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E entry, then KSP spaceplanes would also have trouble with too much lift on entry. You\u0027d have to use a ton of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or a bunch of reaction wheels to maintain attitude since you\u0027d be losing speed much faster than you lost altitude.
