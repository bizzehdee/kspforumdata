The reason why we add gravel (coarse aggregates) and don\u0027t make concrete out of sand (fine aggregates) and hydraulic binder cement only is because they\u0027d shrink when setting in large proportions, also it\u0027d heat up much more due to more binder used, and in general it\u0027s more expensive. Now we do have non-shrink grouts which are specially engineered concrete (ok, maybe mortar) with only binder and fine aggregate, and they don\u0027t shrink, but it\u0027s much more expensive. Unless a different process is used then the fine regolith alone might prove too fine for normal concrete as is made on Earth, you\u0027d have to find the coarser aggregates as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-05T19:06:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2021 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-05T17:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u0027s basically what they did on the Apollo Lunar missions - the spacesuits were unwieldy on Earth, but once on the moon their extra mass/bulk was manageable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main problem would be the \u0022cost per kg\u0022 to the moon is so high, there is a massive incentive to lighten everything anyway.

Well, you now have to get something six time as heavy moving while still having only your normal strength and at most as much traction as you\u0027d have on Earth, since that\u0027s proportional to weight. Worse, if you managed to get yourself to a good jogging speed, good luck stopping. And then there\u0027s vertical movement.
