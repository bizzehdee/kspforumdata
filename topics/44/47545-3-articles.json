We could mass produce a bunch of very thin solar shade material in space, place it directly between Earth and the Sun at the L1 point, and just block enough sunlight to completely null out any global warming. \u003Cp\u003EI read an article that said such a scheme would supposedly cool the tropics more than the poles- but I never found out why they were saying that? Maybe due to parallax? The most extreme parallax, at the poles, from a star shade at Earth-Sun L1 would be a little under 15 arc minutes- when the solar disk is 30 arc minutes in diameter- so it would be borderline. However, if you utilized the radiation pressure on the sunward-facing side of the sail to reduce the effective gravity of the Sun by a bit, it ought to move the effective L1 point away from the Earth, reducing the parallax a bit, maybe enough to ensure full shade coverage even at the poles. Even without that though, we\u0027d be talking about full shade coverage of almost all of the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that article was based on recent research, and as we know, that can be very much subject to change, especially for something as complicated as the climate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIgnoring the effectively infinite problem of making \u0022couple hundred thousand square kilometres\u0022 of shades, you do realize the sunlight powers up almost all of our biosphere?
