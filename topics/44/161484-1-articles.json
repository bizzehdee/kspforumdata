So I\u0027ll try break them down and probably make them into some sensible grouping :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Wind. This will veers you off course. You probably need to expend extra energy to stay on course (well, depends on direction and speed), or you won\u0027t be in the direction you\u0027re intending to go. So it\u0027s down to the margins you\u0027re using : an \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E launcher could easily deal with it. Not to mention that the heavier your rocket the less affected it becomes, and once you\u0027re supersonic it\u0027s probably not something to worry. Two extra bits on wind :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.a. Gusts. Sudden turbulence basically. Probably more to do with structural strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.b. Windshear. Changes in overall wind characteristics between places. Something to do with structures again, but given that rockets don\u0027t create lift it\u0027s probably OK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Precipitation. Actually, it\u0027s not that bad, given that rockets create their own hail (ices during filling). Even combined with wind it\u0027s not as crazy as those space junks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Temperature. More to do with the general system. Parts could be iced over, risking electrical short. I presume the soyuz has less of them, which helps things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Electrical discharge (lightning bolt). Actually, metal rockets are faraday cages so it miight be fine. Mileages vary between designs, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is it possible ? Probably yes. But, if the weather\u0027s bad enough, it\u0027s probably the crews that can\u0027t stand the weather, not the rocket, and it\u0027s never a good idea to launch during times where debris are in the air (as may happen in a hurricane).
