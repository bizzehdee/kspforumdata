However, liquid H2 in large quantities is rather hard to come by, production and storage makes this a no-go. Water has 9x the molar mass of H2, and should thus achieve 1/3 the Isp while producing 3x the thrust. This yields a respectable 693 vacuum Isp assuming 2080s Isp with H2 as mentioned here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#id--Nuclear_Thermal--Gas_Core--Closed_Cycle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#id--Nuclear_Thermal--Gas_Core--Closed_Cycle\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0. The tripling of engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E should also be a huge advantage (note, mass flow could be further increased for reduced Isp on liftoff). No cryogenic tanks are needed on the spacecraft, and it should be a lot easier to get enough water to fuel it up on the ground vs getting H2. Also, from what I can tell, at those operating temperatures, water will begin to decompose, boosting Isp (but I\u0027m not sure how much)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming 9,000 m/s needed to reach orbit, and an average of 630 Isp over the course of the flight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9,000 m/s = 9.81*630 * ln (m_1/m_2) \u00A0 \u00A0-\u0026gt; \u00A0 m_1/m_2 = 4.436. The wet mass of the craft could be less than 5x the dry mass of the craft, and it should comfortably get to orbit, and still have propellant left over to cool the core, and perform the deorbit and propulsive landing burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Tank mass could be in excess of 20:1 for just a water tank, so the main question is if the engine can achieve a ~5:1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. The stats for the NTR 1 at 2080 suggest its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E would be around 2.4 : 1 with water... \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E would need to be doubled. Doing that by increasing mass flow would lower the Isp to sub-chemical rocket levels, it would be very fuel hungry on ascent.... Isp could increase as required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E increases, but still the average Isp comes down, the propellant mass goes up, therequired \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E goes up, the average Isp comes down further as a result....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the stats for \u0022NASA report Nuclear Lightbulb\u0022, we\u0027d expect a 3.9:1 engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ratio... getting closer, but now the Isp we\u0027d expect is 10% worse than the previous example, and we\u0027d need about a 5.3:1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNearly there, but realistically, we need to double the engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and keep the same Isp for a standard rocket ascent. Perhaps a winged design could work, High \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, low Isp flight is used very briefly, before nosing over and accelerating mostly horizontal using wings to provide lift.

The new F-35B does seem to be one of the most capable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E jets ever, and that\u0027s largely thanks to its lift fan which is driven by the main engine... its essentially like putting a big fan on a turbojet (ie, a turbofan). It turns the low bypass engine into a high bypass engine. I\u0027d guess it roughly doubles mass flow. It does help the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of the plane (the X-32 competitor could barely hover when stripped down, and didnt use this lift fan system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E turbojets are difficult because jet engines have ridiculously poor thrust-to-weight ratios. You need a very heavy multistage compressor to get the air packed into a tight space, and then you need duct length to mix the fuel with the compressed air, and then you need to have more duct length to combust the fuel-air mixture, and then you need a heavy aft turbine to drive the front turbine. Plus, higher-speed turbojets need even longer ducts because the airflow is moving so fast (e.g., the gorgeous but oh-so-heavy J58-1 on the SR-71).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA turboramrocket needs none of these things, and an NTR less so. You don\u0027t have to collect, compress, or mix your oxidizer; you simply pump your working fluid through your NTR and let it blast out the back end. You need a duct to mix the airflow with the working fluid, and you need a single-stage fan to force air into the duct, but that\u0027s it. The air doesn\u0027t even need to be significantly compressed, because the rapidly-moving NTR exhaust will take care of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor lightweight chemical rocket engines, adding the duct alone runs about 3-5x the mass of the engine and a single-stage fan would drive that up to about 6x. But for a heavier NTR, it might double the mass of the engine, maximum. And you\u0027d be increasing the thrust by about 60% at a standstill and up to 80% at speed.
