Wanna see how a repulsor engine would REALLY work if it adhered to it\u0027s namesake (repulsion) and newtonian physics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes you do!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI admit I am borrowing from the KSP antigravity mod, but also expanding on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA repulsor engine would generate thrust by repelling all mass in front of it using....repulsor \u0027rays\u0027 (yep I know....don\u0027t say it). In accord with physics, if mass is repelled, the ship is thrust in the opposite direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike KSP\u0027s mod, a repulsor that repelled all mass would blow much like a rocket...just minus the plume... an invisible plume if you will. Still expect dirt shockwaves to blow accross the ground on takeoff or liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince thrust is based purely on mass repulsion, once the vessel reaches vacuum, it could still repel off the planet\u0027s atmosphere, \u00A0since the repulsor \u0027rays\u0027 travel at light speed anyway. Just expect to fly along a curve or otherwise to fly directly upward from the planet if using repulsors in space. What you cannot do is point your repulsors at deep space and fire the engines and expect to get thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing to repel against.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBorrowing\u00A0from KSP\u0027s antigravity mod, I think it is a GREAT idea to drain the least power close to a planet\u0027s surface, but suck up the most the farther one gets from a planet in space, to the point of simply not having the power to operate them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet I will expand on this by saying that for the repulsors, power drain will be low so long a ship is surrounded by mass (atmosphere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust is most needed near mass anyway, and repulsors work equally well on in asteroids in space too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, one could push asteroids or even accelerate them while the ship accelerates in the opposite direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the distance becomes too big the power drain would not allow more repulsion anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt any rate...inside an atmosphere...you could repel...I mean fly, indefinitely since the power drain would be low (mass all around you to repel against). Only once you get to vacuum will the power drain start to creep up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there ya go. Repulsors\u00A0that are more newtonian and repulsive than Ironman\u0027s, which basically look and behave like magic rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for you rocket aficionados, yes the ship still needs normal rocket engines, at least if it want\u00A0to thrust in space far away where repulsors would require exorbiant power to operate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr simply to thrust in a direction where there is no mass in range to repel off\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is... so long you also use other scifi staples *cough* like FTL/warp, the tyranny of the rocket equation is largely defeated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough for long missions, refueling off planets or asteroids is a need for the normal rocket engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the repulsors which could run off multiple nuclear reactors. Until the reactors died anyway or ran out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-23T04:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2020 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-23T06:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to Galilean relativity principle, when you jump up, it\u0027s either you are moving away from the Earth, or the Earth is moving away from you, nobody cares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if a 100 kg human jumps up at 3 m/s vertical speed from the 6*10\u003Csup\u003E24\u003C/sup\u003E kg \u003Cs\u003Eheavy\u003C/s\u003E massy Earth, it\u0027s like he makes\u00A06*10\u003Csup\u003E24\u003C/sup\u003E kg of propellant move away from him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApplying the conservation laws (6*10\u003Csup\u003E24\u003C/sup\u003E /100 * 3 ~=2*10\u003Csup\u003E23\u003C/sup\u003E m/s), we can see that by jumping up, the human should approach ultrarelativistic speed and reach the stars without a rocket at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, he even doesn\u0027t need a spacesuit to get to the closes stars by jumping, because the time will relativistically shrink, so he gets to another star between breathings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Let\u0027s\u00A0 name him Skywalker.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-23T06:41:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2020 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
