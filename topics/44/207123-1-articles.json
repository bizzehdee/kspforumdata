As a refresher, an intercontinental ballistic missile has four flight phases: the boost phase (while the rocket motor is firing), the coast phase (while the payload is coasting through space), the re-entry phase (where the payload or MIRV punches back through the atmosphere), and the terminal phase (from plasma sheath termination to impact). A hypersonic glide vehicle, like the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAvangard\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0design, is able to maneuver in a non-ballistic fashion during the terminal phase, but is otherwise the same as an ordinary ICBM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe desire to defend against inbound ICBMs lead to the development of many different anti-ballistic missile systems and designs. Typically, each different type of ABM system targets the ICBM in a different phase:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBoost phase.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EDuring boost phase, the missile is still moving fairly slowly and its carrier rocket is vulnerable to attack. The YAL-1 airborne chemical laser system was designed for this phase, and we have also tested high-acceleration air-to-air missiles, which could be fired from fighter aircraft. The disadvantage of both of those is that you already need the aircraft to be airborne and in the vicinity when the missile launches. The Super-Excalibur nuclear-pumped x-ray laser system also would have targeted the carrier rocket during the boost phase, but it had its own host of problems.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECoast phase.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAs a rule, ICBMs do not maneuver during their coast phase outside of the atmosphere, making them fairly easy to target. They are, however, very small targets. Plus,\u00A0 if the missile is carrying multiple independent payloads (which is now usually the case), that separation event will happen almost immediately, meaning that you now have multiple targets. The original Excalibur, if it had been built, would have targeted the ICBM at the very beginning of the coast phase. The Spartan ABM missile, launched defensively, would have used a five-megaton physics package to intercept and destroy incoming payloads without requiring a perfect lock on the target. The primary US ABM system, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, uses a maneuvering exoatmospheric kill vehicle to achieve reasonably high probability (\u0026gt;50%) of a direct impact with an oncoming missile while it is still outside of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ERe-entry phase.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAlthough the THAAD system is designed primarily for intermediate-range missiles, it is believed to be capable of intercepting ICBMs with a hit-to-kill approach during this phase, although it requires proximity and upgraded guidance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETerminal phase.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAn ICBM-launched payload spends less than a minute in the terminal phase, making it extraordinarily difficult to intercept. The only successful system was the Nike Sprint missile, which accelerated at approximately 100 g and carried its own physics package for a proximity interception. It was extraordinarily expensive and difficult.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a thorny problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it got me thinking -- what if there was a way to target not ONE missile during the coast phase, but ALL missiles during the coast phase? We all know about the Kessler syndrome, where the breakup of one LEO satellite could create a debris field that threatens other satellites, leading to a chain reaction that makes space inaccessible. What if that basic principle (with modifications) was applied to a coast-phase intercept?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, we don\u0027t want to actually trigger Kessler syndrome, no matter how dire the situation may be. So the debris field would need to be at a very low altitude, such that all the debris would burn up and re-enter in a matter of days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a spacecraft carrying its very own ready-made debris field: a few thousand pounds of lightweight aluminum plates. Put a few dozen of these into 300x300 km polar orbits with a range of different ascending-node longitudes, but phased such that several are\u00A0crossing over the Arctic Circle at any given time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spacecraft would need to carry enough fuel to lower its orbit into a 100x100 km circular orbit and then raise it back up to 300x300 km, several times. At 300x300 km the stationkeeping cost is reasonably low. In a high-alert situation where the threat of an ICBM seemed likely, all of the spacecraft would lower their orbits down to 100x100 km, where stationkeeping costs are higher. If the threat passed, they would return to 300x300 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the event of a launch, the satellites closest to the North Pole would blow their payloads, releasing clouds of orbital debris. These debris clouds in turn would impact each other, creating an massive dome of debris across the Arctic Circle. That cloud would only be concentrated over the Arctic Circle for a few minutes every other hour, of course, but with enough satellites in place, you could create a dynamic, persistent debris cloud that would last for several days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question, I suppose, becomes whether such a cloud would actually have a chance of damaging or impeding an ICBM passing through that region of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr would there be any other way to use a debris cloud approach rather than a \u0022hit-to-kill\u0022 approach?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-03T15:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat stops the enemy from just waiting a week to launch their strike?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr detonating nuclear weapons in space to \u0022fry\u0022 the debris-dispenser sats?

If we\u0027re at the point where one ICBM has been launched, it\u0027s a pretty safe bet that whatever happens subsequently is going to happen pretty fast. It\u0027s not like the world powers are going to lob one missile at each other every few days or something. For the same reason, a direct attack on the satellites doesn\u0027t work; once an attack has launched, there would be an immediate response and so the satellites would blow on their own before getting hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have confused the issue by proposing that they would drop down to 100 km in a high-threat situation.

One point that came up was that countermeasures are cheaper than the SDI measure. So for directed energy weapons, spin the rocket so the beam must dwell longer.
