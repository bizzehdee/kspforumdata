It used 3D printers to produce the engines and a body made from lightweight carbon fibre. The rockets were 1m in diameter and 20m tall.\n\nBeck said New Zealand had never launched an orbital rocket before.\n\nHowever, the site at Bayleys Rd, Kaitorete Spit, was uniquely placed for such launches as there were few planes or marine traffic at risk of disruption. The picturesque spot also had the best launch trajectory, or \u0022azimuth\u0022.\n\nEasy access to Christchurch was also important as the US-owned company wanted to establish a rocket manufacturing plant there.\n\n\u0022We\u0027re looking at creating 200 jobs,\u0022 Beck said. \n\nRockets, about one metre in size, would carry satellites into space for commercial customers. The company had over 30 launches booked already, he said. \n\nBeck said preparations were under way to submit resource consent applications to Christchurch City Council for the launch site. \n\nThe proposal has attracted concern about the potential impact on the environment from the Green Party.\n\nSpokeswoman for conservation, Eugenie Sage said the Kaitorete Spit was a nationally significant ecosystem and natural landscape feature containing habitat for threatened lizards, rare invertebrates and threatened plants such as Muehlenbechia astonii .\n\n\u0022The launch activities potentially disturb wildlife.\u0022\n\nSage said local residents were concerned about the potential impact of a launch on access to conservation reserves and other public land during the launches. \n\nApplications for three consents from Rocket Lab were lodged with Environment Canterbury on June 15.\n\nThese consents are to discharge contaminants to air, discharge stormwater, and to provide a coastal permit for temporary occupation of the coastal marine area associated with the operation of a rocket launching complex.\n\nBeck said the company would be working with affected parties. \n\n\u0022This is an announcement of our intentions so we are at the start of the process and will be working with all the relevant parties,\u0022 Beck said. \n\nHe said the launch site would be no bigger than a tennis court and would have minimal impact on the land.\n\nRocket launches were loud, but the noise was for a very short time.\n\nInitially Rocket Lab would launch one rocket a month, but aimed to increase frequency to one a week using a number of sites. Beck said. \n\n\u0022People don\u0027t realise how critically reliant we are on satellites.\u0022\n\nRocket Lab\u0027s Electron rocket was built to launch low earth orbit satellites, which had a life span of 5-7 years and reduced to dust after that time. \n\nThis made them more sustainable than geo syncronist satellites, which stayed in space of 10,000 years, Beck said. \n\nThis story has been corrected to note that many countries have been the staging ground for rocket launches.\n\n - Stuff"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:04:47Z","Content":"And of course, Australia still cannot into space."},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T10:16:26Z","Content":"Good to see an other country reaching space and a completely 3d printed rocket sound great.\n\nOne thing that bothers me, sure it\u0027s going to be a cheap rocket, but it will also have a small payload capacity.\n\nSo I\u0027m wondering what it\u0027s payload capacity is."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:53:21Z","Content":"Hmm...
