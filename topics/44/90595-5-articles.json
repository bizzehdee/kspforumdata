The difference that the possible time travel makes is that even those alternatives that usually would not cause interference because they\u0027re too far apart can now interfere. The trace operation can mash them together, and it ensures global consistency. An external observer will always see the same thing coming out of the time machine than later gets in. Still, in this model, unless you actively set up paradoxes in some worlds, interference between them is as weak as ever, at least after averaging over macroscopically indistinguishable initial states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Deutsch\u0027s model, it\u0027s simpler. You actually travel back into a different world than you started from. What an external observer sees leaving the time machine does not need to match what he later sees entering it in the future. There are different ways to interpret the equations, though, and the alternate worlds are not necessarily the ones from MWI. You can also see them as actual clones.

If you entangle your system with a measuring apparatus and leave the apparatus alone for the rest of the experiment (no interaction with the system or other measurements, no quantum erasing, it helps if it is a macroscopic apparatus, but not a requirement), you measured it.

No fixes are required, actually: What you think are \u0022rules\u0022 for MWI are actually consequences of the way time evolution usually works. You take an in-state and via a linear and unitary operation, you transform it to an out-state. A lot of the rules of QM we take for granted derive from that: the no-cloning theorem, the no-communication-via-entagled-states theorem and conservation of total probability. And locally, time evolution is still unitary.

Yeah, Deutsch\u0027s model looks a bit like that: \u0022First, you take the state of the universe. You use that continuously to feed the time loop until it has settled down. Then, you take the state of the loop and set it as the initial state of the loop in the real universe, then you run that.\u0022 But that\u0027s not relevant. You could just as well interpret the regular time evolution as \u0022Next Tusedayism\u0022, because it allows you to progress time one week at a time, each week copying the end state of last week to the initial state of next week. What matters are the results that come out, and the proper way to analyze them is to apply the formalisms (which are interpretation free and don\u0027t care whether you use MWI or Copenhagen) to test systems. And then you interpret the result like you would do with any other out-state. You have to treat the region with the time loop as a black box. And to determine how events inside the loop influence the outcome, you play with different in-states or time evolutions and see how things change.\u003Cp\u003EThe time travel aspect simply comes in because we partially feed the out-state back into the in-state; it\u0027s similar to a regular feedback loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Technical Ben\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Technical Ben\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll this would be more understandable if it was Multi System Interpretation or similar.

It is not at all clear how it would be supposed to work; it applies to an external observer doing the measuring, and who would be external to the time loop, yet close enough to measure something caught in it? Instead, if you want a measurement from inside the loop, you have to do the complicated thing and model the measuring apparatus as part of the system. It can be a mock apparatus that could not exist in reality, it just needs to be able to measure and store the same thing. Then, you model how the measuring apparatus goes out of the time loop. Only after all is over, you measure the state of the measurement apparatus with your chosen interpretation of QM. And it can matter a whole lot more than normal what you measure and how you treat your equipment. In Deutsch\u0022s method, it matters whether you push your apparatus through the time loop or not after it has done its measurement. In Lloyd\u0027s method, what you measure has a lot more influence on the future of the system than usual, and quantum erasers no longer work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T22:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not convinced.

Or rather, you just wait for it to happen naturally, because it happened billions of light years away and billions of years ago... But regardless, with light, you again run into the same problem. Whether the object far away is receding or the space in between is expanding, you\u0027ll get the same result. Motion due to expansion is true relative motion, and it is true relative motion at the superluminal speeds for the galaxies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369063\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002290595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709056875\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to build a space craft drive based on changing space time seems to me like instead of designing a jeep one designs a lever that will rotate the planet underneath one so your desired location arrives underneath you.\u00A0 Impossibly big lever and untold unintended consequences if you use it and far easier to drive a jeep, fly a jet, or even walk and swim\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if I told you that if you write it in the framework of GR, properly accounting for frames of reference, effects of driving a vehicle across the planet, and saying that the vehicle\u0027s wheels cause the planet to spin underneath with vehicle staying put are identical?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just a mathematical perspective. We happen to use math that explains this type of motion through space-time geometry, because that\u0027s the easiest thing for us to put into formulas. There is an equivalent formulation of it under which you just \u0022drive the Jeep\u0022. That is, fly the ship at FTL speeds. It\u0027s just the kind of math that makes the epicycles of a Geocentric model look quite reasonable in comparison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other problems with the Alcubierre Drive, of course. I actually missed the mark a bit on saying the behavior has to be different in curved sapce-time. I had time to revise my understanding in the years since... It\u0027s a lot worse. The Alcubierre Drive just straight up doesn\u0027t work if it carries any non-zero mass inside of it. Even in flat space-time. The negative energy of the bubble walls has to cancel the mass energy of the ship, or the bubble starts radiating gravity waves. So how do you avoid angular momentum conservation problems when warping around a star system? Super easy, barely an inconvenience. You make sure that the total mass that gets transported is zero. Where you get that negative mass at origin and what you do with it at the destination is left as an exercise to the reader.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002290595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709068478\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut maybe time dilation is involved for K^2 and not \u003Cs\u003Ehis\u003C/s\u003E fault.\u00A0 Alcubierre drives have side effects like this I gather\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E*Her\u003C/em\u003E.
