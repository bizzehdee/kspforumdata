As well as this various officials have been saying they will launch a new sat soon, even the big guy claimed he wanted one for the October celebrations (NK 70th anniversary), it should also be noted October always comes up in these claims. And now just today another head official from NADA claimed they were building a newer, more advanced satellite for a launch soon. Considering the special event and recent activity in Sohae.SLS, i\u0027m going to assume that they are serious and that we should prepare for it; so here\u0027s a quick breakdown.\n\nDate; 7th Feb 2016\n\nLaunch site; Sohae Satellite Launching Station, after being upgraded for two years Sohae is ready for launches. Same procedure as before although they may use the new HAB and transporter built there.\n\nRocket; Unha.\n\nSatellite; Kwangmy\u00C3\u2026\u00C2ngs\u00C3\u2026\u00C2ng-4, supposedly a more advanced national surveillance satellite for resources, disasters, blah blah blah. You get the drift.\n\nNotes; This will be NADA\u0027s first mission, are they up to the challenge or are simply \u0022nothing\u0022. This could be NK\u0027s first successful mission considering K-3 didn\u0027t even work.\n\nPredictions; An \u0027interesting\u0027 month, maybe some explosions, laughing at North Korea, AA guns/flamethrowers, an international s\\*\\*t-storm.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T11:45:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555**\n  \nUpdated launch date"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:13:14Z","Content":"I\u0027m actually rather curious.

In particular they lack modern microprocessor and materials technologies. They have alienated themselves from everyone (including China) and can not produce enough food to feed their civilization. Internal descent is more frequent then it at first appears as many people are forced to operate black market business rather openly simply to survive. The country is not catching up. Not keeping pace. but falling behind. While I do not doubt that they will eventually launch a successful satellite, and that they have managed to invent nuclear weapons, these achievements are not considered modern. Nuclear weapons have been around since 1945 and North Korea tested theirs in 2006. Orbit capable rockets... 1957. DPRK.. pending (maybe 2016).\n\nThis indicates that North Korea is about 60 years behind. I do not criticize North Korea for having propaganda. I criticism them for having BAD propaganda.
