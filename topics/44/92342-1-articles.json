Are there different forms of heat shields? how different they are from each other?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T04:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeat shields are made from materials, often ceramics, that are very poor heat conductors.

Imagine the heat shield has a conductivity of 0. \u003Cstrong\u003ENo \u003C/strong\u003Eheat at all flows through it. Then, the outer surface atoms of the heat shield will soak up \u003Cstrong\u003Eall \u003C/strong\u003Eof the heat from the air pushed aside by your craft on reentry. Since only a layer of atoms just 1 thick has absorbed any heat, once the spacecraft slows to reasonable speeds, you could EVA out and possibly put your bare hand on the heat shield because a 1 layer thick atomic layer, no matter how high the temperature, has very low \u003Cstrong\u003Eactual heat \u003C/strong\u003Estored in it.
