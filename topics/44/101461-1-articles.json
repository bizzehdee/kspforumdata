We\u0027ve all seen the [image](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nasa-warp-drive-007.jpg)of a hypothetical warp drive equipped spacecraft. Probably total science fantasy, but it sure looks pretty. Seeing that image, I immediately began to wonder : let\u0027s suppose you *could* build a spacecraft that vaguely resembles the rendering, with a working FTL warp drive, but other than the warp engine, you did not have any technology we cannot reasonably extrapolate from known principles and physics. \n\nAgain, this discussion is not about the warp engine. Let\u0027s just pretend it works, and suppose that you could travel 10s of light years in a matter of months. So you are out exploring, and you encounter a planet similar to the Earth in that it has a similar atmosphere composition, at least half the surface is water, and it has a surface gravity of 10 m/s^2. How convenient. \n\nYou are quite excited to land on that planet with a landing party and meet the alien ~~women~~ organisms up close and personal.\n\nFortunately, the wizards back at NASA have loaded up your starship with a vehicle capable of, at a minimum :\n\n1. Taking off and landing from an earth like planet (in atmosphere, gravity, and element mix) without help from the ground with **humans onboard**\n\n2. For an even harder challenge, it\u0027s an SSTO that must make orbit with no missing parts except fuel\n\nWhat would the form of the vehicle even look like to pass a napkin test? This is, to me, a fascinating challenge.\n\nHere\u0027s where I\u0027m at so far. \n\nVehicle starts with a similar lifting body design to the space shuttle and various space-planes, but it has to be even larger than the space shuttle orbiter. It has a massive reactor in the back, similar to the one used by Project Pluto, but it\u0027s dual mode, capable of working to superheat both atmospheric gas and stored onboard hydrogen for thrust. There\u0027s a crew capsule in the very nose, protected by a shadow shield. (this is the main reason it has to be large : the larger it gets, the relative mass penalty for shielding against radiation from the reactor becomes smaller)\n\nThere\u0027s 7 main phases of flight.\n\n1. Reentry - Vehicle uses similar mechanism to previous spaceplanes. Though it\u0027s quite rear-heavy from the reactor and it has mostly empty fuel tanks.\n\n2. Soft Landing - Once it reaches cooler altitudes, damper doors over 2 turbine air intakes at the front of the vehicle are slid open. These are turbines powered by the reactor (via a hot-air power take-off turbine in the back and a long driveshaft) and they compress incident air and feed it to the reactor in the back. With sufficient power, you land this vehicle onto a calm patch of the ocean\u0027s surface on hydrofoil skis that deploy from the bottom.\n\n3. Take off. After a stay on the ground, you have to start from 0 m/s to even get enough speed to get off the water. Good thing you have compressor turbines that can compress outside air to feed to the engine. You don\u0027t need a TWR of \u003E1 to take off like a seaplane, maybe 0.3-0.4 or so will do it. (not certain how much skis reduce drag compared to tires on a runway).  *The moment you depart the water surface, you jettison the modules containing the skis and any floats.*\n\n4. Fueling. Once already in the air on nuclear thrust, you fly around for hours to days to fill your onboard fuel tanks. On an earth like planet, you do this by collecting water from the atmosphere with condenser coils, electrolyzing it for the hydrogen, then filling your onboard tanks with liquid hydrogen. *Once you have full tanks, you jettison the modules containing the electrolysis equipment.* You might have done this stage before takeoff if the atmospheric concentration of water is low.\n\n5. Transition to ramjet flight. Faster and faster you go. Once you are going fast enough, you *jettison the modules containing your main wings and the compressor turbines and all the equipment needed to drive them.*  The craft is now only flying due to nuclear ramjet thrust and the main fuselage, sans wings, is enough of a lifting body to stay in the air.\n\n6. Transition to scramjet flight. *You shed part of your ramjet air intake*...at high speeds...leaving only a smaller intake for scramjet air.\n\n7. To space. From extremely high altitude, and up to half orbital velocity, it\u0027s time to go to space today. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re going at 1/3 orbital velocity already, and your nuclear engine gives 1000 ISP when configured for hydrogen. So your scramjet is already going 2.6 km/second, and you need 6 km/second, even, plus a little margin. Half the mass of your remaining craft has to be fuel, stored as liquid hydrogen which is not very dense, and you\u0027ve still got your crew compartment, radiation shield, and monster nuclear engine. If you had several modules to the nuclear engine, you could make this more efficient by dumping the extra modules later in the burn once you have shed enough weight in propellant. For bonus points, these modules would be optimized for handling atmospheric air, while the core would be designed with channels for liquid hydrogen. \n\n8. Waiting in orbit. You need enough stuff working to wait in orbit. Your monster nuclear engine is still incredibly hot and dangerous, producing 1/3 of the many gigawatts of power it had to produce right up to engine cut off. Realistically you\u0027re gonna have to dump it, you don\u0027t have the mass budget for radiators to keep it cool once you\u0027re out of propellant. So you jettison the entire propulsion section, leaving just the crew capsule and enough batteries and life support on board to stay alive until the mothership picks you up.\n\nFrankly, this design barely seems plausible on a napkin. Even if you posit incredible engineering talent, better than anyone who has ever lived, to develop this vehicle, I don\u0027t know if it could ever actually work. \n\nIf we\u0027re gonna land and take off with an intact vehicle we can use for another shuttle run, this isn\u0027t gonna work. What design *could* work? Once we send down the red-shirts to make sure it\u0027s safe, the captain is going to want to join them in the interspecies exchange with the alien women. So the shuttle needs to be able to ascend to orbit and pick him up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T17:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EzinX**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:30:50Z","Content":"So, an SSTO trumps a starship, huh?"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:50:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, an SSTO trumps a starship, huh?\n\nI\u0027m assuming the starship is powered by pixie dust that ceases being magical when you get near a planet. \n\nI see your point, though.

Also, impossible. And it is not a SSTO if it has more than one stage, that too, and yours sheds a lot of stuff.\n\nFirst, you can\u0027t have a NERVA-like reactor running on Hydrogen running on anything else. The cooling channels on the reactor are designed with hydrogen\u0027s density in mind, so they won\u0027t work for anything else. Or, the Pluto-like engines won\u0027t work with hydrogen, one of both.\n\nThankfully, there is already a nuclear engine design specifically thought as a SSTO: [DC-X](http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/06/nuclear-dc-x-recent-nuclear-thermal.html). NERVA-like engines can give you TWR over one with delta-v\u0027s over 10km/s if they are properly designed, and then the only other thing you need is landing gear strong enough to support it. Though considering how hot the tail would be after a powered landing on the main engines, maybe auxiliary chemical landing engines would be preferable.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s the [QED ARC Polywell fusion engines](http://www.askmar.com/Fusion_files/From%20SSTO%20to%20Saturns%20Moons.pdf). Those are much more theoretical, since no one even knows if a polywell even works, but if you believe that very speculative paper, then, well... fusion SSTO spaceplanes with near-future tech! That looks positively sci-fi.\n\nRune. Being a pebble bed, the core on a nuclear DC-X can also be safely dumped to space after the main burn, that\u0027s another plus.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T20:48:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune**"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T20:51:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure what kind of input you are expecting from this thread.

So using a magical high thrust NERVA engine with a magical nozzle that works efficiently at all altitudes, your 18000m/s dV SSTO rocket still needs to be twice the size of a Saturn V.\n\nYou\u0027re calculating required vehicle masses linearly, when due to the nature of the rocket equation it\u0027s actually exponential:\n\ndV = g \\* isp \\* ln(wet mass / dry mass)\n\nwet mass / dry mass = e^(dv/g/isp)\n\nmass ratio = e^(dv/g/isp)\n\nSo: mass ratio = (payload mass \u002B fueled mass of rocket) / (payload mass \u002B dry mass of rocket) = e^(dv/g/isp)\n\nNow, for a dV of 9000 m/s (by the way, this only BARELY gets you into orbit with nothing left for deorbit or orbital adjustment) and an isp of 450 (chemical fuel with hydrogen), the required mass ratio is about 7.68. For a more reasonable dV of 9.5 km/s, it\u0027s 8.60. Now, to get our payload fraction, we need to subtract the structural mass of the vehicle from the dry mass. Let\u0027s assume the structural mass is 5% of the fueled mass - this is comparable to a F9R first stage, and it uses kerosene fuel (high density \u002B non-cryogenic = good tank mass fractions) and the highest TWR liquid-fueled engines ever flown, so this is VERY optimistic.\n\nSo: (payload mass \u002B fueled mass) / (payload mass \u002B 0.05 \\* fueled mass) = 8.60.\n\npayload mass \u002B fueled mass = 8.60 \\* payload mass \u002B 0.430 \\* fueled mass\n\n7.60 \\* payload mass = 0.570 \\* fueled mass\n\nfueled mass = 13.33 \\* payload mass.\n\nlaunch mass = 14.33 \\* payload mass, or 1433 tons for a 100 ton payload. This is much lighter than a Saturn V, but we used an unrealistic mass fraction for our rocket: it\u0027s more realistic to assume dry mass is around 10% of fueled mass for a cryogenic stage. This gives us a launch mass of about 5400 tons, which is close to double a fully fueled Saturn V (and the Saturn\u0027s payload is a bit more than 100 tons actually).\n\nAnyway, now let\u0027s switch out our hydrolox engines for a solid-core NTR with an isp of 900 s, and keep the mass fraction the same.\n\nWith our higher isp, we get:\n\n(payload mass \u002B fueled mass) / (payload mass \u002B 0.10 \\* fueled mass) = 2.93.\n\nOur launch mass ends up being **373** tons for a 100 ton payload. Holy mackerel! Doubling our specific impulse didn\u0027t half our launch mass, it cut it by more than ten times! Unfortunately, our actual mass ratio won\u0027t be that high, since (a) nuclear engines and their associated shielding are heavy (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) the vehicle needs to survive reentry for safety reasons, and \u00A9 again for safety reasons we\u0027ll want fairly high structural safety margins.\n\nNow, let\u0027s look at a rocket with a dV of 19,000 m/s (enough to make a propulsive landing on an Earthlike planet with no atmosphere and launch back into orbit).\n\nWith hydrolox engines, our launch mass must be e^(19000 / 9.81 / 450) = 74 \\* (dry mass of rocket \u002B payload mass).\n\nOops. Even the lightest rocket stage we\u0027ve ever built, launched with no payload at all, is still three times too heavy. Let\u0027s try again with NTRs.\n\n(payload mass \u002B fueled mass) / (payload mass \u002B dry mass) = e^(19000/9.81/900) = 8.6 (hey, this number looks familiar).\n\nTurns out our nuclear rocket with a dV of 19 km/s DOES end up being about twice the size of a Saturn V, but a chemical-fueled one turns out to be utterly impossible.\n\nFortunately for OP, if we can build a warp drive we can probably build a closed-cycle gas-core NTR (aka a \u0022nuclear lightbulb\u0022), which would have an ISP of at least 1500. Or, better yet, we could use some type of fusion reactor. For that matter, less than a gram of the antimatter used for the mothership will provide plenty of energy to reach orbit provided we can find some way of using it to make a jet or rocket engine usable in atmo.\n\nAlso, if we\u0027re exploring the stars with a ship like this, it\u0027s reasonable to assume we\u0027re looking for potential colonization sites. If a planet has so little atmosphere that we can\u0027t aerobrake or run a nuclear-thermal jet engine (Mar\u0027s atmosphere makes both difficult but possible), then just leave and find another target, and send a small robotic lander to do some basic measurements on the feasibility of terraforming the place."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T21:56:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe you built the descent vehicle after you already arrived, or sent a probe earlier.

Also works on vacuum worlds just fine.\n\nYou are asking a lot of chemical propulsion, even for a tripropellant engine. The russkies [didn\u0027t think they could make that work](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/maks.htm), not without an air launch assist and an expendable external tank. Going nuclear with a higher isp would give you some mass fraction breathing room to stick the heatshield and ISRU equipment in.\n\nAnd I say heatshield and ISRU equipment, because you can\u0027t make do without those. The equivalent energy to the ground-to-orbit burn has to be dissipated in order for you to stop, so if you don\u0027t make it go with the heatshield as it ablates, or with a retro burn, you have to sink it into the airframe and re-radiate, so you quickly start glowing white. Especially if you land of full tanks! Then your ballistic coefficient would be crap and stopping it before the ground wold be incredibly difficult, needing massive heatshields and landing systems. Now, if you land it empty, that is much less mass to stop, so much less energy to shed. Plus, much less thrust to land propulsively, so you don\u0027t need to light the main engine, auxiliary chemical rockets wouldn\u0027t be such a mass hit and would save you the deep throttling and multiple firings requirement on the main propulsion system.\n\nAnd if you are worried about nuclear engines becoming hot after a firing, as I said, with pebble bed systems you can dump the whole radioactive core away in orbit and put new fresh fuel afterwards. Another reason for auxiliary landing systems, that way the nuclear engine can land \u0022cold\u0022.\n\nChemical-only SSTOs probably won\u0027t have good enough payload fraction to be useful, if you add the reentry requirement, sorry. Even doing clever things like Skylon to use atmosphere as extra reaction mass on the way up won\u0027t yield mass fractions that allow for the big payload margin that ensures a robust design.\n\nRune.

If you\u0027re leaving legs and heatshields on the surface, you might as well just go full Apollo with a two-stage lander. It makes things much simpler.\n\nThis is debatable. What you are dropping is presumably relatively smaller and light. Heat shield plates would be thin plates of some kind of wonder ceramic-carbon-composite whatsit that can tolerate the heat. And, you only drop the plate protecting your engines in flight. The plates protecting your fuel tanks you would drop before launching again. (you\u0027d use em to make shacks to live in or something on the ground). Or, with future materials, you might be able to make your fuel tanks and engines heat resistant enough that this isn\u0027t even needed (and the tanks and engines would still be light enough for SSTO)\n\nThe main thing is that if it\u0027s *partial* SSTO, you might be able to do 10 or 20 launches and landings with a single shuttle for the same total mass carried on the mothership as 2-3 landers that can only do one trip each.\n\nYour point is received regarding ISRU. You can\u0027t rely on finding hydrogen and carbon just anywhere. \n\nRegarding scooping gas : the way this is possible uses a nuclear engine that has insane performance (multiple gigawatts of output power) and it will leak fission fragments in the exhaust. That\u0027s why you gain net fuel this way, because the engine sustains your speed during the hypersonic flight, and it does the burns to put you back into orbit at a very high ISP. \n\nNow I\u0027m wondering what other options there are to get the needed performance. Perhaps ablative laser propulsion? (the mothership would carry a very large laser onboard). It would vaporize a chunk off the lander vehicle to give it net thrust with an ISP of better than 2000. (and high thrust as well). And ablative laser propulsion propellant is solid blocks of homogeneous material - you could probably make it from a large variety of possible elements found on other planets.\n\nProblems include the fact that your laser mirror has to be gigantic to get a decent spot size. If the mothership is in geosync, it has to focus precisely on specific spots on your ascent vehicle from 35k meters away, at the correct angle...probably be easier to set up a mirror on the ground that acts as a relay and beam combiner.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T21:11:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EzinX**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:18:22Z","Content":"You\u0027re talking about crazy magical propulsion methods, yet you insist on jettisonning parts that quite easy to reuse even with current technology: heat shields, landing legs, and molten reactor cores.

You are either SSTO or MSTO. SSTO is just a pointless label. The number of stages is irrelevant.
