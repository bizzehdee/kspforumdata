If gravity travels at the speed of light, then how does the gravity of the singularity of the black hole escape the event horizon at all? I\u0027ve heard of stars that are so massive they don\u0027t leave anything behind when they die, could that be why?\n\nI just woke up, and this is essentially dream logic.When I wake up I\u0027ll think about this more."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T12:40:00Z","Content":"Because gravity is a consequence of spacetime distortion by mass.

If you drop a really heavy ball onto the sheet, a distortion will appear, but only propagate at the speed of sound of the sheet (in the real world, this would be equivalent to the speed of light hard limit). The distortion itself is unaffected by the speed at which it propagates."},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T19:00:23Z","Content":"Because gravity is not subject to gravity.
