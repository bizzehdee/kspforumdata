If it was absolutely needed, we could launch really soon with lots of launches, lots of re-purposed devices, and lots of risk, as we will be testing new hardware by using it, and if it fails we will have to deal with it as it happens. I do not think that anyone in the field of spaceflight really wants that, however. If the funds were available in endless heaps of ready cash, a few years would be reasonable at the least, and it would again, depend on why we are going. There are some who want to go simply for flags, footprints, and a bit of surface material, some who want colonization, and some who want extensive science missions based on landings of teleop robots and humans in orbit, not to mention the many other mission profiles proposed.

Total mass in LEO start shy of 200t, upto 1000\u002B tons, depending on the mission parameters. As we speaking of NASA, you can peek into the \u0027Design Refererence Architecture 5\u0027, or one of its appendixes: \u0026lt;\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NASA-SP-2009-566-ADD2.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NASA-SP-2009-566-ADD2.pdf\u0026gt;\u003C/a\u003E (I think the DRA-5 is the currently \u0027active\u0027 one (for small values of active). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are others, as well as there are projects from other agencies, even officially abandoned plans give an idea. For ESA, search for the Aurora-Program. There are some ideas to cut tonnage in LEO, as in-situ production of fuel and water (some of them with added complexity as sending some stuff ahead).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T23:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldnt 200 tons still means you need to send 2 rockets and assemble in space?

In fact, there will be multiple launches (there are other mission ideas, as sending the Mission bit-by-bit, so that that some hardware will already be at mars when crew arrives - obviously this also requires multiple launches, but there is no need for LEO-assembling; as well as you \u0027know\u0027 as you send the crew that you have a working habitat in place).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, DRM-5 requires orbital assembly. One of the problems is also that the max. output of KSC is limited to shy of 3 SLS launches per year (shy of 5, if they are working in shifts 24x7). So I don\u0027t believe we will see a final mission profile grossly exceeding 500-400t in LEO, if no major changes to the ground infrastructure (read: a 2nd VAB, ...) will be made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
