That would require having an absolute attitude reference (horizon sensor, maybe?) that it trusted for knowing its orientation, but using the rate gyros as the dominant source of angular velocity information. I can see how that would be useful; gyros could give more precise instantaneous readings of angular rates, and the absolute reference would let you null out integration errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E tend to think that a huge conflict between the model and a sensor would ring some alarm bells and tell the filter to ignore that sensor, but I don\u0027t write those programs so I don\u0027t really know.
