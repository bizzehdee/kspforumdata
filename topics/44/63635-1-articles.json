It has all of the advantages of both systems without either drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe foremost advantage is that an air-augmented rocket can run as a conventional scramejet at hypersonic speeds. In other words, you get hypercruise capability, where you only burn conventional jet fuel. This makes such an airliner very cheap to operate compared to a Scimitar alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther advantage over Scimitar is safer, denser fuel. Tanks will be smaller and lighter, not only because Jet-A takes up less volume for the same energy, but also because it\u0027s not cryogenic. And safety is no small factor. Any LH2 leak is an explosion hazard. Hydrogen gas mixed with air will auto-ignite in presence of certain metals, such as platinum. Never mind real ignition sources, such as sparks or open flame. Jet-A, in contrast, is hard to light with a match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, engine complexity. Scimitar is going to be a nightmare to maintain. You have coolers, compressors, turbines. Tons of feeds, valves, and various moving parts. And FAA requires you to pretty much take everything apart and check every 100 hours. Expensive. In contrast, an air-augmented rocket is just as simple as a scramjet. A duct. A few fuel and ox inlets. Maybe a few cowlings. That makes it easier to maintain, and safer to operate. Not only are there fewer things to break, but unlike any turbine engine, it can take sand and bird strikes, and just keep on going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s almost as simple and cheap as conventional scramjet. But it doesn\u0027t require boosters to get it off the ground. It can get rolling and up to takeoff speeds using rocket thrust. At that point, it will have enough air coming in to start running in its air-augmented mode. As an air-augmented rocket, it will have way more thrust than a conventional ramjet while passing the sound barrier, and that\u0027s where all that thrust is needed. Once well past the sound barrier, the ox supply can be cut off, and the aircraft continues as a scramjet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only disadvantage of an air-augmented rocket used as a jet engine is the fact that you do need oxidizer. You don\u0027t need much. Most of the flight you\u0027ll be burning conventional jet fuel. So the costs aren\u0027t really an issue. But you do need an extra tank, and pretty much anything you go with for ox will be some sort of hazard. At the end of the day, I\u0027d probably go with LOX for that. It\u0027s comparable to liquid Methane in ease of use, except that it\u0027s also corrosive. On the plus side, it\u0027s not a suffocation hazard, it\u0027s not quite as much of a fire hazard, and at any rate, you\u0027ll have way, way less of it to worry about than you\u0027d have to with Scimitar\u0027s LH2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShouldn\u0027t it be possible to build a Methane-based SABRE?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, not really.

I\u0027ve addressed most of this. Running as a scramjet, air-augmented rocket can pull I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E closer to 1,500s. \u003Cem\u003EOn Jet-A\u003C/em\u003E. If we make it impulse per $$$, instead of weight, a scramjet beats SABRE hands down. And this is atmospheric flight. It\u0027s not all about I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. TWR is a very important factor as well, which is way, way better for a scramjet. And then there is the question of the craft\u0027s size. Hydrogen is very, very low density. For same mass of fuel, the tanks have to be 10x larger. So even if I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E is 2x better, for the same operation time at the same thrust, you need 5x larger tanks on SABRE. Did I mention that they are cryo tanks, which need to be extra thick and extra heavy? Oh, and also, they vent H2 gas while on the ground, which is about as flamable a gas as you are likely to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for complexity, SABRE \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E includes a rocket engine. And turbines. And compressors. And coolers. It\u0027s a way more complex engine with all of these components having to run 100% of the time. The rocket engine on air-augmented rocket is needed only for the takeoff and getting past sound barrier, where extra thrust is needed. There, you\u0027ll be down to something like 700s - 800s of I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E on a Jet-A/LOX engine, but it\u0027s a small fraction of the operation time.
