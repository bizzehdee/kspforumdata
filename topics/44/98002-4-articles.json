Although the U.S. gives lip service to the developing space industry, the increase of regulations, nearly oppressive government oversight, and now differing approvals required by differing agencies beg to differ. I read on Space.com about a year ago that for every test flight by a civilian space company (such as Virgin Galactic, SpaceX), the FAA requires a detailed flight plan, NASA requires suborbital and orbital trajectories and mission plan, the EPA wants a complete environmental impact study (to include various materials used, what the environmental hazards could be, the plans to clean up in the event of a disaster, etc.), the DoD wants information, the NTSB wants detailed reports on evacuation procedures of human passengers and pilots, and nearly a dozen other agencies with some report and documentation required BEFORE each launch.\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s face facts, while we like to say that the federal government (in the case of the U.S.) wants to keep things safe, reduce liability, and manage risk, could there be more to this story? Could the nations of the world realize that there are many of us that are willing to risk everything for the opportunity to settle on the Moon, Mars, and beyond? What would happen to these same nations if those colonies declared independence, much like what happened in North and South America between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? Could it be that maybe the spacefaring nations are afraid of an uncontrollable exodus or new sources of unregulated wealth if these companies begin mining asteroids and the Moon? Could it be a little of both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the governments of Europe had placed so many restrictions on the early explorers, North and South America would have never been settled by Europeans.

And even in the manufacturing process, the largest cost factor isn\u0027t the raw materials to build the rocket, it\u0027s the workers. By reusing rockets, you need less of them, but you still need to maintain a factory and a decent workforce to run it, so you don\u0027t necessarily make huge savings there. And the manufacturing workers are only a small part of your total workforce. The highest salaries are in the R\u0026amp;D and mission control departments. And you are still going to need hundreds of people to do all the logistics, transportation, payload integration, testing, and other administrative work. There is also the cost of maintaining facilities. Launch sites, research centers, factories, mission control centers, aren\u0027t cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even if the actual hardware is 50% of the total launch cost, the first stage is probably around 70% of that, which would make it 35% of the total launch cost (not the price!). The price of a launch, is $60 million, so to simplify, let\u0027s consider that the cost without reusability is around $50 million, so you save $17 million on each reusable launch. If you reuse your first stage 10 times, it brings the average cost of a launch down to around $36.5 million ((1x50\u002B9x33)/10), which results in saving about 30%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is a highly optimistic estimation. It assumes zero refurb cost, zero transport, and a constant unit price for the actual reusable unit. It also assumes 10 time reuse, which is also optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that the cost of each unit increases as you reduce the number of units produced. If a factory is sized to produce 400 engines/year and you only build 40, then your costs are not optimized. Your fixed costs take a larger part of your total costs and ou also don\u0027t get large volume discounts from your suppliers. So your unit cost increases, which also eats into the savings that you might get compared to launching 400 disposable engines. There is a balance to be found somewhere, and until SpaceX has some real data about the recovery and refurbishing costs in an operational environment, nobody really knows how much reusability will save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s more likely that in the end, you\u0027re looking at something like the 20% figure I quoted above.

They\u0027re generally not good engineers. If people like Nibb (or pretty much any realistic engineers) were in their team, they\u0027ll either scrap the idea outright (and come up with a new one), or make more modest estimations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX, in this case, started out modest. They learn to build small rockets first (Falcon 1), make a VTVL rocket-like vehicle to learn how to land them safely (Grasshopper), then they build larger rockets (Falcon 9), along with a capsule to go on top (Dragon). Right now they are applying their lessons from Grasshopper to learn how to land Falcon 9s safely. After that\u0027s done, then they\u0027ll reach other milestones that they plan (Falcon Heavy, Mars Colonial Transporter, Dragon V2). That\u0027s why NASA trusts them; they are able to, and have proven their capabilities enough for NASA to inject them some funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkylon, though? It\u0027s almost an all-or-nothing affair. Either the final product will work or it won\u0027t. Their technology requirements are quite tall (the precooler system alone gave them a lot of trouble already), and their cost estimations have no real grounding. They don\u0027t even build small-scale versions of the thing, let alone actually flying it. Almost all of the dev funds go to the engine, which while quite logical given that the fancy motor is the lifeline of the craft, almost everything else is relatively undeveloped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX builds its might by making small steps.
