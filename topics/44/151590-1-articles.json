I wanted to figure out using only what stock KSP actually provides in-game to determine orbital parameters of the planets. KSP provides things like masses and radii, and you can mouse-over a planet in map view to get its current altitude and velocity, but no angles or eccentricities are provided anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line, I\u0027d like to get a value for semi-major axis and eccentricity for every planet on my own. Yes, I know there are reference values on the wiki, and it\u0027s possible to figure it out by inspecting the game\u0027s files, but I wanted to know how you could calculate such a thing. I got as far as being able to calculate a semi-major axis based on one reading of a planet\u0027s altitude and velocity; I rearranged the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eorbital speed equation\u003C/a\u003E to provide the semi-major axis when given velocity and radius, but I still don\u0027t know how to get eccentricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought about taking two readings and using a solution to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_problem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELambert\u0027s problem\u003C/a\u003E, but I don\u0027t really have a good fix on the positions; all I get is the distance from Kerbol, but no angle that I can fix a position on. Another route I tried to go down was to use the semi-major axis to calculate the orbital period, then grab the radius/velocity once, then again exactly half-way through the orbit as timed by the clock; Kepler\u0027s second law says I\u0027ll get two equivalent areas that way, and their total makes up the total area within the orbit, but I couldn\u0027t figure a way to relate that back to the eccentricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned a lot trying this exercise, but I seem to be stuck. Any orbital mechanics experts out there who know how to do something like this or can tell me it\u0027s a lost cause?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T07:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet your periapsis and apoapsis height, add the planet radius and solve the equation system, you\u0027ll get major semiaxis and eccentricity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nr\u003Csub\u003Eperi\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0 =a (1-e)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nr\u003Csub\u003Eapo\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0 =a (1\u002Be)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t find out the longitude of periapsis or longitude of ascending node without getting it from some in-game display because any longitude is relative.
