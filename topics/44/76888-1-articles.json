Anti-Electrons (Positrons) are positively charged, and anti-protons are negatively charged. When Matter and Antimatter come into contact, all of the energy contained within them is released in a process called Annihilation. Only particles and their antiparticles annihilate, so a positron and a proton won\u0027t annihilate, neither will and electron with an anti-proton. When Positrons and Electrons annihilate, it produces pure gamma rays. Protons and their antiparticles produce gamma rays as well as a myriad of particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are multiple ways to produce antimatter. You can smack really heavy nuclei together, you can smack really heavy nuclei into really heavy stuff (like gold or lead), you can use lasers to produce electron-positron pairs, and there are some radioactive isotopes that naturally produce positrons.

The self-irony comes from the fact that while ostensibly it refers to the events in the book, it can just as well be applied to the book itself on a meta-level.

Antimatter annihilation is merely an energy source - mostly in the form of gamma rays and charged particles, as mentioned before. That energy needs to be converted into electricity, and doing so is a surprisingly mundane process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could for example encase the annihilation reaction in a material that\u0027s a highly capable gamma ray absorber. The material would heat up from the large energy intake, and then the heat could be transformed into electric energy directly via thermocouples, or indirectly via heating water to drive a steam turbine. After all, steam turbines are how 98% of all powerplants in the world do it today, including all nuclear and even most solar ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way could be ion beam harvesting. The concentrated gamma rays could ionize suitable gas molecules and these ions, possibly together with the charged particles from the annihilation, could be guided and shaped by magnetic fields to be fed into a device that extracts the electric charge while returning the gas to its neutral state. For example, they are currently looking into this technology for use in fusion reactors, where high numbers of charged particles are produced and the magnetic fields are already present.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"christok","CreatedById":93810,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T15:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter isn\u0027t just normal matter with the electric charge reversed.

Dirac proposed that all of the negative energy states are \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E filled, by an infinite vacuum sea of particles (e.g. electrons) which exerts no net force on anything because it is uniform. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents \u0022normal\u0022 electrons from lowering themselves to the negative-energy states of the vacuum electrons. Whenever one of the particles in the sea was knocked into a positive-energy state, the Pauli exclusion principle would no longer prevent a positive-energy electron from falling into the so created \u0022hole\u0022, which would mutually annihilate with the electron when they encounter one another. (The electron lowers itself to the now-available negative energy state by radiating energy. The system is then in the vanilla vacuum state.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modern interpretation of this theory is the Feynman-Stuckelberg formulation, which reinterprets the negative-energy holes as positive-energy \u0022antiparticles\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used some details from D.

I only ask none of you start yelling at Brown for his book. Just because he wrote something doesn\u0027t mean he is implying that. All of the ideas in the book are just part of the imaginary universe in his book. I don\u0027t find the book or movie offensive in any way. I suggest you don\u0027t too. Maybe I saw the wrong movie but in my opinion it was done really well. I saw it in Russian and the Italian and Italian accents were very well done. I think a director deserves some credit for getting real Italians or Swiss into the movie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
