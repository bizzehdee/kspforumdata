And I also have been told that it is advantageous to have a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E due to stresses on the vehicle when accelerating very fast so you can build a lighter craft. Is a lower thrust to weight ratio better for these reasons, and is there any more I haven\u0027t mentioned? Also, what would be a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for a rocket to maximize delta v and minimize gravity losses?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-29T03:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, as you burn your fuel your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E increases, and your loads increase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost real\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E limitations come from people.

High \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E certainly reduces gravity losses if you just launch rocket vertically to a suborbital trajectory. On the other hand, you need to either steer more aggressively to get a gravity turn or spend more time at high pith angles if you have too large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, increasing losses in both cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that gravity losses scale approximately as g / (a - g) = 1 / (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E - 1), so going from 1.1 to 1.5 is vast improvement, from 2 to 3 - not so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it\u0027s best to have maximum possible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at liftoff but probably not higher than 3 in the maxQ region (mainly to limit aero stresses, drag losses are usually negligible IRL, contrary to KSP). After rocket passes dense atmosphere, it needs to steer, so high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E leads to high steering losses here. Therefore, something between 1 and 2 is the choice (sometimes even lower, like Saturn V with 0.8 at second stage). For circularization, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E does not matter much so IRL it\u0027s usually low because smaller engines are cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIronically, the closer you are to the ground, the higher acceleration you actually need, which is absolute opposite to what really happens at rocket launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-29T09:36:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2017 09:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pand5461\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
