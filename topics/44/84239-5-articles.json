Let\u0027s assume that earth and mars are stationary, and at a distance of 15 light-minutes (in our reference frame).\u003Cp\u003EIf we observe Event1 here on earth and 15 minutes later we observe Event2 on Mars, we can say: \u0022From our point of view, it seems that both events happend at the same time. We observe Event2 15 minutes later, but that is just the travel time of the signal.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine a 3rd observer that passes Event2 at a near light speed (relative to Mars, Earth, our reference frame). He observes Event2, and he is really close to mars, so the signal delay between Event2 and him is very very small. He might think: \u0022Event2 is happening right now\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ignore special relativity, you might think that he will observe Event1 15 minutes after that, and Earth is at a 15 light-minute distance. But depending on his velocity he can see a comletely different distance, and a completely different time intervall before observing Event1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI havent done the math, but lets assume he sees a distance of 10 light-minutes, and a time intervall of 5 minutes.

Thats the thing about relativity. You can\u0027t say that two distant events are happening at the same time. Even if you think they happen at the same time (taken signal delay into account), for a different observer they can happen at different times, or 2 events that happen at different times for you may happen at the same time for a different observer.

Lets say that communication with this machine is instant for the reference frame of the sender.

If he uses the same FTL communication technology, he may send us a picture of Event2.
