Black holes do not \u0022suck in\u0022 things any more than anything else just as massive does. There is no reason why things\u00A0cannot orbit a black hole forever.\u00A0The fun/weird stuff only starts when you \u00A0get close to it, where things can be dragged around by weird phenomena, the only reason you are able to get so close is because all the mass is so concentrated into a small area.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, say you were 1 AU away from a 1 solar mass black hole (not sure if 1 stellar mass is enough to form a black hole by the usual mechanisms, not sure, just an example), the gravitational effects would be indistinguishable from orbiting the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou often hear about black holes sucking material from nearby stars because (well, mostly because this is a dynamic situation that has many visible effects, so they are easily spotted) there are common mechanisms whereby this situation can arise (stars formed close together, one prone to black hole/neutron star formation). And close to a black hole (within \u0022weirdness range\u0022, tidal forces [amongst other effects]\u00A0are extreme, so you do get \u0022extra suckiness\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a very \u0022off the top of the head\u0022 explanation though, so expect errors -\u00A0I\u0027d encourage further reading, there is a TON of it!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T02:04:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate all the responses.
