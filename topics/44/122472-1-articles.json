So you suddenly need a lot more heavy equipment and people in orbit than you might think which drastically increases the costs. Assembling something like 20 small pieces of a craft in space is a huge task and would very likely require the work of half a dozen astronauts over many months, likely even longer and with crew rotations. The initial construction of the ISS is a pretty good example of how much time, equipment and personal is needed for such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn modules, you always end up with a craft that isn\u0027t as stable, but still a lot heavyer compared to one that has been launched in one piece. You end up with duplicate and thus redundant systems on every piece and have to rely on docking ports and multiple smaller fuel tanks.

Designing 10 very different modules that have to reach the construction site on it\u0027s own is difficult and it\u0027s not efficient to have dozens of dead and useless engines aboard. If you use a tug to deliver the modules (russian style) you cut even more into your payload per launch and need more launches in the end.
