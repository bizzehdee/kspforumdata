Part of this plan involves using an inflatable heatshield to protect the (now-separated) first stage engines on re-entry, due to the high velocity at MECO. This led me to wonder... what\u0027s the current state of inflatable, deployable heatshield technology? It would require some highly flexible material that ablates slowly enough that you only need shielding that\u0027s as thick as canvas. A heatsink design seems out of the question - heatshield mass just doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027d be high enough to support that, at least not using any real material. I can\u0027t think of any material that would fit the bill.
