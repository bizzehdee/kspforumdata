How would I solve the problem. Before I got a few paragraphs down I realized that it was a dirty laundry list of guesses, many of them rather uninformed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is it, we have 1 example of sentient life. And we have been looking all over the cosmos and not seeing any other examples of life, and have not even found examples comparable to earth after studying 2400 exoplanets. So we have a data set of 1 and a possibility of less than 1:2400 or more. So lets look and see what the density might be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if life on planets is X below the probability of observing 1 in 2400 is y (remembering that our observation of ourselves has an acute observers bias)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is there are no statistical tests that allow this. While most qualitative testing does not allow me to do this (to do it accurately I really need a \u0026gt;\u0026gt;32 bit computer), I can trick the fisher exact test into doing it by setting ratios like the actual is say billion over a million is roughly equal to 1000:1 odds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets see were this takes us. lets start by saying there are for every 1000 planets we have 999 with sentient life and 1 without. and we will step this ratio down by 10 each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSL:Not\u003Cbr\u003E\n999 :1 P = 0 to the calculation limit of a 32 bit computer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n99:1 P = 0 \u0022 \u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n9:1 P = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:1 P = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9 P \u0026lt; 1E-107\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:99 P \u0026lt; 1E-9\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1:999 P \u0026lt; 0.4\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9999 P \u0026lt; 0.3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:99999 P \u0026lt; 1E-3\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:999999 P \u0026lt; 1E-5 Note: the estimates below are not really accurate because they test the computational limits of the computer, I could reduce these, but\u00A0 . . . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9999999 P \u0026lt; 1E-7\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9999999 P \u0026lt; 1E-9\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9999999 P \u0026lt; 1E-11\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs we can see the probabilities drop more slowly into the microscopic ranges on the low estimates relative to the high estimates of extraterrestrial life. What this means that if we have to entertaine a broad confidence interval, its going to stretch more quickly into the very low estimates of sentiency. Do we have to entertain such estimates? A historical analysis of the science suggests yes,the curve has been shifting down. First we examined ourselves and concluded it was 100%, then we discovered our 9 planets and it dropped to 1:9, then 100s of planets, now thousands of planets and the probability is falling each time, the reason it is falling is because of our bias.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere does observers bias come from and what is it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur observations suffer from both observation and confirmation bias. The problem is only living sentients can be/create the observers can count sentient life, and there always has to be 1 observer an any observation of sentient life. In very crude sampling (such as 2400 planets out of galaxy that has a trillion planets), very low estimates can never exist because there would be no observer to observe a region that is devoid of life or sentient life. So lets say our observation limit is 100,000 light years, and the field of view has a 10,000,000 stars with transects and we pick up 3 planets with stars. If we do not see signs of life in 1:30,000,000 planets can never allow a statistic say 1000 times lower, even if that is the life\u0027s (or sentient life\u0027s) rate in the entire galaxy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the base assumption of science is that a potential something is nothing until something. We can flip that to the opposite if we observe a strict pattern, such as all flying birds have wings, if want to test a new set of flying birds then the null hypothesis is that they should have wings. Having one earth and no observations of planets, we assume that all planets should have life. Moving to the next higher level of observation, having studied the moon and many planets, we have yet to observe life elsewhere (though predict that one or two have life). In observing the planets and all the moons of our solar system we do not see evidence of sentient life. The mistakes that are made here in the argument is that we assume the current knowledge suffices to create the appropriate argument, and the revelation of new technique reveals that it is not. Its historic ignorance, the question is whether we are above historic ignorance on not in our answers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom this perspective we should argue that the naive state of a planet is not to have life or sentient life, that is our null hypothesis that needs to be disproven. Some may argue the point but if they do we then have all kinds of subjective qualifiers. Do we count moons, do we count large asteroids, what should be counted in the assessment of life. So lets say we only count planets that have atmospheres. How many planets have we observed that have atmospheres,\u00A0 . . .very few. What is the probability that life exists outside of earth, in this argument we can exclude earth, lets say we believe to be transplanted here by beings from another galaxy, an omniscient creature about intergalactic sentients and we know we are the only species in this galaxy from the next galaxy, we ask the question how many planets have evolved life in this galaxy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo improve information of the low estimate statistics, there is another statistical method which is to remove 1 and then re-analyze, this is often done with data presents with a few outliers. Lets suppose we remove the earth from the analysis, because the observer creates the bias, what happens. Assuming no evidence of life or sentient life on 2400 worlds how can we estimate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1:9 P \u0026lt; 1E-109\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:99 P \u0026lt; 1E-10\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:999 P \u0026lt; 0.2\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:9999 P \u0026lt; 1.00\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:99999 P \u0026lt; 1.00\u003Cbr\u003E\nsince now earth is one of 2400, the lost estimates can of very rare life can never go below 1:2400 (0.0042) which means that our probability slow on the low estimate side and essentially stops at 0.0042 This is because although the probability is high at the low end, of the 2400 observations we have a 1:2400 chance of removing the one earth, removing any of the other planets does not matter much, they are pretty much the same statistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this then gets into a qualitative sphere, how far could we observe life on other worlds if we could observer sentient life on other planets. Or to ask the basic question, do some of the observed planets have life and we simply cannot observe it, do some have sentient life and we are missing it? If another world has life did it evolve or did it commute? Asking these questions we can then ask how biased is the observations? Planet hunters are looking for earth like planets, not at all planets, what about moons around gas giants, don\u0027t they qualify, should not the total number of planets be more? And we cannot see all planets, only those that transect our Earth - star sight, many go unobserved. There is a size bias to the observation, certain stars cannot be observed because of solar flares during the observation window, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat have I done, I have improvised a confidence range containing 99.7 percent of estimate where there was none it runs from about 1:20 satellites (1:300 for sentients) to 1:1E23 for the observable universe. The number is sufficiently small to not require adjustment for the entire universe. There is some hideousness to the argument, because space-time obviates any considerations beyond about 2 billion light years. And in fact the observations constraint is limited to a pool about 1000 galaxies in our vicinity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis statistical observation therefore epitomizes the problem that the data used to describe the Fermi paradox is a guess, it has a huge confidence range that is created by an observation bias and no other positive observations. The argument exists but the quantification does not. Some here might argue, why have such a wide and useless confidence range. A nice reason is that the Fermi paradox has bred a plethora of guesses that have each a very low probability of being correct. The confidence range therefore contains data for all of them and does not interfere greatly with the likelihood that any given one is wrong or right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for example how could you know if there are species wiping out upstart civilizations if, in fact, that sentients are so rare, such species would only have a space-time SOI of a few 100 million light years and you are outside of that range, they might exist, but you could never detect them. The correct answer to the Fermi paradox is that \u003Cem\u003Eit \u003C/em\u003E(the argument)\u003Cem\u003E exists\u003C/em\u003E. This may seem like a denigration of the paradox, its not meant to be, its meant to be a denigration of the solutions. Whenever we have an object where it can be inserted into an \u0027it exists\u0027 class, but the supporting data is minimal, we have to be wary of the answers/solutions. Who told us this? About 1000 years of theological philosophy went unresolved until Occam\u0027s razor. The simplest answer here is that life is rare and sentient life is even rarer, but we do not know what degree or why because our sampling is too poor. The sampling maybe poor because there is roughly nothing to sample......only statistics, however poor, are permissible at this point, nothing else has relevance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T18:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I

Technology will fail, radiation will kill the travelers or sterilize them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe newly planned telescopes will tell us more in the next decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-02T10:49:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2016 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Green Baron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
