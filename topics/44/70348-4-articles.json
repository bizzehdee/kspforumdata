Is it that you object to the SLS because of the SRB\u0027s and that we should wait to develop a more advanced type of propulsion to get us into space? Because I as well find Solid Rockets to be inherently unsafe. However in terms of generating massive amounts of thrust efficiently currently there are few alternatives. Without proper funding we just can\u0027t wait for alternative forms of propulsion to catch up with the necessity for manned space flight. Currently SpaceX is on amazing pace in bringing us back into low earth orbit and docking with the ISS without relying on the Soyuz. But if we want to get back to exploring our solar system and beyond we need to get back there sooner rather than later. Would have Apollo been better off if they had waited another 5 to 10 years for the technology to be better? Of course! They went to the Moon at a time where they had no realistic business going to the Moon. They shouldn\u0027t have gone it was dangerous, impossible, illogical, and impractical. But they did and that is what NASA is about. We are destined to explore and question. It is in our DNA to want to know what is going on the in universe. So as much as technology has advanced from Apollo to today are we still really fully prepared to truly reach for the stars and begin deep space missions? No but we should do it \u0022not because it is easy but because it is hard\u0022 not because we don\u0027t have the technology, but do it however we can, because it needs to get done and because we should do it, and in 50 years people will be talking about how we had no business going to Mars and beyond because the technology was primitive but we did it and it was amazing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is we can\u0027t dwell on failure. NASA especially is not going to launch a vehicle into space that is beyond the acceptable risk for manned space flight. NASA has an impeccable track record when it comes to the manned program. Out of the hundreds of manned launches there has only been one catastrophic failure that resulted in the loss of life at launch, and by most accounts the reasons for the Challenger disaster go beyond damaged or defective o\u0027rings. The true failure of Challenger was entirely political. Time constraints, budget cuts, delays, and the launch schedule for military projects being extremely behind resulted in ignoring a problem that dozens of NASA engineers and scientists expressed concerns about. Any concerns directed towards the SLS by us lay people have been addressed, are being addressed, solved and readdressed by all of the amazing and brilliant people at NASA. NASA is not going to put a single soul inside of that Orion capsule until it has been tested hundreds of times and then retested. So we can talk about mitigating risk via different forms of propulsion, but whatever NASA chooses I think we can all rest assured it is the most realistic and safest choice for a launch system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-27T06:11:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2014 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScallopPotato","CreatedById":98794,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T12:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concerns about the solid boosters really can be limited by choosing one of the liquid booster options for the advanced boosters.

The space shuttles most fatal flaw was being downgrade of everything. As was the failure of columbia and challenger, along with the fact that there was no way to do an emergency abort with the space shuttle. Also to one of your other points about the survivability of an enormous explosion, I think that you can agree that the oribter could not have gotten any closer to the source of the explosion during challenger and their is good evidence that the crew survived the explosion. The emergency oxygen was masks were used and the recovered data said that the from the pilot seat Scobee was trying to fly that thing all the way to the ground. So if the shuttle had some sort of emergency escape system they might have lived. The fact that the Challenger crew survived means that if there is an explosion I would much rather be at the top and in a capsule than in a orbiter strapped to the side. It worked for a very long time but it was just a horrible design in terms of safety. With Columbia, because the vehicle was downgrade it was extremely vulnerable to falling debris and it was only a matter of time before something struck the heat shield. Believe it or not most launches the ship returned with tiles missing. The very first launch the ship returned with nearly 100 tiles missing. These issues are unique to the Space Shuttle and that vehicle served NASA very well for over 30 years with only two catastrophic failures both due in large part to the location of the orbiter on the rocket and that there was no ability to abort or detach from the ship. Wasn\u0027t there a plan to make it so that the crew cabin could detach from the orbiter in case of a catastrophic failure to the orbiter? It would have saved both crews. The SLS will be the safest ship NASA has ever made to fly because of the political reasons you mentioned. People might be able to accept the loss of a spacecraft but the loss of a crew would be a death blow to NASA.
