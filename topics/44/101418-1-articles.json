This center of course shifts quite a bit during flight, as the SRBs rapidly shed mass and are jettisoned and the orange fuel tank also rapidly drops in mass. \n\nOk, so I know *why* : if the engines are each aligned with the center of mass, then each will create no net torque on the vehicle.\n\nBut, do you have to do it this way? While there isn\u0027t any net torque, you\u0027ve got 3 competing velocity vectors and some of the thrust will be canceled out by the other vectors. If, instead, you align the engines such that their thrust is in line with the direction of travel, and just balance the thrust generated with the other 2 engines (so the torques cancel), won\u0027t you get more dV for your fuel?\n\nThis thread probably needs some drawings.

Deorbiting burn would be a pain to perform with unbalanced engines, but there\u0027s no reason you wouldn\u0027t be able to perform an emergency landing if an engine failed during takeoff or reentry.\n\nBasically, a jet airliner moving at mach 0.8 and 30,000 feet, with wings optimized for flight in that regime and a TWR of 0.3, is VERY different from the space shuttle, which has a TWR over 1, is designed for hypersonic reentry, and may be flying at, say, mach 2 and 60,000 feet, or mach 10 and 200,000 feet, when an engine failure occurs.\n\nAn airplane can pretty much always rely on being able to generate a pretty large yaw force with its tail to compensate for an engine failure, as well as throttling down. The Shuttle can\u0027t do that without going to a high angle of attack and risking breaking up, and in some cases throttling down would make the problem WORSE because the remaining engines would be unable to overcome the upward pitching moment produced by the SRBs. Its ability to make drastic trajectory changes is extremely limited with the external tank attached.\n\nPlus, in the event of an engine failure close to takeoff, the shuttle would have to either separate from the still-burning SRBs (very dangerous) or ride them all the way to burnout (in which case the vehicle must remain controllable). Longer after takeoff, it would be on a suborbital trajectory over the ocean, with no air to help with control. At best, if a failure resulted in inability to keep the thrust balanced with gimballing, it could ditch the ET and get out of the spin with RCS, but if it can\u0027t keep burning the main engines the OMS would probably be too weak to allow a Transatlantic abort. The shuttle\u0027s high stall speed means ditching in the ocean would almost certainly be unsurvivable, so crew would have to bail out. Again, this is very dangerous.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes)\n\nHere\u0027s a chart of the shuttle\u0027s abort modes:\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ShuttleAbortPost51L.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ShuttleAbortPost51L.png)\n\nBasically, anything after SRB sep is a flight regime where there isn\u0027t enough air for a vehicle to maintain control via aerodynamics alone, so without gimballing you have to shut the engines off entirely and immediately (equivalent to a 3-SSME failure) and use RCS to stop any rotation that was imparted. For the space shuttle, unless this happened very near the end of the burn you\u0027ve got a vehicle loss and frequently a crew loss. This would be true for most spaceplanes of a \u0022shuttle-like\u0022 design.\n\nAFAIK the only serious spaceplane design that *doesn\u0027t* have the ability to point its thrust vectors at the COM is Skylon. However, Skylon is again different from the space shuttle: an engine failure low in the atmosphere would be similar to one on a normal airplane, while at higher speed and altitude it could potentially shut its engines off, reenter, and wait until it reached a low enough speed and altitude for safe powered flight before returning to the runway on its single engine (most likely dumping all oxidizer and some of the fuel to reduce mass enough that reentry is safe)."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T07:06:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also consider that the Space Shuttle had rubbish aerodynamics when empty; with the ET and Boosters attached I expect the control surfaces on the orbiter would be basically useless.\n\nWe aren\u0027t talking about Space Shuttle.

At low speeds it ought to be fine doing what you said, but at mach 3\u002B it\u0027s possible that an engine failure would push the vehicle into a flat spin before the other engine could be shut down (as has been experienced by pretty much anyone who\u0027s flown a multi-engine SSTO in KSP before the update with the RAPIER), which in real life would result in the vehicle breaking up. Here\u0027s an example of this happening with an SR-71: [http://www.916-starfighter.de/SR-71_Waever.htm](http://www.916-starfighter.de/SR-71_Waever.htm)\n\nOnce Skylon has performed its pitch-up maneuver following the transition to rocket mode, it will have almost no aerodynamic control. If an engine fails, it would have to immediately shut down the other engine completely (RCS would be much too weak to compensate for imbalanced thrust). It would still likely go into a spin, with associated problems from high centripetal accelerations, but wouldn\u0027t immediately break up and could slowly stop its rotation using RCS (heck, maybe use the LOX as a cold gas thruster, since it won\u0027t be needing it). However, it\u0027s possible that for a large part of the burn to orbit, an engine failure would result in a reentry too steep for the vehicle to survive.\n\nHowever, according to this: [http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=33648.450;wap2](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=33648.450;wap2)\n\nSkylon has the equivalent of four engines in rocket mode (I guess each SABRE has two turbopumps), so it\u0027s possible it could handle a failure in that regime with just a reduction of thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T09:20:02Z","Content":"Flat spin is definitely a possibility. The only way to really deal with that is automatic cutoff and RCS response. If critical engine failure is detected automatically and opposing engine is cut off immediately, which is possible to do with a rocket engine, any remaining angular momentum can be absorbed by RCS even in total vacuum.\n\nRe-entry on failure danger is always there, regardless of engine configuration. There are a whole bunch of situations that can cause loss of propulsion during any stage of the ascent. And it is possible to design ascent profile to give a safe re-entry on failure. It would increase delta-V requirement, reducing payload, but if we are going to see regular commercial operation, which is the only scenario where Skylon-like craft make sense, we will need to see such measures taken. 2% fatal failure rate may be acceptable when you only expect a bit over a hundred launches in three decades, but if you plan to have hundreds of launches per year, it will be a PR nightmare. Total engine failures will happen to space-planes, and they will need to be constructed to handle such an emergency."}]}
