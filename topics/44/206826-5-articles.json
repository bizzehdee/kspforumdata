In the US we\u2019re already using nuclear for 18%, and we should absolutely keep as much as we can going as long as its affordable. What Im arguing is that as they age out we\u2019d be wiser to replace them with grid scale storage than new plants. The LCOE for LiB grid scale batteries \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E higher than peaker gas 4 years ago, but now its in the $150/mwh range and NREL projects that to continue to fall over the foreseeable future. \u00A0Ive heard a lot of doom and gloom about Li supply, maybe thats fossil fuel companies scaremongering about the future or maybe its commodity speculators juicing the market, but NREL doesn\u2019t seem to believe its a real problem long term. Meanwhile nuclear is up at 175$/Mwh and rising. And remember we\u2019re not trying to cover the whole nut. We\u2019re talking about scaling up from 2% to 20% over the next 20-30 years as it replaces aging nuclear plants and whatever\u2019s left of NG. \u00A0But more importantly that smaller fraction taken up by storage is whats going to allow us to even out supply between wind and solar so that we can spend $30-50/Mwh the rest of the time. So in 10 years when storage is covering 10% of supply at $100/Mwh, plus the $30/Mwh from renewables it took to charge them, its still going to be cheaper than nuclear, all of which accelerates the rate at which we can hit that 60-70% mark replacing fossil fuels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nway i see it nuclear sites will always be radioactive hot zones, since they all store their waste on site. these sites remain dead zones for awhile. also seems like the perfect place for a nuclear power plant. thus in situ waste can be managed properly. decommission first and second gen reactors for fourth and fifth gen as needed, all on the same site. if we develop better nuclear waste handling capabilities, we can start thinking about modular reactors that can plug into existing thermodynamic infrastructure, say replace old coal boilers. and when those reactors are spent, ship them to a reprocessing/recycling/decommissioning facility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas for fear mongering, i think the timetable is grossly exaggerated to stimulate action, they say 20, i think we might have 100 (its the fusion clich\u00E9 in reverse).\u00A0 sure we should behave as if the worst prediction is accurate, but that does not mean abandoning long term solutions. stopgaps buy time for those plants to be constructed, which in turn buys time to complete development of fusion. and maybe we will sidestep it all with beamed orbital solar (environmentalists seem to want to stop development on that front as well).\u00A0 i like green technology, solar, wind, storage, etc, these are all effective technologies for specific purposes, but then again so is nuclear. to block one in favor of another feels like dumping out half your tool box into the ocean, and hoping to hell you don\u0027t need the wrench you just threw out when your ship starts sinking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote
