I am pretty sure that this would fall out of that band, which would mean we would need a special camera that can take images at nonstandard wavelengths. It is possible to fairly easily construct a spectroscope (I have done it at my kitchen table), but not such a camera, alas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could do this basically by shining a light through the container, through the air we are investigating, and through a narrow slit, into a filter that would act as a prism (diffraction grating, pretty easily available), and then into the normal camera optics. This would essentially project a rainbow onto the CCD, and the absorption of the gas would be compared to the output of the lamp and the absorption of the plastic container. I note that in the arrangement I have used, in order for this to be done without too much noise, combination of many frames was required, although the files could be black and white. I would also be concerned about precision. While we could easily assert the presence of, say, nitrogen, in our samples, it would be a different matter entirely to confidently say how much nitrogen relative to CO2, to oxygen et cetera, and to differentiate between the different samples, as minor fluctuations will be fairly important. Not impossible, but difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are talking about mass spectrometry, which you may be, I will caution you that it will take far more than a fancy camera and a lamp to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeljr: Okay. That makes sense to use, as we need to make sure that we keep the torus aligned right for the other work. I am thinking though that we might could do that some other way, say a hook that punches into one of several funnel shapes on the moss torus, and slides the assembly to where we want it to be? Then again that would be possibly more complicated and difficult to set up, whereas a ratchet will work, we know.
