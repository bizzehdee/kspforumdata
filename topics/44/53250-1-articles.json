However there were other constraints that made a near-equatorial lunar orbit desirable. For example, they wanted to land with the sun behind them, for better visibility. The landing sites also had to be properly lit, and had to face the Earth. The biggest requirement though was that an equatorial orbit is safer, because you have your free-return trajectory if the SPS engine fails to start (or if you do an Apollo 13) and you get one TEI window every orbit whereas things are much more complicated if you are on a polar inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T01:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMostly for the same reason that getting into a polar orbit expends more Delta-V then equatorial.

So much time was spent milling around out near the moon that conics or patched conics do not provide accurate simulations.

This was in the early days of high speed computing, so these calculations required resources which are hard to comprehend today.
