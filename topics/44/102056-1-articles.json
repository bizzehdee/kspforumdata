Even if liquid methane was ten times as expensive as RP-1 is (and I assure you that it is not, RP-1 is super highly refined and certainly not common kerosene!), its price point would be irrelevant in the grand scale of things.\n\nI can\u0027t tell you with certainty why it wasn\u0027t adopted earlier, but I can *speculate* that it was largely a question of practicality. RP-1/LOX not only worked just fine, but in fact did something very specific very well: it delivered high fuel density, allowing the designers to keep the rocket stage small and easy to build. Then, if you wanted a high Isp fuel and density was no longer important, you could go with LH2/LOX. It\u0027s the most effective (sane) chemical propellant mix that we have, even today.\n\nCompared to that, liquid methane had no immediate key selling point. You had no reason to pick it over RP-1 if you needed a dense fuel, because it is much less dense. You had no reason to pick it over LH2 if you wanted performance, because its performance is much lower. And yes, it is much better storable long-term than LH2... but for deep space missions, you take hypergolics anyway, because they make the design of a restartable rocket engine a million times easier, and the resulting engine that much more reliable.\n\nThe problem with a propellant sitting somewhere in the middle is that it is a jack of all trades, master of none. It is good at many things but not the best at anything, so when rocket scientists looked to use only the best stuff to maximize their efficiency, it got passed over at every opportunity.\n\nFast forward a couple decades, and you get renewed interest in methane because nowadays, we have computer-aided engine design that allows us to understand the combustion process, and design specific behaviors for specific fuels. We have better materials to build rocket hulls and tanks. Thirty years ago the advantages of methane seemed not worth the extra effort you needed to go to to unlock it, but today we have minimized that effort. Additionally, the scientists today are looking at dfferent things than they did in the past, such as:\n\n- Self-pressurizing tanks, which saves weight and complexity by removing the need to carry helium tanks and pumps and seals and valves and control electronics and software to maintain the pressure. Methane can do that, hypergolics or RP-1 cannot.\n\n- The ability to refuel a rocket in situ, something that just doesn\u0027t work with most fuels due to the complexity of the refinement process. Methane on the other hand is super simple to produce, if you cannot just collect it from the environment outright.\n\n- Cost reduction. Mixing a RP-1 first stage with hydrogen upper stages might be performing better, but it requires a more expensive rocket and a more expensive launchpad and a more expensive servicing and launch process. With just one fuel in all stages, and it being less cryogenic than liquid oxygen which is present anyway, you can radically simplify a lot of things, and that might be worth a small hit in performance.\n\n- Special applications. SpaceX wants a higher Isp engine because that higher Isp is critical to avoid losing too much in the way of payload capabilities by saving fuel for a boostback and landing of the first stage. A conventional rocket gains a bit of mass to orbit from every extra second of Isp... but a rocket that needs to reserve some of its fuel for after decoupling gains many times more of an advantage - or more precisely, it sacrifices less in addition to gaining the same benefit that a conventional rocket would. So for SpaceX, the advantages of running on methane are larger than they are for conventional approaches.\n\nTo sum up, nowadays we have the know-how and the technology to get an actual advantage out of methane while mitigating its downsides, and we have gained a new appreciation of things only methane can do that designers decades ago weren\u0027t even in need of (or aware of). It\u0027s a different fuel for a different era."},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T09:53:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes the two liquid states don\u0027t overlap, LOX might freeze methane however that would require long time as the difference is only 20 degree so its far less a problem than hydrogen.\n\nSince you have to have a LOX tank *anyway,* couldn\u0027t you do the same thing they do for storing liquid helium, and make the lox tank inside a larger tank that holds the liquid methane? This would let you make the lox tank walls much thinner, as the cold methane layer would act to keep the lox cold.

You can make all the weight-saving designs you want for a fuel tank - it\u0027ll never achieve much more than a 3.5% weight saving.\n\nWhy hydrogen over methane? \n\nHydrogen burns at a ratio of 2:1 with oxygen (2H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u003E H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO). \n\nMethane burns at a 1:2 ratio with oxygen (CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 2O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u003E 2H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO \u002B CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E). \n\nSo methane requires four times as much oxygen to burn as hydrogen, for roughly the same energy output per unit mass of *fuel* that undergoes combustion.\n\nUsing a space shuttle external tank as an example (again), liquid oxygen already makes up the bulk of the mass (630 tonnes of the 760 tonne filled weight).

Either way you have a heavy tank that should be load-bearing but is not, and you may have an additional load-bearing bulkhead that was not necessary.
