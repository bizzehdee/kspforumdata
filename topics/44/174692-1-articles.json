I was hoping someone could give me a second opinion on this, because mine is crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCold fusion, right? It\u0027s bunk. But... check out this presentation from 59:00 - 1:01:00.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the presented evidence is pretty extraordinary. To summarize, Deuterium fusion makes Helium-4, so they took a Deuterium cold fusion experiment where they could turn up and down the apparent produced heat and detected Helium being produced in response in matching levels. Afterwards they baked out and counted all the Helium, and found its ratio to the the total measured excess heat was spot on for fusion. Apparently this was done by two separate groups with confirming results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable border=\u00221\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:800px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNDqaFPO4A?start=3540\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no chemical process to make Helium, only nuclear, so I\u0027m agog that not one but two separate groups confirm the Helium production and that the heat per atom is spot on for fusion. I find it quite compelling. How about you?\u00A0 I\u0027m yet to get my hands on the original journal articles, and will save any real judgment until I have a chance to comb through them for gotchas, but it\u0027s a little hard to have experimental gotchas that could do this spuriously and line up this well from two separate groups. It\u0027s almost as unlikely as cold fusion \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
