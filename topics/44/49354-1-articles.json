Any purely logical processing entity (i.e. a computer or robot) would eventually reach a mathematical contradiction (this is a formal-logic term, with a precise meaning - think 2=3 to get the general idea). How it dealt with this contradiction would dictate its response (whether it crashes, freezes, or simply ignores it). Any halfway sane programmer would tell it to simply ignore the contradiction, as opposed to having it freeze or crash (it\u0027s like a divide-by-zero - a ridiculously basic condition that is dealt with trivially in ALL modern computer systems at a very low level).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T03:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most popular paradoxes do not apply to computers.
