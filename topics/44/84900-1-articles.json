We only know of 1 planet with life and we\u0027re standing on it. You can\u0027t extrapolate from a single data point. But if I had to guess I\u0027d say they look more like the Zerg than the humanoid aliens that Star Trek uses. Simply because zerg have such a wide variety of shapes that it seems likely that an arbitrary alien would share similarities with at least one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for their science and technology. The laws of physics apply to the entire universe. So if they invent science they\u0027ll come to the same conclusions as we have.

Generally I think it is accepted that we would be most likely to find primitive life in the oceans. Beyond that, for science and extensive material manipulation for tools etc then some form of hands and fingers are required. This would almost universally be required for an intelligent race to have developed \u0027technology\u0027. Of course you also require an advanced brain, which in the development of life on earth has generally required mammals to maintain sufficient heat and energy. This may not be the case on other planets and climates but this becomes speculation or debate on what defines intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor science and technology, although science is science and the rules of physics are the same it is not necessary that they have the same type of technologies as us. Out technologies developed from our surroundings and requirement to develop material for defence, warmth and food etc. For instance electricity is from our production of metals. Our ability to process metals came from our drive to develop stronger metal based weapons to fight with. Without this early drive for metal refining our current source of electricity for power could well be based on other materials. The exact same argument is posed for fossil fuels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd to this that the presence of fossil fuels is due to the fact we had masses of life on an early planet several hundred million years ago. If Earth did not have masses of forests, ocean life and dinosaurs we would not have fossil fuels, electricity or even the early metal weapons to fight with. From that argument you could suggest that our technology is actually due to the dinosaurs and the late rise of mammals to Earth. Imagine how our technology could have developed without fossil fuels, no oil for heat, no coal for fire to smelt iron or mould copper/brass. This would have limited our war making ability quite severely and also our ability to generate electricity to develop our current technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have statistics on our side due to the number of planets but could the same scenario have developed elsewhere? Early life abundant planet, cataclysmic death of everything allowing the evolution of small mammals whilst providing huge quantities of fossil fuels in order to start technology development in a highly evolved mammal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, although life is almost certainly elsewhere in the universe, and on that basis probably intelligent life also, the age of the universe, the vast distances of the universe and our current limited knowledge of the longevity of species\u0027, we are very unlikely to meet another life form of this type. Of course this is the case unless we develop principles far beyond our current understanding to travel much faster than the speed of light before we succumb to a natural or unnatural disastrous fate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ramblings of a bored physicist with too much time at work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, As above, we just don\u0027t know and the answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T17:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can wax philosophically all day here, but no one will give you answers you look for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E We need more data.
