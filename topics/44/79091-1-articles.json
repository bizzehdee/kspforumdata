First, yes, they are very short events. So you have to happen to look in the right direction. Second, most of the energy output is in gamma, which you can\u0027t see with radio telescope. Or conventional telescope. Or even X-Ray telescope. In fact, one can\u0027t build a gamma ray telescope, because there are no optics that work in the right range. We have equipment to detect gamma bursts, but usually just the general direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that these events have only recently been detected, and some of the facts have only been established this decade, should tell you how challenging it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not going to say that i understand the article completly, some there are some parts of it, i barely can comprehent, but as far i can, we can detect the outcome of such white hole phenomena, but due the distortion of space time, as the acticle say, the transformation of an black-hole to an white hole takes milliseconds, but the distortion of the space/time make the event for the outside observer look like its there for trillion of years.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve misunderstood some of the key points. The distortion, essentially, works to create the delay. It\u0027s the reason the white hole explosion doesn\u0027t happen immediately following the collapse. But the energetic part of the event will take as long as the collapse. That puts it on the same time frame as blitzars. And that\u0027s the same time frame as we see with Lorimer bursts. The duration will be just a few milliseconds, spilling all of the black hole\u0027s energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T11:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I remember reading about shrinking primordial black holes who might then \u0022die\u0022 already in Stephen Hawking (maybe even in \u0022A brief history of time\u0022) ... 2 decades ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, AFAIK he didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t write anything about what becomes of the BHs materia ... this may be the thing that is new (by these 2 scientists)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
