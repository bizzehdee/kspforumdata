This was an absolutely ingenious way to return from the Moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the astronauts lifted off the Moon, they would burn to a trajectory with the periapsis inside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, but not by much. The astronauts would detach their top stage, which was designed like a plane, prior to entering the atmosphere. The trajectory that the astronauts took would have been shallow enough for the plane to leave the atmosphere. However, the plane would use its wings to \u003Cem\u003Ebrute-force itself to remain at altitude\u003C/em\u003E. Once the plane had burned off most of its velocity (which would take almost a full \u0022orbit\u0022 to complete), it would glide in for a landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would reduce the G-forces on the astronauts tremendously: Wernher calculated that the astronauts would experience 2 g\u0027s of centripetal force, which would balance nicely with the 1g of gravitational pull, to give the astronauts about 1g of force. When the G-force dropped back to zero, the astronauts knew that they were at suborbital velocity, and that they could land.
