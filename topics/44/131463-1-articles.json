Initially the film was not to be directed by Christopher Nolan but would instead have been helmed by Steven Spielberg, and as such, the first drafts of the script are much more Spielbergian and \u0027family-friendly\u0027 in nature, with a faster pace and\u00A0increased fantastical elements, such as aliens, evil robots and backwards time travel, and the laws of physics are treated a little more loosely overall. In around 2012, Spielberg left the project and Christopher Nolan was invited to take over (the script was penned by his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan). At this point it\u0027s not clear how much was locked down in the script and how much freedom Nolan had to change things (production was already gearing up so there will have been certain things which were locked in place by the studio; after all, they\u0027ve given the green light to a specific project and don\u0027t want to end up with something wildly different.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that Nolan didn\u0027t have a huge amount of leeway and that certain story points were very much locked in place\u00A0(the dust, the wormhole, the ice planet, sabotage to the Endurance, Amelia separating from Cooper at the end, all of which are present in the 2008 script) so had to make choices more in terms of the technicalities of shooting the film rather than the overall story. As such, you actually get one of the finest examples of \u0027proper film making\u0027 in the last few years; the film is shot almost entirely on 70mm IMAX film at a time when the majority of films are shot on easier to use but inferior in quality digital cameras, as was also projected wherever possible using traditional film projectors. The film pretty much single handedly revived Kodak\u0027s dwindling film stock production line from the dead. Then there\u0027s the fact that the vast majority of spaceship shots in the movie are miniatures or \u0027maxatures\u0027 as they were dubbed in the movie, some of which up to fifty feet long and taking days to film for a single shot in multiple passes (just like the techniques used in \u003Cem\u003E2001\u003C/em\u003E!) Nolan also refused to use green screen at any point, traveled to real locations, built fully enclosed sets lit only by their diegetic lights, etc. etc. He also obviously chose to emphasise realism wherever he could without breaking the bounds of the story which had already been pretty much set in stone. Hence you have beautifully realistic depictions of wormholes and blackholes while the physics of the spacecraft are questionable at best (even if their aesthetic is pretty much spot on)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd talking of long shots from orbit: what about Saturn?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.megabearsfan.net/image.axd/2014/11/Interstellar-Saturn_approach.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Interstellar-Saturn_approach.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the most beautiful scenes depicting the sheer scale of space (much like\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E2001\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0does) in an understated way. You don\u0027t get that sort of grandeur in later sequences because the film is shot in such a subjective way; you are always positioned with the characters. There are very few wide shots detached from the ships and most of the time the camera is crammed into the cockpit with the characters (side note: this is also why the interiors of the ships are so large; there needed to be room for the bulky IMAX cameras and the film crew to move about once the doors were closed, since Nolan didn\u0027t want to disassemble the set and break the sense of space to get the shots he wanted). Because of this subjectivity, we\u0027re experiencing the events as the characters do, and later on (especially the water planet), as the situation becomes more fraught and fast-paced, we\u0027re seeing effectively a series of vignettes heading down to the planet. Nolan\u0027s trying to emphasise how rushed and unprepared they are; we don\u0027t get a long, beautiful establishing shot because the characters are rushing headlong into a situation they know almost nothing about, and have no time to get their bearings. The comparison with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E2001\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0isn\u0027t really fair because they\u0027re two films trying to achieve different things and have very different tones by design. It\u0027s like saying all films should be shot in one take because\u00A0\u003Ci\u003EBirman\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0was shot in one take and it worked there so why don\u0027t they use it in everything else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd can we just put to rest this idea that CGI is somehow cheap? It\u0027s a complete falsehood. You\u0027ll have hundreds of people working on a show for months or years at a time (\u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EVFX people were involved from pre-production; I\u0027ve actually had the pleasure of talking to the guy who was technical supervisor on the waves scene and he stressed the importance Nolan places on having pretty much all the VFX prepped\u00A0before shooting even begins) and the price is increased by the studio covering costs of software licenses (Maya is not cheap), computers capable of rendering out video high enough resolution for IMAX prints, and R\u0026amp;D. These costs are increased even more when you have to write an entirely new rendering software specifically for one film in order to accurately depict gravitational lensing combined with super-high-res physical simulations. CGI is only ever cheap if it\u0027s rushed and low quality, which\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EInterstellar\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0isn\u0027t by any stretch of the imagination. And AFAIK \u0027toning down\u0027 the black hole simulation didn\u0027t make it any less complex, it\u0027s just as high fidelity, it just meant they reduced the amount of turbulence in the accretion disk. So the CG in that shot is just as expensive as it would have been if they\u0027d stuck with their original.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T17:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222397706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131463\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454849638\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145429\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022A35K\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, A35K said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot about Edmund\u0027s planet, but is it possible to have \u0027solid clouds\u0027 like Dr. Mann\u0027s planet?

I know gravity changes time pace, but it seems like the tsunami could\u0027ve been easily avoided. I also noticed that the water was really shallow on the water planet, which seems like it would keep a tsunami from forming more than a few feet tall. Plus, it seems like on landing you would\u0027ve been able to see at least one tsunami while entering the atmosphere, because tsunamis have more waves behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tCSDMz8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tCSDMz8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A35K","CreatedById":145429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T16:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I didn\u0027t get about the tsunami is HOW WERE THEY NOT EXPECTING IT???
