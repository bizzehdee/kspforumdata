cleaning debris altitudes. \u00A0I wonder what altitudes most of the current debri orbits at. \u00A0I\u0027m sure all\u00A0of it slowly changes to a more elliptical orbit due to irregularities in Earth\u0027s density and would eventually starts hitting thicker atmosphere, but might be so slow that it\u0027s negligible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps they could put boost it to a grave yard orbit and operate it remotely. \u00A0No human crew, only a remotely operated robot. \u00A0They could even put a monorail of some sort through the ISS to allow the robot straightforward movement. \u00A0It would cost more to send resupply missions to the higher orbit, but hopefully that would be offset by how rarely you\u0027d send a resupply. \u00A0You wouldn\u0027t need to send food or drinking water. \u00A0Assuming you are now outside of the atmosphere completely, not more need for propellant (8,000 lbs of propellant a year is what I believe is currently needed for reboosts!)\u00A0 Probably there are certain things needed to keep the station operational. \u00A0It leaks air, and you\u0027d probably want to maintain a certain amount of atmosphere inside the cabin to support cooling electronics, but you could probably have a lower pressure and thus decrease the leak rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there\u0027s lots of other issues at a higher orbit.

fast. That is not possible with the ISS unless you do an inclination change and add more boosters. The ISS can\u0027t handle interplanetary radiation levels, and the van allen belt is 3 orders of magnitude more intense.\u00A0And just look at how sharply the van alen belts ramp up, the blue is orders of magnitude less than the red;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(First image is outer belts only)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Earth_Plasma_Shield_686x632.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://astronomynow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Earth_Plasma_Shield_686x632.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225ffef1c38a1c38a3ef000ff45f5b07e1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5f/fe/f1/5ffef1c38a1c38a3ef000ff45f5b07e1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigher orbit also means more debris, and a longer lasing impact if the ISS is hit and fragments.
