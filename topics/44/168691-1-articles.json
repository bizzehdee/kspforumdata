In my original situation I\u0027m in the precise space vacuum so there is nothing to drag the rope back. As long as the rope is in vacuum it should hang perpendicular to the ship pointing at the center of the earth.

Most places high up are very cold.\u00A0I don\u0027t know how big these high temperature areas are or widespread. I don\u0027t think they belong in this problem because they aren\u0027t uniform and they don\u0027t have much to do with gravity, vacuums and orbits.

Even though the temperature is technically very high, you are almost perfectly insulated by a vacuum and so it\u0027s effectively very cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCounter-intuitive, I know, but it\u0027s the same principle as someone dipping his hand in water and then dunking it in molten lead. The water boils and expands so fast that it holds the molten lead away from your hand, so the\u00A0heat cannot be transferred to you. Similarly, the gas molecules in the thermosphere have a LOT of kinetic energy due to solar radiation, but there is so much space between molecules that very little of that kinetic energy is transferred to objects as heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the lack of heat transfer goes both ways. We say it\u0027s \u0022cold\u0022 in space because objects lose thermal energy\u00A0by blackbody radiation faster than they gain thermal energy by collisions with gas molecules, but it isn\u0027t cold in the sense that objects in space instantly freeze. If you step into a freezer, you feel cold because your body begins losing thermal energy to the frigid air, but there aren\u0027t enough molecules in space to lose energy to, so you don\u0027t gain energy or lose energy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObjects that produce their own internal heat, like the ISS and the astronauts it contains, are so well-insulated by vacuum that they will rapidly overheat if radiators are not used to radiate away that thermal energy in the form of blackbody radiation. The rate of heat transfer by blackbody radiation depends on the emissivity of the material and the material\u0027s surface area, which is why big thin metal panels are so great at radiating away heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, ships heat up as they reenter but that\u0027s because of friction with atmosphere the result of an object hitting something at high speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlightly pedantic, I suppose, but ships heat up not due to friction but due to compression. When you compress an ideal gas, its temperature increases, because you have the same amount of thermal energy packed into a smaller volume. A re-entering spacecraft is traveling so fast that the air cannot get out of the way, so it is compressed. The air is compressed so rapidly and thoroughly that the kinetic energy of the molecules exceeds their ionization energies, causing them to flash into plasma. As tongues of plasma come into contact with the surface, they transfer their heat to that surface by a combination of conduction and radiation, eating away at it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern heat shields are typically phenol-impregnated carbon. Phenol is a volatile organic compound (responsible, incidentally, for the unique flavor present in Islay scotch) that is stable to reasonably high temperatures and then rapidly evaporates. The heat transferred by the re-entry plasma causes the phenol to evaporate, bleeding into a boundary layer that insulates the shield, not unlike the water on a person\u0027s hand boils away and insulates them from the molten lead in the example above. The carbon shield underneath doesn\u0027t really burn as much as it just slowly bakes in the radiated heat from the plasma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-20T11:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223247912\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168691\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513693470\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298447\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, YNM said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Does the rope stays \u0022magically\u0022 straight ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat part actually isn\u0027t a problem.

The rope would have to be slacked out and then slowly pulled back otherwise the impact energy would cause it to pull the rope over the ship and slam back into the atmosphere.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-22T11:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nive always wondered if airfoils would function at such high velocities. if a bit of down force could be generated to hold the \u0027rope\u0027 in the atmosphere long enough for drag to bring the whole ship into the atmosphere. would need to be a hypersonic wing design, possibly just a peice of wood out of one of the seats (they wouldnt use wood but lets say this spacecraft is made by ikea) wittled into a triangular shape with a bit of a curve on one side to form a crude delta wing, with maybe a couple stabilizer fins glued on. and then through some feat of engineering the precise center of lift on\u00A0the foil is found and attached to said \u0022rope\u0022. fishing boats use something similar to improve stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-22T11:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2017 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-22T11:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly I am thinking about feasibility of space elevator \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-22T13:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne does not simply \u0022hang things\u0022 in orbit. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone Remember that shuttle mission where they attempted to generate electricity using a tether?

There\u0027s no thin upper one and thick lower one. The atmosphere extend upwards and blends with space medium, making the question of thick and thin layer kinda not making any sense\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.Reentry does not work that way. You are in highspeed free fall state while in orbit, so when you are entering atmosphere, you did it at speed so high that the air molecules in front of the capsule doesn\u0027t have enough time to displace and thus being compressed. This compression generates heat so high that the air turns into plasma, which is what becomes a hazard to your craft. Sticking something outside your capsule, even if you are in orbit and it touches the atmosphere, won\u0027t even make it on fire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. You cannot hang something on space. The rope that being hanged outside won\u0027t stay straight downwards towards the planet. Remember, you are in orbit, you still have orbital velocity, that does not mean your craft stay static and any stuff you throw outside will drop straight downwards. The rope would be trailing behind your craft. And even if you attach makeshift \u0022parachute\u0022, it won\u0027t work since you are in orbit, there are not enough gases to slow your craft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume that \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E thinks that atmosphere is like water where there\u0027s a clear boundary between water and air above, and thinks as if you are on a hovering vehicle that cannot stop, so you throw a makeshift parachute into water and let the water slow the craft, pulling the vehicle towards water surface where friction can slow it down to a dead stop. Unfortunately, real life atmosphere does not work that way\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
