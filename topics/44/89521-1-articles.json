The Galilean satellites are ellipsoidal in shape, due to having planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter\u0027s rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remainder of Jupiter\u0027s moons are irregular satellites, whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities.

[6] They include the seven major satellites, four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of Saturn\u0027s F Ring. Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn\u0027s rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn.[7] \u003Cstrong\u003EThus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn\u0027s ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons.
