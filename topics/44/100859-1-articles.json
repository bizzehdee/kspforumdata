What can give it an advantage in some situations is that it includes some of it\u0027s own oxygen, but that doesn\u0027t help you much in a rocketry situation as you\u0027re providing your own oxidiser anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T15:51:53Z","Content":"Well I was lied to\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWhat about metallic hydrogen?"},{"CreatedByName":"Neywiny","CreatedById":65808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T15:53:24Z","Content":"Wikipedia says: \u0022 It is a slightly viscous, highly polar liquid commonly used as a solvent in a variety of industrial applications such as in extractions, as a reaction medium, and as a cleaning solvent. As an intermediate in organic synthesis, it is used widely in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, explosives, fibers, and coatings.\u0022 there is the one big problem which s that if it\u0027s used as a solvent, storing it will be harder, and also if it\u0027s \u0022slightly viscous\u0022 the flow rates would drop preventing large amount of it to be burned quickly, so maybe as an upper stage but a first stage engine would require too much of it to store and keep flowing. On the other hand, it requires less oxidizer (can be used as a monop and is already used for rocket/engine applications so storing and pumping must already be figured out. There was a combustion velocity measured at .5 m/x vs lox/lh2 at 2,435 m/s, but I don\u0027t think they are measuring the same thing, and carbon monoxide is produced through nitromethane\u0027s combustion, which is a poison that can lead to harmful testing at full rocket capacity. Also it\u0027s a high explosive, meaning that it\u0027s dangerous to transport."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T16:01:45Z","Content":"For nitromethane or metallic hydrogen"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T16:45:01Z","Content":"Metallic hydrogen hasn\u0027t been made yet, and we don\u0027t know if it exhibits metastability that may make it usable as a rocket fuel. \n\nIf it turns out to exist and be usable as a rocket fuel, it\u0027s energy density and pure hydrogen exhaust give it an isp high enough to completely change spaceflight. \n\nNitromethane is just another of thousands of chemicals that could be used as rocket fuel but dont have any advantages over existing fuels."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T18:38:29Z","Content":"Nitromethane was a reasonable suggestion, if not that useful in practice compared to other fuels.

That\u0027s a huge if, though. So far, none of the experiments that have claimed brief existence of metallic hydrogen have been capable to test any of its properties. So while there is some theoretical indication that it may be possible, there have been no experimental confirmation.\n\nNitromethane wouldn\u0027t give you great performance as a rocket fuel. There are far better rocket fuels available if you plant to launch something into space. But it might be a pretty good fuel for a hobby rocket with liquid fuel engine for a lot of the same reasons that make it a pretty good fuel for RC models."},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T03:43:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If it turns out to exist and be usable as a rocket fuel, it\u0027s energy density and pure hydrogen exhaust give it an isp high enough to completely change spaceflight.\n\nHow is metallic hydrogen supposed to be used without oxidizer?

Depending on the properties of the stuff and how easily we can manufacture it in bulk, spaceflight might become almost as cheap and routine as air travel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T10:11:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrewas**"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T10:08:07Z","Content":"Depending on the properties, it might make sense to use it as a very fuel-rich hybrid, using the ox flow for throttling.
