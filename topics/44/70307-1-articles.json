There are obviously plenty of difficulties with the concept, of course. A particular question I have is how large does the difficulty of getting a ring of any sizable diameter onto a rocket loom in these considerations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, fitting a ring space station with a diameter of 100 meters would be quite challenging, consider that the diameter of a Saturn V is only 10 meters. So, of course, it would have to be shipped up in segments, which is also difficult, since the segments would be, themselves curved. But, how important is this concern, when compared to other issues in creating such systems? Is it just a minor hiccup, fairly far down on the list of challenges, or is it a major roadblock?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T04:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurved segments are no problem.

It would be likely, after all, that it would be tested in orbit, rather than on a voyage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my basic idea, for what its worth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture a cylinder, cut into segments at alternating biases, so that each segment is a wedge (the larger the ring, the smaller the angle). After being placed into orbit, the individual segments would rotate along the biases so that the former cylinder is a portion (or, depending on its total length and the angle of the cuts, the entirety) of a ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough its a two dimensional comparison, imagine a pizza cut into slices as the final product. While in transit, the slices would be alternating in their directions, laid out next to each other: the crust of one slice out on one side, the crust of the next on the opposite, so that they form one long line of slices, rather than a complete pie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I think this is a fairly elegant solution to storage, since storage and transportation is likely one of the smaller concerns, I doubt it would be much use overall.
