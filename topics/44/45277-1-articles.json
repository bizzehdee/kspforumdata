You would have picked up speed as you descended. The core of the planet is the point at which the mass on either side of you is equal so passing it gravity effectively reverses. As you go up, gravitational acceleration increases and so does your rate of decelleration. You would basically get almost to the other side, only to be pulled back.

If the Earth was a uniform density of mass throughout, then the moment you drop below the surface you start weighing less because some of the mass is above you. BUT, actual Earth is not evenly distributed. The mass is a lot denser at the core than on the surface. This makes it so that you do actually get heavier as you go down for a little bit, because the effect of being closer to the dense core (smaller \u0027r\u0027 in the gravity equation) is larger than the effect of having some of the less dense mass of the crust now above your head. The boundary where your weight stops increasing and starts decreasing as you descend is actually down near the bottom of the Earth\u0027s crust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough once you start taking that into account you have to also take into account other inconvenient things like the molten mantle.
