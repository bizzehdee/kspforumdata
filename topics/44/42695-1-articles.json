Whereas in reality the atmospher is spread out in a very gradual fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a general barrier based on that criteria, a point bellow which debris can\u0027t hang around for long because the atmospheric drag is just too much. In fact I think the ISS could almost fall under this criteria, since it does loose it\u0027s orbit slowly over time. But since it orbits 16 times a day and it takes over a year for it to drop 100 km, I think we can call it roughly stable. But yeah, is there a point in the atmosphere where debris can\u0027t survive for more than... 50 orbits?
