Let\u0027s see:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1.)\u003C/strong\u003E is an elaborate publicity stunt by a single person who felt needy for attention. Literally everyone wanted in on this alleged supermaterial, but when it came down to actually licensing and reproducing the technology, the guy refused - for obvious reasons, if you ask me. He never had anything to sell in the first place. This isn\u0027t a \u0022lost technology\u0022, this is a work of fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2.)\u003C/strong\u003E was allegedly created by a highschool dropout. Even if he had possessed an unusual spark of genius, it seems awfully strange that the device hasn\u0027t been replicated**. Consider that today, we have automotive engineers employing software to cheat government emission tests because there is absolutely no way that the fuel efficiency and emission targets that are demanded of them can be achieved while keeping inside the cost envelope demanded of them. If this alleged \u0022filter\u0022 allowed multiplying a car\u0027s mileage by 8 even in its simplest form - which apparently didn\u0027t need any sort of complex equipment or materials to construct - then multi-billion dollar car companies would have been using this forever. The conspiracy theory that the inventor was somehow assassinated by the oil industry completely fails to acknowledge that there are other entities, with just as much power and money, who would have benefitted to such immense magnitude from this technology that they\u0027d have lapped this up like a dog encountering a spill of peanut butter. But that, of course, doesn\u0027t fit the story. Because that\u0027s all this is: not a \u0022lost technology\u0022, but rather a work of fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(** But what am I saying, it \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E been replicated.

This isn\u0027t a \u0022lost technology\u0022, this is a work of fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4.)\u003C/strong\u003E exists today. It\u0027s called a mass driver/coilgun/railgun. It also works a lot differently than Tesla imagined, because he never got around to actually experimenting on it and figuring out the pitfalls in trying to accellerate matter to relativistic speeds inside an atmosphere - such as the way said matter tends to spontaneously undergo nuclear fusion with the air molecules it encounters, if it moves fast enough. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe very first XKCD What If\u003C/a\u003E deals with precisely this phenomenon, and the resulting effect on the \u0022weapon\u0022 that fires the stuff. And everything around it, if you catch my drift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words: not a \u0022lost technology\u0022 either. More of an early paper concept produced ignorant of several physical realities, but which nevertheless served to inform later developments in similar (and more practical) directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5.)\u003C/strong\u003E is a curious case. The guy really did die from a heart attack just one day before signing a deal that would have made him rich, that much is proven. The problem with the story? He was running a software company. Like, literally, a \u003Cem\u003Ecompany\u003C/em\u003E. It had a CEO and employees and everything. But did any of them actually work on this coding system? Nope. None of them did. In fact, none of them ever saw it. Sloot claimed that in the event of his death, he had a copy of the software stored in a safe deposit box at a bank. However, as it turned out after his death, no such thing had ever existed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also be kept in mind that it\u0027s very much possible to produce extremely small software when needed. For example, there are programming competitions which center around producing videos, tech demos or even \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_4K_Game_Programming_Contest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eentire games\u003C/a\u003E within the confines of 4096 bytes (or similar sizes). However, each of these is custom-written - they are small because smart people hand-tweaked this particular thing to fit into that size. There\u0027s no algorithm that can do it for just anything. As such, it is not difficult to believe that what Sloot actually produced was vaporware, assisted with a few hand-crafted demos that were much smaller than the (generally clueless) audience thought possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, he ran an elaborate computer software scam and likely planned to abscond with the money, like many others before him and after him. It\u0027s just my conjecture, but maybe it was the extreme stress on the eve of the grand finale of his game that did him in? Who knows. But regardless: this isn\u0027t a \u0022lost technology\u0022, this is a work of fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome on now, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152800-spaceception/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152800\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/152800-spaceception/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spaceception\u003C/a\u003E - you can surely do better than to fall for cheap clickbait videos like this one? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T11:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222630131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141747\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465890486\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome on now, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152800-spaceception/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152800\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/152800-spaceception/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@Spaceception\u003C/a\u003E - you can surely do better than to fall for cheap clickbait videos like this one? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it would be a cool video to show you guys \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I didn\u0027t think it would be fake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T11:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecialy the fuel thing sounds like a fake, since it would stand against the laws of thermodynamics.

When you place these metals in a vacuum, the patina wants to go back into the vacuum but lack the kinetic energy to do so, it you distarge a high voltage they gain the energy and colored discharge occurs, ussually a avocado green color is a mixturs of several gases.

While\u00A0the amps would not be that great the type of power being produced would be simply dangerous. The second problem is that while in a vacuum everything works great, if you\u00A0trash through a chamber at 4000 miles per hour your chamber wont be\u00A0a vacuum chamber, so that you would have to have a high speed aperture that closes behind the projectile, one in front that opens after the projectile leaves closes again, evacuates, then\u00A0the interior aperature reopens.
