How to make or design an uber magnet \u00A0that won\u0027t tear itself apart under constant operation (they break in mere moments nowadays)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. How to design a fuel source that has a high enough power withought\u00A0being too heavy to lift off the ground for flight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Partially solved. How to manipulate electomagnetic fields so that air is repelled below the \u00A0the ship, generating lift? We akready have magneto aerodynamic lifters on the books, just nothing much designed yet, but at least the physics does not say no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtreme possibility of possible realistic scifi use in the future?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA donut shaped \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with two rear rocket nozzles at one end. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E is acomplished by ionizing the air around the shlp and repelling it downward while the ship lifts up.\u00A0Expect a light show, lots of lightning, maybe even a scifi looking shield made of ionized plasma emitting from the hull of the ship. Maybe even an artificial aurora borealis... who knows? Point is, with a powerful enough magnetic fields and precise control, along with a way to ionize surrounding air, you can \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E anywhere there is sufficient atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce air gets too thin you switch to rocketry for orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPros: Any planet with an atmosphere you can \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E without expending propellant. Also with precise control over the magnetic field and ionized air interaction, you could use it to literally thrust vector in ANY direction you want, since the air is your reaction mass and the engine is rhe magnetic fields emanating from the ship while the fuel is the power source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons: Do not try landing on the moon unless your ship is equipped with beefy landing thrusters and propellant to match. Also do not engage fighter jets scifi style in the air on earth while using the magnetic lift propulsion. You would likely lose... hard. Since every bullet and missile shot in your direction... if ferromagnetic at all... wouls ruin your day once it got near you. It would\u0027nt likely miss. Also because of\u00A0ionization, your ship is literally leaving\u00A0an ozone trail in the atmosphere in it\u0027s wake, but that would fade in time so long\u00A0you did\u0027nt go crazy with thousands of mag lifters flying everyday continuously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may discuss.
