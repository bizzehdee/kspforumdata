The kessler effect from all that debris left behind moving at orbital speed would prevent any kind of subsequent space travel in the future for all sides, and war would just have to continue on the ground in the end. Interplanetary war, however, might be different. I imagine there would be little spacecraft-to-spacecraft battles due to difficulty of detecting and catching up with spacecraft moving in space as a lot of people has already mentioned. It would just be mostly spacecraft dropping things (likely huge kinetic payload like an asteroid or an artificial one, which is both hard to destroy when intercepted, and the fragments when destroyed still pose a threat) from orbit to hit planetary targets. And due to the speed involved, neither side will have complete protection from the other\u0027s attack.
