Appetizing, who knows, but edible yes. But, if Mars was green, we also have to consider the fact that it would also have animal life as well. Its unlikely I think that a planet would never evolve animal life but still have plenty of vegetation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T20:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe we would have a big, sophisticated space station in orbit - serving as a space dock. refueling station etc. And fully developed nuclear propulsion technology.
