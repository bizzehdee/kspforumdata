Namely that the risk of terrorism or destablizing military applications was too great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even if it was otherwise practical for someone like Google to set up a company only use teleport-net, they would not be allowed to (or at least it would require a hell of a lot of money) so that the government could definitely provide oversight on the use of the system. It would likely have checkups like at least two locations in the US would be \u0022Teleport Control\u0022 where a man at the station to transmit, another at the station to receive, and someone at the massively protected \u0022Teleport Control\u0022 Would all need to provide input to allow a transport to occur. This, while a little cumbersome, is still better than air travel is today and largely protects against misuse by non-state actors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally one thing that is rarely brought up when discussing teleportation seriously, but is presented in a great deal of sci-fi (I get that it\u0027s sci-fi, but so is/was teleportation, so hear me out) is that what we end up using as teleportation does not strictly require the dissection of an object at the atomic level. An example: Lets say in our quest to figure out more about wormholes that we discover how to cheaply make \u0022short range\u0022 wormholes. Enough to get around the Earth with only 2-3 stops. But making them arbitrarily large is just stupidly hard. So our teleportation is just opening up one of these wormholes and stepping through. At no point is it possible for a system to arbitrarily declare that it is not going to let through a given aspect (such as the cigars, or a nuclear weapon, etc.). Now, to be fair, our current attempts at teleportation do generally speaking require the sort of knowledge that I just mentioned.
