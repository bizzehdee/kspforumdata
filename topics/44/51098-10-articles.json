The second people hear it they start running and screaming, thinking their faces are going to melt off and that the planet will be irradiated to hell. That, and the fact that people think a reactor is just a bomb in a facility that churns out power, and if someone flicks the wrong switch, then you have another Hiroshima, or Nagasaki. Which is of course, completely wrong. (It would take a lot of flicks of the wrong switches, coupled with incompetence, and basic human stupidity, along with a Homer Simpson styled mentality.) While I can understand the argument against N power through the waste perspective, if we were to manage to work with it more efficiently, and more cleverly, that argument would be null and void also. Fusion is cleaner, to the point that it just irradiates the reactor to hell, rather than leaving around \u003Cem\u003Emostly\u003C/em\u003E spent fuel rods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour general tone is right, but let me correct some of the things you\u0027ve stated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, no amount of switching switches, stupid Homers and incompetence can turn a nuclear power plant into a nuclear bomb.

The worst case scenario with Western second generation reactors (standard containment, negative void coefficient, etc.) is what happened in Fukushima 1 power plant, and that\u0027s waaaaaay less worse than what happened in Chernobyl. Mind that Fukushima was rocked by a stupidly powerful earthquake and covered with like 15 m tsunami wave, which is quite frankly the worst realistic thing that could happen to a power plant, aside from getting bombed by an atomic weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically speaking, an usual Western PWR, situated on a lake or a river, has the worst case scenario of Three Mile Island: partial core collapse and controlled release of radionuclides through the stack.
