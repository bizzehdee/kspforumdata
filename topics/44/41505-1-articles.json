Because of KSP, over the last couple months I\u0027ve read several books on the space program, watched documentaries, perused countless Wikipedia articles, become a daily visitor to Space.com, started playing Orbiter, stood outside with my 6 year old daughter finding constellations and watching the ISS fly overhead: in short dived in with my usual enthusiasm for subjects I\u0027m interested in, but know little about.

I still couldn\u0027t handle the maths behind most of this.
