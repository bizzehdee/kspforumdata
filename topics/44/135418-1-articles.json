So let me specify, when I say a homenade rocket motor I mean more or less 100 gram of powdered KNO3-Sugar propellent stuffed into a\u00A05 inch long PVC\u00A0(dia 1/2 inch). I live in Bangladesh so everything is very much expensive and there is no such thing as readily available rocket motors. So I have to build everything from scratch. However I experimented with it before and I know the dangers. Apart from that experimenting with motors is very time consuming plus expensive and I am now giving attention to the airframe. So I need someone to tell me at least a rough estimation of nozzle throat so that it has enough thrust to lift itself off the ground rather becoming a stationary flair so that\u00A0I can proceed with experimenting the body tube framing.
