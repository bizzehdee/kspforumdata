Humans need a long laundry list of elements and compounds to survive, and those simply don\u0027t exist on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Humans live as a part of a mind-bogglingly huge and intricate biosphere, and a suitably sized *complete* biosphere must be transported there in order to sustain even a small human presence. Until it\u0027s self- sustaining, we\u0027re talking about an outpost, not a colony. As long as it\u0027s an outpost, it\u0027s a liability rather than an asset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Moreover, as long as there are no marketable commodities on Mars, there\u0027s no fiscal basis for supporting a colony there. NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and all the rest are left on the hook to spend their budgets supporting a colony on a far away planet that provides nothing instead of using their funding for science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This is not a trivial matter. The top of Mt. Everest is a far more habitable place than the surface of Mars, yet nobody lives up there because there\u0027s no benefit to it. People spend a lot of money and effort to visit... but they don\u0027t establish a settlement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Musk hasn\u0027t given serious thought to any of this, but hey... it\u0027s his money so what the heck. *shrug*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, since this is addressed to me, I shall try to dissect this argument. First off, the compounds. There\u0027s literally nothing stopping Mars from recycling these compounds once they\u0027re here. There\u0027s also nothing really stopping you from synthesizing them, as long as you have the ingredients and equipment, both of which could be shipped, and the ingredients don\u0027t necessarily have to even come from Mars. A lot of them actually could come from inorganic compounds. Admittedly, chemistry is one of my weak points, so I\u0027ll accept that I\u0027m probably wrong on a bit, and that you should take this with grains of salt. I\u0027m only making generalizations based on what I remember from a 2 semester high school class I had from 2 years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, biosphere. What is absolutely essential in a biosphere? Water and an energy source, usually some form of sugar.\u00A0Oxygen is optional, but appreciated by most living organisms. Water is probably the trickiest one, and thankfully, accessible! Not only would the polar caps have water too, on top of CO2, but its been hypothesized (and I believe is currently being tested for) that there is subsurface water. This would mean that one of the biggest requirements is out of the way. You can synthesize oxygen out of the water as needed, but more than likely you\u0027re going to keep the same oxygen in your bases, and in an emergency, are going to resort to hauling some dry ice to scrub. That leaves energy, which can simply be recycled compounds. This is even just relying on what we have now, so no doubt this\u0027ll get greatly improved as technology invented solely because of Mars habitation occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is a doozie. Let\u0027s be polite, and suggest they aren\u0027t going to separate from our government and make their own medical advancements and other things they could trade. What do they have that we don\u0027t? Well, for starters, Mars is very close to the asteroid belt. Perfect, Mars now has a mining industry that is unparalleled to Earth\u0027s. Even if they focused on ONE asteroid, an asteroid like 16 Psyche could be used to fund a tonne\u00A0of things. Given Mars has a gravity field, it also helps avoid one of the biggest problem of space living:decaying muscular structures. But wait, it\u0027s too expensive to reliably bring materials back from an asteroid to Earth... sounds like an excuse for factories to me. Its also a lot easier to take off from Mars than it is to take off from Earth, adding to viability for mining and manufacturing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, let\u0027s address Mt. EVEREST. You\u0027re kidding. That was your counter? Jeff Bezo\u0027s counter too? First, have you TRIED to find an area flat enough for a nice, cozy home? Mars has way more real estate than Everest ever will, and thats before landscaping. Than let\u0027s address the cold, the thing atmosphere... so what, you\u0027re gonna build a pressurized pod in the mountains because you couldn\u0027t make a dome or something?

I can\u0027t say that I agree with all of it, but its definitely well more thought out than a certain billionaire who hasn\u0027t even gotten a single orbit has ever put into a space plan. Also, none of this addresses potential technologies we can\u0027t even dream of, which appear as a result of necessity on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027m writing this someone responded to me.

But hey, you know what, great idea! If it wasn\u0027t for the heat, I think this would be the perfect place to test that kind of equipment!

The only thing Mars has going for it is solid ground under your feet, and that\u0027s overrated. Especially, when that ground is irradiated, chemically toxic, and abrasive for a good measure. Almost total lack of atmosphere and radiation protection means that the only possible living on Mars is in small, stuffy tunnels underground. Not sure what will limit your life span on Mars more, constant stress over maintaining all the air seals in confined space or the effects of low gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus gives you almost a full Earth gravity and temperatures just above freezing at altitudes where atmospheric pressure is close to Earth\u0027s. The atmosphere\u0027s not breathable and toxic if you inhale it directly, but it\u0027s there, meaning that even if you lost pressure, you could hold your breath and have a couple of minutes. And since the pressure in habitat is pretty much equal to outside pressure, you can build large clear domes out of plastic really easily. No need to be stuffed in a tiny tube with no windows. Plus, small leaks are effectively harmless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars has such thin atmosphere that CO2 capture is actually somewhat of a challenge there, especially given the fine dust that will damage and clog any turbines you build to compress it. And carbon is the easy part. Water is present pretty much only as ice, and you have to dig through aforementioned toxic dirt to get to it. Good luck getting nitrogen. All of this makes manufacturing on Mars actually very, very difficult. You are in luck with a lot of metals, but getting them out of soil is going to be a complex process requiring very significant infrastructure. Prospects of more conventional mining are unclear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenusian atmosphere is basically giving you all the building blocks of hydrocarbons. The CO2 and nitrogen are readily available for capture. The atmosphere is often quoted as very dry, but that\u0027s because all the water is bound in sulfuric acid droplets. If you account for that, Venus is actually quote moist. At relevant altitudes, the sulfuric acid content can reach 0.1g/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which is comparable to typical moisture content of dense fog. The sulfuric acid is trivially decomposed into sulfur oxides and water vapor at temperatures of a few hundred Celsius. And because all of this is taking place at high altitude, you don\u0027t have to worry about solids damaging your condensers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only disadvantage of Venus in terms of long term sustainability is access to heavy elements. Early on, any colony will have to be good at recycling. I would argue that recycling metals is a lot easier than recycling organics, making it easier to build an outpost on Venus that can be self-sustaining for years or decades. To make it properly lasting, you would have to come up with some sort of a scheme for mining. Whether it would involve dropping scoops on the surface or some other arrangement. This is entirely feasible if you have a healthy industry and large population. And the fact that the colony can grow with just minimal supplies of minerals from off world initially is already a huge advantage, which means we have an actual chance to expand a Venusian colony to self-sustaining levels, whereas a Martian colony would rely entirely on off world supplies for a very long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the day, we might end up bothering with neither, sticking to building in space instead. But either way, trying to build a colony on Mars before Venus is entirely silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-06T11:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224000266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625521217\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111526\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, GoSlash27 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nswjr-swis,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0No, not at all.
