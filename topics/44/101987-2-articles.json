Beyond the Ln part, it\u0027s all basic math.\n\nSorry to go off on a tangent here. But nuclear thermal rockets only hit high ISP values because their exhaust gasses are so light. It is true that you get roughly 1k ISP when you use liquid hydrogen, but this comes at a price. Reaction mass like Liquid hydrogen and ammonia are so ridiculously low density that you need very large tanks to get good dV. Very large tanks means a lot of added structural mass and insulation mass. This means that the increase in dV from switching to nuclear thermal is much less than you\u0027d expect. ISP goes up, but mass fraction goes down.\n\nTry it out in KSP for yourself. If you install the Realfuels mod you\u0027ll notice that the NERVA is not nearly as OP as it is in stock.
