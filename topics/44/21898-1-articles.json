I have gotten space craft to go very fast (over 100,000 meters per second) I find the physics controller breaks around that speed and the rocket becomes uncontrollable. I don\u0027t think they can make the light speed infinite strictly speaking what you are saying is they display the light independent of the crafts speed. in other words it simply is. The graphics engine simply draws the light the same no matter the speed of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T04:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I know I am going to do once I get all the nuts and bolts put together in my mind, is put all the math info that is already on this forum into one coherent organized post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T15:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShips flying apart at high speed is the \u0022Kraken\u0022 and should be fixed in 0.17. As for the speed of light, I highly doubt that\u0027s modelled at all. Light effects are handled by the engine, and they are anything but something that resembles light rays. (That would require ray-drawing graphics. However while hyper-realistic and relatively fast compared to current raster-based graphics, require custom build GPU architecture, which at least partially explains why it hasn been widely adopted.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for accurate drag, I\u0027m not sure but I don\u0027t think that part of the engine is complete. The current system is quite basic. That said, maybe it can be expanded later to base behaviour at least partially on an object\u0027s mesh. Anything that does that though will be a loose approximation at best. Accurate fluid simulations require immense amounts of computing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything that resembles relativity will probably be kludge-like in nature. As a computer simulation, the space that KSP takes place in is Euclidian, though things are almost certainly complicated beyond my paltry explaination here by KSP\u0027s scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-11T15:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2012 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
