Not the new space capsule, but the idea of using nuclear bombs to propell spacecraft.\n\nThere is a mod for it in ksp that was released a while back\n\n![triOrion01.jpg](http://i816.photobucket.com/albums/zz85/winchellchung/triOrion01.jpg)\n\nAnyway, I renember when I first found out about it, I came up with an idea for some sort of sci-fi explosive manoeuvring system using conventional explosives that would be used on space fighter craft. The idea being it could be used to for a sudden boost in acceleration to dodge things like missiles.\n\nI was actually about to do some concept art to post here when it occurred to me, how does an explosion push the spacecraft? There\u0027s no shockwave since it\u0027s in space, but somehow it must work for nuclear explosives.\n\nAnyone got any idea?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T20:35:42Z","Content":"Orion doesnt just use nukes, it uses \u0022shaped charge\u0022 nukes that deliver 50% of the explosive power of an atomic bomb in a relatively narrow beam. This beam is an extremely dense particle beam that bounces off the plate to push the craft foreward.\n\nThe problem with doing this with conventional explosives is that it suks. You\u0027\u0027re losing 50% of your potential thrust, that would be better spent in a rocket. The reason it works for nukes is because it\u0027s the -only- way to use high-supercritical fission (as opposed to controlled supercriticality, like NERVA) without blowing yourself apart- all the efficency is in the fuel, not the drive."},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T20:45:36Z","Content":"I see.

An atom bomb consist of nuclear active material which has a certain mass. The explosion occurs if you go beyond a certain critical mass. A bomb consists of multiple masses which are spatially split. If you want to make it detonate you fire up little bombs which smash all the masses together. The matter does not annihilate like when using antimatter. Only a small fraction of the mass is converted to energy. This energy heats up the \u0022reaction mass\u0022 which reaches the hottest state of matter. A plasma! You may know that heat is nothing but movement of the particles. This insane plasma heat creates an enourmous pressure on the plasma which expands in all directions. You can shape the nuclear bomb (shape charge) in a way so the plasma does not expand in all direction but mostly two. To the front and to the back. 50% of the plasma smashes into your absorber while the other 50% are gone.\n\nThe stresses of the sudden acceleration would be too much I guess on a plane. A plane looks sturdy but it\u0027s really just paper. It has to be as light as possible! A full turn using their joystick would allready be too much at high speeds. This means they can\u0027t turn more quickly than they allready can due to structural limitations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T21:10:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalEssences**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T21:10:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see.

I think perhaps more what PB666 was getting at was that it would be absurd to make one that small to fit on a vehicle the size of a fighter, like trying to put a nuclear powerplant of the sort on aircraft carriers into a wristwatch. It is not about economic efficiency, but technological efficiency. Even the US military cares about doing things well.\n\n@Rakaydos: Of course, at that point you need not worry about armament, only armor and acceleration.

No need to launch a weather satellite with a nuclear bombs, definitely you would not win a popularity contest and probably instantly become public enemy #1.\n\nBut even moreso, if you had say a VCF sized ship you could make a bowl at one end and detonate the bomb and the focal point of the bowl, it would be more efficient. But if you tried to do the same on the booster engine of a saturn-V rocket, you would simply blow off the engine and the other 4 engines, and the end of the rocket. \n\nThis was getting at something I mentioned in the other thread.\n\nThe types of reactions that will generate the most energy per given starting mass are also the most difficult to control. For example recreating a supernova reaction would generate a hell of alot of energy and in particular, if it could be directed, momentum (the players involved are heavier than tritium). The problem is that initatiing the reaction is more difficult than simple fusion, and once you have created that force, then how do you control it. \n\nThe problem with a pulse charge is that if the impulse is say for 5 seconds (generous) and you are limited to 8 g of force, then the maximum acceleration you can get from a blast is around 400 m/s. \n\nA nuclear bomb is not simply nuclear material. The hydrogen bomb is made of explosive lenses than electrons, there are outer layers of fissile materials, there is a neutron generator and layers of other material that include inate material such as lithium, and the fissile/fussile material are not completely or efficiently utilized. So to make this viable one would have to find a way of\n\n1. Making a more efficient bomb with no inert reactants (Since you have to carry the weight of bombs just like fuel)\n\n2. Scale down the size of the bomb so it does not blow of the end of your ship\n\n3.
