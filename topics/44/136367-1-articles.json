If you made a very slender spike, or something like a pointed spear, that pointed perfectly prograde as it descended, it would sort of achieve what you are looking for. You would lessen the heating by making it easier for the air to move out of the way and could dip further into the atmosphere before experiencing heating, but by that same token, that object would not slow down nearly as much as an object of the same mass but is, say, spherical. Since you almost invariably are looking to slow down when you slam something into an atmosphere at orbital speeds, this doesn\u0027t usually end up being useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T06:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlrighty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured ram heating would still make it fireball.

You would lessen the heating by making it easier for the air to move out of the way and could dip further into the atmosphere before experiencing heating, but by that same token, that object would not slow down nearly as much as an object of the same mass but is, say, spherical.

The answer to this is probably both, some reflect, and some displace. What happens as you increase density?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen\u00A0there is the math question, if every rigid volume must have a leading edge or surface, what happens with\u00A0the surface of the leading edge decreases. IOW what if we make the leading edge a point, when we do that we might not realized that we have stepped into a messy domain of quantum dynamics, that in itself is a project. But we can address something, because the rigity has to have momentum, and that implies mass, to create a moment of rigity at least two molecules would need to be bonded or linked, and for it to be a volume implies at least a tetrahedral. So if the objects momentum is given by its mass, and the mass falls along a single dimension line that follows a point, the the gas ca interact with points along the line. . . . . side friction, the pressure of the gass and its temperature are pushing\u00A0\u00A0the molecules (their electrons)\u00A0in the gas to strick the\u00A0line causing its moleculs to absorb, reflect\u00A0and possibly displace a rigidities constituants. Quantum mechanics tells us that for a line, nomatter how perfect is composed of quanta whose position at the quantum scale cannot be rigidly defined. So that the electrons of a gas molecule moving in the direction of the side of something might entirely miss a collision or slam\u00A0directly\u00A0into and be knocked free of the charged nucleus that binds it. Ocassionally,mwith high enough energy two nuclei might come close enough to reflect..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus in trying to reduce drag to zero a critical problem is exposed within the implicit rigity. The de broglie equations point this out that everything has a frequency, they\u00A0vibrate,the fields can interact if close enough and transfer momentum. Even the most recent studies indicate that quantum transfers can occur across\u00A0several atoms distances. So there is no way to avoid the base question, in the real world how can you make a object so slippery\u00A0it would not creat drag. That things that compse the rigity will not interact with the molecules of the gas, the\u00A0only possible answer is that the object is smaller\u00A0than a quanta volume and/or its not\u00A0massive/energetic\u00A0which is to say\u00A0its not an object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are ways to trick the system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-rf frequency to displace gas in front of the objects motion,mproblem is rf creates thrust against the motion of travel.
