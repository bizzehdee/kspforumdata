You have the same effect on satellites in Earth\u0027s orbit, and it has to be taken into account by GPS satellites, or any other means of precise radio tracking/positioning. Person standing on the surface is affected the most by gravitational time dilation, but only very little by Earth\u0027s relatively slow rotation. An astronaut on the ISS is affected by gravity almost as much, but also by high orbital velocity, so his clock runs slower than that of any person on Earth. On the other hand, a GPS satellite is on high enough orbit that its clock runs faster than that on the GPS receiver on Earth, because gravitational time dilation is much weaker up there, and it\u0027s not moving fast enough to compensate.
