And then there\u0027s higher n-body systems - for starters, Kerbin itself is one, with its two moons. Maybe the Lagrange points for the Kerbin-Mun system and the Kerbin-Minmus system respectively end up positioned such that Minmus could move its SoI over Kerbin-Mun L2, or the Mun could move its SoI over Kerbin-Minmus L1 or L3? In such a system, these points would be practically nonexistant because the close periodic passing of a gravity well would completely obliterate it.
