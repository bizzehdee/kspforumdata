So in terms of the Moon, Mars and asteroids humans have got to get out there. Once we can learn to live out there effectively it\u0027ll help us back here in the greatest way possible in terms of quality of life. If we can perfect an efficient life support system for a Mars colony imagine what that would mean if that system was adopted into every newly built home?

Morale for one.. great for a country to see its citizens doing what is the greatest thing human beings could ever do. Good for inspiration. Kids get to see humans in space, hopefully on TV instead of what arabic city got bombed and the death count. ( we had the same back with Vietam, but we had Apollo to go along with it so... what missing here now a days? ) Good for jobs. We got all these kids coming out of college with 4\u002B year degrees only to go back to flipping burgers. Takes a great deal of people to put humans beyond LEO.

I hope to soon see a major news outlet cut from beheadings to a rocket launch just for 8min. Gotta get the mass public seeing these views from space and the awesome engineering that goes into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if not then somethings gotta happen to shift the public so people are willing to throw NASA just a little more money. We may disagree on the unmanned/manned approach when it comes to space travel, but if I said that 2018 for the first SLS flight is absurdly slow... Would you say the same in a way? I\u0027d hate to bring up Apollo again. Different times, different people, but if you look the Apollo capsules maiden flight was in 67 ( or was it 66? ). The equivalent of what Orion just had. We landed on the Moon in 69. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I see that type of progress made in just a few years ( and we we\u0027re fighting a major war ) I compare to today\u0027s progress and I die a little inside, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-25T00:17:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2015 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T01:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApollo technically started as soon as NASA started...
