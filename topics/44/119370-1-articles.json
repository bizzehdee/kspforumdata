One of the most convincing concepts so far is a dual, 4 bln dollar mission consisting of two separate orbiters. As this is a Flagship mission, to see serious progress we will have to wait until Mars 2020 and the Europa Mission are launched, but I\u0027m seeing a lot of confidence this time round in the scientific community. The 2011 Decadal Survery already indicated Mars, Europa and Uranus as top destinations... well, the first two are happening, finally! With those two out, it seems likely that Uranus (and/or Neptune) will be elected as top priority destination in the next Decadal Survey, as in the years following the last Survey we have just found more and more reasons to explore Uranus and Neptune (compare them with Juno and Cassini data on Jupiter and Saturn, compare Triton to New Horizons\u0027 Pluto and KBOs, etc.). Jim Green said such a mission would launch at the end of the 2020s or at the beginning of the 2030s. I\u0027m guessing it will have an approx. 10 year transfer, unless it launches on an SLS - which actually seems likely, as it would give the rocket-to-nowhere at least another launch, and a huge one too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been following OPAG live, but in case you want further information so far I found these two articles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/08/25/uranus-neptune-in-nasas-sights-for-new-robotic-mission/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spaceflightnow.com/2015/08/25/uranus-neptune-in-nasas-sights-for-new-robotic-mission/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://futureplanets.blogspot.ca/2015/08/outer-planet-news.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://futureplanets.blogspot.ca/2015/08/outer-planet-news.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I shouldn\u0027t be excited because, even if this mission gets all green lights, it will start returning data no earlier than the mid 2030s-2040s, but still, I can\u0027t wait!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T00:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efinally\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T00:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUranus?

I am also excited at the prospect of missions to Uranus and Neptune for the purely selfish reason that my wife and I named our daughter after one of their moon\u0027s. It is odd to think that she\u0027ll be an adult before these missions start returning images but at least she probably won\u0027t have to wait until her own kids are grown.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiranda?
