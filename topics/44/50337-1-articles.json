Although I think it was a pretty nifty thing to pull off, I cannot help but feel that this idea in large part exists because of the massive amounts of propaganda surrounding the Apollo program (partly due to political tensions). Mankind \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E done some other pretty unbelievable things and some of those can at least rival the Apollo program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat got me thinking what I consider to be the greatest achievent \u003Cem\u003Eup till now\u003C/em\u003E. There will probably be bigger achievements in the future, but we are talking about those that already exist. There are two ways to go about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The greatest achievement in an absolute sense, so not taking into account what was known at the time or what resources were available. Just simply what the best thing man built or devised is today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The relatively greatest achievement, where people heroically engineered a marvel of technology in difficult times with little tools of knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your take on the subject?

Not only is it a marvel of technology, it is also a massive success when it comes to politics and colaboration. We have overcome petty political problems and stuck together (coming from lots of different cultures) to research the fundamentals of life and our very existence. It is not a project instigated to fullfil some personal agenda, but a true quest for knowledge about how the universe works. And of course, it is absolutely massive in every way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/lhc-sim.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lhc-sim.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen talking about relative achiements I am pretty impressed with the waterworks of the Dutch.
