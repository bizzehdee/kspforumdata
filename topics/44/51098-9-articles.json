Germany has done this trying to remove there nuclear share down from 20% to zero, but because of this even despite the energiewende emissions have actually risen, because the primary fuel replacing nuclears role in the grid is coal, so electricity prices have risen dramatically essentially for nothing, for now. switching to renewable is a good idea but by also choosing to remove nuclear they\u0027ve set themselves back, potentially for decades on what they could have achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T11:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps I have been reading too much Asimov, but nuclear energy seems to be a much better alternative to oil than wind power or solar power.

That, and the fact that people think a reactor is just a bomb in a facility that churns out power, and if someone flicks the wrong switch, then you have another Hiroshima, or Nagasaki. Which is of course, completely wrong. (It would take a lot of flicks of the wrong switches, coupled with incompetence, and basic human stupidity, along with a Homer Simpson styled mentality.) While I can understand the argument against N power through the waste perspective, if we were to manage to work with it more efficiently, and more cleverly, that argument would be null and void also.

Price\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Power is by far the most expensive power source, its cheap for the big companys because the big price comes in the future. Here in germany we have an experimental long term storage for nuclear waste called \u0022Asse\u0022 which was considered safe when they build it. But not even 40 years later its unsafe and radiation is leaking in the groundwater, opposed to the million years it was supposed to last. The current estimated costs to get the stuff out there are 10 billion Euros, if it can be done at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso after a shutdown of a nuclear powerplant you have to carefully disassemble it, since everything in there is somehow contaminated. Our electricity suppliers safed 30 billion Euros to disassemble our 16 reactors, but now they want our government to take over additional costs since that wont be enough by far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother costfactor that gets ignored are insurances for the worst case. Each powerplant in germany is insured with 2.5 billon Euros, but in case of a meltdown that wont even be enough to repair the reactor. Just imagine the economical damage if a bigger town gets contaminated, it would be over a trillion Euros. Noone can insure that so the electricity suppliers dont have to pay for such an insurance, otherwise the price per kWh would be much, much higher (some sources say over one Euro per kWh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Uranium is limited. Since Uranium contains way more energy per gramm than every other source this offten gets ignored, but there isnt enough Uranium to power humanity for eternity (or even this century). Maybe it will be the same like oil, the point where none is left will be allways \u0022in 30 years\u0022 but the prices will rise and at some point it will be clear that it cant go on like this. Thats the main reason why it should be totaly clear that nuclear can and will never be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: When germany decided in 2010 to extend the lifetime of nuclear powerplants (they decided to limit the lifetime in 2000) i began to research about that topic (especialy nuclear safety) and held a presentation about school. My final statement was \u0022no matter what you do, there is allways a small risk left\u0022. Two weaks later, on a monday, i got my mark for the presentation, while we were watching the explosions of the reactor buildings in fukushima that happened in the last three days...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T12:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are right on the base price being rather high if one factors in the massive hidden founding by the governments, especially storage costs. But the insurance costs are not that relevant actually. While the costs of a single incident are tremendous, they are dampened by the plants generally not being built very close to larger cities. If you factor in that other energy sources have similiar hidden costs, e.g. climate change or pollution, then it is not that frightening anymore. What actually constitutes a problem is that it is somewhat close to impossible to have an insurance for, as is a low risk, very high damage thing. No insurance company can probably stem that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T12:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Elthy you are absolutely right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an strong pro Nuclear lobby but nobody of them mentions that N power is one of the most costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody mentions that if we switch energy economy to N the uranium reserves won\u0027t even last enough for this century.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery one of them is playing down the risks.
