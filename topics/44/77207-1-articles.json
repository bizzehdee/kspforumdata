You need to design mass distribution so that tidal torque is minimized in that orientation and that one of principal axes, preferably the major one, is in the normal direction. You also want to balance light pressure and maybe add something to dampen oscillations. That way, if sat does end up getting knocked off the correct alignment, you can count on tidal torque to fix it, rather than just set the thing oscillating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T22:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case you\u0027re interested, the ISS uses reaction wheels, as per this video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZHw4UKFiHQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume they must desaturate them using some sort of reaction control system at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@K^2, thanks for the info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T22:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense ... thanks for the info!

Mir and the ISS use the gyrodyne reaction wheel system, with rotating masses distributed throughout the structure. While spacecraft like Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer etc use the 3-axis reaction wheel system. Other satellites use electromagnetic torquers for fine adjustment and precision aiming of antennae. Of course ships such as the Apollo CSM, Space Shuttle, Dragon, and Orion systems use a propellant based attitude control as their reaction speeds generally need to be an order of magnitude quicker than those used in satellites, and satellites (usually) have longer operational lifetimes, and as such these propellantless systems offer greater longetivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that attitude control and station keeping systems are usually completely separate and different systems. The (usually) monopropellant systems used on satellites, such as for GEO satellites for example, are used to restore the orbital characteristics after various factors have cause the satellites orbit to change.

It\u0027s a small force, and it takes electrical power, but satellites are often designed for 10\u002B year operational lifespans, almost always have power readily available thanks to solar panels, and the perturbing forces that the magnetorquer is intended to counteract are quite small, so it\u0027s more effective than the disadvantages I just stated make it sound. They\u0027re usually not used for primary attitude control, instead they are used for things like de-saturating reaction wheels/control moment gyros, mid-precision attitude control, and can usually be used as a backup system if the primary attitude control systems fail partially.

I think I know what you are saying, but I am not sure I understand how that works.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angular momentum, L, is conserved. And for arbitrary rotation axis, L = I\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0. However, the moment of inertia tensor, I, rotates along with the body. If \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 happens to lie along one of the principal axes, then I\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 product remains constant despite the object\u0027r rotation. But if not, I\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 would change with object\u0027s rotation. So in order to keep L constant, \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 must change as well. That\u0027s axis tumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ecat","CreatedById":68747,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T02:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve also heard of satellites that use magnetorquers, basically the satellite can control the power to an electromagnet, which acts on the Earth\u0027s magnetic field to change the orientation of the satellite. It\u0027s a small force, and it takes electrical power, but satellites are often designed for 10\u002B year operational lifespans, almost always have power readily available thanks to solar panels, and the perturbing forces that the magnetorquer is intended to counteract are quite small, so it\u0027s more effective than the disadvantages I just stated make it sound. They\u0027re usually not used for primary attitude control, instead they are used for things like de-saturating reaction wheels/control moment gyros, mid-precision attitude control, and can usually be used as a backup system if the primary attitude control systems fail partially. I\u0027m pretty sure they can\u0027t be used to fully control the satellite\u0027s attitude, because there\u0027s only one axis they can apply torque on (parallel to the axis of the earth\u0027s magnetic field at the satellite\u0027s position)\u003Cp\u003EEither way, they\u0027re useful, and hadn\u0027t been mentioned in this thread yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagnetorquers, can\u0027t say I\u0027ve ever heard of them but the effect used to work in game with the KAS electromagnet.
