Delta-V is a measurement of any given vessel\u0027s ability to change its velocity. We use it as a measurement of how \u0022far\u0022 a vessel can travel since all that matters in orbital mechanics is your ability to preform burns, i.e. change your velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The reason Delta-V can be the same for a large vessel and a small one is due to the way it\u0027s computed. Delta-V is given by the Rocket Equation :\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E*g*ln(m\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ed\u003C/sub\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure we care about here is the m\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E/m\u003Csub\u003Ed \u003C/sub\u003Eterm. This (called the mass fraction) represents the ratio between your vessel\u0027s mass when it\u0027s full of fuel and its mass when empty. Given a certain engine efficiency, Delta-V scales with mass fraction, not with mass. Or, in other terms, the amount of Delta-V in your vessel depends on A: the efficiency of your engines and B: the fuel mass to not-fuel mass ratio, and not on the vessel mass itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The Oberth effect works because of the way work and energy are defined in physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, in terms of work: Work is computed as F*d, or the product of force exerted time the distance it\u0027s exerted over. If you\u0027re moving faster, then you\u0027re going to travel further in a set amount of time. In the context of burn efficiency, it means that a given burn (force applied for a set time) is going to do more work if you\u0027re traveling faster, since the force will be applied over a longer distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, in terms of kinetic energy: Kinetic energy is computed as KE = 1/2 * m * v^2. This means that a linear increase in velocity will result in a quadratic increase in kinetic energy, with increases in velocity when already moving at high speeds producing large changes in kinetic energy compared to low speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T05:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta v\u00A0is the difference (=delta) in velocity (=v) between where you are and where you want to be.

What is Delta V? (A simple explanation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe talk often about \u0022orbital velocity\u0022, usually in reference to the velocity of a spacecraft orbiting in a circle just above the atmosphere (about 7.8 km/s or 17,000 mph), but there is a different velocity for every possible orbit. In order to move from orbit to orbit, you need to either increase or decrease your velocity, which requires you to fire your engines. The greek letter \u0022delta\u0022 is used in physics and mathematics to refer to a change in some physical quantity, so \u0022delta-velocity\u0022 or \u0022delta-V\u0022 is used to represent the change in velocity (e.g., between two orbits).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut since we don\u0027t have infinite fuel, we can\u0027t just fire our engines whenever we want for as a long as we want. Just like in a car, you need to keep an eye on your fuel tank. But how far will a given amount of fuel get you?\u00A0Fortunately, you can use an equation (the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ETsiolkovsky ideal rocket equation\u003C/em\u003E, or \u003Cem\u003Erocket equation\u003C/em\u003E for short) to figure it out. Plug in the mass of your spaceship, the total amount of fuel, and the exhaust velocity (also called \u003Cem\u003Especific impulse\u003C/em\u003E) of your fuel, and the rocket equation will tell you that if you burned all your fuel, it would change your velocity by some specific amount. And remember, a change in velocity is also called...delta-V. So if your fuel tanks give you the ability to change your velocity by 1,000 m/s, then you can execute any maneuver that requires you to change your velocity by 1,000 m/s or less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nice thing about this is that you don\u0027t need any complex math to figure out how far you can get. If you need to add 50 m/s to your orbital velocity now, and 100 m/s to your orbital velocity later, then just make you have at least 150 m/s of total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in your tanks. Just add it up. Note, however, that you can\u0027t subtract. If you need to add 50 m/s now and then subtract 100 m/s later, then you\u0027ll still need 150 m/s of total velocity change; your engines don\u0027t care whether you\u0027re speeding up or slowing down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the delta-V value is so useful, it is used for other things as well. If you are taking off from the ground and going to space, then you will experience drag due to friction with the air. Rather than having to calculate the forces on your rocket and subtract them from your engine thrust for every point along your ascent, you can just determine that the total air resistance will rob you of about 750 m/s of delta-V. In other words, you burn 750 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in fuel just fighting air resistance on the way up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223027382\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159462\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492647567\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ALaz1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, ALaz1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

The mass of a satellite or spacecraft doesn\u0027t affect its orbital velocity; and good thing too. That\u0027s how a small capsule is able to dock with a much larger space station:\u00A0they both have the same orbital velocity and orbital location, even though their masses are different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a big ship needs the same change-in-velocity to move to a different orbit than a small ship does. However, the bigger ship will need more fuel. If the two ships have similar engines, it\u0027s fairly simple: both ships will burn approximately the same \u003Cem\u003Eproportion\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of fuel to achieve the same change in velocity.\u00A0For example, if the small ship masses 10 tonnes and needs to burn 2 tonnes of fuel to achieve a certain change-in-velocity, and the bigger ship masses 100 tonnes, then the bigger ship will need to burn 20 tonnes of fuel to achieve the same thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that if one ship has better fuel/engines (e.g., liquid kerosene on one ship and liquid hydrogen on the other ship), the ship with more energetic fuel won\u0027t have to burn as much of it for the same difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223027382\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159462\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492647567\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ALaz1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, ALaz1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

Just like a surfer can ride a wave in the ocean, a rocket\u0027s exhaust\u00A0can \u0022push against\u0022 a gravitational field in order to increase the change in velocity.
