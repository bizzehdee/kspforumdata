If you can build Alcubierre drive, you should go FTL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlcubierre is a special case of warp drive, however. There are warp metrics that are inherently sublight. As such, they are not subject to CTC conjecture constraints. They can also have thicker bubbles, making them far more feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, we might one day build a sublight warp drive for solar system exploration. Probably sooner than skeptics think, but still not soon. That drive will not be an Alcubierre drive. For starters, it will have Lorentz boosted interior metric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for uses, the obvious one is cycler ships. You still have to produce exhaust to change energy and angular momentum of your ship. Warp is not magic. That means you need to be in transfer orbit with correct semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and argument of the ascending node. This leaves argument of periapsis and mean anomaly as free parameters. These the warp drive will have access to. Which means you can throw a ship into cycler orbit, ignoring phase sync, and warp yourself between the two planets in a tiny fraction of the time. Best part, if you can recover part of energy needed to create the bubble when you drop out, you can make the trips pretty cheap. And an Earth-Mars cycler can be making trips in days or weeks, depending on relative phases, with very reasonable energy investments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T05:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could be convenient for going places without pancaking yourself against the back wall of your ship due to excessive G-force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could of course simply accelerate gradually, but that increases your total travel time.

But if its LS or sub-FTL you have essentially the same problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inertial shift cause by the drive might disperse the matter, but if you are heading at C then the level of dispersion is minimal, a grain of sand would impact an area slightly larger than a grain of sand. The cohesion of the molecules in the grain of sand is immaterial at C, its the energy that is contained within its mass. Therefore deflecting the matter a tenth of a millimeter does not really fix the collision problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimarily interstellar travel is an effort of nearly global cooperation, it would require building a massively survivable ship capable of sustaining flight for generations. This is all doable with nuclear technology, but the social aspects are the big problem. If a robotized ship sustains a collision and looses vacuum, the robots can survive in the vacuum of space, humans cannot, and robots sustain far less damage from ionizing radiation relative to humans, and if you concentrated the processors you could use local shielding. Humans you have to protect the whole body where-ever they might move.

I get that for some observers, events might occur at the same time or in a particular sequence, while for others in a different state of motion, the same events might occur in a different sequence - time and the order of events is always relative to the observer(s). I also get that for all observers, objects moving near light speed relative to them will appear to experience time slower, regardless of whether you claim it\u0027s the object or the observer that is moving. And, as the cause of this, time slows down for anything approaching the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome have claimed that simply extrapolating the trend of time dilation implies that if you go past the speed of light, your perception of time will go into negative territory, but as I understand things, time dilation follows an asymptotic curve. Thus if you hurl yourself at light speed or faster, the only thing you can expect to happen to your time is for it to move infinitely slowly or stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how is any of this even relevant to a device that doesn\u0027t move within space, but simply translates itself within the universe by surfing about on its own little wave of space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ran a thought experiment. About 1400 light-years away is the star KIC 8462852, which has been in the news lately due to what could be an alien megastructure. So to find out, I accelerate to near light speed and jump over there. For me, I travel for a few hours, but when I get there, about 1400 years have passed and I find all the aliens are dead. I turn around, and using my super-duper-mega-ultra telescope, I can gaze upon Earth as it was 1400 years prior (i.e. the present). All well and good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the meantime, humans have invented warp drive and a plucky young Kerballer from the year 3415 warps to my location over the course of a few minutes. Since he was in warp, he gets no time dilation, and because he was traveling at ludicrous speed, he can tell that, indeed, five minutes have passed. When we meet, he tells me all about the glorious exploits of future human civilization. When I look back at Earth, of course, none of that is evident, but I know that light is slow and that 1400 years have passed, so I believe him. He turns around and goes home to future Earth to hang out with his future friends at the future mall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, I reverse-engineer his warp drive and try to troll the universe by time-traveling. I surmise that since it is now the year 3415, if I warp back home I can tell everyone all about the future before it even happens. So I build a warp drive and go home... to the year 3415 (plus five minutes). I run into my acquaintance from earlier and he laughs at my idiocy, embarrassing me in front of his friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesperate to troll spacetime, I hop back in the time machine to try and tell all my alien ghost buddies about Earth\u0027s future. I warp myself over there, and it\u0027s still the year 3415, and all the aliens are still dead. I regale their ghosts on Earth\u0027s future, but it really doesn\u0027t matter to anyone because it\u0027s already the year 3415 anyway.
