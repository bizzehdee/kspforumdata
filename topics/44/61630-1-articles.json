The Shuttle is a good illustration. There are many other factors that need to be taken into account, and reducing the cost of the hardware is only a small part of the problem. There is a rule of thumb in the space industry called the rule of fifths: \u0022One fifth of the budget for the satellite bus, a fifth for the rocket, a fifth for ground systems, a fifth for the payload, and the rest for various systems work (e.g. integration).\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest cost isn\u0027t propellant or even hardware. It\u0027s manpower. There are thousands of technicians and engineers involved in a space project, many of which are typically high-pay-grade professionals, but there are also administrative costs, HR, training, maintenance, facilities, energy, transport, etc... Reusing part of the hardware only saves you some of the manufacturing wages, but you still have to pay for all the infrastructure and other fixed costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, if reusing the first stage only impacts the fifth of the budget that is allocated to the rocket, then in that fifth, you still have the cost of refurbishing, testing, transport, refueling, etc... and the upper stage isn\u0027t reusable yet, so end customers are potentially looking at a rough estimate of much less than 20% savings on their project compared to an expendable launch vehicle. You\u0027re looking at a 10% saving on the total project, at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember that the reusable Falcon 9R will have a reduced payload. It will be competing with the medium-lift Soyuz market, not the heavy GEO comsat market. And remember, some of the fundamental systems haven\u0027t been proven yet. Nobody knows yet if \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ea Merlin engine can actually restart facing a supersonic airflow, or\u003C/span\u003E if the lightweight tank structure can resist the stress of reentry and landing without damage. This is stuff that has hardly been researched, let alone tested, and yet the whole concept relies on it working. There is still a long road before anyone can assess the idea as feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other ways of making stuff cheap. For example, mass production of disposable items. That is the route that Arianespace is following with the Ariane 6: 4 near-identical SRBs per rocket for 12 launches per year means that the factory has to churn out nearly 50 solid booster cores per year. In space terms, that\u0027s mass production, and has the potential to massively reduce costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX is also going this way, with a facility that is designed to build 400 Merlin engines per year, the equivalent of 40 falcon 9s. But that pretty much flies in the way of their reusability plans, because once SpaceX starts reusing all those Merlins, their production facility has to slow down and loses its competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd to the fact that the commercial launch market isn\u0027t expanding at a huge rate. The comsat market is reaching saturation while land-based networks are becoming more pervasive. The institutional market is under a lot of pressure too. And new markets will need more than a 20% discount to become viable. In fact, there isn\u0027t really much demand for a higher launch rate right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you see, there\u0027s very fine balance to be found in the industry, and I applaud SpaceX for trying something new. But this is an industry where technical achievements, no matter how impressive they are from an engineering standpoint, don\u0027t always become an industrial success.

First of all the entire point of a first stage is to get the payload UP, and overcome gravity, so the boosters that would land back at the launch site (or at some other location) would be traveling mostly vertically and only need enough fuel to combat descent. Which brings up another point that the landing site could be separate from the launch site, a predetermined location that would require less fuel to land at. All the booster would have to do is counter its own weight and minor horizontal forces. So by saving a small percentage of the takeoff fuel from the first stage in order to save a booster for multiple flights, this is a pure genius move. The rest of the rocket can be designed knowing that there is some extra weight for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T04:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it ballzy as heck, I would not be so daring, but if spaceX gets it to work it will be incredible!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly back reusably as traditionally proposed used wings to glide a booster back, such as the early fully reusable shuttle proposal of a booster shuttle and and orbital shuttle, the booster shuttle would glide back and land on a runway.

I\u0027m not talking about just the launch cost, I\u0027m talking about what it costs a customer to get a satellite in orbit to do a specific job. Together they count as two fifths, because the operational payload (instruments, transponders, whatever) is usually expensive, but of course, it\u0027s only a quick estimation of how much a space program costs. My point is that savings on the launch vehicle won\u0027t impact payload, ground station, transport, testing, infrastructure, etc... and therefore only has a marginal impact on the total program cost for the customer.
