If I remember correctly, this is one manner in which a celestial body\u0027s mass may be determined. For instance, if we determine the orbital parameters of say, Io orbiting Jupiter, we can sue that information and the vis-viva equation (v^2 = GM*(2/r - 1/a), where \u0022v\u0022 is the orbital velocity, \u0022G\u0022 is the Universal gravitational constant, \u0022M\u0022 is the mass of the parent body, \u0022r\u0022 is the distance between the centers of the two bodies, and \u0022a\u0022 is the semi-major axis) to determine the mass of Jupiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, If you want to perform a little bit of science on your own, you can launch a vessel to orbit of Kerbin, or any other body and note your velocity and altitude at a certain time, add the parent body\u0027s radius to your altitude (this gives your \u0022r\u0022 for the vis-viva equation), use your periapsis and apoapsis to determine your semi-major axis, a=radius\u002B(Ap\u002BPe)/2 (where Ap and Pe are altitudes relative tot he surface), and use the vis-viva equation to calculate the mass of the body you are orbiting. I believe that in the Tracking Station you can get both the radius and mass of each body to use for your calculation and confirm your result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cziken20","CreatedById":95907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T16:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut i also want to ask for other scales- engine sin KSP are about 10 times less powerful, aren\u0027t they?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T17:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cziken20\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cziken20\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut i also want to ask for other scales- engine sin KSP are about 10 times less powerful, aren\u0027t they?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo they aren\u0027t.

ISP, however, is measured in seconds, and KSP doesn\u0027t fudge the time dimension. From looking at the ISP range of kerbal engines, they\u0027re roughly equivalent to a space program that only uses RP1/LOX. That isn\u0027t really about the engines but about the chemistry of the bipropellant. A great philosopher once said, \u0022respect the chemistry.\u0022 Human space programs have access to cryogenic fuels like LH2 that has a base ISP over 450 seconds. That isn\u0027t \u0022ten times more powerful\u0022 than a KSP engine that gets 330 seconds of specific-impulse, especially when you consider the density issues of LH2 compared to RP1. As a rule of thumb, at lower altitudes, the higher density of RP1 trumps the higher efficiency of LH2. A tripropellant system was proposed for the US space shuttle\u0027s main engines that ran on RP1/LOX at low altitudes then LH2/LOX at high altitudes. Now and again people ask about a LH2/F/Li tripropellant because it has the highest ISP in chemical rocketry (550 seconds or so), but that\u0027s an engineering nightmare and an environmental catastrophe, and once again, they\u0027re not \u0022ten times as powerful.\u0022 If you\u0027re interested in human-scale rocketry, there\u0027s a realism modpack you could install. Because LEO \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is no less than twice the LKO \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv it tends to be a humbling experience.\n"}]}
