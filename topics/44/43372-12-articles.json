A manned mission would have to leave after a few months to return to Earth, whereas a robot can keep on going until it breaks down, potentially for years. In effect, you might be getting several years worth of science from a robot, but only 6 months from a human expedition. The advantage of the robot in this case, is to be able to observe seasonal changes and to obtain sismological or meteorological data over longer periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage of robots is that they are cheaper, so it\u0027s easy to land a whole fleet of them in order to cover a wider and more diverse territory.

The mission requirements intended for them to be able to walk back to the LM in case the LRV broke down. They were never more than 8 km away from the LM. A robot can actually go much further away without worrying about getting too far from the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA manned mission would actually have quite a limited horizon compared to a fleet of robotic probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s not a matter of distance. Opportunity travels at such a slow rate because it stops every few meters to do science along the way. A manned expedition would probably travel further and concentrate on specific locations. The short range of current robotic rovers is more a constraint of size, cost, and risk. There\u0027s no technical reason we couldn\u0027t design a larger long-range robotic rover that could travel over similar distances to a manned rover.
