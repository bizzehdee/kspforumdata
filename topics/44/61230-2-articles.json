Some people (like me) would respond by building spacecrafts the size of skyscrapers, carrying enough supplies for such a long trip, and back again. Only if political holds are released, are we able to build more powerful and exotic propulsion systems, up to and including the ever-infamous nuclear pulse propulsion. By then, the time distance to Mars would be measured by weeks (or even days), rather than months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, getting to mars in say, 2 weeks, assuming going in a straight line and closest approach, you\u0027d need to go about 48 km/s on average, that\u0027s (very) roughly 80 km/s of deltaV needed ( given that we\u0027re not startin from nor ending at 0 m/s velocities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i\u0027m neglecting a lot of details increasing this number, like the fact that you\u0027d have to go above the 48 km/s to compensate for time needed to accelerate and decelerate, gravity (although that works both ways) and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven, i\u0027m also neglecting factors reducing that number, like gravity(again), aero breaking, slingshot maneauvers etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint being: I think a trip to mars lasting only days, is very far off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T20:05:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Neotician\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T20:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with nuclear reactors for powering spacecrafts would be the cooling systems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E in vacuum, it\u0027s very hard to dissipate thermal energy.
