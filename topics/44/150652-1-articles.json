On the one hand, at least it went to a chemist, far too often it gets handed to biologists or physicists. Still,\u00A0I\u0027ll say the prize is extremely premature. Those kinds of molecular machines fall into the \u0022looks cool but useless\u0022 branch of science. If any of those things actually did something I would be all for the Nobel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else have thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T04:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s so bad. It\u0027s a very young field, and i personally think we reach a bit ahead of ourselves with nanomachines. I mean, we are not 100% sure how all structures in our own cells work, what all the genes in our DNA do - yet we are trying to build microscopic machines performing similiar tasks? I feel like we are sticking our arm in a dark hole and groping around in hopes of finding something useful. Shining a torch inside first could be much more productive \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Still, isn\u0027t it what science is supposed to do?
