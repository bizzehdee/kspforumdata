A circular-section nozzle is self-reinforcing: if it starts to bend out of shape then the pressure within restores it, but the curves of an aerospike (linear or circular) are shaped in such a way that if they start to deform then the pressure on them exaggerates that.\n\nAnother problem is that the engines that create the flame that plays over the aerospike are very difficult to make. A conventional combustion chamber is simple by comparison - it just needs to be a heat-resistant, pressure-resistant approximately spherical chamber with opening for combustants coming in and for exhaust going out to the nozzle. Rearranging all that to create nearly flat jets of exhaust that the aerospikes need is very tricky. Some designs have had many tiny combustion chambers each leading to a small, flat nozzle that directs the exhaust over a segment of the aerospike, or they have required large, heavy, complex manifolds to do the job. Either way, the engines are large, heavy, expensive and inefficient."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:05:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The actual \u0022nozzle\u0022 part, yes, that\u0027s not excessively difficult, though making it strong enough and light enough has proved tricky.
