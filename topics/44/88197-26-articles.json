OTOH, the competing theory of MoND, which manages to do a better job of explaining things in most cases than Dark Matter, and without invoking a \u003Cem\u003Edeus ex machina\u003C/em\u003E, is considered heresy. Yet the same mainstream that embraces Dark Matter over MoND seems to reject EM out of hand without really looking at the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit to being a serious EM skeptic, having been raised devoutly orthodox in terms of the laws of physics. If you\u0027re going to undermine my understanding of the universe, I want proof. But that doesn\u0027t seem to be the issue here. As best as I can determine, we have corroboration from multiple independent sources with accuracies that exceed the known sources of error. So something does seem to be going on, unlike the \u0022cold fusion\u0022 fad of my youth, which nobody could ever duplicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe source of EM\u0027s controversy, therefore, appears to be more in terms of why than of what. If there\u0027s no why given, then naturally there will be intense skepticism. But OTOH, focusing on the lack of a why ignores the existence of the known whats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hold it as a given that nothing can violate the laws of physics as presently understood, but at the same time we obviously don\u0027t have a full understanding of those laws. If we had a complete understanding, we\u0027d have no trouble tying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics together. Thus, we must acknowledge significant gaps in our knowledge and, therfore, can neither blindly accept nor reject out of hand observations that fall into the gray areas between them. What we must do is investigate further. If EM is really a thing, then it must both conform to what we\u0027re already pretty sure of and, where it differs, must provide an explanation of how it got there from where it started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I sit here, I imagine a world where gravitational lensing or some other relativistic effect was observed prior to Relativity being postulated. How would that sit with folks committed to a purely Netonian mindset? Photographic evidence of the phenomenon are there for the looking, but nobody can explain why they happen. Seems to be where we are with EM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s MoND?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou have me curious now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s MoND?\u003Cp\u003Eyou have me curious now\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModified Newtonian Dynamics, which, last I heard, didn\u0027t work in several areas and explained things more poorly than the theory of Dark Matter.
