The ideal of earth as a living thing just as a eucaryotic cell has multiple lives within it, and the body has many cells, the Earth\u0027s surface is a living thing compose of biomes with various biotypes that cooperate (through both their lives and deaths) to create a living surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we remove this, we get something like Mars (too cold and small) or Venus (too hot and dense atmosphere). The old earth soil was this thin, methane was up there and spread loosely around. Now the organic material is a very dense and living layer decaying first by bacterial action, then by fungi, then by the activity of soil detritovores, then by the activity of plant roots, then by the decay of roots and plant leaves and start next cycle. In such a dense layer of organic material perchlorates or any kind of highly alkaline base cannot survive, since water is a prerequisite for soil, many soil oxides will decompose to base and the bases are unstable and become salts (like carbonates). Most of the biomass of the earth is now within the very top of earths crust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T03:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223244745\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513308907\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00228059\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, PakledHostage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no doubt in my mind to begin with, if you mix enough compost with martian soil those perchlorates will not last very long.

Crucial to life is water, basically water that moves \u0027freely\u0027 between the gaseous and liquid phase. This process brings us fresh water. [Mars does not have a source of fresh water It means Water = [Energy] \u002B precursors\u003Cbr\u003E\nNoting that surface hydrogen [H- , not molecular] is scarce on Mars and very abundant on Earth\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. While O2 is not critical to all life it is critical to complex eucaryotes. [CO2 \u002B reductants \u002B [energy] ------------\u0026gt; O2 \u002B Carbon\u003Cbr\u003E\nNoting that surface hydrogen is scarce on Mars and very abundant on Earth, surface hydrogen is key on earth to reducing carbon, and you need lots of it because you need to lock carbon up for a very long time to make oxygen available.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Critical to life is vapor pressure . . N2, O2 in its break down on Earth. Martian Air relative to Earth has none of the components to sustain life. This means that all living things must be contained and pressurized. this makes building and repairing structures on Mars difficult. Spacesuits are not magic, they fail, and when they fail on Mars the wearer is spaced. Without substantial vapor pressure endothermic life is nearly impossible, particular vapor pressure of water, which on Mars is practically zero, because there is virtually no water on the surface of Mars. The only viable way to get the vapor pressure up on mars is to raid the Kuiper-belt for ice and transport them back to Mars . . . . .very expensive and requires Fusion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Critical to life on Earth is photosynthesis, it is not obligate, there are archea that can live off of earthen energy sources, but for advanced Eucaryotes photosynthesis is key. To get get this to fly you need sunlight (149\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E/229\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E =\u00A0 0.42. Mars gets 42% of the sunlight from Earth. A fair number of plants, like C4 plants would make poor crops on Mars (discounting the above 3 problems) because these plants do not get adequate light to produce. On mars roughly you would need 3 times as much land and soil to grow crops, which is expensive on mars because it would all have to be enclosed. Mars has CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E. CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B sunlight \u002B H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0 -----\u0026gt;0\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B sugar.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Critical to life on Earth is Nitrogen, nitrogen on earth comes from the Air and is created by lightning which is then absorbed by plants, nitorgen also comes from minerals in the earth that are acted upon by water. Martian atmosphere has virtually no nitrogen (it have virtually no anything), it has no water. Again we can bring nitrogen to Mars, but before we did that we would first need to figure out a way of keeping Mars from loosing all it atmosphere. While nitrogen does not appear to be critical, Nitrogen and Argon have buffering effects on the rate of oxygen, given that humans do need vapor pressure to survive, we then also need molecular nitrogen to survive, and Mars simply does not have what we need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you managed to solve these problems on a planetary scale, then the martian problem is solvable with tools we have already on Earth, you could build a mini-Earth, much less productive than Earth and with 1/100th the population, but you could.Otherwise the colony will not likely be self-sustaining. I make the logical argument that talking about what is possible on Mars in a \u0027terraformed\u0027 context is not a kosher argument, since it is not clear at the moment whether we possess enough usable energy technologies to do this. If we are talking about 1 Mt fusion reactors that are 1% efficient in power production then the atmospheric problems on Mars will never be a solved thing. If the above 5 can be solved, then martian regolith composition is not going to be a problem, trust me. However without the correction of these problems we can assume that humans, improving on their current skills, could bring all the things necessary for life and could extract C and O from martian atmosphere, assuming these to be the case what are the problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on conservative principles, terraforming Mars is best described as a B.S. argument. That means it makes hand-waving assumptions that cannot be proven to be true and should thus be eliminated from the argument, period. IOW, without a solid base of facts we can just say \u003Cem\u003E\u0027sprinkle fairy dust\u0027\u003C/em\u003E and make any impossible scenario possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----Does not need fusion power to achieve -------unsustainable colony that is functional---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 1. Insufficient automation. Basically all processes outside need to be automated, humans would basically be the repairmen. (Which has its own sets of major issues, see problem with lunar moon dust). Logic. IN the near future (next 1000 to 10000 years), if we cannot solve the fusion problem, then Mars will unlikely to be \u0027atmosphered\u0027 to Earth-like composition. Before Mars is properly gased and magnetically protected, it would not be safe for humans to repeatedly expose themselves to \u0027spacing\u0027 by attempting to work outside, except in emergent situations. Building a colony does not qualify as emergent. Automation requires masses of specialized equipment.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIssue 2. Erosion of equipment. Martian substrate is damaging to equipment. A desired working area would need to be cleaned of all loose substrate and a barrier around the area would need to be built sufficiently high enough to prevent larger particles from entering the work area. Eventually you would want the area covered so that loose dust did not enter.\u00A0 To prevent this you would need gas-phase cleaning stations that blow the dust off and collect it. This would create a compound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 3. Batteries, a martian colony would need a huge reserve of batteries capable of storing power. There are no coal-fire power plants on Mars, there is no coal, no fire and no plants. More importantly it would need to be able to make batteries on Mars. Current batteries of high efficiency are made with Lithium, . . . no readily apparent at concentrations needed on Mars. Energy could be stored in pressurized underground caverns but there is no air to pressurize. Assuming we could assemble batteries on Mars (unlikely in the near term so thinking out 200 years from now) this problem is solvable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 4. Importing and protecting the solar power. Given the above desired enclosure of work area, you can have durable plastics that cover the solar panels during dust storms that also cover the entire \u0027compound\u0027 preventing the entering of dust. We can have fission reactors and heavy fusion reactors on Mars (within the next 100 years however I don\u0027t see how). Because Mars has a surface it is possible to build out equipement that cools the heat -exchangers. But real power on Mars would have to come from solar, Mars colony then need much better solar panels. In the near term (next 200 years) Mars colonies live off of solar and low power decay-energy units. As a consequence in the near term mars needs alot of solar-panels to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 5. Digging into mars (automation of tunneling). This solves several of the problems. A. Pressure, the lower you go into mars the easier it is to pressurize things. Also the easier it is to trap humidity. B. Radiation, the lower you go the less energetic the cosmic and EM radiation is C. Climate control, the lower you go the easier it is to deal with day night shifts. D.\u00A0 Humanance, the lower you go the easier it would be to find soil on mars representative of a past mars that was more organic and hydrogenated. Digging however presents its own problems, the erosive regolith can no longer be isolated from the equipment. Another problem is that excavation equipment is very heavy and there are no manufacturing of equipment on Mars. One solution is to use microbots that pick sediment out of the rocks creating cells that could be pulled out in one piece and used as building blocks (for shelters or substrate barriers) [this technique was used by the Egyptians to form the blocks of the pyramids but on a softer substrate]. The martian digging problem is a problem, but if we brought substrate back from Mars we could design over the next 25 years technologies that could deal with it. Tunneling is just good logic, because it give you a potentially automatic secondary/tertiary containment but also because potential pressurization of this system is also a warning system of a leaks in primary containment. In addition, via tunneling it may be possible to find trapped reserves of water that have been protected from the effects of surface evaporation. We need however first to build autonomous tunneling equipment that will retrieve power, dispose of substrate, and analyze their process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 6. Trapping volatiles. At martian pressures many things on earth that are liquids become gas, at least at standard temperatures. As stated above hydrogen is a premium element on Mars compared to Earth. This means we need to trap elemental hydrogen, this is a problem because water seeks its own level. For example if you water plants in a green-house, the water will just go down into the substrate and you will have to get more. So farming would be need to be contained, either in glass or in durable plastics (which contain hydrogen).\u00A0 The farming then needs to be such as to trap volatiles. This is a big problem if you have ever seen the way a green house is run, water runs everywhere. So greenhouse areas would need secondary and tertiary containment systems. They probably need to be insulated on all sides, and thus LED lighting and solar electric power is going to be a thing on Mars. For at least\u00A0 a time the colony would dependent on Earth for Carbon. Tunnels will need to be dug, enclosures made, fluid based cooling systems installed with radiators on the surface. I can see this evolving over time to a more self sustaining process (maybe 100 years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 7. Balancing artificial ecosystems and scaling up self-sustenance. See Biosphere experiments. NASA is probably better at it, but they do so in a high professional environment with resupply every few months. Martian colonies will need to be independent for 4 years. We know that adding lots of compost to the system is just not going to work in closed space, so that we are talking about artificial plant growth systems, not gardens or rain forest. Its all going to be LED lights and conical rooms with wall-to-wall plants and lights. Short term no energy foods, fats can come from earth, nutrition comes from greenhouses. Or put it otherwise, untill you can grow a grove coconut palm on Mars forget about mars as a bulk source of human calories. The martian regolith as I stated above is not a death nail, human fecal waste can be mixed with garden waste and this mixed with martian dust and some source of acidity which will in special enclosures bio-remediate the soil. This should be used by automated farming units (for example tuber farming or peanut farming - as these return nitrogen to the earth you can use these to remove nitrogen from CO2-N2 mixtures drawn in from the surface and converted to nutrients for farming).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssue 8. Self-sustainance. Given that above we did not manage to get fusion to Mars a self sustaining colony is not possible, but it might be possible to get colonies that need low attendance, say once every 10 years supplies traded between the colony and earth bound ships. One of the benefits of growing stuff on Mars is its isolation from diseases on earth, such as plant diseases. Plants could be grown on mars as a seed repository for species on Earth that are endangered by diseases. For example you could be working on providing seedlings that are resistant from Dutch elm disease,\u00A0 . . . . . .This is probably the most difficult problem, however, for Mars in the sense that there are so many ecosystems on Earth it is difficult to find a place that is better suited on Mars than it is on Earth. The other idea is that Mars would be a refuge from an Earthen Armageddon. I would say no, if Mars requires Earth for essentials like LED, etc. . .there is no way for Mars to be a refuge from an Earthen disaster, it would only be the last grave dug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic problem with DAL\u0027s argument is that he has a tendency to hand-wave problems away.

If we have fusion and if we can get fusion to work in space and if we can find a way to import frozen gas from space-time isoquant X to space-time isoquant Mars, and if we can stop the erosions of the Martian atmosphere but solar storms then we can terraform Mars.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbability of workable fusion - good - scale is 100,000s of tons on Earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbability of workable fusion in space poor, probability of a fusion work around - fair. Likelihood that we could get a working fusion reactor on Mars, this would require a fully fledged colony capable of building such a reactor from parts and a massive (10x times that on earth), heat exchanger. Not near-future or mid-future but more like far-future. Mars could become\u00A0 destination for Nuclear waste, in which case you could use latent heat to generate power. Of course one bad landing and . . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbability of a scale of operation that brings adequate mass from outer solar system to inner solar system - poor. This requires efficient space fusion and a type of generator and heat radiator with efficiencies that are in the mid-future range of possibilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbability that we can stop erosion of Martian atmosphere - poor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConclusion, in its current state mars is unlikely to ever have a self sustaining colony. For this to occur certain constraints on space travel need to change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the current world circumstance (looking out 200 years) we would need a colossal investment in terraforming Mars to get there. Given our recent progress just to get back to the moon let alone the decadal projections on Mars sample return and human landing attempts (by four space capable bodies on Earth) it is clear that a timeline for Terraforming mars is not in Earths short or mid term future. Alas the technologies for doing this are not present and neither is the investment capital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConclusion, the political will to advance the colonization of Mars is not there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonization of Mars is not likely\u0027 and it will not be a thing in the near future.

But we don\u0027t, artificial intelligence has evolved to the point it could make all the determinations, but without contaminating life on Mars, or it contaminating us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223245608\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513398906\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I\u0027m just trying to be realistic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommon atmosphere for all inhabited planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThermodynamcal and chemical equilibrium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean about teleport . . .beam me up scotty . . .
