Like I already know the crew will just have to tough it out hecause they signed up for the cutting edge of science (can\u0027t make an awesome omelette without breaking eggs), but even once the starship returns and lands, would workers working on starship repair have any increased cancer risk just working on a returned spaceship that has been in space getting battered by radiation for months?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is this not really anything to worry about?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really that is perhaps one of the few things scifi gets right lol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could have SSTOs that have been in space for years, the hull could be safe to come near without getting lethal doses of radiation after it landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Actually... it depends. If said ship has been flying around uber radioactive space (near or around jupiter) or been shot up with particle beams or nuclear howitzers... the hull could very well be radioactive. So instead of landing a damaged and radiated ship you would just use escape pods to reach a planetary surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust another reason why real science makes scifi require more steps for safety than scifi which either eliminates them or drastically reduces them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-05T06:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno i dont think so, that would require neutron activation and heavy elements to be activated. alpha and beta radiation dont have much penetration capability. ionizing radiation can just strip electrons and have no effect on the nucleus. cosmic rays might do
