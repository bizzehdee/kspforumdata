Like I already know the crew will just have to tough it out hecause they signed up for the cutting edge of science (can\u0027t make an awesome omelette without breaking eggs), but even once the starship returns and lands, would workers working on starship repair have any increased cancer risk just working on a returned spaceship that has been in space getting battered by radiation for months?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is this not really anything to worry about?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really that is perhaps one of the few things scifi gets right lol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could have SSTOs that have been in space for years, the hull could be safe to come near without getting lethal doses of radiation after it landed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Actually... it depends. If said ship has been flying around uber radioactive space (near or around jupiter) or been shot up with particle beams or nuclear howitzers... the hull could very well be radioactive. So instead of landing a damaged and radiated ship you would just use escape pods to reach a planetary surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust another reason why real science makes scifi require more steps for safety than scifi which either eliminates them or drastically reduces them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-05T06:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno i dont think so, that would require neutron activation and heavy elements to be activated. alpha and beta radiation dont have much penetration capability. ionizing radiation can just strip electrons and have no effect on the nucleus. cosmic rays might do something. its not like its corium though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-05T09:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre meteorites typically extremely radioactive after being in space millions of years prior to hitting Earth?\u00A0 Not so much\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-05T09:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJupiter has a radiation belt 1000 times stronger than Earth\u0027s Van Allen belt.\u00A0 It\u0027s full of high energy protons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe should study Io.\u00A0 I predict that certain isotope ratios which we use for atomic mass will be different there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-08-05T11:12:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2024 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 dy\u0022\u003EMonday at 11:12 AM\u003C/time\u003E by farmerben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-05T15:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224412691\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225643\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221722848941\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre meteorites typically extremely radioactive after being in space millions of years prior to hitting Earth?\u00A0 Not so much\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent point and they been in space for billions of years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
