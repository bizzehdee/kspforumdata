There is a basic assumption about satellites that you can always communicate with them, but there are instance tgat as soon as a payload gets into space it dumbs up. Many satellites die and thats it. If you are lucky enough to have satellites with a relatively high apogee you can spend a small amout of fuel to place it in a decaying orbit, but this first reduces the eccentrity and then finally decays, while it does this it plows through circular orbitals and risk hitting stuff. Even hitting dead stuuf is bad because it creates 1000s of more objects. If the sat retains more fuel, if it retains communication, and if the actuators still actuate, then you can do a two point burn to either junkyard staus or deorbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T18:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople leave their trash everywhere they go.
