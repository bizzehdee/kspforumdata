Under threat of planetary annihilation, humanity bands together to construct 12,000 enormous \u0022Earth Engines\u0022 on Earth\u0027s surface to propel it out of the Solar System to a new home (Alpha Centauri), Planetary Annihilation style. However, upon approaching Jupiter to make use of gravity assist, thousands of engines get knocked offline all across the globe, threatening to plunge the entire Earth into Jupiter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea that the entire Earth can be equipped with giant thrusters to push it out of orbit.\u00A0The Earth Engines, each one is stated to be eleven kilometers tall, and the torque engines around the equator are even bigger. One Earth engine over Paris is shown to make the Eiffel Tower look like a blade of grass. There are\u00A0ten thousand\u00A0standard thrust engines and\u00A0two thousand more\u00A0torque engines. The 10,000 Propulsion Earth Engines are said to output a combined 150 trillion (1.5 x 10^14) tons of force to propel Earth to Jupiter\u0027s neighborhood in 17 years.

In reality the sun would still shine for another five billion years.\u00A0The technology (besides the Earth Engines) does not seem much more advanced than current modern era. The movie takes place in 2075, as shown by display monitor in one scene. This means that the Earth Engines were activated in 2058 at the earliest, since the prologue that takes place 17 years before shows the Earth in its usual position, before the engines were activated. In fact, Han Zi\u0027ang states that no Earth Engine had failed in 30 years, which means that at least one was completed in 2045, and were being constructed earlier still\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow the hell they carry a FREAKING MINIGUN as one of their loadout\u00A0while they\u0027re transporting and replacing the engine\u0027s core!? What\u0027s the reasoning behind it!?.\u00A0\u00A0It is explicitly stated that due to the Earth Engines\u0027 influence, the planet\u0027s rotation stopped, causing tsunamis all across the globe, devastating the surface and forces humanity to live underneath each of the engine city. By that point there\u0027s nothing alive on surface, only perpetual darkness and eternal blizzard that flash-freeze anyone wandering outside without protective suit. If the reason for minigun is for self-defense, a handgun is more than enough.

Since the Earth Engines that push Earth are facing towards the sun, this means that most of the Earth Engines are on the lit side of Earth, with only the torque engines approaching the dark side. However, the\u00A0engines are also mentioned to be powered by ordinary rocks burned using \u0022heavy fusion\u0022 technology. From John Elliot from the same article as above, it would also take 95% of the Earth\u0027s mass to power the entire 4.3 light year trip to the Alpha Centauri system.

No, planets cannot randomly increase in gravity. What\u0027s even more stupid is, the solution to escape from Jupiter\u0027s gravity? Ignite the atmosphere of Jupiter to propel Earth away. Igniting Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere would cause a shockwave strong enough to wreck the entire Earth.\u00A0The plan\u0027s outcome is even more devastating for the people on the surface of the planet. Assuming such a powerful explosion can even happen, an explosion powerful enough to push Earth away to allow it to overcome Jupiter\u0027s gravity while it\u0027s 30 minutes from breaching its roche limit would crush all the Earth Engines on the side of the planet that the shockwave hits, killing everyone who is currently on that side of Earth, sending shockwaves through the entire crust and probably caving in every underground city on the face of the globe, and leaving the world with one hell of a dent.
