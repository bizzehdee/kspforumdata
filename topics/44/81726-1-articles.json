With hydrogen, the exhaust is a mixture of H2 and atomic hydrogen, both of which move very fast. Likewise, methane and ammonia partially decompose, releasing some fast-moving hydrogen atoms that boost the ISP. Water doesn\u0027t work as well because oxygen forms stronger bonds with hydrogen than carbon or nitrogen do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn nitrogen, the two atoms are linked by a very strong triple bond, so it barely dissociates at all. This leaves you with an exhaust stream of nothing but diatomic nitrogen, which has a rather high molecular mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be posible to have on nerva with two sets of tanks, one for H2 and doing the mars transfer burn then using methane for the later burns?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would actually be quite effective, particularly if the empty hydrogen tanks were either jettisoned or refilled with methane manufactured on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
