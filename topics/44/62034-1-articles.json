They can still maintain two Mars rovers at once, even - Opportunity is a 10 year old rover with a broken wheel, two inoperable science instruments and a robotic arm that will only move with lots of good words and gentle coaxing. Yet they still have a team assigned to it full-time, and they are still receiving great results, especially since they also have Curiosity active which can verify or contrast the findings with a different set of instruments in a different geological location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a period of anxiety over maintaining existing missions as NASA\u0027s budget dropped year after year; eventually they would have to decide whether to keep existing missions running and don\u0027t do anything new, or terminate existing missions early in favor of occasionally doing something new. That point hasn\u0027t been reached, however, and NASA\u0027s budget actually went up this year as they got tasked with intensifying their space launch vessel development in the wake of a series of Chinese success stories that took some politicians outside their comfort zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I wouldn\u0027t worry so much.

Almost all the money is spent up-front, and the returns only start rolling in afterwards. Which is why decades-old missions like Cassini and Opportunity are by no means a waste of money... much to the contrary, they are among the most cost-efficient things NASA did. Sure, the instruments are old and low-resolution, but having lots and lots of low-res data is better than having nothing at all.
