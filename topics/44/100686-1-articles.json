This means the ISS project officially ends after 2024.\n\nThe USA have already approved the extension to 2024, so this is very good news for the ISS project. Even if it is to end in 2024, it was previously not known whether it would even run at all past 2020, considering the current political tensions between the US, Europe and Russia. With the two largest contributors confirming the extension, there\u0027s a very good chance for it to go through with the remaining three partners as well. Canada, Japan and the European Union are expected to give their answers no later than 2016; Germany at least has confirmed their committment, but not all of ESA\u0027s 21 other member nations are as convinced just yet. Still, I would be very surprised if any of them would pull out now, since this is basically \u0022the final funding round\u0022. Might as well give it that one last go, even if it\u0027s a bit expensive.\n\nThe extension is extra nice in the context of the crew size expansion due in 2018. Right now, the six crewmembers are very busy just running the station and don\u0027t have that much time for science; but a seventh crew member would be able to be dedicated 100% to science, allowing us to get that much more out of our orbiting laboratory. It would have been a bummer if that crew size could have only been run for one or two years. Now we get six years!\n\nAs for the future of cross-national orbital projects past 2024: China has been fishing for interest in their planned space station due to go up in the early 2020\u0027s. They want international partners to come and participate. Depending on the scale they plan for, which is as of yet not precisely defined, this might potentially result in an ISS-2 of some description."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T10:02:01Z","Content":"It\u0027s still nearly 10 years away.
