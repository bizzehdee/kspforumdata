Methane is going to be frozen out, and Helium won\u0027t be sufficiently abundant.\u00A0That leaves a Hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. And in plausible temperature ranges, that gives us upper limits on pressure in 1-10 bar, perhaps as high as 100 bar if there is a strong greenhouse effect, but that\u0027s a stretch already.\u00A0Anything else will condense and rain down as Liquid Hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are very low pressures. Conditions much closer to what we see on rocky worlds than gas giants. I\u0027ll grant you, that this is very unusual for a Gas/Ice Giant, or even a large Super-Earth, but only because our study is focused on much warmer worlds. We tend to see the smaller worlds have a solid surface, and large worlds have layers. But the boundary depends on size and temperature of the world. A good example, once again, is Venus. It\u0027s an Earth-sized world, but due to its temperature, it already starts exhibiting some of the features we expect of a large Super-Earth. Likewise, Nine should be an ice giant. And had it remained in the outer system, it would certainly be one of these layered planets with no well-defined surface. But with temperatures as lows they should be on that world, I expect an environment that at the first glance looks very terrestrial. A well-defined surface, either icy with lakes of Hydrogen, or a global Hydrogen ocean, and above it, an atmosphere of a few bar with clouds of Hydrogen mist. All on a world with a surface gravity 30%-50% higher than that on Earth. If it weren\u0027t for temperatures, I\u0027d say it\u0027d make a good world for a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wouldn\u0027t internal heating heat the interior up to the point where it would never be solid? I mean, solid hydrogen takes place at 14K. Does anybody have any idea how much the interior alone would\u0027ve at it up.. Neptune\u0027s heating is primarily internal, with the internal heating being 2.6x the external heating, leaving it at 72K at 1 bar. If it ends up being 40K (removing external heating entirely, and reducing the heat flux by 10K). That would be higher than either the points for Solid or liquid hydrogen. That\u00A0means the solid/liquid slush layer would be very deep in, perhaps 100-200 bar (Iom just making a guess for this one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T23:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222374329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453484473\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104935\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, cantab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA planet of the mass proposed is going to have a hot core from when it formed, which will be several thousand Kelvins. When the middle is that hot, whether the outside is at 20 K or 200 K doesn\u0027t make a lot of difference to how long it takes to cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether it has a solid surface then depends on how the gradients in pressure and temperature with depth compare to the melting point of whatever it is made of. There are I think two plausible structures. Either way there will be an outer atmosphere of helium and probably hydrogen. If that atmosphere is thin the pressure and temperature at its base will be such that methane is solid and there will be a solid surface. If the atmosphere is thick enough though it will grade into methane gas or supercritical fluid, with no solid surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering how much hydrogen and helium Neptune and Uranus have, at 15 Earth masses overall, I think for a planet of ten Earth masses the latter structure is *far* more likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it is best to consider what solid methane is like even at extreme cryogenic temperatures: it would have the mechanical strength of lard (lard at our temperature of course). A planets surface made of lard is not like anything we know of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso consider Uranus\u0027s cloud deck temperature is 120-55 k and it\u0027s black body temperature at its average distance from the sun (19.2 AU) is 90 K, Neptune is averaging 73 K, and its blackbody temperature at 30 AU is 72 K. So there is very little internal heating. This theorized planet is getting far less sunlight, enough equivalent to blackbody temperatures of 11-27 K. Using Neptune and Uranus as very poor rules of thumb as they don\u0027t have such wide temperature regimes, it is perfectly possible this planet has an average temperature below 20 K, and that hydrogen liquifies naturally. It could have a Helium atmosphere and hydrogen rain, seas of hydrogen-methane sludge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-22T23:53:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2016 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T23:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222374067\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453472779\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUranus is 15 times heavier than earth so I guess this will be like Uranus or Neptune but smaller,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif its in the smaller end it might not keep hydrogen and helium but have an fairly dense atmosphere like titan and ice surface, not an ice giant like Uranus and Neptune but more like an super earth or water planet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a guessing game.

Relevant values are the melting point, which varies with pressure, but not much. We can just take it at 14K. The triple point, which is about the same 14K, but at 7kPa, so we don\u0027t care about it. And the critical point, which is 12 bar and 32K. Between these 14K and 32K, actual boiling point is going to vary with pressure. It\u0027s only 20K at 1 bar. At this point, it becomes very important that Nine\u0027s atmosphere is almost pure Hydrogen. It\u0027s going to have some Helium in it, but not too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets picture what happens to 30 bar atmosphere at 25K. We look at the phase diagram, and at 25K, the vapor pressure of Hydrogen is 3.5 bar. That means, at anything above 3.5 bar, Hydrogen from atmosphere is going to condense into liquid. It\u0027s going to keep condensing, until pressure drops to 3.5 bar. There is absolutely no mechanism to stop it. Which means that at 25K, atmospheric pressure on Nine would be 3.5 bar. It can\u0027t get any higher. It can\u0027t really be lower, either, at least, until all Hydrogen from all the lakes boils off. That\u0027s a possibility, but I think there is enough H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E there to maintain pressure at 3.5 bar and have enough left over for lakes or oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelium in atmosphere would provide a touch of buffering. Technically, it\u0027s partial pressure of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E that\u0027s going to be at 3.5 bar, and total pressure would be slightly higher, because partial pressure of He would add to it. That would prevent things from being constantly at the threshold of boiling. It would also allow for things like cloud formation and weather. Though, I suspect, not particularly exciting weather, since the Solar power input is pretty low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are essentially two \u00A0possibilities here. First, Nine maintained most of the Hydrogen an Ice Giant would start out with. Given a thin atmosphere of 3.5 bar, most of that Hydrogen would end up on the surface, certainly flooding it all. That would result in an ocean world. Constant overcast, perpetual drizzle. Liquid Hydrogen from horizon to horizon. Not very exciting at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond possibility is much more fun. A catastrophic event, such as impact with one of the moons, could have knocked out a huge chunk of that atmosphere when Nine got ejected from the System. This could lead to a world with very little Hydrogen on its surface. The surface of such a world would be dominated by solid Methane, which forms Plastic Crystal at the above temperature and pressure. Which means surface will be solid, but soft. Hard to say just how much plasticity it will have at 25K, though. In either case, significant elevations are not possible, even if there is some tectonics.

Relevant values are the melting point, which varies with pressure, but not much. We can just take it at 14K. The triple point, which is about the same 14K, but at 7kPa, so we don\u0027t care about it. And the critical point, which is 12 bar and 32K. Between these 14K and 32K, actual boiling point is going to vary with pressure. It\u0027s only 20K at 1 bar. At this point, it becomes very important that Nine\u0027s atmosphere is almost pure Hydrogen. It\u0027s going to have some Helium in it, but not too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets picture what happens to 30 bar atmosphere at 25K. We look at the phase diagram, and at 25K, the vapor pressure of Hydrogen is 3.5 bar. That means, at anything above 3.5 bar, Hydrogen from atmosphere is going to condense into liquid. It\u0027s going to keep condensing, until pressure drops to 3.5 bar. There is absolutely no mechanism to stop it. Which means that at 25K, atmospheric pressure on Nine would be 3.5 bar. It can\u0027t get any higher. It can\u0027t really be lower, either, at least, until all Hydrogen from all the lakes boils off. That\u0027s a possibility, but I think there is enough H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E there to maintain pressure at 3.5 bar and have enough left over for lakes or oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelium in atmosphere would provide a touch of buffering. Technically, it\u0027s partial pressure of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E that\u0027s going to be at 3.5 bar, and total pressure would be slightly higher, because partial pressure of He would add to it. That would prevent things from being constantly at the threshold of boiling. It would also allow for things like cloud formation and weather. Though, I suspect, not particularly exciting weather, since the Solar power input is pretty low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are essentially two \u00A0possibilities here. First, Nine maintained most of the Hydrogen an Ice Giant would start out with. Given a thin atmosphere of 3.5 bar, most of that Hydrogen would end up on the surface, certainly flooding it all. That would result in an ocean world. Constant overcast, perpetual drizzle. Liquid Hydrogen from horizon to horizon. Not very exciting at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond possibility is much more fun. A catastrophic event, such as impact with one of the moons, could have knocked out a huge chunk of that atmosphere when Nine got ejected from the System. This could lead to a world with very little Hydrogen on its surface. The surface of such a world would be dominated by solid Methane, which forms Plastic Crystal at the above temperature and pressure. Which means surface will be solid, but soft. Hard to say just how much plasticity it will have at 25K, though. In either case, significant elevations are not possible, even if there is some tectonics. This means that entire planet would be lowlands, either resembling Titan with its lakes, or an endless marsh. Weather on a world like this could have more familiar patterns with partial cloud cover and actual weather systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond version being more exciting also happens to be less likely, unfortunately.
