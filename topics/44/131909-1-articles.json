You\u0027ll also want something that can react at least a little with atmospheric air so that you can run fuel-rich from Mach 0.7\u00A0up to Mach 4 or so and get a little airbreathing assist. And you can\u0027t sacrifice too much ISP because air-augmentation\u00A0is going to run out when your velocity equals your actual exhaust velocity, and at that point you\u0027re still depending on the same engine for orbital insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if your primary working maas from launch to Mach 10\u002B is going to be diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen, should you use a low-molecular weight fuel or something with really high heat capacity? Air augmentation is about delivering as much thermal energy to an airstream as possible, which is different from the usual vacuum rocket optimization parameters.\u00A0What fuel will have optimal mixing in a duct? Would it be feasible/advantageous to use a triprop design, with a denser oxidizer for takeoff\u00A0and max air augmentation and cryolox for the upper portion of the flight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts/analysis would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-12T02:40:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2016 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lobe","CreatedById":78710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T04:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Earth the combination is nearly unethical in all regards.
