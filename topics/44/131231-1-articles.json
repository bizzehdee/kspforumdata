Take that away and essentially, any sort of punch is throwing your opponent away from you while shoving you away from your opponent. So, to hit somebody, you need to apply two forces: One that keeps your opponent in place or forces them towards your attack, and the attack force itself. This might sound familiar if you\u2019ve ever seen a hockey fight; hockey enforcers need to hold onto each other to land a solid punch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there are new vistas of incapacitating your opponent if you get creative. For example, the old Superman trick of throwing somebody off the planet would actually work in zero-g; a good hard shove with your legs would send them flying off into space. Alternatively, mess with their balance; grab them and spin them as fast as possible until they\u2019re disoriented. Or until they\u2019re barfing, either works. Or if you wanted to get really nasty, put their center of mass in a spin, and then grab an arm or a leg and keep it from going with them. A dislocated limb tends to take the fight out of people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not just that, we also have to think about other aspects, such as how to transfer the maximum amount of force to your punches and kick - would a spin kick be more effective due to centrifugal force? Would simply increasing your total mass deliver more forces behind your punches, making an obese fighter as effective as a muscular fighter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this thought experiment, let us assume we are having a space fight club in some frontier asteroid colony, no artificial gravity, and using a spherical cage arena.

For the sake of argument, I\u0027m assuming that the only factor here that is different from earth-bound martial arts is the gravity. This means the fight is performed indoors, spacesuits are either not worn or sufficiently supple to allow (almost) complete freedom of movement, life support is either not an issue (indoors with the entire room/station under life support) or sufficiently small and fortified to the point that trying to disable it bare-handed is futile and no RCS thrusters or mechanical means of movement are possible/allowed. Everything is done through your own human strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m basically imagining a normal dojo/training room inside a station where the participants wear normal sparring outfits suited to their discipline.

Those bouts can then\u00A0be broken up by one the combatants pushing off hard against the other to send them both flying in opposite direction, after which the whole thing starts over. free-floating grappling bouts may occasionally occur, but fights at the edges of the arena seem like they would occur most commonly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main thing to note in zero-g is that newton\u0027s third law is very much still in effect: ever action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every punch you throw sends you backwards as well. That also means that your punches hit a whole lot less hard then on earth. On earth, when you throw a punch, the fact that friction and gravity keep you and your opponent in place means that a whole lot of the energy in the punch is translated into deforming the opponent\u0027s body rather than pushing it away. In space, that friction and gravity isn\u0027t there (assuming you\u0027re both floating) so a lot more energy will be put \u00A0into moving the opponent and less into deforming (hurting) him. It\u0027s kind of comparable to hitting a falling bowling ball with a baseball bat vs hitting a pingpong ball with the same bat. In case of the bowling ball, stuff breaks. In case of the pingpong ball, it flies away relatively intact (this comparison is not ideal by ANY means because the reason behind it\u00A0is inertia instead of friction/gravity, but it\u0027s the best I could come up with).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how do you punch someone in zero-g? you hold him by an extremity with one hand and hit the center of mass with the other (or another body part, but center of mass seems most efficient at first glance). This way you stop him from moving away and all the energy you put into the punch is translated into trying to deform the opponent\u0027s body: one impact on the stomach, the other is a pulling force on his arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpinning someone is a very interesting idea as it uses the opponent\u0027s mass and inertia against him. Disorientation and dislocating joints is a great way to exploit zero-g environments, but there is\u00A0one problem: if you try to spin him, you\u0027ll spin in the opposite direction just as fast\u00A0unless you have something to brace against. So disorienting by spinning only works if you can get him to spin without doing so yourself. And that, again, means bracing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion: there\u0027s two very important things (according to me. I\u0027m in no way an expert on zero-g fighting, I could be wrong on this):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) bracing yourself: if you are braced against \u00A0something and the opponent is not, you have the advantage. You can push and twist the opponent around, and he can\u0027t do the same to you\u00A0(providing that whatever you are bracing against is heavy enough to slow down your inertia by a whole lot, like\u00A0the room/station wall).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) no straight up punches (unless you want to separate from each other): any punch thrown without holding the opponent will result in both of you flying in opposite directions. Grappling is key when you want to hurt him, getting out of his grapple and punching/kicking off is critical when you are in a bad spot and want to reset the fight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s actually a manga that i\u0027ve read once that does quite a lot of theorycrafting on martial arts in space and zero-G. I think it\u0027s called \u0022battle angel alita\u0022 in the english translation. Don\u0027t let the title put you off, it\u0027s actually quite an interesting read. Enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhew, lots of text.

The reason for this is, again, every time they try to throw a punch or spin the opponent, they\u0027ll spin or be thrown back too. Only, if the inertia of one of the two fighters is significantly lower than the other, that one will spin/fly a whole lot faster. So if they\u0027re freefloating, a lightweight and sumowrestler trying to spin and disorient each other will result in a fast-spinning and motion-sick lightweight and a gently rotating sumowrestler. Lightweight MUST try to brace, sumowrestler can just go in without bracing. Strength isn\u0027t really a big factor since all movements can be done at a fraction of the effort they would cost on earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, space martial artists would benefit from being heavy. Space sumowrestling is the future ladies and gentlemen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
