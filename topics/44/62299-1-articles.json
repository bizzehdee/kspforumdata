That\u0027s absolutely irrelevant. Could you make a black hole with enough angular momentum? Easily. Electron\u0027s L/m is already over this limit. Just feed it a polarized stream of electrons, and you\u0027ll have a black hole with too much angular momentum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this was just a demonstration of \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E there are obvious problems. If we assume Kerr metric to continue into interior of the black hole, there are way more problems with that. There are CTCs in the interior regions even without naked singularity. So if you\u0027ve fallen into a sufficiently large rotating black hole to not be shredded by the tidal forces, there is a trajectory you can fly to go back and meet yourself from before you flew that trajectory. Then fly it again, and meet the two of previous you. And then keep doing this so that you can throw a big party for yourselves. And then, maybe you can find the you from the other universe, because interior of the Kerr metric has two exteriors, only one of which is our space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s crazy stuff. But like I said, the most important fact is that Kerr metric in the interior is \u003Cem\u003Eknown\u003C/em\u003E not to be stable. It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the interior solution for the rotating black hole. So what\u0027s a Kerr black hole above the horizon, is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a Kerr black hole bellow the horizon. Which puts the whole question of a ring singularity rather up in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat is a true singularity if not a purely mathematical concept?
