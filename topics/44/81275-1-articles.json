I\u0027d love links to explanations about mechanical springiness and how they apply to large structures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand things correctly, if you have a large structure made of lots of pieces of metal like a large orbiting rocket, when you do something to perturb the system, there\u0027s a delayed response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, suppose the large structure is just floating in orbit. You then activate a large rocket engine connected to the structure. This new force will compress the metal structural elements near the engine, and those compressed structural elements will compress the elements adjacent to themselves, and so on down the line. A compressional wave will travel all the way to the end of the rocket and return. Since no realistic large rocket is perfectly symmetrical, some of these forces end up causing twisting the structure slightly. The twisted structure makes the rocket engine no longer point \u0022straight\u0022, which leads to off center thrust, which can lead to the ship turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying the game, large structures becoming increasingly difficult to control. You can make all your burns very low thrust, but that makes them take hours, and the way the game is programmed, physical timewarp sacrifices accuracy and ghost forces will tear your ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose it\u0027s a future world where we have the technology to build huge spaceships. Maybe exotic engines such as nuclear salt water/black holes or even \u0022cheat\u0022 engines that don\u0027t need propellant are available. Can you manufacture an ocean liner sized spaceship that won\u0027t wobble around as it flies? How would you construct it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game seems to simulate physical springiness at the joints between components rather than internal to the components themselves. I would assume no real rocket is going to use discrete parts that are rigid bodies with floppy joints. You\u0027d bolt or weld all the sub components together so the only source of wobble is compression of the structural elements themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to build dampers into a structure to soak up compressional disturbances so that they don\u0027t cause the overall structure to jerk around? Or perhaps increase thrust on a rocket engine very slowly so that there\u0027s no sudden change that causes the initial compression in the first place. This game seems to throttle up near instantly, perhaps that is part of the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final question. Docking ports in this game, which are needed to connect multi-part ships launched as separate pieces, add huge amounts of wobble. Has NASA or another real space agency ever designed docking ports that connect the two vehicles together more securely, say with big bolts that automatically screw from one spacecraft into another, or some other method of mechanical attachment? You would need this if you ever wanted to build a vehicle constructed of many small components that you wanted to send on a trajectory to Mars with an interplanetary burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T02:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, any large structure will wobble. Ever been at the top of the skyscraper on a windy day? There is nothing you can do to stop it completely. What you can do is prevent resonances, because that\u0027s the way such oscillations can build up to exceed structural strength. Happened to some bridges in the part. Happens to rocket engines all the time while they are being developed. Problem for rocket overall as well. But it\u0027s the sort of problem that can be solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, there are two problems. First, devs decided to use Unity\u0027s joint system to hold things together. That wasn\u0027t necessary, as one can use rigid physics to simulate the rocket, and it would fly like a single solid object. And yes, you can still compute stress on a structure like that, and still waste fewer resources than KSP does. And while yes, there is some realism to how KSP rockets behave, and real rocket would behave much in the same way if engineers building it didn\u0027t think it through, with real world rockets we have way more control over how the structure is built, down to which materials are used where, as well as in how the rocket is controlled. This is the second part of the problem. KSP uses a very simple algorithm to keep the orientation of the rocket consistent. It\u0027s a modification of the PID algorithm. While it\u0027s possible to tune a PID algorithm to play nice with your structure, the PID parameters in the game are fairly generic. That means that oscillations induced by the PID can hit a resonance with one of the normal modes of your structure, and the whole thing will fly to hell no matter how many struts you put in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, these are some of the major differences. In short, yes, KSP physics is pretty realistic with regards to wobble, but because we don\u0027t have the right tools for fighting it, it would actually be more realistic overall to go with a rigid body physics and get rid of the wobble all together. But hey, it\u0027s a game, and this is one of the game\u0027s challenges, intended or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p331083","CreatedById":57783,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T03:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot possible.

Question : if you simulated rockets as a single monolithic rigid body, how \u003Cem\u003Ewould \u003C/em\u003Eyou model the wobble? I\u0027ve read about methods to compute stress computationally. One method is called the Applied Element model, and it sounds straightforward : you break the thing being simulated into separate subcomponents and you have each subcomponent apply the various vectors of stress to their neighbors. One logical method of division would be to create as many elements as a typical CPU can support. So if you discover a 100 element model is the limit, you\u0027d divide \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E rocket into 100 elements. This means that bigger rockets effectively have lower resolution for their structural analysis - but their parts are bigger and stronger, so it might work out ok. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for wobble : could you treat each model in the game as a giant spring, and actually move the vertices along the direction of compressional stress? I read this game allows you to do very easy rescaling where you simply adjust the coordinates by a fixed factor - I saw a snippet of code that does this, and it\u0027s super easy. To go from 1.25 meter to 2 meter everything just doubles in size. So if you have a component experiencing N Newtons of stress, and you know it\u0027s \u0022springiness factor\u0022 will cause it to compress by 0.01 times N, then you would realtime rescale the object so that it gets slightly shorter visually to reflect it compressing under the load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p331083\u0022 data-cite=\u0022p331083\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot possible.

Just static stress. You compute forces required to keep the object rigid. In a real rocket, these forces are the various kinds of stress in the parts. These stresses correspond to part deformation. If there is a lot of deformation, you see the structure bend. KSP\u0027s simulation is similar. Parts themselves don\u0027t deform, but they shift relative to each other as if if they did, because joints have a bit of a slack to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a rigid body approach, you assume that deformations are zero. You still have corresponding stress, but the structure doesn\u0027t bend under it. This isn\u0027t quite as realistic, but if the real rocket bends enough for it to be visually obvious, something went \u003Cem\u003Ehorribly wrong\u003C/em\u003E. So for a game, it really wouldn\u0027t be a problem to simply always display the structure as if it is perfectly rigid. This has additional benefit. Because the structure doesn\u0027t actually bend, you don\u0027t end up with various induced oscillations due to PID and thruster behavior. So essentially, you\u0027ve just killed all of the sources of resonance. So while the model you use isn\u0027t as realistic in terms of physics, it gives you result that\u0027s much closer to what a well-engineered rocket should behave is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way you compute constraint forces is by solving a constrained dynamics problem.

Also, on the way things are inter-connected. If we ignore struts, the way things are connected in KSP, you can get away with deformation tensor per part for a very good approximation. You\u0027d need a custom shader to go along with that, but it\u0027s easy enough even under Unity. Struts would then simply have to be whatever length they need to be to connect the two points.

You\u0027re correct in your understanding of stress waves and elastic reactions in structures, it does need to be given careful consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers divide this kind of thing into two classes of problem, statics and dynamics. A static analysis will generally use tools such as finite element analysis that you mention. This allows us to model things like the distribution of stress intensity within a part. While stress intensity can also tell you how it will deform engineers are first and foremost looking to prevent failure. The geometry of a part affects the stress intensity, it\u0027s concentrated around sharp bends and holes, for example. So a finite element model would be built with this in mind, at the level of components or assemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets however have the additional problem of being very dynamic. Like I said I\u0027m not familiar with their design process, but I would imagine that individual assemblies are designed so that they perform to certain tolerances, then these assemblies are considered as discrete elements in a larger model, with the performance they were specified to have. In other words, a large assembly like a fuel tank might be considered as a single element in a larger dynamic analysis to have certain elastic properties, because the entire tank was simulated in detail in a model specifically for the tank.

That means that \u0022but that would be heavy\u0022 is, by itself, usually enough to rule out solutions that have it as a disadvantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wings of basically every single modern passenger airplane are actually designed to flex a certain amount in flight. Wings that don\u0027t flex would weigh a lot more, which would mean taking either less payload or less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s actually most of the reason that airplanes and rockets are built with aluminum alloys, Al/Li alloys, and titanium alloys, instead of steel alloys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might take more volume of those alloys to get the same strength as steel, but it will still end up weighing less overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the goal is \u0022As light as possible while still remaining safe\u0022. Most of the \u0022remaining safe\u0022 part is handled by making the parts a little bit stronger than absolutely required, and then manufacturing the part to be as close to exactly that strong as possible. Strength takes mass, after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a part that is required to take a 1 kN tension load will be designed to fail at 1.25 kN tension, giving a 25% safety margin. In extreme cases such as safety critical parts, there can be 200% safety margin or more. Usually that\u0027s only seen when failure of the part will result in catastrophic failure of the entire device, and multiples of the same part won\u0027t help or can\u0027t be done (space constraints, failure of any one of them results in same catastrophic failure no matter how many of them there are, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you make a structure TOO rigid, it will fracture instead of bending. That\u0027s NEVER a good thing. Bent parts can be unbent. Fractured parts can only be repaired by welding or use of a patch panel. Both of those options are weaker than an unbent part. Of course, a bent and unbent part will be weaker than a part that wasn\u0027t bent in the first place, but that can often be solved by reapplication of the heat treatment used on the original part, if any. If there was no heat treatment originally, it should be annealed to remove any work hardening that happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-edit-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Seret\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Seret\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDampers for what purpose?

Back in the days of Apollo, this was a lot harder, since you pretty much needed to build the thing and test it. Things become a little more complicated when a lot of different elements are all adding to the chaos, but in general solutions such as large dampers or computer controlled compensation are not necessary since you would have to have a general idea of what you are trying to compensate, and if you do, you could prevent those oscillations in the first place.
