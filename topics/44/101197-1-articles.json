How come the angle of the newly formed photon following a mirror trajectory/bouncing off at the same but opposite angle it arrived?\n\nViewing light as a solely particle phenomenon, you\u0027re going to run into things that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make sense. Like everything else, electromagnetic radiation is a wave phenomenon, and you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t understand how it works without acknowledging this.\n\nLet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s look at a partial example of how light reflects off of a perfect electric conductor (PEC). The electric field must go to zero in a perfect electric conductor. Metals are very close to being PECs, which is why they are \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cshiny\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 when polished smooth as compared to the wavelength of light. A PEC can support a surface charge, so they can have electric fields that are normal to their surface, but any tangential electric fields are neutralized by the flow of charge. Furthermore, the accumulation of surface charges screens any normal electric fields and prevents them from penetrating into the PEC.\n\nFor simplicity, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll only show you half of a solution- I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll only look at electric fields and one polarization case, but it will hopefully get the point across. Imagine an incident electromagnetic wave coming in from a random angle. In this example, the polarization is such that the electric field is tangential to the surface of the PEC. When that electromagnetic wave reaches the surface of the PEC, the boundary condition of the PEC- that tangential electric fields go to zero- forces the surface to \u0022launch\u0022 a reflected wave that exactly cancels out the electric field right at the surface boundary. There are boundary conditions that apply for magnetic fields too, and that relate them to surface currents, and these are equally important, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m trying to keep things simple here, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m only presenting half of the solution. Suffice it to say, the boundary conditions set that the direction of the reflected wave follows the law of reflection (the angle is the same but opposite). But hopefully, this example should get the point across that you really can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ignore the wave nature of light.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Did I not state: \u0022(absorbed and re-emitted by atoms enroute)\u0022 ???\n\nBut it\u0027s not true that the *same* photons were absorbed and re-emitted in route. The photons are absorbed and their identities- as much as they can be said to have identities- is gone. The photons that are re-emitted are of a different wavelength, and contain different quantum information. They are *entirely* different particles. Imagine that you shine an invisible ultraviolet laser beam (just as an example, but any light source of any wavelength would do for this example) on a piece of metal and heat that metal until it\u0027s glowing red-hot, then turn the laser off and record the photons emitted by the heated metal. The metal continues to glow even though the laser is off, because energy is stored in vibrations of the particles that make the metal up. The photons emitted by the red hot metal are NOT coherent ultraviolet laser light. They are entirely different photons, and emitted at a spread of wavelengths determined by the temperature of the metal and Planck\u0027s law for thermal blackbody radiation. THAT is what is going on inside the Sun. It is entirely false to claim that photons in the center of the Sun can ever make it to the surface. It is only the *energy* produced in the center of the Sun makes it the surface.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T16:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T15:54:29Z","Content":"Quite important to get some better view on the absorption - reemittance : p-p chain in Sun (that gives Sun it\u0027s enourmous luminosity) produces gamma rays, yet the radiation from the surface of Sun peaks up in yellow - green portion of visible wavelength.
