It\u0027s obvious that the future big projects will probably follow in ISS footsteps, that is international cooperation. And by big projects I mean next generation of space stations and/or missions to Mars or asteroids (including flybys and landing on Mars moons). But the question remains - will it be possible? Let\u0027s analyze the situation in terms of the potential manned flights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. NASA - without clear goal (asteroid? Moon? LEO? nothing?), with overpriced SLS and MPCV in development but with great experience in both manned and unmanned missions; currently lacking any real political support and money, but it\u0027s possible to imagine that good ol\u0027NASA can still do great things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Roskosmos - again great amount of experience, probably the best spacecraft ever built (Soyuz) but again severe problems with funding; there are plans to develop new LEO spacecraft (PPTS) as well as the new rocket familiy (Angara). Perhaps a new space station in the next decade\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. ESA - Ariane family and ATV, of course; unlikely to lead any new initiative but definitely a trustworthy partner for other space agencies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. JAXA - there are plans to rate HTV as a manned vehicle, but besides this just like ESA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. CSA and other space agencies - will definitely join the new international project if it suits them (money or equipment for the project in exchange (for example) for a place onboard and opportunity to do some experiments)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we have CNSA, which is going to launch its own space station in a next few years and proved to be able to send taikonauts to space and return them safely. China has also real motivation, unlike the other agencies (to prove its superpower status) and resources to realize its goals. Even landing on a Moon in the next 15-20 years is quite possible, if only the leaders would like to make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we can see, CNSA have two things which other agencies are lacking, that is money and motive. One has to wonder, wouldn\u0027t the cooperation between the biggest players (NASA, Roskomos, etc.) and CNSA be beneficial to everyone? On the other hand, there is a rapidly developing private sector capable of sending cargo to orbit (Dragon from SpaceX and soon Cygnus from OSC) and well known problem of China stealing the know-how and technologies from the developed countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo knowing all this, is it possible that, say, NASA (still the leading space agency) and CNSA will create a joint mission? In almost all sci-fi novels from the Cold War period (that is, most of the sci-fi novels) the USA and USSR are frequently shown cooperating (Space Odyssey for example). It was only natural - only these two superpowers had the ability to execute realy big projects. Now when the USSR is (fortunately) long dead, it\u0027s obvious that only China can fill this gap right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut will it happen?
