So much scifi has humans spreading love, the greatest and most unique gift the species has to offer, across an otherwise cold and heartless galaxy. Captain Jack, one of the first humans to explore the galaxy, and kind of immortal too, spread love at every possible opportunity but in a more tangible way than some other scifi would present.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommy99534","CreatedById":6162,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T17:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScrew being stored in a robot, I\u0027ll just steal Radigan Cohnagers blueprints and build a life extending machine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T18:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ecat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ecat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA sweeping statement.\u003Cp\u003ERemember H1N1? iirc Both it and the Spanish flu of 1918 killed more young than old through overreaction of their immune systems, perhaps our longevity treatment will have the same effect?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can compare a hyptotethical treatment that MIGHT exist to the flu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF it will be done with virusses, it will be adenoviruses (if I remember that correct, could have mixed up virus types).

Presumably they would be designed to repair telomeres. From there, you just let the body continue replacing damaged cells. One of the things that causes cell division to start to fail due to faults in their genetic coding is little things called free radicals that bombard the DNA over the years. That may be something else that needs to be addressed, but death from old age is mostly due to organ failure after cells stop dividing when the DNA comes undone when the telemeres reach a point of irreparable damage, having been opened and closed over and over again ever time the cell has divided in the past.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll never be able to remove free radicals, as metabolism itself produces most of the radicals you find in the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for telemeres, it will probably be easier to reactivate telemorease in the celltypes that don\u0027t have it.
