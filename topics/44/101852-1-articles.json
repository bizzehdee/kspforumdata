Can\u0027t you use just a little bottle of wodka to put into your drinks? Isn\u0027t that just a scam?\n\nEdit:\n\nOn wikipedia it says that powder can hold 60% of its own weight in alcohol. So If you have a 1 kg (!) of that stuff, you have 375g of alkohol. That is less than you have in 1 liter of wodka. And 1 kg of that stuff sounds like an insane amount. You sure don\u0027t save any transport weight by using it. How much does it cost?\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, it clearly is a scam. They market it as if it would be more portable. People jump to the conclusion it would be like concentrated alcohol in powdered form, and they just need to take a small package of powder instead of a big bottle. They say a \u0022liquid is often not convinient\u0022 and that powder would safe space and weight.....\n\nClearly it is not. You don\u0027t save space and you don\u0027t save weight.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T10:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by N\\_las**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T11:32:35Z","Content":"Alcoholic lollipops.

So instead of buying 50 Liter alcohol fuel at the gas station, you buy at lest the same amount of weight in form of powder. Imagine having big sacks of powder to fill into your car, instead of a simple liquid. And you to add water, you have to mix the fuel yourself in your car.
