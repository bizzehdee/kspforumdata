Caramelization has been found to be a function of both temperature and time.

The temperature of the melted mixture is significantly lower than KNSU, which results in an improved safety margin with regard to overheating. Lower casting temperature also leads to the significant advantage of less rapid freeze-up of the melted slurry, which results in a better cast product with fewer voids or air bubbles. Since KNSB propellant does not caramelize, the pot life is essentially unlimited. This makes it very suitable for casting very large propellant grains. The largest KNSB powered motor that has been successfully fired to date is a\u00A0300 mm static test motor\u00A0built by Rick Maschek which contained two grain segments, each having a propellant mass of 55 kg (121 lbs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mechanical properties of cast KNSB propellant are similar to sucrose-based KNSU and dextrose-based KNDX propellants, that is, rigid and brittle. The tensile strength, however, is appreciable. As such, the structural integrity of a grain made from this material is substantial, and if reasonable care is taken in the design and support of the grain in the motor chamber, large grains are capable of withstanding the high acceleration loads imparted by flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hygroscopic tendency to absorb moisture from the air is significantly less than that of the sucrose-based KNSU propellant and is slightly better in this regard than KNDX. It appears that there is a relative humidity threshold that determines whether or not a KNSB grain will be hygroscopic. I have observed that when the humidity is low (less than 50%) that KNSB propellant left in the open air will remain bone dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance of KNSB propellant is theoretically similar to that of both the KNSU and KNDX propellants. It is however important to coat KNSB burning surfaces with ignition primer and to provide adequate inter-segment spacing of the grain segments in a motor. This is a consequence of bare KNSB being hesitant to ignite. With this approach, KNSB delivered performance is consistent with performance predictions and comparable to that of KNSU and KNDX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
