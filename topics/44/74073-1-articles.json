Reason and logic do not know culture, and they are \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E relative. In fact the idea that morality is not objective and is entirely subjective such that it varies from culture-to-culture and each culture is \u0022right\u0022 has been discussed at great length; what you are describing is called Cultural Relativism. While it still has its proponents, moral relativism as a whole has pretty much been shredded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me give you an example. Say someone steals a loaf of bread from a store. There are two people, each from different cultures, who are asked what an appropriate punishment would be. One person\u0027s cultural heritage suggests that the one who stole should pay a small fine for the act. The other\u0027s cultural heritage demands that the person be stoned to death in a public square. By the standard of a cultural relativist, both of these moral decisions are right. However a moral absolutist would conclude that there is in fact a right course of action, and that right course of action is independent of cultural tradition. In fact most of the progress we\u0027ve managed to make in law is due to moral absolutism; it\u0027s what lets us say \u0022Murder is wrong\u0022 instead of \u0022Murder is wrong in this country but it\u0027s okay that the government of that other country is killing all its citizens, that\u0027s just their culture\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason and logic are \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E relative, they are universal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If you want to see where moral relativism leads, look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emurder of Kitty Genovese\u003C/a\u003E. She was brutally murdered in a New York street, in view and earshot of thirty-seven people. Those people, when asked why they didn\u0027t call the police, said they expected someone else would do it, or just didn\u0027t want to get involved. In both moral relativism and cultural relativism, their actions to not do anything to help her were morally right, because either they decided that that was the right choice (the former) or that they had a culture of not calling the police when someone was murdered outside their window (the latter), or of \u0022not getting involved\u0022 (also the latter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are better arguments to be made against relativism but this is the easiest way to drive the point home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-04T06:29:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2014 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T07:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am enlightened.
