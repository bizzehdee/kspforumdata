I\u0027m going to start off by stating that since we know that venus is like living hell, than we need to consider how in the world we would terraform venus in the first place. Venus\u0027s atmosphere is made up of sulphiric acid (commonly found in batteries) so just putting something on venus would be extremely difficult as all machinery made out of metal would corrode very quickly, and be extremely inneficient. We would have to do the opposite of mars, and cool the atmosphere, we definitely know how to do this, but it takes an extremely inefficient amount of trouble to do so and would mean we would have to lessen it\u0027s already thick atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith your idea, it would probably make sense but i highly doubt that it\u0027s atmosphere would change except for the elements in it that are already close to solidification or sublimation. Even then we would have a massive amount of work to do. There is no oxygen on venus, if so, miniscule amounts, but the amount of carbon dioxide in venus would pretty much kill plants because there is so much. The sunlight on venus is very dangerous. And the atmospheric pressure is equivalent to that 3,000 feet beneath the ocean, so any structures built on it\u0027s surface would have to be incredibly strong. Although this is a great idea, it just ins\u0027t practical in science, unless you know I get frozen in cryonics and wake up 1,000 years from now to our superiority of space elements. But like I said this is an extremely expoundable subject and keep up the great thinking!
