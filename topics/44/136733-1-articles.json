The reality is that if it was about science, they\u0027d be pitching an international sample-return mission sans astronauts, not a stunt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T17:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222525050\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461162959\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00227272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Nibb31 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nESA\u0027s total annual budget is about $4.5 billion.\u00A0There is no way ESA member states will agree to give ESA\u00A0the same\u00A0budget that NASA gets, so there is no way ESA can ever contribute to an international project as much as NASA does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy naut?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222525099\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461164208\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty down on Orion/SLS, for example, but I think the SM should not be coming from ESA.
