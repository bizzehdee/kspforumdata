As long as space travel consumes resources at a gluttonous rate (mostly propellant with tanks) they will never ever have a world where space travel is as common as flying in passenger jets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is especially true in settings where spaceships do not require propellant as we know it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern economic methods even break with such a scifi civillization, since if space travel is that cheap, you do not need to mine stuff for resources for on site utilization. It is arguably cheaper to just haul everything you need with you and make it super resusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining is still reasonable if you\u0027re\u00A0 turning an asteroid into a new \u0027house\u0027 (habitat) in space, or if trying to colonize a mars-like world is the goal. But hauling tons of asteroid platinum ore from space back to the homeworld is also viable too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my point is that for a scifi massive space faring civilization, extreme technological reusability is their main requirement they would need to even exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnology usefulness would be rated for durability and reuseability. \u00A0Both of which would need a low enough resource threshold that space travel is common.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat this would imply is massive leaps in technological growth as well as associated indusry. To the point where extremely durable and reusuable technology becomes affordable to most on a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be sure, modern tech would be considered primitive more because of it\u0027s lack of extreme reusability and extreme durability than whether or not it works optimally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I say extreme durability and reuseabilty, I am implying tech continuous use rates without needing repair that is on pair with biological systems.\u00A0 Biological systems are a form of technology considerably more advanced than anything man does, inasmuch it can replicate itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also takes years before a human body begins degenerating while operating, never turning off the whole time (sleep is still an operation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuper advanced technology should be on the same order of magnitude, with the added bonus of an off switch to increase the total operational lifetime when not in use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, a car can drive for hours before needing to turn off and refuel. To drive for years on end, decades even?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat... is akin to biological operation copied as technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be the biggest tech game changer to me when it comes to scifi tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot what is done, but for how long without turning it off to recharge or refill, and whether or not reproduction of the\u00A0technology\u00A0is possible using the same tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTech that can operate continuously for years on end without repair and can reproduce itself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust... wow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive me a computer that can do that and you would have a\u00A0library that would NEVER lose information since it is always growing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive me a car that can do that and I would never have to buy a car twice unless I wanted a different type altogther (car reproduction at work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah... wow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think on this matter? Because I think it matters little if you have AM or warp drive or even FTL if reusuability is not far better than what we have now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would or should scale up I think.\u00A0 Not down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the only other option is manual reproduction (which is what we already do), which involves using raw resources to create new tech upon failure of old tech from continuous operation without shutting it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-03T14:56:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2020 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-03T15:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the reproduction is not exactly manual (though, depends...), the quantum mechanics gives us a wave function which can make the faring much faster, just properly collapse it in desired place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeads - you\u0027re there, tails - still here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN_vPgTzfS39-ItEbmgDx\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022225\u0022 width=\u0022225\u0022 src=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN_vPgTzfS39-ItEbmgDxAZ-F3Q_c8fvP1rw\u0026amp;usqp=CAU\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepeat while still here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SOXBLOX","CreatedById":204106,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-04T02:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re suggesting biotech, then forget it.
