But then there\u0027s water and its recycling, an environmental control system (oxygen, filtering, temperature and humidity control), medical facilities, exercise equipment, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure I want to use ISS numbers because that station is larger than what we\u0027d send to Mars, not that I can even find those numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-07T04:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nucleartherm1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p5bihMOGYDY/UDEUdW3SjUI/AAAAAAAAX5E/5L_QGXm0uDs/s1600/nucleartherm1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what the Mars DRA has for a transit vehicle (top). They are around 10m in diameter. This is for 6 people (this shows nuke propulsion, but they have the same crew portions for chemical as well). Call it on the order of a hitchhiker per kerbal, plus your transfer vehicle(s), and a lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T13:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
