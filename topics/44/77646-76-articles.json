Mazon Del can you give your input.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a reasonable enough approximation (some had little domes in the top or side for their lens), however the diameter of the container is much larger than necessary. 5-8 mm in diameter is probably sufficient depending on our desires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMBobrik: Ah, sorry, thought I hit that one. The answer is we could, but we\u0027d have to do quite a lot of testing to have confidence that the samples won\u0027t slide around or anything inside the holding space. The containers were designed to allow for jostling of the contents to some extent. We would of course need to test that configuration as well, just to verify that it meets our needs. One thing we have to remember is that unless the containers are being held in some sort of gimbal (it wouldn\u0027t be too hard to make one out of plastic and a thin \u0027captured\u0027 nail to be honest) on the ring, then chances are our best way of storing them during the ascent is to have the axis of the cylinder in line with the expected axis of thrust. Meaning that all the samples will try to end up on one of the walls. With the starting sucrose/moss mixture, this \u0022should\u0022 be minimized though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sample containers themselves are, by design, open to the air around them. Though they can be sealed off if our needs require it. However, it would probably be best if we keep them open and have the ring area be contained. This way we can get air quality and gas-distribution information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moss itself actually utilizes very little air over a given period of time, mostly because its what we are starting with is going to be barely visible to the human eye and by the end of 2-4 weeks, should fill most of the 5mm x 5mm cylinder. \u0022Most\u0022 is describing the good kind, where it is a \u0027fully grown\u0027 plant that gets us our data, not the kind of \u0027most\u0027 that implies we now have a cylinder of moss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrOnak: What is my current plan is that once we have settled on a tentative design for the growth chamber, I will print/build a mockup version of it. Luis will then provide me with some samples of moss to let grow inside the chamber for several weeks while I collect some data using instruments I have (we can cheat and have non-flight equipment here as long as the data collected somewhat resembles what we will be getting). With that data and the samples, Luis can apply (and believes he will easily get considering how long he\u0027s poked at them about the topic) NASA funding to have at least one grad student devoted towards breeding the specialized versions of moss that have an extreme gravitometric response in the up/down/perpendicular directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this mockup, once Luis has the data he needs to apply for the NASA funding, I can torture the daylights out of the moss to get design data for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewt: I think you are under the impression that people want to mount the camera onto the ring. The currently discussed method is that the cameras are fixed and will not move, and the ring will rotate to change which sample is in view of the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf MBobrik\u0027s calculations hold true, then there isn\u0027t really any reason we couldn\u0027t add a couple more cameras for both spare reasons and weight distribution reasons.

Where did the 100W figure came from? But regardless I believe starting a mockup experiment right now here on earth would be very useful, coupling with a camera test. I still feel one picture an hour came out of nowhere, from my very limited biology knowledge I recall moss gre quite fast. @Mbobrik, that data transfer calculations ignore power constraints, are you sure we can afford beaming down that many images every orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@deljr15, that idea is pretty accurate, though it brings back up some old discussions. Since the sample ring (that looks like a donut, or a tube, what do we call it?) Is going to be circular, the gravitational gradient will not be negligible like it is on Earth. I calculated the vertical difference of a 5mm high Petri dish a lot of pages ago, and it turned out to be a lot greater than the maximum variation across planet earth. I still believe this will mess with the experiment. But besides that the gradient across 13mm of horizontal space will be much more noticeable (not to say the direction would change, no idea by how much though).

Navigation in this thread, I am sure we can all agree, is difficult. Topics switch unpredictably, overlap with each other, and restart multiple times over the course of 189 pages of discussion. This makes it very difficult for newcomers like myself to figure out quite what is going on, and I am sure that it is also difficult for those who have been here longer too. We are not providing a welcoming place for interested newcomers, and yet we should be and we want to be. We just got a comment from another person who does professional designs using Solidworks (page 185), offering to help in a way that seemed more like a resum\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 than a mere statement of willingness to help. We, well, we greeted him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That does not keep most people interested, and that person has not posted on the forum again (sorry for making you an example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If establishing a website is impractical for the members of this team, that is fine. Setting up a good website takes effort, time and resources that not all of us can provide at the drop of a hat. What we have now, this forum, while not ideal for our purposes, has more potential than we are tapping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would move that we start additional threads on this forum. Different threads for major design topics: Experiment, Comm Systems, Computer Operation, et cetera, as well as a thread that serves as basic introductions, and questions and answers, for newcomers and interested community members. These could be linked in signatures, and at the OP\u0027s here and on all the others, that they may easily be found by those browsing the forum. The Q/A forum we would assign a moderator, from our ranks, who would either answer questions directly, or refer another team member to answer it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is not the best structure.

It is understandable to continue using a tool that has been useful in the past, but it would be a mistake to continue using that tool forever, even after we have exhausted its ability, and are no longer aiming at the same goal anyway. This thread was originally to gauge interest in a hypothetical project and discuss vague possibilities for it. That project has developed into a plan, a project with dedicated supporters and extensive research, design, and critique. This thread has served a valuable purpose.
