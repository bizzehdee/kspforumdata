To the OP, highly directional RF signals aren\u0027t new, and indeed are inherently harder to intercept and/or degrade. Generally keeping an eye on the enemy\u0027s emissions is a good passive way to detect them. It\u0027s called Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) and you\u0027ll find that the military strictly control what they transmit to avoid giving the game away. It\u0027s not like in the movies where everybody is using their radar all the time, in reality folks will often keep their transmitters shut down a lot of the time. Even for a powerful active sensor like a radar the enemy can detect you via ESM from a lot further away than you can detect them directly with your radar.

Say it only had 1m^2 of surface area facing earth because our tech is that compact. First of all you\u0027d have to paint it perfectly black to ensure earth doesn\u0027t see the reflection of sunlight on the hull. With current detection tech (Where we don\u0027t have to worry about warheads in high orbits) you\u0027d have to cool the hull to 163K to avoid thermal detection (see equations on Atomic Rockets). You receive around 1.3kW per square meter from the sunlight at 1AU and at some point during our orbit that light will directly hit our cloaking plate. So we\u0027d have to pump 1.3kW of heat from 163K to our radiators. Say we have a generous 10m^2 of radiators hidden behind our cloaking plate. Assuming the temperature of the CMB is negligible and your radiators are perfect black bodies Stefan-Boltzman tells us our radiators need a temperature of about 220K. So you\u0027re lifting those 1.3kW over a 60 degree temperature difference. Assuming a perfect Carnot efficiency you can do this with 385% efficiency. So you need an energy source producing 338W just for cooling. This would require at least another 2.5m^2 of radiator to get rid of that output. 338W is a lot of juice in spaceflight, that\u0027s almost as much as the Voyager probes at launch. Producing that energy is going to induce more waste heat to worry about, requiring more radiators or higher temperatures.

And thats a pretty dang narrow beam of detection, just sweeping across the whole of the angles that teh L4 region takes up would take days or weeks, maybe even years to pick up something that small. And if theres other debris around, good luck. Would be better off trying to pick up targets within 1million km from earth before working on the 150million range. Although, you could always just have a scanning array built in L4, sicne in this space future you might need sats there to keep in communications with bases on mars and such (unless those got destroyed, and now there\u0027s more debris absorbing heat to try and sift through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore realistic would be the craft sitting in Earth-Moon L4. This is only ~384,400km and our 1m^2 target would be 2.18*10^-6 wide from our perspective. I think we could do a pretty good job of picking that up, its over a million times larger in a scope compared to before, and we already have a few satellites out there, or if we don\u0027t already, they would be great aides to communicating with bases on the far side of the moon (being relays for sats sitting at E/M L2) This however also could have a chance to hide because thered probably be more stuff floating around there. maybe some space colonies, maybe a station or 2, ofcourse those stations and colonies could pick it up, but well, who are we at war with, they may be the ones holding those colonies or stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut again, assuming your craft is the 1 above with several meters of radiator/solar panel to keep itself powered and cool, you\u0027d be easily spottable from the lunar surface, sats/stations in L1,2,3,4, and 5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some angling, and redesign though you might hide yourself from earth, moon L1,2,4,5 but still be noticeable from L3. Therefore if you want to be stealthy your best hiding spots would actually be L3, farthest from all the other points, and all the points are within ~60degrees infront of you, so the craft could be designed... maybe with a cone shaped \u0022cloaking\u0022 array, to have a better chance of hiding. Although, thats still assuming there aren\u0027t a bunch of sats/stations/colonies sitting out around L3 which could easily be hidden around becuase they would be vastly higher thermal sources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStealth as I see it in space is much less not being detected through technology, its not being detectible relative to the other junk floating around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a ship could always carry its own thermal/radar decoys to draw attention of scanners away, they could be launched by hydraulic piston away from the ship, after drifting a few hundred KM, they fire up and do their job (make burns different to what you\u0027re making your burn and such) heck could get all tactical with ships in 1 area launching decoys to draw the attention of scanners to a different part of the sky, so that ships elsewhere can have their time to make a burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes me wish I had a team of developers where we could go make a sim game that you have to deal with and work with all the problems of range and detection and such.

They electrically steer the sending beam for their radars, also they can similarly do it to send things like communications signals, VOR beacons work like this to an extent too. However this isn\u0027t even really a new technology. We\u0027ve had highly directional, tight beam antennas for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a matter of fact in the early stages of WW2, the Germans used this to their advantage when directing bombers to targets in England.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially there were 2 tight beams, 1 that the bombers would travel along, and a second that when met, they would drop their bombs. This worked pretty well for a while actually, just set up the 2 beams so that they cross over the factory or w/e you want to bomb and go. Later though the English started picking up those signals with their own systems and would have fighters waiting at areas they thought the bombers would hit, or they\u0027d evacuate. So the Germans instead added a 3rd beam. Like before they would fly along beam 1, but when they hit beam 2 it would start a timer counting up, when they hit the 3rd beam the timer would stop and start counting back down to 0, and when it hit 0 that would be their target and they\u0027d drop. After that some stuff started where a radio station in England figured out the frequency they were using and would start/stop the timers prematurely so that their drops would be far off course. And that was in the 40\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T02:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow you\u0027re just throwing around technobable to look smart.\u003Cp\u003EMass Spectrometers have NOTHING to do with emissions, in space or otherwise.
