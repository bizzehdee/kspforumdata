I chipped it a bit in a vain attempt to remove it. Eventually got it off by letting the mirror/lap sit in the sun to melt the pitch, prying them apart, and then bathing them in acetone to dissolve the pitch (Acetone, like pitch, is nonpolar and thus will dissolve it). The 12\u0022 is my third mirror. Despite being quite large it\u0027s thin and thus lightweight at only 1\u0022 thick - not quite thick enough to support itself under its on weight, but thick enough to require relatively simple support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou typically want at least 3 eyepieces - one around 20-32mm (depends on the scope) for low power (i.e. large DSOs and finding things), one from 12-18mm for medium power (most DSOs and maybe the Moon), and one from 5-10mm for high power (small DSOs, double stars, Moon, planets). Sometimes you\u0027ll want one below 5mm for really high power with a scope below f/6 or so. More eyepieces than 4 or so tend to be unnecessary and seldom used. Price usually depends on the apparent field of view, coatings, and performance (i.e. astigmatism/coma correction) below f/6.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-06T16:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12\u0022 blank is here.

I am keeping the mount because while the paintjob could be better (Black mount and black tube? Really?) and it weighs about as much as a small child, it does have nice construction and even an adjustable tube cradle - and it\u0027s not worth the cost of shipping anyways. The focuser I\u0027m keeping as well, obviously - it alone is nearly worth the price I paid for all of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seller told me an interesting story. He wanted to make his own scope so he bought a kit to make his own mirror grinding machine (a mirror-o-matic kit to be exact) , and proceeded to make an 8\u0022 on it. He dropped the 8\u0022 during fine grinding and bought a GSO primary to build a scope with. Then, despite having no prior skill in even polishing a mirror, he proceeded to make the 16\u0022, and gave up during figuring because he had no idea what he was doing. Now he has an 8\u0022 Skywatcher collapsible scope and has given up on the whole ATMing thing, so he sold me everything but the machine (I don\u0027t really have the money for it nor the space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to having no prior skill in polishing/figuring, this\u00A0guy used Burgundy pitch (which if you remember from when I started making mirrors is unreliable and bad) and ROUGE (messy and slow-working) to polish despite having \u003Cstrong\u003EPLENTY\u003C/strong\u003E of cerium oxide and zirconium oxide (the latter works slower and leaves a slightly smoother surface than cerox - like rouge but without the mess). There\u0027s still rouge on the test stand he made for it that gets on my fingers whenever I touch it, and the entire side of the mirror is stained with it (though thankfully it doesn\u0027t come off).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plopped it on the Ronchi tester (which I had to position a little over 13 feet away!), expecting either a somewhat decent sphere (assuming he just gave up on figuring without actually trying it) or a mess. I got the latter. The mirror is pretty astigmatic, as well as hyperbolic (though the astigmatism makes it hard to tell and it may not be that severely overcorrected). Just to make sure the astigmatism wasn\u0027t caused by the glass itself having issues, I tested the mirror for strain - I found none. So the messed-up surface is his fault, and I can fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the issues with the surface, correcting this 16\u0022 will take far less time and effort than working the 12\u0022. So once I pour a new tool and finish with #80 on the 12\u0022, at which point I\u0027d have to clean up my work area anyway, I\u0027m going to put everything away and focus on finishing the 16\u0022 instead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this mean I\u0027m abandoning the 12\u0022? Heck no! I just don\u0027t have the money to complete both at the moment and I\u0027d rather work on the one that will take less time and has more aperture. The 12\u0022 may get redesigned to be either a faster and more portable instrument or a slower (f/7-f/8) Chief with no central obstruction, but I will still finish it.

I could bring the 6\u0022 to that, but there would probably be a fair amount of M\u0027s that would be either invisible and show no detail, either.
