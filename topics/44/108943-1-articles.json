Either runways or landing pads are acceptable. Maximum reentry G-loads capped at 4G.\n\n-Cargo bay large enough for 2 standard 40-foot intermodal containers.\n\n-Crew optional. LES required, ejects only the crew cabin.\n\n-Propellant primarily LH2/kerosene-LOX, other (hypergolic/exotic fuels, nuclear) propulsion systems acceptable above 100km.\n\n-Price-per-kilogram must be comparable to currently-available launch vehicles.\n\n-Post-landing maintenance costs must be cheaper than building costs for a single unit.\n\nA single vehicle is expected to launch 4-5 mission per year (about one launch every 3 months), and to last at least 20 flights (4 year\u0027s worth of use).\n\nHow would such a vehicle look like? How would it fly? How would its typical mission proceed?\n\nP.S. I request that we avoid discussing the economic consequences of such a vehicle operating, and focus our attention about the vehicle.
