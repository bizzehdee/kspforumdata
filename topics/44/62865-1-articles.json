Anyways, tonight as i was sitting on my porch I could only see a single star. I fired up google skymaps and it seemed to point out Betelgeuse as the one star I could see. Googling seemed to verify my observations as it would be highly visible. My question is that is it likely that Betelgeuse could be the only star luminous enough that it would be the only one visible to me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T07:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom Tampa? Unless it simply hasn\u0027t gone up yet, you\u0027d see Sirius way better than Betelgeuse. Of course, it all depends on how clouds/haze are distributed. You could have so much more haze near horizon that Sirius is obstructed. Betelgeuse is also hard to confuse with something because it has a reddish tint that\u0027s very persistent even when the star is difficult to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was the time?

It uses GPS, compass, and accelerometers to figure out where you are pointing your phone and where from, and draws the sky map that corresponds to that direction. So you literally point your phone at the star and read off the name on the screen. Now, it\u0027s far from perfect in determining the orientation, but it can put you close enough to figure out the rest. And it is certainly way more precise than trying to guestimate azimuth and altitude by eye.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T08:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETalking about Google, theres an app called Google Sky Map that can answer these mysteries.
