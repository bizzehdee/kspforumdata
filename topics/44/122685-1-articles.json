Your initial orbit has radius r1 = (6378.1 \u002B 500) km = 6878.1 km, while the target\u0027s has radius r2 = (6378.1 \u002B 700) km = 7078.1 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time required by the transfer is simply that of the standard Hohmann transfer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EtH = pi * sqrt( (r1\u002Br2)^3/(8*mu) )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere mu is the gravitational parameter of the primary celestial body you\u0027re orbiting.

The total delta-v is thus about 100.8 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf initially the target is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E \u002B3.8 degrees ahead of you, then you\u0027ll have to wait for the phase angle between you two to reach that value.

Emperically a vessel takes 5 minutes to reach near orbital velocity. During the first minute of flight its horizontal velocity is near zero, but climbs from near zero to orbital over 4 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ea. thus it is traveling about 2/5ths orbital velocity (discounting ground movement) for 5 minutes, and orbital velocity thereafter. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eb. this means if a target is directly overhead it need to warp 3 minutes forward to catch up after reaching target orbit. But since we know angular velocity we can calculate what? lets see\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E c. 3min(=60sec)*0.0032 = 0.57 radians = 33 degrees. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. So if you know the longditudinal coordinates of the launch site (in mech jeb this will be given as angle to prograde) and you know the angle to prograde of the target, just wait until the launch site preceeds the anlge to prograde of the target by 33, launch and set the target altitude at 100. The only trick here is to make the orbit realtively flat over 42k. With reference to the targets humor, if you are not experienced in making your gravity turn you might have to thrust in the -radial direction to get orbital velocity were it will intercept. If you are not, then allow your self a few extra degrees. When you reach the target your horizontal velocity relative to the orbital velocity (target velocity also)/2*accel(=thrustMax/mass) is the lead time you need over the target at your apo. If you are one of those who likes to do most of the circularization at target altitude, then you need to factor this time into your lead over the target at launch. For example, if you are 1000 m/s slower and your thrust is 1 g, then it takes 100 seconds, you will need half this time. so 50 seconds = 0.16rad (=10 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and how much dV do you need, its the same as orbital insertion from launch. IOW practice making orbit at 75k and then use that method and extend your apo from 75k to 100k at an altitude of 60k or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case if you know your insertion methods (wipe that grin off your face) and you know how to guestimate targets position relative to launch site even goofing this method and sill having a 100k equitorial then you are going to get much closer to your target than you might imagine, 5k is ideal, more than that and you might have to increase or decrease your orbit a tad to close the gap. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverkill phasing. This method is less risky than the first, but really overkills on fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. So we know what our Nu is, is that cute, so how do we get an orbit going half the velocity. r (=600K\u002Balt) needs to be 4 fold. So to get an orbit half as fast we need an orbit 4 times the radius or 2800K, that means we need an alt of 2200K. But then our target is 1/4th the radius, so its radians per second are v/r and ours is (v/2)/4r = 1/8th its making 8 oribt for our 1 and basically we have a window every 37 minutes. Thats not to clever, but on the bright side we are long 400km from a KSO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. So we are going to have to close the gap, but do we actually need to think about this too much just match the planes. Actually this does not need much math either. Just burn retro until the orbit is nearly the targets orbit alt or even the targets orbit. It is recommended that you do this at your targets theta(=apo) this way your intercept is at the targets pa. Now we might get lucky and get close to the target, but actually chances are no and don\u0027t waste the effort trying. When the ship hits apo, just retro, as you retro your ships ellipse will intercept the target maybe six times as you close your orbit, you are interested in the smallest circle. Each of these you can calculate with relative ease if you know the period. Mech jeb tells you the periods of your orbit and your target will give its period. so basically you can use this to estimate the intercept if you know the angle to prograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmart phasing. So basically we have done the direct, and we have overkilled on the phasing. How about a better phasing. Once again target is at 100 k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. This time you want to be about 90 degrees ahead of your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch to about 125 to 150 km alt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once at target apo, correct the pe to 100 km alt, (125 alt apo = ~ 0.0031 rad/sec, 150 alt apo = ~0.00305 rad per second)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At pe squeeze the apo in just as in method 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. time the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote this can be done at any launch position, but who actually wants to wait \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is what makes method 1 and 3 work. The short answer is we are not lingering around waiting for a transfer window, in method 1 we are essentially allowing our non-inertial reference frame (=surface of Kerbin see Einstien\u0027s theory of relativity) to phase us with a target in its inertial reference frame. We only need to wait 32 minutes at most to launch, and we are trying to get within a 5 km window where our docking manuevers are more important than transfer dynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn method 3 we know a higher orbit has a slower angular velocity, so we allow ourselves to get about 60 degrees ahead of the target, and then use that lead to close our orbit with the target successively such that when we are ready to make the final closure we are on top of the targets. In method three we retro at pe which is targets alt, so no fuel is wasted in making multiple retros at the same kick position. The better you are at approximating your launch with target intercept, the lower altitude that is convienient (avoiding wasted time in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the lesson we learn is that if we had to rescue a naut in crisis its almost always best to plan a launch window that will intercept a target in a more or less direct manner.

So we can use these to our advantage, infact kicking ion drives at pe essentially does this. So the planning is in kicking out enough that at the next cycle through pe, if we kick so that our apo ~ crosses the target orbit at coincidence the target. The kicking out also allows one to match planes at the optimal lowest velocity. This startegy is advantageous under almost all circumstances except if time is a constraint. The 67p mission is essentially doing this because they lacked a dV budget to reach their target, they basically are using various oberth boosts to get to their target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this you have to know exactly when the target passes the orbiters theta at apo. this is simple becuase of the sweep rule, you ca determine the time to that theta, and you know the period thus its the series t(toTheta) \u002B period*n(=0,1,2,3; easy to set up in excel, or the free linux equiv).

Then its a matter of fideling with 2 periods one generated by the intermediate apo and on by the final apo to get a two orbit cumulative that coincides at the second apo with any element in that series target. its usually going to be n= 0 or 1 and the orbiter may need additional orbits to hit 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this stategy, the only one that is functional and not subjective (i.e having to do with mission needs such as food or battery life) is that when the two orbits apo and pe do not coincide, there are two inefficiencies, one is non optimal dV at vector matching, this is most pronounced when the targets apo is at the orbiters pe, such as in making a transit to moho starting the mission with a kerbin theta at moho\u0027s pe.

If you\u0027re willing to spend more delta-v than a Hohmann transfer, you can get a faster intercept by doing a \u003Cem\u003Eone-tangent burn transfer\u003C/em\u003E. The basic idea is that the transfer orbit is a higher-energy orbit (which can be elliptical or even hyperbolic) that \u003Cem\u003Ecrosses\u003C/em\u003E your target\u0027s orbit instead of touching it tangentially (as the Hohmann transfer does):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/fig4-12.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fig4-12.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt intercept, you\u0027ll be moving considerably faster relative to your target (and, more importantly, along a different direction), so the speed matching burn will be costly. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERobert Braeunig\u0027s excellent website\u003C/a\u003E (from which I stole the above picture) has the mathematical formulae needed for this kind of transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm#maneuver\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbit Maneuvers\u003C/a\u003E section of his Orbital Mechanics page. Due to the way these expressions are written, you\u0027d have to first find the size of the transfer orbit (i.e. its semimajor axis, a\u003Csub\u003Etx\u003C/sub\u003E in Robert\u0027s notation) by trial and error, repeatedly choosing a value of a\u003Csub\u003Etx\u003C/sub\u003E and computing the corresponding time of flight (equation 4.71) until you get the desired transfer time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you can use the other equations to compute the delta-v of both transfer burns as well as the angular position of the intercept (the \u0022true anomaly at second burn\u0022). The phase angle for the start of the transfer can then be deduced from this quantity and the time of flight (in a way similar to what we did for the Hohmann transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T21:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T22:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I have a much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E easier KSP-related solution: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethrow a maneuver node and see what happens\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, I do this several times a day.

It\u0027s a really easy thing to do, in four easy steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-Get into a coplanar orbit with the target, either over or under it, but consistently so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-Drop a maneuver node that gets your orbit to intercept the target\u0027s, pretty much anywhere. If you are in a higher orbit, this a retrograde burn to bring your Pe to the target\u0027s altitude, otherwise it is a prograde vector to bring you apoapsis to it. Note that doing this from a lower orbit is slightly more efficient, if you are coming form the ground. A \u0022close approach\u0022 will show up when you do this, don\u0027t worry what it shows, just that it shows a single encounter at the right height, ideally over an ascending/descending node if you were not 100% accurate matching inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-Right-click on the node, and play with doing the node one or more orbits later. You will notice this changes the separation at the close approach, the more orbits you let pass before doing it. If the separation is going down, continue to add orbits until just before you catch up to it. If the separation is going up... do the same thing, only it will take longer because you have to go the long way around. This encounter won\u0027t be anything acceptable, but it will put you in the position of getting one that is, on the next orbit after it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-Once you have actually done that, drop another node just \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the close approach. It will start showing the \u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E close approach after that one, and placing a maneuver that brings your orbit closer to the targets will get you a perfect encounter on the next orbit, 100% of the time, guaranteed. Just match orbits, but not quite, until the new encounter distance reads under 1km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works because if you are in an orbit with a different semi-major axis, your orbital period is different (you take different time to complete a revolution), so you will \u0022gain\u0022 (lower orbit) or \u0022lose\u0022 ground (higher orbit) with respect to your target on each revolution. Since how much you \u0022win\u0022 or \u0022lose\u0022 depends only on the difference of your periods, when you make your orbit more like the target\u0027s, that \u0022gain\u0022 can be tailored to any amount you might want. One and a half times the orbital period in one of them? You will gain or lose half an orbit each revolution. 1/100th difference?

So just get things close while maintaining an intersection point (the close approach, never maneuver so it changes your altitude at that point), and you can adjust things on the last-before-overshooting pass so the next one is \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E the right difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and done this way, dV is the bare minimum to get this done, BTW.

So, for example, for a target 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA before you, you want your orbital period to be 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA/360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA=3/4ths of the target\u0027s (or in other words, a semimajor axis 3/4ths of the target\u0027s), so you gain 1/4 of an orbit, or 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, on each revolution. Or, you know, gain 1/8th on each orbit if you have an orbital period 7/8th of your target\u0027s, and you\u0027ll get there in two orbits with less dV expenditure. Or 1/16th, to get there in four, or 1/12th to get there in three. Or you could of course go higher, say 9/8ths of its period, and then you will get there the \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E way around in... 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA/45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA=6 orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee how that makes a lot of intuitive sense, if you look at it form an orbital period perspective? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meithan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Meithan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree with you Rune: in practice I don\u0027t do the calculations either, I just throw a maneuver node and play with it too. As you said, what\u0027s important is understanding the fundamental principles behind it (the orbital mechanics).\u003Cp\u003EFor rendezvous, I actually don\u0027t use a lower or higher phasing orbit. What I do is first match my target\u0027s orbit (close to zero relative inclination and close-ish Ap/Pe), trying to get as close to my target but \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E it. Then, I do an elliptical \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_phasing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ephasing orbit\u003C/a\u003E: I raise my Ap a bit so that my orbital period increases. By toying with the maneuver node I can get the extra period to be exactly the time I\u0027m lagging behind the target. The result is a very close intercept on the next orbit once I get back to Pe. The relative speed will also be quite low (a few 10\u0027s of m/s usually), so the transfer is close to optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself, I launch into temp. ~70x70 orbit, then see where the target is at, relative to me. If it\u0027s far away, I run the clock for a while until I\u0027m closer. Once I\u0027m less than a quarter orbit away, I raise my Ap to the target\u0027s orbit in any one node, and go from there, always approaching from behind so I don\u0027t waste dV going higher than my target. An if I\u0027m short on dV or want to be extra-efficient I try to set a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E tiny burn and explore what will happen a lot of orbits from now by dropping a second node, and then moving \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E forward in time to see my subsequent close approaches. I feel so professional when I set up a rendezvous something like eight orbits form now... nice trick to know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t plan launch windows either until career mode hard.

Its silly not to use launch windows. The alternative is your orbit coukd be oof by 180 degrees and requires the user to create a highly elliptical orbit which is the matched at apo and shrunk, cost is around 3500 dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmos flights. Save a few dV on the plane matching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sat you saved fuel with you can put in Kerbol orbit near Kerbin. By using the flight planner you can roughly test to see when the best launch times. So when is this important moho! Its not a day, it could be years of capital wasted to get a good dV. The best transfer is when you launch window is closest to mohos apo and the transfer orbit pe coincides with moho pe. Obviously this is hard to do, but moho travels around 5 times per each kerbin orbit so at worst you are going 36\u0027 from apo. So in this instance you may have to wait half a year, and waiting a up to a year and a half you could get within 18 degrees. Once you get the launch window you can plan a launch which optimizes plane mtaching. So this is an intance where planning luanch windows can save 1000s of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, this is for launching stuff to rendezvous around the same planet you launched from. Interplanetary transfers are another thing entirely, and then it really pays of to figure out the right time \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E angle to eject.
