What do some of the more informed people think about the SLS program? Is it really all just political? Ula with Atlas and delta are also extremely political but in fairness they deliver and are exceptional launch systems. Will the launch cost really be 1 billion? That will be basically shuttle 2.0 and we know how that ended. If we take development cost into account it will be more than 2 billion unless the SLS launches very frequently. I do not understand how it can be so expensive to develop a launcher. From what I read it cost 14 billion so far. What are they doing? Apollo was expensive but they delivered and in their defence they basically had to invent every single component of the saturn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flavio hc16","CreatedById":183153,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T10:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 billion? that is the marginal cost, you are looking at 2-2.5 billion per launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\np.s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3563553422\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186560-new-space-launch-system-orion-discussion-thread/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere is a tread about sls 4 post lower than this post\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T11:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223731845\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579862744\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183153\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flavio hc16\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n40 minutes ago, Flavio hc16 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 billion? that is the marginal cost, you are looking at 2-2.5 billion per launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\np.s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed566844100\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186560-new-space-launch-system-orion-discussion-thread/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere is a tread about sls 4 post lower than this post\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd somehow I managed to overlook it again......\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T14:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SLS fans would probably enjoy it if the new round of talking about how awful it is took place in another thread, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 billion per launch has to be low, really low, as we know for a fact that each of the first 4 SLS LVs has 508 million worth of RS-25s in it.

If you are working some random job for NASA (not engineering, something generic needed to keep the lights on (maintenance, administration, HR, etc )), then your concern is not sending a probe to Europa, it\u0027s getting paid (like most people, everywhere). As long as you are paid, the system is working. If doing more cool stuff efficiently was to close your local center, and lose you your job---that would be a failure to you, even if it\u0027s a win for people like us who want to see the cool things (or the people working in the sciences or tech areas that don\u0027t get fired).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barzon","CreatedById":185383,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T19:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223732026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579894294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNSF has 3 year round stations in Antarctica.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr Bergin has really diversified recently, hasn\u0027t he?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T20:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223732035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579895575\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185383\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barzon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Barzon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr Bergin has really diversified recently, hasn\u0027t he?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, LOL.

US government had some reasons to use shuttle despite its costs and safety issues but I do not believe that such reasons to use SLS will ever exist. Politicians can not continue expensive and non productive project forever if there will be similar or even larger commercial products at orders of magnitude lower cost. I think continuous chain of delays serve better real objectives of SLS than actual attempt to fly. If it fails it is game over immediately and if it works it is too expensive for operational use.
