This will only be more true as time goes on. When you consider how relatively close the moon is (virtually no communications lag eh?) I think that X-billion dollars spent on 20 unmanned missions, which could go on providing active means for data acquisition for literally _decades_ (Those antiquated Voyagers!!! OMG, built in the 1970s!!! Those marvelous guys are still out there, doing their jobs!!

In 50 or 100 years when there really is more infrastructure in place, escape velocity is cheaper, life support systems are more self-sustaining and failure proof, and there really are good economic reasons for humans to be up there in the cold black awfulness of space . . . sure I bet there will come a time when it really is prudent to have people going into space, even deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe just don\u0027t seem to be there yet.

Given that there is no \u0027rush\u0027 with a robot to get it done before the oxygen runs out, I just do not see how a human being there inplace of the robot offers anything except greater cost, greater risk, a shorter window of opportunity to perform missions, and a more limited cumulative possibility for information acquisition.

Imagine a true \u0022moon base\u0022 in which 20 humans can safely and comfortably live for long periods (whether self-sufficient, or somewhat dependent on resupply from Earth is slightly irrelevant). Your argument holds more water in this future context, tis true. With humans in a permanent moon base, the intuitive, qualitative and creative aspects of human eyes \u0022on scene\u0022 could honestly be fruitful.
