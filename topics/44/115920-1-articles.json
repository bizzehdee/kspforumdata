The orbit of Sedna is another weird thing. Sedna has an elliptical orbit with a periapsis way past Neptune and an apoapsis about 1000 AU. Since its orbit never even comes close to Neptune it is a mystery how it ever ended up in such an elliptical orbit. And Sedna isn\u0027t alone, there are other bodies with these weird orbital parameters. All of which could be explained by another heavy object in a very distant orbit.\n\nBut, all these things could also be explained by a close pass of a few stars a couple million years back. We know that there isn\u0027t anything really big out there thanks to IR observations. But something the size of the earth could exist.\n\nThe implications depend entirely on the body that we detect. Extremely elliptical orbits with a very high apoapsis imply a interstellar capture, circular in a cleared orbit implies formation within the solar system. We can\u0027t really say until we see it.

When Neptune\u0027s newly determined mass was used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System.

Any signal from within our galaxy is going to reach us within that timeframe - not exactly \u0022the-lifespan-of-human-industrial-civilization\u0022 timescales, but certainly within the bounds of human existence.\n\nAt any rate, contacting these civilizations isn\u0027t necessarily the point, although it makes for good press. Importantly, locating other civilizations, especially those with the power to be noticed across hundreds or thousands of light-years, helps us establish a framework for where we\u0027re going to be headed, if we intend to become a spacefaring society (or at least long-lasting enough to *be* spacefaring). If we could learn something about the characteristics of sapient alien societies - what kinds of energies they\u0027re capable of employing, how much material they\u0027re capable of extracting from their systems and lobbing around are things I assume may be among the first things we learn, and then how all that stuff is distributed - it could contribute to a roadmap for our own development, and give some indication of what challenges and dangers we\u0027ll face in the future.\n\nCMB detections are far from useless. They help confirm or disprove, to my knowledge, fundamental theories of physics, which makes them particularly useful to extremely prevalent Earth tech that depends on such things like electronics (quantum physics, etc) and GPS (relativity)\n\nSimilarly, if we could somehow find evidence of, say, extraterrestrials using a warp drive, that could similarly help develop our practical knowledge. That\u0027s probably a far-out example, so if anyone can correct me or suggest a more grounded one that\u0027d be nice.\n\nWe don\u0027t necessarily need to receive messages from the stars to see extraterrestrials, either (although it also makes good press). [\u0022Zen SETI\u0022](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=31808), for instance, proposes looking for evidence of ETI activity by analyzing non-waterhole astronomical data for evidence of large-scale ETI involvement, a la searching for infrared emissions from Dyson spheres, or large solar power constellations in general, perhaps. Looking at concentrations of metal in other solar systems to determine whether an industrial civilization has lots of infrastructure out there is another idea. [If we could get telescopes out to the sun\u0027s gravitational lens](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=785), it may even be possible to directly see other worlds with significant clarity. And if we do find something within a 200 light-year bubble, communicating with it (if desired) could be done within the time industrial society has lasted so far.\n\nThey might not send signals out of fear, as you note, or perhaps simply because they don\u0027t want to spend the resources, but if the galaxy is indeed a quiet place, it\u0027d definitely be worth looking out to see who we\u0027ll be dealing with should we ever leave the solar system.\n\n---\n\nI don\u0027t personally think it\u0027s useless to search for life within our solar system. Enceladus and Titan stand out as good targets to me. And perhaps there is some planet out there in the far reaches of the solar system, but to my knowledge, people have been searching for a while and they have yet to find significant evidence of one, so people discredit others who insist that there must be a very specific planet there that is just being covered up/scientists are ignorant/etc. And there\u0027s a lot more stars and galaxies out there than there is currently estimated mass to form planets in the Oort Cloud, between 4 and 80 Earth masses. Doesn\u0027t mean that nobody is looking out for objects in the Kuiper Belt/Oort Cloud.\n\nEither way, there\u0027s no need to discredit either line of exploration, interstellar or in-solar-system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T07:59:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 07:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T08:54:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This idea is centuries old.

Since its orbit never even comes close to Neptune it is a mystery how it ever ended up in such an elliptical orbit. And Sedna isn\u0027t alone, there are other bodies with these weird orbital parameters. All of which could be explained by another heavy object in a very distant orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E But, all these things could also be explained by a close pass of a few stars a couple million years back. We know that there isn\u0027t anything really big out there thanks to IR observations. But something the size of the earth could exist.\n\u003E \n\u003E The implications depend entirely on the body that we detect. Extremely elliptical orbits with a very high apoapsis imply a interstellar capture, circular in a cleared orbit implies formation within the solar system. We can\u0027t really say until we see it. We know its possible from exoplanet observations, so it wouldn\u0027t be that big a surprise.\n\nBest answer so far, but I think wikipedia also does a pretty good job here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna#Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna#Origin)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E They observed that, unlike scattered disc objects such as Eris, Sedna\u0027s perihelion (76 AU) is too distant for it to have been scattered by the gravitational influence of Neptune.\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E If Sedna formed in its current location, the Sun\u0027s original protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75 AU into space.[34] Also, Sedna\u0027s initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole would not have been possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body.[35] In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested **three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt**, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E The trans-Neptunian planet hypothesis has been advanced in several forms by a number of astronomers, including Rodney Gomes and Patryk Lykawka. One scenario involves perturbations of Sedna\u0027s orbit by a hypothetical planetary-sized body in the inner Oort cloud. **Recent simulations show that Sedna\u0027s orbital traits could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2,000 AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass (MJ) at 5,000 AU, or even an Earth-mass object at 1,000 AU.**[37][41] Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka have suggested that Sedna\u0027s orbit may have been caused by a body roughly the size of Earth, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System\u0027s formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 80 and 170 AU from the Sun.[42] Mike Brown\u0027s various sky surveys have not detected any Earth-sized objects out to a distance of about 100 AU. However, it is possible that such an object may have been scattered out of the Solar System after the formation of the inner Oort cloud.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Each of the proposed mechanisms for Sedna\u0027s extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. **If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u202080 AU)**. If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated in the same direction as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153500 AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.[43]\n\u003E \n\u003E Acquiring a larger sample of such objects would help in determining which scenario is most likely.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E In 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of 2012 VP113,[19] an object half the size of Sedna in a 4200-year orbit similar to Sedna\u0027s and a perihelion within Sedna\u0027s range of roughly 80 AU,[49] which led some to speculate that it offered evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:17:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pattern in DNA could be useful and would mean that GMO and any other genetic experiments are totally wrong.\n\nOf course DNA has patterns, it\u0027s an information-coding system.
