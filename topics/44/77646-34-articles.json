Besides, we are going to need some sort of actuator to some extent as it is for the latch to open the first time. We most certainly do not want to try and have the panels spring loaded in the carrier. In fact, I am reasonably sure (I should reread that document someone had posted) that you are not allowed to do that. Strictly speaking if we wanted to, we could have them attach closed with a plastic connector of some sort, then when the system goes online it activates a heater that melts the plastic enough for the springs to open it up.
