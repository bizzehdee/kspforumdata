During this we came to the conclusion that the real question (or at least the more interessting to us) is: How would we react, if we discover that we are not alone?\n\nWe have distinguished four cases:\n\n1. **Discovery of extraplanetary life:** Some probe/rover discovers life on another planet/moon in our solar system.  \nI do not think this will matter all that much to most people. The news will be full of it for some days, most people will tell everybody who wants to hear it, that this was always clear and no sane person ever doubted it. A not to tiny fraction will probably declare it as contamination from earth, a scam to get more money for space agencies or a mortal danger to all life on planet earth (like the film Evolution or so ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)). But in general I think most will have forgotten it after some days. In the middle to long term it will most likely help the space agencies to get more funding for exploration. Also most likely regulations for sterilization of space craft will get even tighter than now and return of samples at least from the \u0022infected\u0022 planet/moon will be out of question for some time.\n2. **Receiving a signal, but do not understand it:** somehow like the [WOW! signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal), but longer and clearer to be artificial in nature  \nI think there would be a great depate if this signal is artifical or natural or a scam. If it is artifical and only noticed by military/national controlled stations I suspect that they could try a cover-up. For thi scenario, although I deem it the most probable, I have no further idea what would happen. As information on public reaction and circulation is a bit scant and I was not alive then, I cannot really compare it.\n3. **Receiving a signal and understanding it at least in parts:** like the [Aericibo message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message), also I really do not know how some other race should ever understand this message...   \nThis would probably be the most interessting solution. There we will get evidence of another intelligence. I do not know what they would send. If I had to compose my own message and just wanted to say \u0022I\u0027m no artifical signal, I\u0027m from an intelligence!\u0022, I would just send a sequence of prime numbers (dit-dit pause dit-dit-dit pause dit-dit-dit-dit-dit pause ...). This does not really transfer any knowledge, but it should be understood by every being able to receive this message (as the count and prime numbers are the same in every numerative system). But let\u0027s just say we get a bit more complex message. We can decipher something like origin and there system layout or so. What would happen?  \nLike in the first example I suspect that certain governments will try to cover-up if they can. Even if they have no good reason to do so, it will be a reflex. We do not know it, so it must be bad... If it goes to the public their will be a gigantic discussion how to interpret this message. Five \u0022experts\u0022 will have six opinions how to decipher the message. But I think in the end the contents will not really matter. The fact that we are not alone will matter.  \nSome people will clearly use the situation and try to immediately answer with a message of their own. So if the origion would not be too far away, we could (speaking in long term of one message per generation or so...) establish an interstellar \u0022freindship\u0022 or at least post office. Other will try to hide. No message may compromise earth. They want to play dead. So this are most likely the extrem positions. I think the genral will either rush into an new Golden Age of space exploration (either united in face of the big unknown or as competition between the different agiencies) or we will go through something akin to the five stages of grief: denial (scam), anger (terroristic attacks against radio telescopes?), bargaining (What if they are evil?), depression and acceptance.  \nI for myself would really welcome the first variant. I cannot hope to live for any extrasolar exploration but a radio message, although unlikely, might be the only chance to ever know if there is/was anything other out there. The thought that we are all alone out here is frightening and also the number tell us, that we should not be alone it is a completely other thing as knowing.\n4. **Finding physical evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence:** like the [Pioneer plaque](Pioneer) or the Golden Records  \nThe chances to ever find an alien artifact are way beyond slim. But if it happens, I cannot really think that it would change all that much in comparision to scenario 3. Maybe a global received transmission would be sooner admitted as real than any physical evidence. Here the same principles apply as above: cover-up, accusation of fraud, maybe panic of invasion. But in general I think it would have less impact as a message. The probe would be tens of thousands of years old (in minimum), so the probabillity that its builders are still alive is slim. But a message traveling at light speed is a completly other topic.\n\nWhat is your opinion? How would you react? How would mankind as a whole react?"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:36:30Z","Content":"How would I react?

This is not an problem we have long experience handling various lunatics. \n\nIf from an pretty close indefinable star it would have more impact even political one. Should we reply, we should anyway try to find out more about the planet if came from.\n\n4 is the real interesting, first off it would probably have real world applications, its an alien artifact from someone who has star travel. Just the material would be interesting. \n\nMain question is that sort of object is it and can we learn anything from it. Can it be other objects perhaps more interesting ones nearby.\n\nFirst it has to be cleat its not an scam or something we misunderstand. Plenty of ancient astronaut junk around.\n\nIf not well we know its intelligent aliens who is able to travel between stars. If we find something like an fossil of an probe we would not learn anything outside of this. \n\nIts also likely to be an one off yes it might be more in the solar system but it would be very hard to find. \n\nNow if you find something like remains of an starship in space it would be an game changer and it would be an race for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T05:53:34Z","Content":"we start building an invasion fleet."},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T06:40:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E we start building an invasion fleet.\n\nHern\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1n Cort\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s de Monroy y Pizarro, 1st Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, has conquered the New World with 11 ships and 500 mens...\n\nI bet we need no more!"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T07:42:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hern\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1n Cort\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s de Monroy y Pizarro, 1st Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, has conquered the New World with 11 ships and 500 mens...\n\u003E I bet we need no more!\n\nI bet we would have if the natives had managed to send a scout ship over first. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T08:32:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I bet we would have if the natives had managed to send a scout ship over first. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf I assume that we have detected and captured that \u0022arecibo\u0022 scout ship..."},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T09:22:38Z","Content":"We\u0027ll send Jodie Foster into space."},{"CreatedByName":"AcidSludge","CreatedById":95709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T09:57:04Z","Content":"3.

For them, apparently the news would be devastating.\n\nEdit: [Found the article right here](http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/25/how-different-religions-would-deal-with-aliens/LMaD7Mwuit4vQXELgICSQK/story.html).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T19:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JetJaguar**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T20:58:38Z","Content":"Should aliens ever make their presence known?... this world would fall apart in a day.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo answer that, I have a better question: Should they show up, who are ***you*** going to listen to and want to follow?... those little green guys with the superior technology who travel through space... or the incompetent government/religious leaders (and media) incessantly yelling at their puppets, telling them what to do."},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T21:21:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Should aliens ever make their presence known?... this world would fall apart in a day.\n\u003E Why?\n\u003E \n\u003E To answer that, I have a better question: Should they show up, who are ***you*** going to listen to and want to follow?... those little green guys with the superior technology who travel through space... or the incompetent government/religious leaders (and media) incessantly yelling at their puppets, telling them what to do.\n\nSuperior tech doesn\u0027t mean superior government/religious leader or superior puppets ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T22:43:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I highly doubt humanity has the capability to decipher any alien signal.\n\u003E The so called [Arecibo Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) as it was send in 1974 to the M13 star cluster (25,000 light years away) was a binary signal that made up some stylized imagery.
