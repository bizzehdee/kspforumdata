That\u0027s not odd. Imagine the \u003Cem\u003Eobservable\u003C/em\u003E universe to be a Rubik\u0027s cube. A Rubik\u0027s cube can technically have about 519 quintillion states. Now, however, consider a room FULL of Rubik\u0027s cubes. Every single state in the original Rubik\u0027s cube can now be duplicated in any of the (probably thousands of) Rubik\u0027s cubes in the room. In effect, we have duplicted our observable universe with many instances of the same. Now imagine an entire house full of rubik\u0027s cubes, an entire city, entire country, and entire planet full of Rubik\u0027s cubes. The number of duplications of our observable universe is now, for all practical purposes, gargantuan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly the case of reality. Within a bubble with a radius of approximately 10^10^91m, there should be a sphere of space exactly duplicating our entire stellar neighbourhood of 100ly. An identical copy of you is roughly 10^10^29m* away, and an identical copy of our entire observable universe should exist in a bubble of space with a radius of 10^10^115m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, there is a much much much older argument for an infinite universe, known to the ancient Greeks. Consider the universe being a spherical room with a diameter of 5 meters. What happens when I step outside of it? I still exist, so my universe must have become bigger. And I can step further and further and futher, and each time I step further, I\u0027ll expand my universe. There is no end to this. You can always step further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*: I\u0027ve once asked a physicist about the following problem tho: I know the Pleiades exist, several hundred light years from here. An exact copy of me should also know that the Pleiades exist. Shouldn\u0027t that exact copy of me also be placed within an exact copy of the entire observable as it is known to me, to be actually an exact copy of me; thus necessitating the entire observable universe to be duplicated (10^10^115m)?

An exact copy of me should also know that the Pleiades exist. Shouldn\u0027t that exact copy of me also be placed within an exact copy of the entire observable as it is known to me, to be actually an exact copy of me; thus necessitating the entire observable universe to be duplicated (10^10^115m)? I never really got an answer to this question. So, if someone here has an answer to this rather philosophical question, please tell me!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is something to be resolved by considering probabilistically the odds of exact duplications occurring. I assume the numbers given consider only random chance and the possible arrangements of atoms - in theory, your clone could know of the Pleiades without having ever seen them, a weird phantom memory that has appeared by random chance, but this is unlikely, which would therefore make your exact clone significantly less likely. Adding in consideration of another dimension, time, presumably your exact clone would need to have an identical history to be truly identical. This calls into question exactly where your nearest clone could be, depending on how much has to happen and whether it\u0027s possible atoms could just randomly arrange themselves into an exact duplicate by chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact duplicate of our observable universe is similarly questionable, but may, depending on variance allowed, still be at a similar distance. Quantum effects over time make it questionable, as well as -exact- particle conditions, versus simply being entropically equivalent with functionally identical particle arrangement, would call into question the exact distance this is likely to occur at. It\u0027s a weird question - in theory you can use probability to determine these distances, but do you actually know the odds you\u0027re calculating, or even the steps to determining the true chance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vitekc45c","CreatedById":98257,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T11:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the universe itself IS infinite, but the amouth of matter is finite?

Think about it : how many numbers (or units) there exist in the lines of this coordinates on Big Bang, is it finite or infinite ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it can be either one; for the infinite, while big bang leads to a conclusion that the universe starts from a single point, this point is there because light can\u0027t move around yet at all, and what mass-energy can affect is just that point - there are infinitely many other points. For been finite ? the same - it\u0027ll be a point again, but there could be other points (ie. more than one yet finite), most likely to happen when our Universe is positively curved and have a larger than zero (uh, positive) curvature radius at start. There could be actually just a point because at the time of Big Bang, the curvature is positive, and the radius is zero (whatever units). Sounds silly, but that\u0027s it : we don\u0027t see the same objects many times (ie. had it been closed the horizon distance is less than it\u0027s \u0022circumference\u0022, or it\u0027s simply infinite) and it\u0027s isotropic and homogeneous on large (like, \u0026lt;100 Mpc) scales (means there\u0027s no way there could be a border, because that\u0027d be a preferred direction, and that the center of the Universe exist).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could even take infinitesimals and then says it\u0027s undecided.
