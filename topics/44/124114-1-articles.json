For system designs, from 0 to and army of engineers (if by engineer we mean someone trained as an engineer). IIRC, this gaming gadget, a joystick with inbuilt games was conceived and designed by a single engineer. A large company bought the design and put their own engineers to work on the mass production/market side of things. The Apollo program saw thousands of engineers working in teams for each detail. Individuals had a general idea, then the teams got down to work out the how to-s. I read about the new launch vehiecle, more than a dozen teams just to work on getting to the next milestone in the design. For production design, one can expect a huge army of engineers working for all those contractors. As been said, how many comes down to several things: Budget/time line, complexity, how much needs to be either invented or reinvented, safety concerns (how critical is it to get everything right the first time?), traditions (it can vary between countries or businesses in a given country) and a host of other things I haven\u0027t thought of right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T16:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it depends.
