While the Soviet Union was never big on such broad, borderline-religious ideologies, the populist (and quasi-athiest) appeal of this message synergized nicely with propaganda themes of the time. By extension, ICBM development (which then led directly into the Soviet space program) was performed by many individuals who were inspired by such beliefs and narratives fostered within that community (combined, of course, with the infamous Russian inferiority complex that perceived the \u0022west\u0022 was headed in the direction of similar accomplishments).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that Siddiqi is incorrect in crediting this term solely to the influence of Cosmism on the Soviet space program.
