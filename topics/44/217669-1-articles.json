The density of the propellant does not significantly affect performance. Sugar brine has a density of about 1300 kg per cubic metre and using that density in the model only yeilds about 1-2% more altitude. The reason being that the Ve is that much lower because the same internal rocket pressure can\u0027t accelerate the heavier fluid as much as it does the lighter fluid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The boost phase of the flight is over in about 1/3 of a second, and the rocket accelerates to about 95 kph in that time. It then flies ballisticly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Performance isn\u0027t that sensitive to the size of the nozzle. At least not with variation of only a couple millimetres around the existing nozzle radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The biggest determinant of performance (perhaps not surprisingly) is internal rocket pressure and the amount of water in the chamber. In my son\u0027s rocket, launching slightly less than 1/2 full with water seems to yeild the best performance, but\u00A0 that would change depending on the rocket geometry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMy model accurately predicts the flight duration and I am working on figuring out how to verify other parameters.

A family friend had donated me a PVC pipe based air rocket launcher designed to hook into an air compressor. The rockets would be built out of duct tape and paper, and the pressure would be built up and released, sending the rockets a couple hundred feet. I made an extension for it that would allow it to hold standard drinking bottles down and pressurize them. However it was very janky and unreliable, and required me sitting right next to it to set it off, thus, fearing for my life, I never took it up to the pressures those bottles were capable of, and also because there was no seal, it leaked too much to reach those pressures without prematurely spraying all of the water out! Also I got soaked every launch, but it was part of the fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember precisely what mine were called, but they were part of my X program, encompassing pyro, water, and air rockets. I believe I\u0027ve reached around X-12, but there were a few repeats because I couldn\u0027t keep track of the names myself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X-6 would have been my first self built water rocket, a simple 2 liter bottle with cardboard fins duct taped to it. Probably got 30-50 feet into the air by my judgement. It rapidly deteriorated however as the cardboard fins did not take kindly to the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might be mixing up the X-7 and the X-8, but the X-7 was probably another 2 liter bottle based rocket, this time with another 2 liter bottle serving as a nose cone, and fins with layered cardboard, construction paper, and packing tape, as an attempt at waterproofing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt performed by far the best out of any of my water rockets, probably reaching above 60 feet, but this is just by estimation and was never scientifically measured. The Estes altimeters don\u0027t take well to water, hard impacts, and low altitudes, and I wouldn\u0027t have gotten one for a few years at that point. I hadn\u0027t really learned trigonometry at that point, so strapping some rods to a protractor and standing a known distance away would also come later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X-8 was a rocket designed to test splicing multiple bottles together using tape and whatever glues I had on hand. I believe I attempted to seal 2 or 3 (probably 2) 1.25L bottles together (we were out of 2L bottles at the time I believe), combined with another bottle as a nose cone, much larger fins designed like the X-7\u0027s fins, and a metal pipe as a counterweight because it was tail heavy from the fins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt failed horrendously, my pathetic attempt at a seal probably couldn\u0027t hold water at ambient pressure, let alone the tens of PSI I was targeting! Even during attempted pressurizations and launches, it probably needed help getting off of the launch pad, and never flew more than a foot or two under its own power, although it was fun to throw around (probably not a good idea because of the metal pipe, but it did make it very aerodynamically stable). The large fins also needed a better attachment mechanism than tape as they proved to be quite floppy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pinnacle of my water rocket journey was the X-9. I decided to do it like the pros. I saved up a LOT of 2L bottles, actually bought stuff instead of relying on my family\u0027s grand collection of basement junk, and bothered measuring things to ensure they would go on correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the volume of the fuel tank ended up being around 8-12 liters, with either 3 or 4 spliced pairs of 2 liter bottles and one normal 2 liter bottle connected by tornado tubes, all glued together by Air Command\u0027s recommended glue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had its own section for a parachute, built from a broken umbrella, which, due to my lack of electronics knowledge, was actively deployed using remote control from an R/C car I had disassembled for the purpose, which never worked more than 1/4 of the time in testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts fins were actual corrugated posterboard, gigantic sheets secured with diagonal braces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt even had a payload bay at the top where I planned to seat lego astronauts and possibly a camera if it proved reliable enough to justify risking one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, well... It leaked. Very badly. From what I can remember, the splices were done pretty well, but the tornado tubes were not designed to hold pressure. If I do this again I will order from multiple manufacturers and test before committing to one. Some of the might have even cracked, I don\u0027t remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I took it all apart and rebuilt it, adding lots more glue. This rebuild was so significant that I actually renamed it to X-10. Unfortunately, the launch pad would not seal with it, causing obtaining pressures beyond a certain point to be impossible. The pros use an O ring based system but I never got that far, I had always intended to build a new launch pad capable of supporting a rocket that huge, with a proper seal, but I just haven\u0027t yet, and the rocket is currently sitting untested in my parents\u0027 basement, as it has been for the past several years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour post has kind of made me want to get back into this. Unfortunately I don\u0027t permanently live with my parents any more so acquiring the resources for restarting NOSPWRAD (my water rocket agency) will be problematic, but I might be able to figure something out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are curious, a summary of the full X program:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-1, a clay rocket I built as an art project designed to accept Estes motors, flown with much fear and trepidation. If I remember right it burned a hole through the launch pad during attempted liftoff and never went anywhere.

So dangerous even I never flew it. So much so that I even forgot I had assigned it an X designation until many years later when I, slightly more professionally, revived the X program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-3 Red Goblin, a cardboard and wood and styrofoam rocket designed to test construction techniques and the ignition of two Estes motors simultaneously. Flew at least four times, and if I remember correctly, there were only one or two separate dual ignitions that actually succeeded, the majority of the flights ended in it veering off one way or another with only one of the engines having lit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-4 Red (I forgot the second half of the name), a cardboard and wood two stage rocket designed to carry a payload and test manufacturing techniques, probably the most successful of the entire X series. Obtained altitudes of a few hundred feet (altimeter and trig verified) and with successful second stage ignition and payload return. The brown first stage tube never got painted, though, and I never found it in the field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-5, a massive K\u0027nex rocket with a 2 liter bottle in the base I launched on the air pressure launcher. Made it perhaps 5-10 feet laterally, but beyond a certain pressure the bottle shot through the rocket, destroying it and causing me to have to pick up a lot of K\u0027nex pieces from the yard. Flew before X-3 or X-4 because they took me so long to finish and fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-6, discussed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-7, discussed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-8, discussed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX-8 again, a rocket made entirely out of paper and tape and toothpicks. A very bad idea, but a very fun idea.
