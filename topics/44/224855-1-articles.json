And I looked the cost of criogenic units, and I saw that you can buy a refrigerator that can reach -200\u00B0 C for little more than 3000 $.

They can take severe swings in temperature with just insulation protecting them. Building on research done for ICBMs, they can be stored for years to decades in tanks before being mixed in the engine, and not do anything exciting. Bladders and/or pistons in the tanks can pressurise the propellants in zero gravity. The engines are often pressure-fed, either combining the two fuels or feeding one over a catalyst bed, which makes them, again, simple and reliable. Specific impulse is not the main priority here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCr\u003Cstrong\u003Ey\u003C/strong\u003Eogenic propellants are trickier.

To reliably cool a zero-G liquid, it must be touching the cooler. Materials for bladders/pistons that can stay flexible in such temperatures aren\u0027t common. Or researched. Further, most of the research was conducted on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, Intuitive Machines\u0027 Nova-C probe was methalox and used cr\u003Cstrong\u003Ey\u003C/strong\u003Eogenic propellants.

I regret that I only have one upvote to give you for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, while cryocooling wasn\u0027t the main topic, there were experiments made. the values of thermal transfer given with the use of MLI, around 1 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, are consistent with a small probe only needing a few W of cooling power. With a cryocooler efficiency of 5 to 10%, which is pretty reasonable considering the theoretical carnot efficiency for the temperatures involved, a good guesstimate is several tens of watts, up to 100. that\u0027s within the capacity of probes like New Horizons or Juno, but it would place a significant strain on their power generation. For starship, the power generation needed would be in the tens or hundreds of KW - could be inconvenient, since the solar panels need to be retracted and protected during aerobraking on mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe main issue, anyway, is indeed the way the liquid form bubbles that interfere with heat transfer. several experiments were attempted with bringing cryocoolers in space, some were successful, and it was demonstrated a prolonged storage of LOx with zero boiloff, but some failed due to heat transfer issues. sloshing is also an issue; with MMH and NTO, the problem is avoided by using internal bladders and pistons that prevent sloshing, but such solutions would not work in cryogenic conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit seems the system is potentially workable, and it is being investigated. However, the specific issues are caused by the zero-g environment, and fixing them requires experiments in zero g, which are very expensive to make. confronted with limited budget, it is preferred to stick to older, less efficient, but tested and reliable solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is turning out to be a surprisingly common answer to a lot of things about space. many practical problems trequire to think a solution, launch it to space, test whether it works, tryto make some sense from the data coming from the instruments, think another solution, wait to launch that in space too... on earth, a team of engineers could fix it with a few weeks of trial and error. but needing to launch every single iteration in space - much less being unable to put your hands on it and having to rely on limited instrumental data to figure out what\u0027s going on - increases costs and time exorbitantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit still does not answer my question on why cryocooling isn\u0027t employed on earth. it seems that taking air, cooling it, extracting nitrogen through fractional distillation, and transporting it to the factory to compensate for boiloff is considered cheaper than just keeping the nitrogen cool inside the tank. this baffles me. Still, a potential answer also lies in that paper, when it suggests the main issues of venting are during fuel transfers. so it is possible that the greatest losses to boiloff are not caused by heat transfer, but by fuel transfer - which, in a factory using liquid nitrogen, happens multiple times per day. it is possible the figure for 1% daily losses include those for fuel trasfer, while heat transfer losses are a lot lower. i would still like to hear about it from an expert, but it\u0027s no longer related to the field of space travel, and it doesn\u0027t belong here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-17T09:45:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2024 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 17\u0022\u003EMay 17\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-17T10:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224390579\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224855\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715932348\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t expecting to get snide remarks and not-so-subtle insults, though.
