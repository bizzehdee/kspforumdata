I just checked yesterday on Dawn\u0027s NASA site, I figured new images HAD to be coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still baffled why the camera on Dawn has only a 20 mm aperture. It\u0027s only a few times sharper than the human eye. Surely, with all the money they spent, they could have put a camera with a bigger lens on the spacecraft. Anybody know why they chose such a small lens?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T15:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it a weight issue?
