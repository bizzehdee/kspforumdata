At greater distances (generally to Jupiter and beyond) our probes use faster transfers because Hohmann transfer just takes too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same way, transfers between stars in a binary system could use different trajectories depending on the relative sizes and distances of the stars, the propellant budget, maximum available thrust, initial orbit, expected failure rate of spacecraft components, possible time-critical mission objectives, and the availability of planets for gravitational assist. Probably more things I haven\u0027t thought of as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
