For reference, these are the two types of planetary orbits in multiplanetary systems.

As current detection limits are fairly low, and planets have already been found here, it is quite probable that there are additional bodies in the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanets around Alpha Cen A\u003C/strong\u003E: It\u0027s certainly possible for there to be planets around A, but there are some complications. Alpha Cen A and B are separated by 17.6 AU on average (varying between 11.2 and 35.6 AU). While planets orbiting up to 2.8 AU away would be stable, it is unclear if planets could have formed in this region. Several planets have been found around single stars in multistar systems, but few as close together as Alpha Cen A and B.\u00A0OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L B is currently the record holder for tightest binary with an S-type planet, and is separated from its companion by somewhere between 11 and 17 AU. This is very similar to Alpha Cen, but the stars in the OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L system are both red dwarfs, where planets would form much closer in, so its still unclear if planets could have formed around Alpha Cen A. There is some evidence for dust around A and/or B, so its certainly possible that planets could exist there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanets around Alpha Cen B\u003C/strong\u003E: A very similar case to A, certainly possible, but the situation is made complicated by the AB binary pair. Unlike A, there is an unconfirmed exoplanet around Alpha Cen B. Bc, if confirmed, would be a lava world about the same size as Earth. Alpha Cen Bb was found to be cause by data artefacts in 2015, and so is extremely unlikely to be present. With unconfirmed planets and possible dust, it is possible that one or more planets could be present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanets in P-type orbits around both Alpha Cen A and B\u003C/strong\u003E: This is possible, but less likely than planets around either A or B. There are numerous binary systems with planets in P-type orbits, but none have been found in systems with stars as far apart as Alpha Cen A and B. The current record holder is FW Tauri AB b, orbiting stars separated by 11 AU, which is only two-thirds the average separation in Alpha Cen. It is also unclear if FW Tauri AB b is a high mass planet, brown dwarf, or low mass star. Even if no planets were able to form in P-type orbits around A and B, it is possible that some worlds were flung out from A or B into orbit around the pair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECool Info, but what do I actually think?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0I\u0027d guess there are few more planets orbiting proxima. I\u0027d also guess that there are a several planets in S-type orbits around A and B, but wouldn\u0027t be too surprised if this wasn\u0027t the case. I\u0027d guess there aren\u0027t any planets larger than Earth orbiting A and B in a P-type orbit, but wouldn\u0027t be shocked if one was found eventually. I would however guess that there are several circumbinary dwarf planets around the pair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps give ideas and clears up more confusion than it causes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
