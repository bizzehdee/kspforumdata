Hacking into a ship\u0027s computer and reprogramming it to do things such as shutting down the engines and defensive weapons, atmospheric controls, or if you really wanted to prove a point, reprogram it to crash into other enemy ships, planets, asteroids, or even enter the corona of a star. Again if this cannot be done by radio signal, it could be accomplished by the use of the aforementioned robots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but no. No freaking way. This is like \u003Cem\u003Eboarding\u003C/em\u003E, and that won\u0027t work in space. To perform a rendezvous, you need a cooperative target, else the best you can hope for is to slam into it at a few hundred m/s, if not more km/s, and that is if the target is already defeated, because otherwise it wouldn\u0027t have allowed functional enemy drones inside a 1,000km radius around it. I don\u0027t think you truly grasp the scale of space combat, the arena is at least a few tens of thousands of kms around the involved ships, up to \u003Cem\u003Elight-seconds\u003C/em\u003E (hundreds of thousands or millions of kms, if you are feeling lazy to do the calculation) at high tech levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think it is about time to say how \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E actually think warships would be designed, in my humble opinion and all that jazz, and stop with the generalities so you guys can put holes on specific ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing is, it really wouldn\u0027t be much of a warship, more like a inter-dependent flotilla. The core would be the manned portion, housing a pretty hefty reactor, the most efficient drive you can get your hands on (probably some form of nuclear thermal engine), maybe a railgun (for siege/bombardment operations), and a boopload of C4IR and support equipment. Basically, a glorified tender and C\u0026amp;C ship, plus the legs for the whole thing. The hab(s) would probably be configured so that artificial gravity can be generated when the ship is not under thrust, and it would have a lot of hardpoints to carry fuel tanks and cargo externally. Probably something actually derived from civilian designs, at least at first, since the requirement ain\u0027t that different: carry a lot of payload from A to B, A and B being as far away as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a kind of \u0022warship\u0022, but the point would be that it should stay \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from all fights. Plus, it really carries no ship-to-ship armament and really shouldn\u0027t waste mass in armor. Ship to ship \u0022armament\u0022 would be entirely drone-based, with laser cannons and their power systems coupled to some drive system... resistojets would work very well, they have nuke-like Isp and they are electric drives that can be put all around the ship, thus giving it the same thrust potential on all axises, and good maneuverability. Those would be the laserstars proper, the drones that actually do battle a few thousand kilometers away form their mothership. They would also form a shield around it, protecting it from all harm and keeping it away form the range of enemy weapons. If a laser cannon is on the order of 10-50mT, these drones will be on the order of 50-100mT, when power systems and engines and reaction mass and such are included (rough order-of-magnitude figure I\u0027m pulling out of informed my ass, this whole thing is very dependent on tech level). Pretty hefty for a drone, but all I can say is they will be as small as they can, while still carrying the biggest laser, with the longest-ranged optics, that side can afford to mass-produce. When those are lost, the battle is lost, so the manned module/mothership would turn tail and run, if it can, or surrender or blow themselves if they dV/ acceleration won\u0027t let them evade the surviving enemy combat drones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther kinds of drone would be carried, of course. Additional sensor drones come to mind, for example. Mind you, the laserstar drones would have one or two very cool optical telescopes of extreme range to do targeting with (their primary turrets), but you kind of want to keep those busy firing, and/or you don\u0027t want to risk them unnecessarily. So, some kind of cheap disposable drone would do, plus you could give it a secondary purpose as ECM platform. Basically, a chemical-powered drone of a couple tons fueled that power its ECM suite with fuel cells, so they are compact and you can carry an order of magnitude more of those than weapons,. They would be more maneuverable, so they can get a bit closer before they are shot down. Plus, they can do spotting over the horizon and serve as communication relays and such. All in all, too useful not to carry at least a few, they can even try to suicide themselves as improvised missiles if the situation calls for it (which I doubt it ever would). Also, for extended deployments, because the rocket equation is kind of a ... hard mistress, shall we say, and battles will waste \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of propellant \u0027dodging\u0027, miner drones to remass propellant sound pretty useful, if suitable sources are available. I imagine they would be like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/realdesigns.php#id--Kuck_Mosquito\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKuck Mosquitoes\u003C/a\u003E, probably civilian models with a paintjob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the big mothership acts as tender and nerve center to get its laserstars into battle. Those constitute its main combat force, and they are themselves supported by smaller drones still that form a durable sensor network. Together, they form a very mobile force that, when trouble arises, can present to the enemy a distributed source of dakka, while putting all the really vulnerable stuff behind layers of defense/offense. And the support equipment in the mothership, plus the modular nature of the system, allows it to fulfill any kind of non-combat missions with a proper loadout, from disaster relief to invasion actions, just by leaving some of its combat drones at home. It also addresses the highly \u0022ablative\u0022 nature of space combat where one hit generally equals one kill: Damage is received in the form of destroyed drones until the very last, and destroyed drones can be replaced whole with minimal effort by shipping new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. You could call the motherships \u0022carriers\u0022, to continue the trend of \u0022stealing names of previous weapons of war that have nothing to do with the new one, but sound cool\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-20T00:46:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2015 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T01:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have rendezvoused and even docked with non-cooperative targets before - remember the heroic cosmonauts who saved Salyut 7?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T01:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBTW, are we discussing missiles vs lasers or railgun rounds vs lasers?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, it as alway been \u0022railgun guided projectiles\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can call them \u0022kinetic missiles electro-magneticaly catapulted\u0022, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T02:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe have rendezvoused and even docked with non-cooperative targets before - remember the heroic cosmonauts who saved Salyut 7?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESalyut 7 was an inert hulk, not a maneuvering, armed, enemy spaceship.

Period. Furthermore, sensor destruction exchange is going to take place at much farther distances because it is far easier to blind than it is to kill... and the whole reason a target has to be \u003Cem\u003Epermanently\u003C/em\u003E neutralized is to ensure that it doesn\u0027t return to fighting form and shoot you at some future date. So once they\u0027re blinded, finishing them off is mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThus the only logical conclusion one can come to is that the most successful strategy will be the one that renders the opponent blind and deaf, so they can\u0027t dodge and they have no countermeasures, followed \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eby a mop-up operation.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what about the mechanisms to achieve that finishing blow? Let\u0027s look at the big 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELasers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with using lasers as kill weapons is a combination of thermal efficiency - not really that big a deal since it\u0027ll be safe to deploy your radiators - and precision. Precision issues means that hitting the same hole again to burn through the next layer of ablative armour makes burning holes through a warship at long range a difficult proposition, and it is compounded by the compartmental nature of warships. So their engagement ranges are going to be within a few kilometres or so to ensure that the series of pulses doesn\u0027t scatter over the hull of the ship, leaving a polka-dot pattern all over the place, while the critical systems and compartments are untouched because the laser didn\u0027t burn through \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the layers of whipple shields and ablative armour. Since what we want is to be close enough that the dispersion isn\u0027t a factor - and that means being closer than we first speculated. Yes, the amount of power is going to be significant... but really, at that point, we\u0027re just wandering around the battlefield stabbing wounded knights in the throat with our dagger so does it really matter how long it takes to charge our capacitors or if we deploy radiators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERailgun/Coilgun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA KE system is also of questionable use at long ranges. Direct hits with KE systems - even against non-maneuvering targets - would limit their ranges to a few km; even \u0022guided\u0022 rcs powered shells wouldn\u0027t offer much improvement because the amount of fuel to noticeably change course - which it wouldn\u0027t be able to do until it was within a few km anyways - would mean that much of that accelerated mass isn\u0027t used for the kill since it would be maneuvering at the most expensive point to change dV. More likely a shell (continuous rod blah blah blah) would be fired at a range where sensor resolution and mount precision are good enough that the shell simply has to get within about 40m or so of the target before it explodes, ripping the ship in half or perhaps even just tearing open a big hole through a few sections and disabling a whole bunch of critical systems. So there\u0027s a pK A of \u0026gt;0.5... but again, it was fired within km of the target so it doesn\u0027t have any advantage over the laser except perhaps in efficiency (DARPA\u0027s mortar coilgun has over 20% efficiency), but, again, since we can use our radiators, does it actually matter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissile/Drone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a great idea: we lob a missile from 100\u0027s of km and it has a continuous rod blah blah blah and it homes in on the target and all our problems are solved. But there\u0027s an interesting issue with that: missiles/drones take up volume. More volume than a railgun and its shells or a laser. We could keep them outside of the ship before launching, but then they\u0027re exposed to laser fire and, well, you\u0027ve just surrounded yourself with dozens of continuous rod warheads... not exactly the position you want to be when people are zapping each other with long range lasers. So now we have a ship with a larger than necessary hull to protect those missiles (it also just occurred to me that SRBs aside, most missiles would need to be fueled, serviced and tested just before battle if they\u0027ve travelled many months through space, so externally carried missiles are even less likely), where it would be just as advantageous to carry more fuel and simply close in and laser or KE the buggers to death. Or, more likely, a missile bus would simply hang around at the fringe until the battle was over, and simply get a little closer and lob its missiles at all the helpless ships floating in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I therefore submit that, outside of a dedicated support missile bus finishing off the enemy from stand-off distances, there really isn\u0027t that much of an advantage or disadvantage to using KE or lasers as finishing weapons. I suspect lasers would be favoured by pure anti-ship doctrines (or those that prefer lasers in general) while KE weapons would be favoured for multi-role vessels where long range bombardment is part of its job description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T06:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf stealth in space was a thing, yeah, I reckon you would be right.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I\u0027ve said repeated times, boosting the projectile with a SRB is better by any measure, including EM emissions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve said both of these things over and over, and each time, the result has been the same: people have disagreed with you.....over and over.

Being blind really does put a ship at a severe disadvantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse, the attacker sets up a transfer orbit to ensure a close-in encounter that the defender cannot see coming; once within a handful of km the attacker can disable the engines and whatever secondary sensors might be operational - including the crewmember poking their head out an airlock with a radio, a sextant, and eyeballs, mk 1. Boarding actions, aside from dramatic or humanitarian reasons, would be highly unlikely due to the risk of the crippled ship\u0027s crew booby-trapping their own ship, or plotting their own boarding counter-attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, the most likely end to the scenario will either be the defender extending their radiators in surrender - I don\u0027t necessarily see this working due to the high risk involved with boarding actions, making it more likely that an attacker will just finish the ship off; if the ship is an attacking ship, it will try to flee or regroup with its cohorts; or the crew scuttling/booby-trapping the vessel before abandoning ship in escape pods - the most likely solution that ends well for the defenders . I can\u0027t imagine a warship designed for re-entry so I don\u0027t really see any other option a defender would have; and an attacker would likely have a pre-programmed exit burn and hope their INS doesn\u0027t generate enough errors that their escape window is actually the best way to throw them into solar orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T12:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat would be a kind of \u0022warship\u0022, but the point would be that it should stay \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from all fights.

Let\u0027s consider the scenario I mentioned earlier in this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Mars launches a fleet to Earth. The fleet consists of thousands of disposable small drones. Due to the use of decoys and chaotic thruster firing patterns, Earth can see that an attack is coming, but it doesn\u0027t know on which day the fleet will arrive and how large it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) On the way to Earth, the drones are in sleep mode. They use only passive sensors and low-powered electronics. Final course corrections are made using cold gas thrusters well beyond the likely detection range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The fleet passes the Earth from all sides. The battle takes place during the flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) As the drones approach weapon range, they power up their systems. Some drones carry active sensors, which they use to highlight enemy targets to the drones carrying weapons. This also makes them rather bright targets, helping the armed drones that have not fired yet to remain hidden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The armed drones are just large enough to carry an effective weapon (a laser?). They will keep shooting at the enemies during the flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) This was just the first wave of the attack. Later waves may be based on something completely different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I imagine stealth would work in space. The enemy may know that an attack is coming, but they don\u0027t know the precise time of the attack or the exact size of the attacking force. Because the exact time is uncertain, enemy ships won\u0027t be in optimal positions to fire at the attacker. This may give the attacker numerical superiority at the beginning of the battle, which can be decisive due to Lanchester\u0027s square law.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T16:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[snip]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, that is a refreshing amount of realism. Let me offer my opinion on your opinions of the big three, plus a general point. The general point first, since it affects all three. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to be supposing a slow rendezvous as the means of engaging in battle, something like a fleet inserting into the orbit of the other one, then hanging around after the fight. In reality, that position makes little strategic sense that I can think of, except defending fixed orbital installations that you can\u0027t really defend, since they are fixed. Most of the other scenarios involve an interception at high-ish relative speed, and at km/s speeds and effective ranges of hundreds of kms for \u0022hard kill\u0022 measures (blowing stuff up) and up to thousands for \u0022soft kill\u0022 ones (blinding the target), ships will only be in the \u0022hard kill\u0022 range for a few seconds or minutes at most. Considering the G\u0027s we can expect of weapon platforms, they won\u0027t really be able to stop and turn around until hours or days have gone by, even if they have the dV to do so (which they could, many drives can give you dV on the order of 50km/s). BUT. During the approach, for the minutes to hours they are in \u0022soft kill\u0022 range vying for dominance, they can thrust around to change the distance of their close approach and get a better position and stuff. And against a blind target that you know can\u0027t fire, the seconds that you are in kill range are enough: a laser that can burn off a sensor at 1,000 kms can cut a ship in half at less than 100... and if they are worried about closing in they can always tell one of their sensor drones to reduce its closest approach to zero while they burn away to increase it, and trust in good old newton to do the mopping up, no warhead required. Now, on to the big three:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELasers: As I said, they can be just as spectacular as the best kinetic. The laser that can blind at thousands of kms can drill holes very fast at 100kms, to say nothing of 10. As the beam spot gets smaller and more concentrated, they can start cutting away stuff, or let the mechanical shock of the pulse shockwaves rip apart the target. People are just so used to seeing low-power lasers measured in watts or kW, right next to high power chemical stuff that deliver MW or GW, that they forget that it is all a matter of power levels. Still, that means you have to get close and personal yourself, so you have to be really sure that your target is helpless. In any case, for a given wattage output in your weapons system, a laser can dish out just as much dakka as a railgun during the seconds the other ship is only a few kms away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERailgun/Coilgun: they let you lob kinetics at significantly different orbits, \u003Cem\u003Epotentially\u003C/em\u003E allowing bombardment of fixed targets from outside effective engagement envelope. The dV has to work and you railgun has to be hellishly precise, tough. That sounds like the kind of overspecialized siege weapon a class of specialized ship would be built around. Call it a bomber if you will. The main selling point is the cheapness of each shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissile/drone: it is much more flexible than a railgun, with a higher dV even restricting yourself to chemical engines, and \u003Cem\u003Ewith the right guidance available\u003C/em\u003E more precise than anything at long ranges. The problem is that we already have RAM countermeasures today, and in space they have inherent advantages, so anything that can move slightly out of the way of the debris once it\u0027s \u0022killed\u0022 and can\u0027t home in will be safe. So, siege weaponry against fixed targets again, only this one can be bolted to the exterior of ships to hitch a ride. Likely to be expensive in the long run compared to the alternatives, so it depends on how much bombarding you expect to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, that makes sense.

His acceleration will be comparable to the enemy ships, only he can drop every non-essential piece of equipment and all unused ordnance, maybe even some propellant if he knows he won\u0027t need it, so perhaps he can pull a few more m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E (or mm/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, depending on the prevalent drives). With that knowledge, any of you KSP players should know what he should do to get the closest approach to increase, and give the enemy\u0027s weapons the shortest window inside the \u0022kill range\u0022 I alluded to earlier: burn in any direction like hell, without caring much which is it as long as it doesn\u0027t point at the enemy. It \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E already on a trajectory that will take it to a close approach, any change in that will make their orbits no longer cross. If you don\u0027t believe me, set up a rendezvous on KSP at a few hundred m/s, then start firing in any one direction a few hundred kms before it on RCS: you will ruin it in no time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the enemy can try an counteract this, since they can see the direction you are running and they can run themselves, but as I said, the fleeing ship can get some advantages in acceleration over a similar ship that wants to fight when they meet. And since they likely already started in trajectories that only made their \u0022kill spheres\u0022 brush each other, they might have enough time to get themselves completely free for certain acceleration values and closing speeds (the slower the relative velocity, and the higher the acceleration of the ships, the easier to escape). When they are on the other side of teh encounter, if they are still in one piece, the fleeing ship would stop the random firing of RCS thrusters (if they run in a straight line they would be at the mercy of even pieces of shrapnel) and gun it to a homewards-bound trajectory. Running some really crude back of the envelope calculations, at 1km/s losing speed you could move out of the way if you could do just 1m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E more than the enemy (~400kms farther at close approach), but at 10km/s you would move just a pathetic 4, so you would likely still be inside the kill sphere of the pursuer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if the pursuing ship has let loose a few high-G missile interceptors, things look much bleaker for the defeated ship. Come to think of it, that is a perfect argument for missiles: delivering the killing blow to defeated ships, if the closing rate is slow enough for it to make a run for it. Or, alternatively, for the interceptions where relative speed is high enough (\u0026gt;100km/s or something similarly stupid) that your ships only stay a minuscule amount of time in kill range of each other: missiles are not restricted in their wattage output as weapons by things like radiators, you can launch all your compliment at the same time, and if one can home in on the helpless ship without being blinded itself, they all can. But really, those intercept speeds are pretty ridiculous, anyway. The slow motion scenario is much more plausible, even if not very likely to be common either. You don\u0027t want to conquer the position your target was in, you want to neutralize it and move on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I predict that post-battle debris will not often be recovered form its hyperbolic orbits... I wouldn\u0027t expect the future space navies to use many coffins in their space wars, nothing to send home to bury.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Atomic Rockets has a great discussion about this. It\u0027s not about defeating lasers (I don\u0027t see a perfect laser defence, personally); it\u0027s about reducing the pK of that laser strike in the one to ten second window (supposing their orbits are counter to each other) that they have to the point where the defender can survive and possibly escape. Of course a GJ class laser could vaporize a portion of a ship in spectacular fashion; but if the pulses are spread out over the area of the ship, and subsequent pulses are reduced in effectiveness due to blooming caused by the initial vaporization of the first layer of armour (which, given the effectiveness of lasers, it would behoove a designer to try to mitigate their damage if only for crew survival reasons), it stands to reason that even a laser armed ship would have to be quite close to make whatever armour is there pointless by lasing the \u003Cem\u003Eexact same spot\u003C/em\u003E with multiple pulses for reasons of precision. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERailgun/Coilgun:\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually less convinced now of the usefulness of KE ordnance as I was yesterday.

And since they have to maneuver to intercept, solid fuels aren\u0027t really an option - a missile that can throw itself into a Hohmann transfer means that it can eventually pK a helpless target; it can also pK a platform; and it can chase a moving target. Now, can you use a mass driver to give it a dV boost? Sure, why not? But it wouldn\u0027t be like 10km/s or something stupid.

The light detecting sensors are on the opposite side from the enemy, so you can\u0027t jam them. (the whole shell would probably be studded with light detecting sensors. All of them are looking for update packets. If an update packet passes the one time pad security checks, it gets accepted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, these update packets order the shell to make maneuvers to correct for tiny inaccuracies in the launching railgun/coilgun and to correct for any movements made by the victim ship.

You would inject hydrogen into this stream somehow in order to get an \u0022afterburner\u0022 that would boost thrust at the expense of ISP) that can do 1/10 of a G, then in 1359 seconds the victim ship has dodged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the kinetic rounds have a closing velocity of 10 kilometers/second, the max range is 13,000 kilometers. 26,000 if you can launch at 20 kps. The trouble with boosting the launch velocity is that every time you double it, the massive bank of capacitors driving the railgun, or big honking stack of magnets driving the coilgun has to quadruple in mass. So there\u0027s diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you bother with kinetics if you can use lasers instead? One reason is bang/buck. If you can only fit, say, 100 metric tons of weapons into the payload section of your warship, you might be able to do a heck of a lot more damage with kinetic weapons weighing the same amount as lasers. You also have a lot more range - with 5 meter or so laser mirrors, you only have a \u0022beam range\u0022 of about 1000-2000 kilometers. You could open up with kinetic missiles at vast distances, at least against targets who don\u0027t have the dV to run or point defense. You\u0027d carry counter-laser-lasers, these would be small, lower power solid state lasers designed to marr the mirror surfaces of the enemy ship\u0027s laser turrets. They would double as point defense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note : I don\u0027t see blinding as an effective strategy. The reason is that over the years, electronics and sensors have gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. I think it\u0027s a reasonable expectation that by the time we have the technology for space warships (if we \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eever\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E build them), we\u0027d be able to stud their surfaces with distributed sensors and electronics. That is, rather than use lenses, the hull itself would have a thin surface layer with regions of it that are sensitive to light and sensitive to infrared. So the (backup) sensors would be printed onto the hull itself, with the electronics that can integrate all this incoming light into a coherent image (similar to a lightfield camera)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese sensors would probably be sensitive enough to spot enemy warships with active engines (from the massive flares of light their engines give off) and the stars, enough that you could at least keep shooting and/or get home if you survive the engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that anyone would plan to return home. Why carry enough fuel to get home? A more realistic space warship would probably be intended to be disposable. It would either use autonomous systems or some kind of AI instead of a crew. An AI could just get itself home by beaming it\u0027s \u0022mind-state\u0022 file off the wreckage of the ship, and streaming that state file during a battle.

Because sometimes the point of firing rockets in that particular theater is not to actually hit things; it\u0027s to force a civil \u0022head to the bomb shelter\u0022 alert and scare people... Fear is just as important as ammunition.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sort of have a point, but I think both your rationalization and your example is kind of weak: you\u0027re comparing asymmetrical terror warfare intended to force a government to enact policy change to a battle tactic that, I believe, you are equating to a flanking maneuver. In space. Because AWACS and battlespace awareness are something that militaries despise and only perform because civilian committees make them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would have been more accurate to compare it to orbital bombardment from an attacking ship/fleet for the purposes of forcing the planet\u0027s leaders to capitulate to the invader\u0027s demands. The orbital strikes could possibly be rendered ineffective through various planetary defences, but as you pointed out, terrorizing the citizens and getting them to demand that their leaders capitulate could be as effective as actually striking strategic locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOperative word being \u0022strong enough\u0022.

Also, when you guys are talking about heat/IR (and any other kind of radiation), remember that its detection range is based on source vs. background (it\u0027s called contrast ratio, or, for those who are sciencey: signal vs. noise!). The higher the contrast ratio, the farther the radiation can be detected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn warfare, you \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E know where to look... Bottom line: any system that can scan the entire sky at once must always do so at the price of decreased resolution, therefore decreased scanner range.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh, snarkyness aside (and is it really necessary in a friendly discussion?), I think you bring up a good point about one of the things we don\u0027t talk about: and that\u0027s situational awareness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look at it from a strategic point of view, we\u0027re going to know where the enemy is coming from because diplomatic efforts to resolve whatever incident sparked the conflict have failed. If we\u0027re Terrans and we\u0027ve annoyed the Venutians, then we know roughly their likely path to Earth, and know to train every sensor we have on their planet to look for a launch. If we suspect the Jovians are in cahoots too, then we know to spend some time looking towards Jupiter and its moons as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think we Terrans would be lucky to detect a launch from a planet or moon, especially if they wait until their own planet occludes the launch. We also would be kind of lucky to detect a Jovian fleet prior to the asteroid belt if they use Jupiter to slingshot; they\u0027re busy still cooling their engines and their reactors are running at 5 or 10% power, but have dumped enough heat that they don\u0027t stand out too much against the planet behind them. Realistic? Dunno, but I\u0027m just throwing it out there for the sake of argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it looks like Earth is doomed because the fleets have been launched and the Earth is unaware! But wait, the Venutians are detected midway to Earth - the Sun was helping hide them; and the Jovians are picked up as they near Mars\u0027 orbital path because there\u0027s nothing behind them to hide their existence! Does that mean the attack is thwarted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really. It just means that space battles will be much more like the fleet actions during the Age of Sail that they will Star Wars or submarine warfare. Surprise will less likely involve maneuvers as it will discovering what weapon philosophy particular space naval architects settled on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow will we see the invaders from Beta Reticulai 7 before they arrive to conquer us and corrupt our bodily fluids!? I can\u0027t say, but I think we should make it our top priority!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T03:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou sort of have a point, but I think both your rationalization and your example is kind of weak: you\u0027re comparing asymmetrical terror warfare intended to force a government to enact policy change to a battle tactic that, I believe, you are equating to a flanking maneuver.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t a comparison.
