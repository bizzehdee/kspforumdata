If you have the ability to focus a laser beam so it converges to a single point at 1000 km, you should also have the ability to focus it in such a way that it is perfectly parallel and doesn\u0027t converge at all. Then it\u0027s just a matter of projecting that narrow beam wherever you want. The optical systems required should be relatively simple; the main reasons refractors tend to have complex elements is because they need to be consistent through all wavelengths and with laser light you don\u0027t have that issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikely the precision needed for that is beyond our technical capacities. That doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t do it though; feedback mechanisms can correct things but now you have to observe the target and adjust focusing on the fly. In a combat scenario I can see challenges with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen of course there\u0027s the energy question.
