The school wifi is slow at the moment, so I will upload my answer later (it is very similar to the answer in Carl Sagan\u0027s Contact).

Grab a seat, it\u0027s pretty long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the galaxy is teeming with life. Though unconfirmed thus far, it is not an unreasonable assumption to make, especially in accordance with the Drake Equation. So why haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t alien lifeforms contacted us? Why is it that our messages to the stars go unanswered? Perhaps this is because of the sparsity of the stellar neighborhood in which we live. The solar system, our sun, they are often considered \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbackwater\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The nearest star is around 4 light years away from us. And there are only a few stars within a dozen light years. Elsewhere in the galaxy, it is more common to see numerous stars within a few light years of each other, stars that may be able to support life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that in these systems, should complex life emerge and should the formation of these systems coincide with each other than extraterrestrials here could be at very similar technological levels when first contact is made. The two possible outcomes involve peaceful coexistence\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and war. Either a community is ignited between the planets, or they figure out ways to destroy each other. These outcomes will be touched on in regards to our own system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth, being so isolated, likely has no neighbors that bear intelligent life, at least not nearby. Though it is unfortunate in some respects, in others it may be a blessing. Think about the human race. How often are we divided, fighting amongst ourselves? On a galactic scale, the warlike civilizations are more likely to wipe themselves out, or in the previous example of a stellar community, to wipe their neighbors out. Warlike species will inevitably destroy themselves, unless another species presents itself first in which case their own destruction may be delayed. The civilizations that live in peace are the ones likely to survive, thrive in this galaxy and exist in a diverse and amazing community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans are, unfortunately, one of these violent races. We are a young species still, and haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t destroyed ourselves yet. There is still hope, should we put aside our differences and join together as a single species, one of peace and not war. Once this happens, I believe it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be very long until we receive a message, as a kind of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chello, congrats on not killing yourselves off, and welcome to the galaxy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, possibly followed by an alien emissary that we greet with open arms, trusting this newcomer. They share FTL technology, along with other amazing technological secrets. We open up trade with others in the collective, and learn to avoid responding to the more violent new civilizations until they have adopted the same peace as we have. It would not do to invite a group that may decide to exterminate other species in the galaxy, or build up a massive weapons arsenal with the excuse that it serves to deter the more technologically advanced races from attacking\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, humans will live alongside other intelligent beings in the galaxy, with trade going to multiple worlds. Before that day can come, we must put down our weapons, our hate and distrust and reservations, and greet our fellow man with open arms, embracing him the same way we embrace our differences. We are like children, and we must grow up before we can sit with the adults.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T13:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGalaxy scale extinction events are probably the most likely.

The estimations for intelligent life differ widely, and like I said, space is mindbogglingly huge. It\u0027s hard enough to spot planets the next starsystem over, let alone see what\u0027s on them. The hypothesis that there quite a few civilizations out there I can understand, that doesn\u0027t seem too farfecthed because of the sheer giant number of possible habitats out there. But while life may be abundant, intelligent life is (while probably still relatively plentiful) probably far less abundant. Adding to that that said intelligent life needs to be sufficiently advanced to communicate reliably on an interstellar basis... Well that makes it a far harder sell to me that you\u0027d just happened to have several of those in \u0022close\u0022 proximity.

There could be any number of reasons for this, and we see this behaviour in various earth biological systems as well. This disadvantage could run the gamut from there being an actively hostile force that hunts down and exterminates species who try to communicate (cf. Saberhagen\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EBerserkers\u003C/em\u003E) to it simply being an otherwise-useless expenditure of energy that has been optimized away (e.g., Watts\u0027 \u003Cem\u003EBlindsight\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the first point, it\u0027s a popular idea that species tend to wipe themselves out before reaching a sufficient level of civilization.

Wells and so forth. For kindred proof, the answer at that time was \u0027because they don\u0027t want to warn other species before they take over,\u0027 though they didn\u0027t have the question as strictly formulated as we do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has at least two principal assumptions. The first is, species are ever capable or likely to wipe themselves out or cause their own civilizations to catastrophically and dramatically collapse. We have no proof of this capability even on our own planet, though it\u0027s a popular viewpoint that this is a constant danger. (See above about driving philosophies behind our current thought...) The second is, over time under \u0027normal\u0027, i.e. non-catastrophic conditions, civilization has a tendency to increase. There is no proof of this, and in fact I would argue the reverse is true. Over the long term we humans at least tend to move in a broad and chaotic cycle, and the idea of general increase comes from only looking at around the last 500 years of Western history or so (and doing it extreme violence, at that).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T17:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you know?
