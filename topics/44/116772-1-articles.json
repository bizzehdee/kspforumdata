These particular magazines dated from the 1920\u0027s to about late 1990. The history contained in these publications is amazing.\n\nSome articles (with photos) from about 1936 (I cannot find the particular issue right now) had the U.S. Navy in exercises with the German Navy and the author was saying it bodes well for both nations should they ever face a common enemy ... seriously? THEN, it would have been what was wished for, but now, it was laughable.\n\nThe issue I am reading now is from March 1960, the year I was born. The main article is called \u0022We\u0027re going to work miracles\u0022 ... the idea was to explode 5 small atomic bombs at Point Hope to create an artificial harbour which would remain open three months of the year as opposed to only 1 month nearby. They talked about nearby coal and oil reserves.\n\nHow stupid can you get. \n\nI Googled it to see if they had ever done this foolish idea and found this wikipedia page\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Hope,_Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Hope,_Alaska)\n\nand in there, this bit...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Point Hope residents successfully opposed Project Chariot in 1958. The project would have involved buried thermonuclear detonations some 30 miles (48 km) from the village to create a deep-water artificial harbor, which would only have been usable about three months out of the year.\u0022\n\nBut that was 1958, this was 1961 (the year this story was talking about) and the project was called CHARIOT ..... so, I\u0027m wondering if they made a mistake with the dates on the Wiki page \\*OR\\* if Uncle Sam cannot take NO for an answer... and this Popular Mechanics article was nothing but propaganda to window dress an idea which had already been scrapped...\n\nIt is my opinion that back in those days, publications like these were used by the U.S. Government for nothing more than propaganda, I have thought this for years ever since it was revealed that the U.S.S.R. purchased such publications for ideas and to see what the USA was planning.\n\nHad they gotten away with this, what would they have done then?\n\nThere was a story going around, a time ago, apparently true, that the US Air force wanted to detonate Atomic Bombs on the Moon.... (in the 1950\u0027s I think) for no other reason than they could... and to scare the crap out of the USSR .... but reality was, they couldn\u0027t even put an object into orbit then let alone bomb the Moon.\n\n----------------\n\nSo now, I wonder how many people out there would think this was a good idea? How many of YOU think it was a good idea or a bad one.\n\nThis story MIGHT be better under \u0022technology\u0022 but I put it in \u0022Physics\u0022 as the technology (idea) is OLD, but the physics of moving dirt to create an inlet is still current...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nJust read this chilling wiki entry on CHARIOT...\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chariot)\n\nWere they STUPID or did they just want to kill stuff?"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:41:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But that was 1958, this was 1961 (the year this story was talking about) and the project was called CHARIOT ..... so, I\u0027m wondering if they made a mistake with the dates on the Wiki page \\*OR\\* if Uncle Sam cannot take NO for an answer... and this Popular Mechanics article was nothing but propaganda to window dress an idea which had already been scrapped...\n\nThen nor now, Popular Mechanics has never had a reputation for honesty or accuracy.

Thirty years later State officials traveled to the site and found low levels of radioactivity at a depth of two feet (60 cm) in the burial mound.\n\nIt\u0027s like they couldn\u0027t take no for an answer so went ahead with it anyway. \n\nThe specifics of Point Hope are a bit different than I had remembered. It seems all of their detonations were to have been at a shallow depth.... Which is obviously a very bad idea. I\u0027m still not convinced a deeper blast without significant outgassing would produce more radiation and/or pollution than the supposed coal operations would have, especially since the details of the devices in question aren\u0027t available. (Coal is really dirty stuff.) Chagan and Sedan are proof enough that a shallow blast would not work for the intended purpose: A radioactive harbor is useless..... Harbors need stevedores and crews for the ships and squishy humans types don\u0027t agree so much with radiation. Then again the Soviet Kraton-3 and Globus-1 tests aren\u0027t shining examples of such an approach working well.

It was blown up in 1958 to remove the hazard it posed to shipping. They used 1300 tonnes of explosives placed inside the rock ridge via tunnels from nearby islands.

This is what the secret contamination experiment aims were...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Although the detonation never occurred, the site was radioactively contaminated by an experiment to estimate the effect on water sources of radioactive ejecta landing on tundra plants and subsequently washed down and carried away by rains. Material from a 1962 nuclear explosion at the Nevada Test Site was transported to the Chariot site in August 1962, used in several experiments, then buried. Thirty years later, the disposal was discovered in archival documents by a University of Alaska researcher. State officials immediately traveled to the site and found low levels of radioactivity at a depth of two feet (60 cm) in the burial mound. Outraged residents of the Inupiat village of Point Hope demanded the removal of the contaminated soil, which the government did at considerable expense.\n\nWhat they did, was poison the land to punish the locals... that is the ONLY explanation you could gather from that experiment, otherwise.... why secretly do this? And more... why not somewhere closer to the original Nevada test site?\n\nSPITE.... pure and simple. Payback for daring to stand up to the Government!\n\nAnd I said it was a STUPID idea and it was... why? Had they accomplished this, what then?\n\nMake an offer to the Australian Government to \u0027remove\u0027 that pesky reef? (Its called the Great Barrier Reef and its a world heritage site!)\n\nTo put it another way.... why out in the middle of nowhere? Why in place where no one wanted to use it? And they only SUSPECTED there was coal and oil reserves nearby....\n\nWhy not offer to make a BIG hole that New York could use to allow kids to swim in? Why not build a new lake in Washington D.C. or make a huge reservoir to hold water for those times there was a drought in Los Angeles??????\n\nIts the same logic France used to test their nukes in our back yard of the Pacific... not many voters around OR the voters wouldn\u0027t get poisoned...\n\nand even if a few did, who would care? France doesn\u0027t care about the people of the Pacific that were contaminated and slowly died....\n\nIts just why they did it in Alaska.... because \u0022its not in our backyard\u0022 and so what if a few dozen people got killed...\n\nSTUPID.... and dishonest.

The first real naval battle was won when the Pocket Battleship Graf Spee was sunk by three UK Cruisers and 1 NZ cruiser... \n\nAnyhow.... this is going off topic, sorry, WW2 history is one of my favourite topics... any excuse to discuss it, I will....\n\nGetting back on topic... As I said.... it was wishful thinking that the Popular Mechanics author really did want the USa and Germany to be allies... so not really sure why you are saying \u0022no\u0022 to me... its what i meant.\n\nPoint Hope was only one example of the ... silly... thinking during the 1940\u0027s and 50\u0027s.... some ideas were not silly.... just impracticable... such as the Aircraft Carrier they wanted to build out of ice... or rather, ice and sawdust. (Mythbusters did an episode on it) ... it would have been a very good idea.... was a good idea... but silly given the task to actually build it...\n\nAnother idea they had to end the war with Japan was to bomb the Volcanoes to create earthquakes and/or eruptions... a very silly idea, but seeing as Japanese spies would have seen the article as well meant they probably wasted time and money trying to ensure it didn\u0027t happen.\n\nThe thing is, I \\*know\\* those old publications are sometimes used as propaganda... but its still very good reading and gives you an insight into the psychological war they waged against the Germany, Italy, Japan and after that, the USSR. This is why they really hoped Germany and the USA would be allies... both nations hated the USSR...
