So one day the engine locked up. I went to start it and the engine bounced back and forth, but didnt move. I knew exactly what the problem was. I removed the four spark plugs and i told everyone not to stand close to the engine. My bro didnot head. So thats a 1500 cc engine which means each cylinder has 375 cc. Now the starting RPM of ~300 RPM. This translates A cylinder up speed 100 U times d travel of about 0.05 so about 5 meter/sec. The spark plug hole is about 1/50th diameter of the piston. Therefore if the starter is infinitely resistent to back pressure, then what is in the cylinder will pass through the spark plug hole at 150 m/sec however it will spread and slow. The car did not start because gasoline trapped in the oil boiled over and was sucked up by the EGR valve. Oil is not compressible as gas so the engine locked, and turning engine without spark plug forces the oil out strait into bro\u0027s face. Very surprised he was at the physics.\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003ESolution take the car for a considerable drive every weekend to boil the gas out of the oil and change frequently. \u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-30T01:34:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2015 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding missing pi elements\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
