It only works on the home moon stations due to the nature of the drive (lunar unbtanium charge technobabble).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr go within 30 kilometers of a ship with\u00A0the same unobtanium drive and set your drive to recharge mode. Whichever ship within\u00A0the 30 kilometer radius that has the least charge will draw upon the charge of a ship with more until it\u0027s charge is full. Thrusting depletes charge at an equal rate no matter the acceleration rate (6g max or below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFTL: Spaceships also have jump drives that allow them to jump within low planetary orbit of any celestial body with gravity of 1g or higher. So for our solar system that means Saturn, Earth, and Jupiter are easy places to reach in orbit, but everywhere else is harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion 1: Provided you use no other fuel source but the unobtanium charge and jump drive, how far can you make it in our solar system and still have enough charge to get back to the moon station for recharge?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat places are easy and what places are time consuming to reach?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I suppose if you wanted to be clever you could instail a maglev rail on the moon and launch spaceships off it at ridicoulous speed to get speed\u00A0charge free... so long the trajectories line up. It essentially makes the moon the most valuable space asset in the entire solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion 2: The only competing scifi drive to this that is not overpowered is a mix of gravity cancellation and antimatter thermal rocketry,\u00A0beam core, or pusher plate bomb drives . Cancelling out gravity makes getting to space way easier and rockets more efficient. For that matter ships can use airbreathing engines to coast into space, minus the orbital velocity since gravity cancellation is in play. Even space rails connected to the planet and spacestations tethered to it in space all exist because of gravity cancellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the question is... provided this tech also gets the same FTL jump drive that allows for jumping to low orbit of worlds with 1g or higher, can it compete with the unobtanium charge drive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike if both drives were selling, which would outsell the other?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean on the one hand, AM goes boom if magnetic containment is lost for the anti-iron, but it also can outlast the unobtanium drive for constant thrust time, assuming it throttles down or has a lot of propellant to burn. And antimatter resupply depots can be remade anywhere there is iron ore (a lengthy and expensive process makes it anti-iron), unlike the unobtanium charge which only can be had at one system in the known universe \u00A0None like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo which drive outsells the other? Gravity cancelkation with AM rocketry, AM beam core, AM airbreathing, \u00A0and pusher plates? Or the one hour thrust up to 6g or below unobtanium charge drive?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-13T03:51:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2020 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-13T04:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf replace the anti-iron with anti-uranium you can also have an anti-nuclear fission reactor.
