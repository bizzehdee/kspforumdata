During the first run of LIGO, for example, theorists predicted only a 1 in 6 chance of detecting gravity waves, over a six year run of observations (at least, according to Wikipedia). The problem is, the gravity wave detectors we have constructed so far are only capable of observing only very rare, very \u0022bright\u0022 transient gravity wave emission events, such as when two neutron stars or black holes merge, and at least in the case of neutron stars and stellar black holes, we can only detect relatively \u0022nearby\u0022 events.

Light is fairly easily slowed down by air/glass etc, what about gravity?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could create a medium that responded to gravitational waves by shifting large, dense masses, maybe, but I\u0027m not sure. Light slows down in many mediums because the electric charges in the medium respond and change their motion in response to the electric and magnetic fields of the light. So maybe the same kind of thing could be done for gravitation, but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-02T17:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2013 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T17:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an interesting aside, did you guys know that, viewed from a certain perspective, there really isn\u0027t such a thing as magnetism?
