I don\u0027t see how anything ejected from it at that velocity could ever get here. Maybe something ejected from our own galactic center could do it, but I don\u0027t know how much velocity it\u0027d lose on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe it would lose velocity from the universe\u0027s expansion, unless the expansion was accellerating. Yes, I know it actually is, but I don\u0027t think it would be a major effect at all between two relatively nearby galaxies. This would be an interesting point for me to research to make certain, because even if I\u0027m correct in how the expansion of space works, I\u0027d still probably learn something new. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have the time right now, and I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E right anyway. If the expansion of the unvierse was capable of robbing objects of velocity, then galaxy clusters that were gravitationally bound would slowly come apart, would they not? Our orbit around the Sun would be slowly expanding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know for a fact though that Hubble\u0027s \u0022law\u0022 breaks down when the distances are \u0022very short\u0022- like the distance between the Milky Way and M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy). At distances of like 10 million light-years and less (depends on how clustered matter is) individual galaxy motion becomes more important that Hubble\u0027s Law. Only at longer distances does Hubble\u0027s law really become dependable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good case in point IS M31. It\u0027s moving towards our galaxy (at something like 200 km/s if I remember correct), and so its light is actually blue shifted, not red shifted. An object escaping M31 and moving towards the Milky Way will get here some time before M31 collides with us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T23:01:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T23:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour question can\u0027t be answered because you didn\u0027t give enough information.
