The 5.091 is probably the lowest delta-v possible. If it was at aphelion then a space craft launched from earth would need to put in alot of detla-v just to get up to it, then match orbit, if it was at Perihelion very little delta-v would be needed to get to it as it would pass frightening close to earth, but then delta-V would need to be spent to match orbit.

If instead of doing that, you first spend 0.35 km/s to get from L2 down to a low Earth periapsis, you only need an extra 1.45 km/s burn at periapsis to go 12.45 km/s and reach the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen coming back from an asteroid, you can also use Earth\u0027s atmosphere to burn off that 3.22 km/s and aerocapture into an elliptical orbit that would take you back up to L2, and use 0.3-0.4 km/s of delta-v to get captured at L2.
