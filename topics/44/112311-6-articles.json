It\u0027d be as simple as throwing rocks into the fire, though occasionally molten metal would leak out of their ores if heated long enough.\n\nMost metals need significant temperatures to melt (e.g. gold). Those that don\u0027t are mostly found as ores, i.e. in chemical compounds, and thus you need a lot of energy to turn them into metal. In both cases you would need something hotter than your usual small campfire."},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:02:09Z","Content":"Charcoal can burn pretty hot, and are usually used to forge iron. If the ancient people have access to that, they could smelt metals.\n\nMaking charcoal isn\u0027t very complicated either. Burning wood or coconut shells in a pit would produce some charcoal. After the ancient people found that limiting the air supply was the key, building stone kilns to improve efficiency aren\u0027t very far off.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T17:04:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shynung**"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:02:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another relevant video:\n\nIt\u0027s interesting how much of this is ... seemingly... mass \u0022psychosis\u0022 (yeah ok, a harsh word). ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBubbles wouldn\u0027t be as disruptive if more people had a healthy scepticism approach (if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is), were carefull not to over invest and possibly better prioritization in their lives."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:31:19Z","Content":"It may be a coincidence that I live on a deposit where it\u0027s not uncommon. \n\n@peadar1987 I have been at it for years.
