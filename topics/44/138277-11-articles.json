Not a big surprise, it comes with a huge payload penalty AND huge development cost. And at modern launch rates that cost will pay off approximately never. SpaceX at first made modern \u003Cu\u003Echeap\u003C/u\u003E booster, and only after that made it reusable with \u003Cu\u003Eminor\u003C/u\u003E modifications.

Most expensive part is humans that work hours to assemble, check and prepare a rocket. Reusing only engines will be Shuttle all again. Take out engines, take them apart, check everything, replace some parts (at least nuts and pins), clean with surgical tools, reassemble, retest... It may be even worse than just making new.

Decoupling and parachutes are expensive, and may weight not less than spare fuel. But most expensive is work to fit reused engines to a new rocket. That\u0027s thousands of critical connections, that could be assembled wrong or suffer from decoupling and reentry.

They cannot possibly sell a launch cheaper than maybe 5-6M$. So instead of making 10s of millions per launch, they;re making a couple, or maybe 3M. So to keep the lights on, they need 10X as many launches. You need to show that sort of demand for it to make sense. What will they launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T19:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222571437\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462820534\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, Kryten said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf launch availability was a bottleneck SeaLaunch wouldn\u0027t have gone bust.
