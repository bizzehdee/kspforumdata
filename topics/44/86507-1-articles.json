These chips could just detach from the mothership and land wherever they wanted, allowing scientist to react to real-time events happening down on Europa\u0027s mysterious surface.

So you can only make a spacecraft so small before you run into the problem that the majority of your spacecraft\u0027s mass is communications gear- energy storage and antennas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can\u0027t have a bunch of tiny little spacecraft flying around the solar system by themselves because and they can\u0027t transmit very much data or they can\u0027t transmit with very much power because they can\u0027t store much energy.
