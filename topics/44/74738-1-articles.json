Powders are harder to move around using pipes and pumps; a complicated mechanism is needed, which reduces the thruster system\u0027s effective TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, rocket propellants are supposed to burn consistently, not explode (excluding pulsed-propulsion systems). I have no knowledge about its decomposition reaction properties, but if XeO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E cannot be made to burn steadily on its own (including the use of additives), I see no obvious advantage to use it as rocket propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T13:23:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by shynung\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T08:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the question of energy yield.
