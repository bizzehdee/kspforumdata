You\u0027ll probably be okay for a few minutes even. There\u0027s an atmosphere so you\u0027ll be able to hold your breath and the temperatures aren\u0027t too extreme. Saunas often get above the boiling point of water and humans bake in those for fun. Of course the atmospheric density is a lot higher so you\u0027ll exceed your heat tolerance pretty quickly.
