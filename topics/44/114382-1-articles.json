If it survives until 2018, SLS will have too much hardware to be cancelled like Constellation. I think it\u0027s much less likely to be cancelled currently than Constellation was, mainly because it\u0027s mostly on schedule and on budget, unlike the latter program. Congress is also a huge supporter of SLS/Orion, probably more than in Constellation, because it\u0027s one of the few ways they can to recover the same Shuttle jobs lost when the Space Shuttle died. SLS also has more completed hardware than it\u0027s predecessor, as the Orion Command Module and SLS Block I/IB Upper Stage are pretty much completed development."},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T20:19:58Z","Content":"I\u0027m not to hopefull personally.
