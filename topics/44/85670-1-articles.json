Does anyone here have any experience/advise on the use of this fuel for amateur rockets? Also, where would be a good place to acquire asphalt for a reasonable price?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T08:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93433-the-Model-Rocket-thread-Ressurection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93433-the-Model-Rocket-thread-Ressurection\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
