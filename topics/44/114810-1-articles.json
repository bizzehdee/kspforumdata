Both NASA and NOAA, for example, owe a massive debt to the IGY.\n\nThere were numerous books and films created to document and analyze the IGY\u0027s results. Here\u0027s an archive of films, created by the US National Academy of Science, covering the gamut of research done--and in Flash format for your easy consumption!\n\n[http://lasp.colorado.edu/igy_nas/](http://lasp.colorado.edu/igy_nas/)"}]}
