There are many algaes, mosses, and ferns that have generations that alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction. During the asexual generations, for example, ferns reproduce with spores; during the sexual generations, they reproduce with sperm released to swim to eggs in the (hopefully damp) soil. There are also single-celled organisms that swap genes, even though no distinct sexes exist. Perhaps one set of organisms evolved to transmit genetic information more efficiently than it received it, and another set of the same population evolved to receive more efficiently than it transmitted.

I am slightly concerned with gametes finding each other, though. If you need one of many sperm to find one of many eggs, that\u0027s one thing. If you need several different sperm to find the same egg?

It\u0027s easy to imagine that a particular cell might end up having a genetic defect resulting in a mitosis before DNA replication step. That would produce two cells with half of the DNA. If each one can go dormant, then it\u0027s just a matter of two such cells bumping into each other and fusing again. The rest is just optimizing the process.
