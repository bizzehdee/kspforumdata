Not only is its atmosphere almost nonexistent, but it is lacking a magnetic field, has poisonous soil, and will never be able to sustain life, period. Why people think there could be life on Mars is beyond me, since the atmosphere is most likely too thin and Mars is lacking a lot of what is needed for life. It has water, but isn\u0027t very accessible either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to make my case clear, I\u0027m going to walk you through every other body in the solar system that is capable of being terraformed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EVenus\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis planet is about the same size as Earth, and although it has toxic\u00A0clouds and extreme pressure, some people think living above these clouds may be possible and feasible.

Ganymede is definitely big enough to support an atmosphere, but if we were to try terraforming it, we\u0027d mostly be starting from scratch. Ganymede has a magnetic field, but is also buried in Jupiter\u0027s magnetic field, so solar winds are no problem. It has water, and if we could somehow get all of it onto the surface of the planet, then the moon would have an ocean. All we\u0027d need are some certain kinds of bacteria and some other stuff (all easy to get) to give the planet a breathable atmosphere and life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETitan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, Titan is by far the best candidate to terraform.

So the factor between iron production (which is a really mass produced stuff) and Venus atmosphere is higher than the factor between Venus atmosphere and Jupiter. So I would suggest, if we manage to terraform Venus, we are halfway there in terraforming Jupiter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T15:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222366401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453041044\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Albert VDS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would we need to care about losing the atmosphere on Mars when it takes millions of years?
