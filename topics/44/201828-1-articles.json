Despite already wanting to re-use rockets eventually, Mueller and Musk decided regenerative would have too many headaches early on when they needed to get the engine working. So they decided to go ablative at first, which proved to have its own set of headaches, adding weight and robbing performance. So Merlin and Merlin 1A were ablative, and Merlin 1B was abandoned when work on the regeneratively-cooled Merlin\u00A01C proved to be surprisingly straightforward\u00A0and problem-free.

Firstly, you\u2019re trying to get as much propellant as possible through the reactor as quickly as possible. The reason for that is obvious - higher mass flow equals more thrust. That propellant also needs to be as hot as possible, because hot propellant = fast propellant = more efficient rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, right there, is not an easy problem to optimise. Bear in mind that an NTR is basically heating propellant by passing it through channels in a hot block. Make those channels too narrow and you get good heat transfer at the expense of flow rate. Make the channels too wide and you get good mass flow at the expense of heat transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding to that complexity, that\u00A0propellant that you\u2019re forcing through the reactor is also going to be moderating the fission reactions in that reactor. That can be useful - towards the end of Project Rover they\u2019d got to the point where they could control the power output of the reactor purely by controlling the flow of propellant through it. But at the same time it\u2019s also another complicating factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there are material considerations. An NTR needs a seriously powerful reactor because it needs to impart a lot of heat to a lot of stuff in a short period of time (to use the technical explanation \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0).

With NTRs though, I honestly don\u2019t know if one big motor is simpler than multiple smaller motors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull disclosure - the closest I\u2019ve gotten to nuclear rocket science is reading up on it as research for a sci-fi story, so this next part is going to be\u00A0horribly simplified at best and quite probably wrong at worst. \u00A0But with that said, let\u2019s give this a go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA solid core NTR has a number of design challenges. Firstly, you\u2019re trying to get as much propellant as possible through the reactor as quickly as possible. The reason for that is obvious - higher mass flow equals more thrust. That propellant also needs to be as hot as possible, because hot propellant = fast propellant = more efficient rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, right there, is not an easy problem to optimise. Bear in mind that an NTR is basically heating propellant by passing it through channels in a hot block. Make those channels too narrow and you get good heat transfer at the expense of flow rate. Make the channels too wide and you get good mass flow at the expense of heat transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding to that complexity, that\u00A0propellant that you\u2019re forcing through the reactor is also going to be moderating the fission reactions in that reactor. That can be useful - towards the end of Project Rover they\u2019d got to the point where they could control the power output of the reactor purely by controlling the flow of propellant through it. But at the same time it\u2019s also another complicating factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there are material considerations. An NTR needs a seriously powerful reactor because it needs to impart a lot of heat to a lot of stuff in a short period of time (to use the technical explanation \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0). So, unlike a chemical rockets, NTRs absolutely are optimised around high melting materials. Those tend to be ceramics or cermets, neither of which handle thermal \u003Ci\u003Eshock\u003C/i\u003E very well. \u00A0Try leaving a brick on a fire for a couple of hours and then dumping cold water on it if you want an example!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is (yet another) problem when designing your NTR reactor which almost inevitably is going to have searingly hot reactor elements right next to cryogenic propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking all of the above into account, \u00A0you\u2019ll see why I honestly have no idea whether one big reactor is going to be simpler than multiple small reactors. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood answer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut of me is laughing as I am picturing you saying all if that in a British accent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you know this, maybe you don\u0027t, but accross the pond in the USA, there is an assumption, likely influenced from movies and TV, that smart or classy people have British accents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the ones on TV tend to.
