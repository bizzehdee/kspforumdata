Suppose that the mission were to depart in 10 years, with 10 people, for a total budget of no more than 10 billion. Mr. Musk is worth a bit over a billion at the present time, but, presumably, he could get his buddies to chip in a few billion. Also, since NASA is willing to spend a billion per Mars probe, maybe they could sell a seat or 2 to NASA or do paid scientific research when there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so his company\u0027s Falcon Heavy is supposed to cost $120 million per launch. Assuming SpaceX is being honest about the production costs for the Falcon 9 being low enough that a launch can be done for $60 million, that seems plausible. The Falcon Heavy is basically 3 falcon 9 lower stages strapped together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EListed payload to GTO is 21,200 Kg. Using a delta-V table, I find out that \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u003C/a\u003E you need about 1.16 km/sec delta V from GTO to reach Mars, assuming aerobraking for the Mars capture and other maneuvers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means 14,500 Kg of the payload make it to Mars aerobraking, and, assuming similar efficiency to the curiosity rover\u0027s descent system, 6,889 Kg make it to the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYikes. Every Kg of supplies is $17,400. Anyways, an empty dragon spacecraft is 4200 Kg, so it looks like the Falcon Heavy is approximately a big enough rocket to get a crewed dragon spacecraft to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, just 1 launch is nowhere near enough. You\u0027d need enough launches to orbit modules for the journey to Mars (supplies, living space, etc), and a bunch of unmanned launches to test the landing system and place the initial supply dump on Mars before any crew get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, at first glance, it looks maybe possible. I said a 10 billion budget, so if 25% of the budget were spent paying for launches, that\u0027s 2.4 billion for 20 launches. R\u0026amp;D for the various new systems this kind of expedition would need would cost a few billion, and there would also be construction costs to build the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong term, apparently, humans need something like 0.8 Kg of oxygen, 0.63 Kg of food, and 26 Kg of water per day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretically, you could recycle almost all the water and oxygen, and produce at least some of the food with algae or hydroponic plants. Assuming that cuts the total supply requirements to 0.5 Kg/person/day, 10 people would need 5 Kg per day, and 1825 Kg per solar year. From above, that comes to approximately 1 dragon spacecraft stuffed full of supplies per year, which means it would only cost $120 million/year to keep 10 people alive on the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s a couple of show-stoppers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, water recycling is in use on the ISS, cutting that number down considerably if it works. However, it sure would be handy if the carbon dioxide could be converted to oxygen, and at least some of that carbon dioxide were made into additional food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, you\u0027d need algae tanks or some other method, and I could not find any information about testing of these kinds of life support systems on the ISS... I\u0027m not certain what they are doing up there, but, apparently, recycling food and oxygen is not one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could not depart on a Mars expedition without checking to make sure recycling systems actually work long term (several years) and in space environments (low gravity, radiation, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, it is known that zero-G exposure is bad news. Bone density loss, retinal detachment, and a long long list of other unpleasant effects. The catch is, humans have never been exposed to 1/3 G for long periods of time, either. No one knows if humans will go blind or become too fragile to move or other nasty long term effects. The only way to even find out for certain would be to put humans in a centrifuge in space at 1/3 G for several years. (well, first doing it with other vertebrate animals, but, eventually, humans)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely they have some rats on the ISS at 1/3 G, spinning for years, right? Apparently not...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big problem. It looks like Mr. Musk could theoretically get together the rockets and the other systems that would put people on Mars.
