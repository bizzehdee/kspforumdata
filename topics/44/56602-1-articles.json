While Project Pluto was one of the more cruel and ruthless weapons designed by the United States during the cold war, it still remains an interesting technical concept. I have summarized the history of the project, while mainly focusing on the technical aspects, in the following paragraphs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConception and Requirements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the mid \u002750s when the need for a weapons project such as Project Pluto was first rationalized. The United States wanted something that would be invisible to enemy radar and unattainable by conventional anti-aircraft weapons. The proposed solution was a supersonic, low-altitude missile (SLAM). The idea is that the missile would fly so close to the ground that radar couldn\u0027t detect it, and it would go so fast that it could not be shot down. However, sustaining speeds that great (approximately mach 3) at such a low altitude required ridiculous amounts of power. The answer? A nuclear ramjet, of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign: The Vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle itself had obviously been designed with supersonic speeds in mind. It had a pointed nose and very swept wings. The vehicle, in fact, was practically a rocket, as the three control surfaces that it had were small compared to the rest of the vehicle and evenly spaced at 120 degrees. Underneath it was the large ramjet intake which earned it the nickname \u0022The flying crowbar.\u0022 Since the vehicle was to be very large and complicated, the designers figured that it would be a waste of resources to use it to deliver a single warhead. So, it was designed to carry more than a dozen thermonuclear warheads which could be used on multiple targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.bisbos.com/images_aircraft/pluto/slam-cutaway-600.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022slam-cutaway-600.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenges of such a craft were, understandably, enormous. For instance, the body had to endure a dynamic pressure greater than that felt by the X-15. As well, the ramjet had to handle heat loads in excess of 800 degrees Celsius and most of the components within the rocket had to be able to operate in an irradiated environment. The vehicle was supposed to be launched with three strap-on boosters. Once reaching sufficient speed, the reactor was engaged and the nuclear ramjet kicked in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign: The Powerplant \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far the most difficult part of the vehicle to design was the nuclear motor. This was something that had never been previously attempted. It had to produce more than 500 megawatts of power while still being small enough to fit in a plane. Obviously, it had to be unshielded. However, this meant that the conditions within the reactor were more extreme than anything had ever been designed for. the temperatures in the center of the reactor exceeded 1370 degrees Celsius, which is well above the operating temperatures of most alloys. In the end, the core was made of ceramics, molybdenum, advanced steel and Hastelloy R-235. Even then, it was designed at a low factor of safety, as the materials were operating very close to their thermal maximum while still resisting the incoming air, which created up to 2400 Kilo-Pascals of pressure on the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.prometheusturbine.info/nuclear_reactor_pluto_scramjet.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nuclear_reactor_pluto_scramjet.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETesting the Nuclear Ramjet\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the almost impossible technical requirements of the motor, two powerplants were actually built and tested. The first one tested was the Tory II-A. It was a scaled down version which only generated 155 megawatts of power, processed 320 Kilograms of air every second and burned at 1230 degrees Celsius. A large facility had to be built to compress and preheat the air required the run the engine. The first test lasted only a few seconds before all the pre-heated and compressed air ran out, but it was a complete success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, a full scale test engine, called the Tory II-C, was built. As well, the facilities required the store the compressed air were upgraded so that they could fuel the bigger engine for a longer period of time. After a \u0022small\u0022 test with reduced thrust, the scientists put the pedal to the metal and tested the engine at it\u0027s maximum operational limits. It produced 156,000 newtons of thrust and 513 megawatts of power during its five minute burn and consumed almost a ton of air every second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Tory_II-A_nuclear_ramjet_engine.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Tory_II-A_nuclear_ramjet_engine.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe End of the Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, this missile was never deployed as an actual weapon. In fact, a full prototype was never even built and tested. There are a myriad of reasons proposed as to why it was shut down. It could have been that this weapon was just too deadly and provocative. Another plausible reason is that the hundreds of ICBMs and submarine based missiles rendered it redundant. Finally, it could be that it was almost impossible to test the missile without irradiating its test range and rendering the area uninhabitable.

First off, our allies--over whom the missile would have to fly on the way into its target--were less than amused by the thought of a Mach 3 missile roaring past at 500 feet, flattening buildings with its shockwave and literally cooking chickens in the barnyard as it flew overhead with the radiation from its reactor. (Ironically, this last issue was proposed as being an asset in wartime, with the missile being programmed to pretty much perpetually fly back and forth over the Soviet Union after it had deployed its last warhead, to essentially render the place uninhabitable.) Secondly, there was the little issue of where you test-fly an unshielded nuclear reactor--and even if you find a safe place to do so, how do you guarantee that the guidance system won\u0027t go nuts and make a low-level run through Las Vegas, or even Los Angeles? There was a proposal to test-fly them at the Nevada Test Site\u0027s nuclear testing ranges, on an extremely long tether so that they couldn\u0027t run away (and that would have been a HELL of a tether!), but a more realistic one had them test-flying them off Johnston Island, then having the test missile end the flight with a deliberate dive to an ocean burial in the Marianas Trench. As Air and Space Smithsonian commented, \u0022even in an era when the Atomic Energy Commission was trying to get people to think of radiation in terms of \u0027sunshine units,\u0027 the thought of dumping dozens of unshielded nuclear reactors into the ocean was enough to give people pause.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the biggest reason it was cancelled was much simpler than any technical or political issues--those could have been resolved with enough work. By 1960, the Atlas ICBM was starting to show signs that it would be a reliable weapon, at a time when SLAM had yet to fly, or even test a flight-rated engine. What\u0027s more, whereas SLAM would have taken roughly four hours to reach its first target in Soviet territory, and saw genuine risk of being intercepted and shot down, either by fighters or ground-based air defenses, the Atlas could put a warhead on the same target a mere thirty minutes after launch, and was invulnerable to all then-existing defensive measures--AND it looked like it would have a significantly lower unit cost than SLAM, on top of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, not only do we have a project where the final weapon would have a number of fundamental problems, but there\u0027s an alternative program that\u0027s at a much more advanced state of development--despite being started later--which avoids most of those problems, can do the job just as well, and will cost less. There wasn\u0027t any real question which one was going to be cancelled and which would be developed into an operational weapons system, even BEFORE the Atlas people started claiming that \u0022SLAM\u0022 actually stood for \u0022slow, low, and messy\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T03:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis was supposed to be a doomsday weapon, so who cares about the path of death left behind it. you could probibly do a design with a heat exchanger to better isolate the core from the atmosphere, but the risks of using a flying nuclear reactor on earth are still to great (look at how frequent plane crashes are). but that doesnt mean you cant fly around on saturn with one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T03:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey cared not so much for the path in operational use, but the path during test and training missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T04:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit was canceled not because of safety but because icbms pretty much made them obsolete. this was the \u002750s, everybody wanted nuclear and we didnt have hippies to protest it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T04:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 50\u0027s, such a system might have been an ultimate weapon, but now a modern AAA takes something like that out with no trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T05:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the 50\u0027s, such a system might have been an ultimate weapon, but now a modern AAA takes something like that out with no trouble.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMach 3 at 150 meters?

Say a piece of flak moving at 50 m/s and weighing 0.25 Kg impacts a plane moving in the opposite direction at 150 m/s. In this case, the flak\u0027s speed relative to the plane will be 200 m/s and its kinetic energy relative to the plane will be 5 KJ. However, if the same piece of flak hits a SLAM moving at 1020 m/s (~ mach 3), its relative kinetic energy will be more than 143 KJ.
