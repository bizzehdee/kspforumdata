Ofcourse, the larger the ring, the slower it can rotate, but a diameter of around a 100 meter as I proposed means a circumference of a little more than 300 meter, (you could place the ISS in the hub of the wheel, the outer tips of the solar panels would be around the wheel\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s rim), is a decent and viable small size to aim for. But double that then, to a 200 meter in diameter. The wheel itself launched in 30-32 launches, using todays tech and variations over modules being developed today. Add in wire support to a hub, a couple of inflatable shafts to the center, a hub-module or two, giving 0.5 g at 2 rpm. That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s significant.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow here comes a few sad numbers, if about 50% of the space shuttle\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s ET\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s could have been salvaged for a station, out of the 135 launches, say we could utilize some 67 of them. That could give a wheel-station either 46 meter wide, ca 90 meter radius (560 meter circumference). Used side by side like that, it would give the benefit of each piece of straight floor to have very little deviation from the wheel\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s normal, hence, the percieved gravity would be nice and uniform. Spinning this up to 2.2 rpm would give a nice and toasty 0.5 g at the rather large floorspace. Easily several decks actualy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow, if placed end to end, the wheel would be considerably larger. The problem with this setup is that atleast for smaller wheels, the vector of the gravity in each module will be significantly different depending on where in the module you would be. But, 67 tanks, each some 47 meters long, gives a wheel with a circumference of roughly 3.14 km. That means a diameter of around 1 km. Giving a radius of say, 500 meter. Spinning this up to 0.3 rpm is all it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d take. That is less than a third of a revolution per minute, to produce 0.5 g. The problem with using the ET\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s for this is that they would need some external support, and they would have had been redesigned a little from the begining. But something along those lines where actualy proposed. In wich case, we would already have launched a lot of the hardware for a pretty large station with artificial gravity. These numbers are sad, because the Orbiter is now retired, and atleast for the foreseeable future, no such large tanks will be launched into orbit is such an abundance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt this point, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m guessing you still yell on about needing superstrong materials and such.

Maybe, depending on who you listen to. If you go by one study you would need a radius of almost 100km, which is probably not do-able with existing materials and technologies. If you go by another study you could build the same system with a radius of 22m, which is definately do-able.
