And some of the male wasps are wasting time and energy checking out these plants that are Not Wasps. These wasps will tend to be less reproductively successful, and have fewer offspring. So over time the wasp population as a whole becomes more discerning about what Is Wasp, and what is Not Wasp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the orchid ancestors are also evolving at the same time. The wasp population is becoming more picky about what it hangs around, so the advantage shifts further towards the orchids whose flowers are More Wasplike. Those whose flowers are Less Wasplike get fewer visits from wasps, and thus produce fewer seeds. And the feedback loop continues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Wasps get more discerning. The Orchids get more wasplike. The wasps start putting more influence on things like shape and color to discern what Is Wasp. The Orchids that are closer to the right shape and color get more visits by wasps and have more offspring. The ones who are less wasplike have fewer offspring. The Orhcids get More Wasplike. The Wasps get More Discerning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that there\u0027s a balance here. An orchid that is Too Wasplike may entice wasps to hang around Too Long, and waste too much time and energy attempting to mate with something that is Not Wasp. That orchid will tend to have fewer offspring, because the mechanism by which the orchid gets pollinated by this point is by having the Wasp mistake its flower for Real Wasp, figure things out after awhile, but then go to another orchid and fall for the same trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as the process feeds back and forth, overall, the orchid and waps population winds up centering around a situation where the orchids are sufficiently Wasplike to fool enough of the current wasps to get themselves pollinated, but not so Wasplike that it damages the wasp population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother very interesting post, may i ask would there have been glowing orchids that failed?

The ancestor of those orchid looked and smelled only very vaguely like a wasp. Enough to fool only the most horny and stupid wasps. This first similarity was largely accidental( and, as pointed out above, insects recognize their mating partners via far simpler means than the more brainy vertebrates, so it is not particularly hard to stumble upon something that accidentally pushes the right buttons in male wasps miniature brain ), but the natural selection picked it up and from each generation the ones which more resembled a wasp had higher chance of reproducing.
