It is the oxidizer in thermite (a high temperature incendiary explosive), for example. The key is that the oxygen in the iron oxide has an even lower chemical energy state it can go to by bonding with the aluminum \u0022fuel\u0022. At least I think that\u0027s how it works. I only had a single college level chemistry class; they don\u0027t require much chemistry for electrical engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example, water can in fact be an oxidizer too under the right conditions. If I want to grow a thick layer of silicon dioxide on a silicon wafer, then I flow a mixture of about 3 parts oxygen and 5.9 parts hydrogen into our oxidation oven at 1000C; I run it oxygen rich so that we don\u0027t run the risk of a hydrogen buildup on the ceiling of the lab (yea, that could be bad). Anyway, it makes water vapor inside the furnace, which for some reason I don\u0027t understand, actually grows an oxide layer on the silicon \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E than if I just flow pure oxygen. Go figure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm.... I don\u0027t think water is acting as the oxidizer in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Yes, Rust can be an oxidizer if there is a lower energy state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrow sodium in water, and the sodium will be oxidized and Hydrogen will be released, because sodium is less electronegative than Hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, water can also be a reducing agent. Fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen, and should be able to react with water to form H-F and free O2...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut molecular oxygen would actually not be an oxidizer in a Fluorine atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for the chemical composition of Titan... No, water is not an oxidizing agent, and there seems to be no oxidizer present.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUmm....

The ice isn\u0027t pure, think of slush on the side of the road. It\u0027s full of dust/pebbles and other gunk that will probably settle at the bottom of the hole you\u0027re trying to melt, and eventually prevent the heat from melting through. Maybe the sub could gently turn diagonally every few hundred meters to dump the debris, and back up and start a new hole.
