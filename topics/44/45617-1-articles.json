Yet, the KSP community is the geekiest community I have joined (in a good way) and I\u0027m sure there is someone here with some coding knowledge than can answer my question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I\u0027ve bought a PC only game and from the very get go I smelled a port conversion. The community was divided into 2 camps ever since this was suggested... now someone has come up with a line of code that supposedly proves the game will be ported over to console. Now, I know nothing about programming and the simple question I have is: what does this line of code mean and does it prove a UI is made to be ported from PC to console?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;func name=\u0022show_radial\u0022 hidden=\u00221\u0022 repeating=\u00221\u0022\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not looking for some derailing topic about the game itself, that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t mention the title, and also I\u0027m not on a quest for material to post in other forums; this is for personal reference only. I just want to know the gravity of the code line, what it actually means... does this guy have a valid point?
