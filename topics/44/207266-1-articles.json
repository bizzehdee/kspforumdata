realistic advantage for a scramjet is reduced fuel usage (which has to justify the airframe needed to guide enough air in the intakes to achieve the thrust).\u00A0 The cost of launching a Falcon 9 is in the millions and the cost of the fuel is ~$30k.\u00A0 Perhaps with Starship (or possibly a Rocketlabs competitor or even New Armstrong) rocket, the fuel costs will be\u00A0 enough of a significant
