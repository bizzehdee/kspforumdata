The problem is, even a relatively \u0022small\u0022 asteroid is still VERY massive. So you have to fling a LOT of stuff into space to get any noticeable results. Which takes time (and effort). But hey - with every metric ton of rock flung away your task becomes easier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T22:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw a documentary the other day where a scientist had kind of the same idea but simpler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet a satellite near the asteroid and shoot it with a powerful laser.
