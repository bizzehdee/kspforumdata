I think I now have a handle on most things that effect the game (starting with ISP, TWR etc and working my way up) and I\u0027m now happy what each of the six orbital elements that make up an orbit are and how they relate to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am however struggling to get my head around part of the Longitude of the Ascending Node which is the use of an Origin of Longitude. I understand what the LAN shows, but not how to acquire the Origin of Longitude itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot refers to the First Point of Aries, but I believe this is no longer a relevant terminology. Further reading show it has to do with the Spring/Vernal Equinox and where the Sun (or Kerbol) would be at the spring Equinox. In the sun\u0027s case this seems to be round about Mexico? That only makes things more confusing though... does Kerbin actually have an Equinox as it has a non-eccentric, non-inclined orbit?! This also wouldn\u0027t account for how it\u0027s measured on, say, Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I suspect I\u0027m missing something big here; something isn\u0027t clicking into place.

(The Z axis points upwards, and is parallel to the polar axis of all celestial objects, since no celestial object has axial tilt.) I know this holds true for the orbits of all of the planets relative to Kerbol. For the orbits of moons relative to planets or ships relative to other bodies, I believe the local reference direction is parallel to the global reference direction (i.e. parallel to the global X axis), and the local (parent-relative) XYZ coordinate system is simply translated but not rotated, so the local reference direction points down the X axis of the local coordinate system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason the reference direction is about 0.09 degrees away from the opposite side of Kerbin\u0027s orbit at UT 0 is because Kerbin is in a circular, non-inclined orbit with a longitude of ascending node of 0 radians and a mean anomaly at epoch of 3.14 radians (taken from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u003C/a\u003E).
