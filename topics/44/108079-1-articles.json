Most people in the field already thought eukaryotes arose from a fusion between a bacterium and an archaeon-and we had a group that was [a very good candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaproteobacteria) for the bacterium. The main niggling issue was that no known archaeon was capable of engulfing other cells (phagocytosis), making it difficult to imagine how such a fusion could occur. We don\u0027t have full confirmation because we only have the genome, but given some of the genes present this looks like archaeon that can undergo phagocytosis."}]}
