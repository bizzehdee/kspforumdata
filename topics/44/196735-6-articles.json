Consider the above example.\u00A0We have an Amish village, and we have a self-sufficient colony on Mars. The Amish own\u00A0more land area they could possibly farm, the Mars people have, well, all of Mars. However, \u003Cstrong\u003Edemand is limited\u003C/strong\u003E, because they can only consume so much (I\u0027m disregarding possible surplus, because the Amish won\u0027t have much, and Mars couldn\u0027t economically export anything). The former get by on their land,\u00A0make some arts and crafts and provide their own services, while the latter produce stuff largely automatically, with minimum human intervention, and their services are mostly automated. Now, in the Amish community, most of the population works towards sustaining the community. Only a small minority, if any, would have jobs outside production. On Mars, however, the\u00A0majority will have such\u00A0jobs, with production workers in minority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does it translate to a practical situation? Well, long story short, any idiot can dig holes, but being a researcher takes brains. As I said before, automation creates jobs which are different from the ones it destroys, and \u003Cem\u003Eusually require higher skills\u003C/em\u003E. What results in such situation is unemployment in the low-skilled sector, and a shortage of workers in the high-skilled sector.\u00A0One looks at the job market will tell you this is \u003Cem\u003Eexactly \u003C/em\u003Ewhere we stand. On paper, we didn\u0027t lose \u003Cem\u003Ejobs\u003C/em\u003E, but we did in practice, since not everyone has the mental capacity to transition the highly educated stratum. Most people don\u0027t, in fact, and IT professionals, engineers\u00A0and scientists are in high demand on the job market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that this is actually different from past industrial revolutions, which created menial, low-skilled factory jobs, while primarily putting skilled craftsmen\u00A0out of works. This did result in net\u00A0job creation, even if their quality took a nosedive (another thing I take an issue with). Today, what we\u0027re seeing is that automation causes\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eincreases\u003C/em\u003E in job quality, but at the same time shifts them into sectors\u00A0which are\u00A0limited by the availability of qualified\u00A0workers.
