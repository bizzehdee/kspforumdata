We assume that thier nuclear bombs use the same technology as our plutonium, uranium, of hydrogen bombs. To see that precise signal you would have to be looking at them in the gamma ray spectrum. Our gamma ray observatories are quite rare. So more typically our high resolution cameras are visible and IR, and so then you would be interpreting bright flashes of a planet in transect, which is more or less a sampling per unit time, going by the planet hunter plots, with the solar variation. No, sry, i dont think so. Maybe if we had the telescope mentioned in the other thread that could see earth like planets directly, then its possible. Light scattering is the inverse forth power of the wavelegth so getting really high resolution gamma ray chromatography is not at trivial task.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T09:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if aliens signal us,I think it might be something like a mimic of our own radio signals.
