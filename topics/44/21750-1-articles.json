Orbiting at the same speed would not work because the radius of the orbit is larger than that of the planet, meaning that the circumference is greater than that of the planet\u0027s, and so you would fall behind the rotation since you might be going speed A over distance 2D while the planet rotates at speed A over distance D (just a random scenario, not meant to refer to any real orbit around a real body). Obviously, the planet will complete its rotation in this case quicker than you can complete your orbit and so you\u0027ll fall behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T03:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook, I don\u0027t mean to be snarky, but...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lmgtfy.com/?q=geostationary\u002Borbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereally...\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T17:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELook, I don\u0027t mean to be snarky, but...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lmgtfy.com/?q=geostationary\u002Borbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereally...\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know these astronomical things...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flightmaster","CreatedById":32617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T04:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MartinVD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MartinVD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know these astronomical things...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s fair enough, astronomy is often seen as scary and hard to understand but it\u0027s really not if you have the motivation to learn.

Geostationary satellites are designed specifically for one-way regional coverage over a specific country, which is what makes them perfect for TV broadcasting. They are not suitable for two-way communication because of the distance, which causes latency. Each signal has to travel 72000km. Because of their power requirements, they are also big, heavy, and expensive to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want global coverage, you are better off with a constellation of LEO sats, like GPS, Iridium, or TDRSS systems.
