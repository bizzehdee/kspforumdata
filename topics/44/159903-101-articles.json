What if the tire company was new, and the tires won\u0027t be available for a few years, would the stockholders be cool with Ford not selling any cars until the new tires were available, in spite of other companies having acceptable tires?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t matter to me honestly, I want to see BO fy, and I always assumed Amazon would fly on BO. The ULA buy is partially Bezos throwing ULA a bone for their abject failure to deliver Be-4 in a timely manner. I\u0027d guess the Ariane 6 buy is partially to generate political goodwill in Europe where there seems to be some animus towards Amazon\u0027s business practices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s a smart move by Amazon, actually (it\u0027s like BO putting the engine factory in AL) WRT the politics (business and gov politics). If the goal is to get the constellation up quickly, it\u0027s not so smart, since they can\u0027t even start for a couple years at best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
