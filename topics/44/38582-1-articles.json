One of the proposed targets for the Don Quijote mission was Apophis, but Wikipedia says that the current target is the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos. Neither of those asteroids currently have any real risk of hitting the Earth, however. Things might be different if we were to meddle with the orbit of an asteroid that had a higher probability of impact, for the reasons that I described in my earlier post.

Sure, things failed and projects seemed doomed, and sometimes they were, but then sometimes that payed off, and big time. I mean the Wright brothers could always have looked back at the countless failed flight attempts and decided it wasn\u0027t worth it, but they didn\u0027t and now we have commercial airliners that let you travel anywhere in about a day at most.
