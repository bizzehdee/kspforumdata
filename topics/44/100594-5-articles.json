For real. So you had bunch of real scientists, with a budget, and objective of devising ANY way to make EM radiation inconvenient to humans. Or, more specificaly, nazis. And, as should be of special importance to you, with no cellphone manufacturere or whoever influencing them. So, boffins made some calculations and experiments and decided that no, it can\u0027t be done. Not even if fate of british empire was at stake. \n\nJust so you know we are talking smart people here, those same scientists decided it would be a shame to let that money go to waste (read: to nonscience) so they used it for what would be today called \u0022a major misappropriation of funds\u0022.

It could harm us. It could be harmless.\n\n Cellphone uses radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing radiation, and this haven\u0027t been doing much to us, as far as we know. We are even surrounded by it everyday with wifi, microwave and other things, even if we are not using cellphones. The only biological effect that it has on us, and that we have seen so far, is simply cells around contact area getting heat up by a fraction of a degree, which is something our blood circulation can easily handle.\n\nThe research is still going on after decades, and while they haven\u0027t seen any conclusive evidences, they do not want to eliminate the possibilities that there are complication from much longer, extended uses, like, 30,40,50 years in the future.\n\nSo, governments and other bodies decide to just enact preventive policies, and warn about cell phones uses, incase it *does* harm us. But there is no proof that it does *yet*.\n\nNow, what you do with that information is up to you. You can be preventive and protect children from cellphones and such devices if you wish, that is fully understandable.
