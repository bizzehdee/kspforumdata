Energy demand peaks during the day and evening as commercial and industrial draws rise and then people cook dinner, which is good for solar cause thats when the sun is high or can be carried by a 4-6h storage buffer, but you still need something to carry the 50% off-peak demand in the wee hours. Wind certainly helps, but it\u0027s intermittent, so you need something steady to smooth out that curve. Nuclear could suit, but it kind of only exists because of massive subsidization of nuclear plant construction during the cold war. Without that and with aging plants and a long, litigious, expensive road to building new plants the cost just isn\u0027t going to come down to a competitive level. They\u0027ll never secure financing for a losing prospect like that. Most likely that gap will be filled by grid-scale battery storage from Li-ion or Li-S farms down the road. They\u0027re already cheaper than nuclear but as mentioned it won\u0027t matter until its cheaper than coal and natural gas to cover base load. By then it may be too late to scale up. We\u0027d also benefit greatly from a high voltage DC smart grid shifting energy dynamically from regions with high wind or bright sun to places without to reduce the need and cost of storage, but we\u0027ve been talking about that since the 90\u0027s and nothing ever happens. Fat chance the US gets its act together to do anything remotely sensible for the next several decades.

If this is the term utilized when speaking about the past in a science that is virtually entirely divorced from politics, it shouldn\u2019t have to change for the present. That is politics interfering in how we interpret data, which seriously compromises the integrity of the results and conclusions. If the past was one thing but it is different now, even just in terminology, we aren\u2019t going to learn anything because we will see ourselves in some special time, immune to the disasters of the past, and perhaps even feel as though we are superior and above everything that happened in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also presents the problem of categorizing what qualifies as \u201Cnatural\u201D.
