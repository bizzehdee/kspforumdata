Mars\u0027 orbital\u00A0distance from Earth\u0027s is ~0.5 AU. Venus\u0027 orbital distance is ~0.28 AU from Earth\u0027s. So the temperature difference from Earth to Mars is going to be -25/14\u00A0of that between Earth and Venus. So Venus should be warmer than Earth by 21.28 degrees. Now, I know it\u0027s not a linear progression, so I am going to guess that for every two-thirds the distance to the Sun, the rate doubles. So that\u0027s 21.28 times ~1.9 (Venus is at 0.72 AU or most of the way to 0.67)\u00A0is 42.432. 255 K plus 42.432 K is 297.432 K.

That plus 24 degrees is 86.7 degrees, which would be the temperature of Venus with an Earthlike atmosphere. However, a high temperature like that would cause water to boil near the equator, which would give the planet a lot of high-albedo water clouds and likely cool it somewhat. Counteracted, to an unknown effect,\u00A0by the added greenhouse effect caused by the excess water vapour.

As with any alternate reality idea, your project doesn\u0027t have to be 100% realistic; it just has to be \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E. In other words, errors and unrealistic elements are not necessarily bad, if they are so exotic that only a minor subsection of the viewerbase can spot them. As an example, when the Star Wars movies came out in the seventies, almost nobody in the public knew what lasers looked like, and thus, the fact that Star Wars portrayed laser blasts as \u0022projectiles\u0022 that traveled visibly did not hurt anyone\u0027s immersion. Much rather, there were cannons, which fired things that looked like things that cannons fire, so it was all good. It was wrong, but it was \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E. Therefore, always try to estimate how much \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuspension of disbelief\u003C/a\u003E you are asking of the reader, and don\u0027t be afraid of handwaving things that are easy to accept, if it helps your worldbuilding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that\u0027s important is internal consistency. For example, you\u0027ve chosen to go with the Latin names of sun and moon, instead of the English ones; therefore, it would be internally consistent to also use the Latin name for our planet, Terra, not the English one. While the various names in different languages are all officially accepted as valid by the IAU, the inhabitants of your alternate reality must have a reason for preferring Latin, and that reason would obviously apply to all celestial bodies for which multiple common names exist. Perhaps history unfolded a little differently, the Roman empire lasted longer and became even more widespread than in our world, and thus Latin in general is a far more common and alive language? If that is the case though, beware of having celestial bodies that are not named in Latin. For example, Laythe would violate the naming conventions of even our IAU, and it would probably violate the stricter naming rules of your alternate reality even more strongly. Thus, having a body named Laythe in your system, while an amusing nod to KSP, is a breach of internal consistency unless you can believably explain why exactly the name isn\u0027t breaking the established rules of your world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T13:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInternal consistency is a good thing, but not calling the earth it\u0027s Latin name is fine, since most people don\u0027t really know it exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T13:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311836\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127143\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449490152\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy would we do that? of course if earth was part of a binary, far away enough from the sun and the was no jupiter all of this would work. \u00A0Fredinno is fretting about the specifics of a fantasy, \u00A0make it real and his wheels wont spin quite so fast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the question is wether this system was possible.

As with any alternate reality idea, your project doesn\u0027t have to be 100% realistic; it just has to be \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E. In other words, errors and unrealistic elements are not necessarily bad, if they are so exotic that only a minor subsection of the viewerbase can spot them. As an example, when the Star Wars movies came out in the seventies, almost nobody in the public knew what lasers looked like, and thus, the fact that Star Wars portrayed laser blasts as \u0022projectiles\u0022 that traveled visibly did not hurt anyone\u0027s immersion. Much rather, there were cannons, which fired things that looked like things that cannons fire, so it was all good. It was wrong, but it was \u003Cem\u003Ebelievable\u003C/em\u003E. Therefore, always try to estimate how much \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuspension of disbelief\u003C/a\u003E you are asking of the reader, and don\u0027t be afraid of handwaving things that are easy to accept, if it helps your worldbuilding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that\u0027s important is internal consistency. For example, you\u0027ve chosen to go with the Latin names of sun and moon, instead of the English ones; therefore, it would be internally consistent to also use the Latin name for our planet, Terra, not the English one. While the various names in different languages are all officially accepted as valid by the IAU, the inhabitants of your alternate reality must have a reason for preferring Latin, and that reason would obviously apply to all celestial bodies for which multiple common names exist. Perhaps history unfolded a little differently, the Roman empire lasted longer and became even more widespread than in our world, and thus Latin in general is a far more common and alive language? If that is the case though, beware of having celestial bodies that are not named in Latin. For example, Laythe would violate the naming conventions of even our IAU, and it would probably violate the stricter naming rules of your alternate reality even more strongly. Thus, having a body named Laythe in your system, while an amusing nod to KSP, is a breach of internal consistency unless you can believably explain why exactly the name isn\u0027t breaking the established rules of your world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make them all English names, instead of Latin, and then Laythe will work- like how Uranus\u0027 moons are named after Shakespere characters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T13:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311790\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127143\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449484283\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPromise of the books was still an cold war, but less wars on earth,\u00A0no Vietnam and fewer of the proxy wars all over as the run to get foothold on Venus and Mars was an seen as more important so the space race did not end.
