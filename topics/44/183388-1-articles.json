I\u0027ve looked it up, but it seems not much people have * actually* done it successfully.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo HUGE disclaimer: I have no idea where this is going to go. Maybe I\u0027ll stop in 2 weeks, maybe I\u0027ll get super on board with\u00A0the idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I think there\u0027s something really cool to try here and that\u0027s all I need.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main idea I have for how to do this is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Control KSP through the kRPC mod, enabling us to run Python, which means we can\u00A0import any machine / deep learning librairies alongside\u00A0it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Use reinforcement learning to learn from each launch, and try to improve the performances of the rocket. Note that here I\u0027m not trying to generate a rocket design, I just start from a particular rocket and try to teach it to fly it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo put a bit of context around this, I have a few months of practice on neural networks (using mostly Keras over TenserFlow, which will most probably be the library used for running the basic neural network that will be trained) I have barely used kRPC for a\u00A0hours the last few days to say what was possible with it, I just made a successful program that reloads a quicksave when a rocket after a certain time and looks at the altitude it\u0027s gone,\u00A0to see if it was possible.\u00A0I\u0027ve also been through some of the documentation. Oh, and I\u0027ve never done anything related to reinforcement learning, so just like when I started playing KSP a few years a go, I don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m doing, but I have theoretical knowledge, and think this could be fun, that\u0027s good enough for me to start! I thought opening a new post here\u00A0on the KSP forum could be a good place for me to first of all take the time to lay down what I want to do, and get some feedback from people that might have more experience than me, maybe some people might even want to follow progress on this! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo to make things a little more interesting, I\u0027m gonna give my IA a name, because I don\u0027t like how we just refer all the time to \u0022IA\u0022.\u00A0I\u0027m going to call my \u0027IA\u0027 Bertrand.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESo, here are the initial ideas I have (this will be a bit technical as the trickiest part of this is to get a neural network running and interacting with KSP, while minimising the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E counter).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- In order to make any reinforcement learning, we need to define a loss function, this is what the neural network is going to have to minimize. Basically what is Bertrands\u00A0 purpose in life? What I would like to try for the very first stage is to get the rocket to a certain altitude. Say 50km to start with. That sounds super easy: just full throttle and nothing else. Yeah, but you haven\u0027t seen how dumb a untrained neural network is. So basically the reward function would be something like a function of the altitude, say Altitude*10 and you get -500 if you blow up (this is just a rough idea first, I have to figure out the specifics later). I think taking into the account the amount of fuel left when reaching the altitude is also important, as that\u0027s what we want it to do: be the best rocket out of all the self-teaching rockets out there, and make the best ascend possible, using the least amount of fuel possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Second, the controls: Bertrand, my IA, needs to be able to control the rocket\u00A0 to\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Emake it blow up\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0fly it. But the thing is, with KSP, controls aren\u0027t really something we\u0027re short of. Remember, Bertrand is going to be really, really dumb at first, we\u0027re talking cat-walking-on-a-keyboard-level dumb here. I thought having control over yaw, pitch and thrust would be a good start. Since most rockets are cylindrically shaped, roll doesn\u0027t have much of an effect, and I think keeping just 6 buttons (2 for each control) is already going to be hard enough. I\u0027m also afraid that if we start letting roll in, it will heavily confuse Bertrand, because it will change what yaw and pitch do.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EIf\u003C/em\u003E this thing\u00A0turns out to be a good idea, I might add multiple stages to my rockets and thus decoupling as a control. (I\u0027m also pretty curious to see how it starts just randonly decoupling at any time and things just blowing up even more).\u00A0But I\u0027m worried that at first decoupling will make the capsule hop and give an easy win, so Bertrand keeps doing it without learning anything else. But we\u0027ll save that for later, let\u0027s not spoil Bertrand too much for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Third, this is going to need to run a loooot of times before Bertrand starts doing something not stupid and actually understand it has to throttle up and not do anything else to lift off. This is where my little kRPC program comes into play. I can make it reload the game as soon as the ship blows up, or reaches a certain altitude, and store the final altitude at which the game is reloaded. That\u0027s what I managed to do in a few hours of tinkering on kRPC, but I\u0027m also going to need to register all the keystrokes Bertrand does, those are going to be the inputs of the neural network. That\u0027s a bit more tricky, but I don\u0027t think that going to be very hard. The hard part is going to be feeding that to the neural network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fourth\u00A0I only have a Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro, and\u00A0that thing only has an 8th gen i5, with 8Gb of Ram and most laughable of all, an mx150 for a GPU. This bad boy doesn\u0027t have any issue running KSP at beautiful max settings and 60fps no problemo. But we\u0027re gonna have to train Bertrand too. And Bertrand is going to require some serious hoursepower to get better. This means I\u0027m probably going to run KSP at a stupidly low resolution, and potato graphical settings to just even *try* to train the neural network. This is why it\u0027s going to be very important to keep the neaural network architecture as simple as possible! If\u00A0that turns out to be really too long, I\u0027ll see if it isn\u0027t possible to use a Kaggle Kernel to get access to the free GPU and connect it to kRPC. Otherwise I might have to pay an online GPU, but I\u0027d rather keep that as a last resort, I\u0027m just a poor lonesome student with a bit too much time on his hands, but surely no money to rent a GPU. So\u00A0I\u0027ll simply take this as the \u0022optimization\u0022\u0027 success trophy in my Bertrand plays KSP game. And if hooking a Kaggle Kernel to kRPC doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027m not even sure it would with any other paid service; but that\u0027s for later anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The idea I have, from this\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://medium.com/@whiteastercom/kerbal-space-program-complex-environment-for-reinforcement-learning-12318db065f5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earticle from people that previously seemed to have relatively done what I want to do\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0would be to use OpenAI\u0027s Gym, as a support for the reinforcement learning. OpenAI\u00A0launched a thing called Universe a while back that was supposed to support KSP, but that got cancelled before we had time to see Terminator-powered rockets take over. But these guys (the ones from the article) made their own environment compatible with the Gym, which I will very happily clone, and tweak according to what I will be trying to do \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(after I eventually understand all of it)\u003C/span\u003E. I\u0027m basically going to use what these guys have done to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etry\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto get something working. I do think I should spend some time learning how to use OpenAI\u0027s gym on easier examples first before doing that though. So Bertrand isn\u0027t even going to see the world inside KSP first!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s basically how far my reflexion has gone for now. I\u0027ve spend a good amount of time going through the internet looking for people trying this, and as I mentioned earlier, didn\u0027t seem to find anybody that did achieve this, apart from the guys who\u0027s work I shared in this last point. I also saw that a few years ago a guy streamed his neural network training, but that\u0027s long been finished, so I can\u0027t see that anymore\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to conclude here is what I have already done:\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing kRPC, I made a program that goes on for 5 epoch (or 5 times) and each time makes the rocket turn after epoch_number seconds, then waits 5 seconds, gets\u00A0the altitude the rocket got at after those 5 seconds, and reload to the last quicksave. These altitudes are stored in a dicitonnary called Dict_alt that is displayed at the end. This was my initial test to see if it was simply possible to be able to run multiple launches one after the other without me coming in. And storing in a dictionnary will probably need to be changed to a dataframe using a cuddly panda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p82Gsop.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/p82Gsop.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTL;DR: I have no idea what I\u0027m really doing, but I want to train an IA to fly a rocket, and I have a lot\u00A0of work ahead of me for this to even remotely work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, if this is interesting to follow, well take a seat and prepare to wait a long time, and if you have any good ideas on how I could do this, things I have forgotten even if I haven\u0027t even started or improvements, please let me know!

I\u0027m even been thinking about only giving him access to pitch and throttle. Does anybody know if there\u0027s a mod to lock the game in yaw and roll? That would basically make the game a 2D environment, that could be interesting too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout learning Go, that\u0027s not really what happened, and there are mostly two different algorithms: AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. AlphaGo used human games to learn from them, a little bit like any human player would. But what AlphaGo Zero did, was totally unsupervised learning: it played against itself, only, and got better from there. This means it actually came up with strategies that never occured to humans before, and completely smashed the original AlphaGo. So no, IA is really not just brute forcing in that term, otherwise it\u0027s just any other program. What is commonely referred to IA, and what I want to try here is a little bit how humans learn: trial and error, with a feedback on your progress. In Bertrand\u0027s case, the\u00A0feedback is the loss function I talked about in the original post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo come back to the IA taking hours, days, weeks or months to learn how to fly a rocket in the previous streamer\u0027s tentative, that\u0027s one thing I\u0027m going to try to optimize, how long before each epoch, because I\u0027m going to need to go through hundreds or even thousands. If it turns out ot be too complicated, I might need to record myself playing and feed that to Bertrand to decrease the learning time. But that\u0027s just not as fun.\u00A0I\u0027m also trying to think if my gaming beast of a computer would handle running two instances of KSP \u002B Bertrand. Of course I\u0027ll only try with one in the first place, but running 2 games at once means it could double up speed time.

I already knew I was entering uncharted seas as far as what my knowledge of reinforcement learning was, but didn\u0027t think I\u0027d have too many things to learn. I was wrong.\u00A0I have started learning to use OpenAI\u0027s Gym, to get an understanding of how it works, and what I can do with it. I\u0027ve learned quite a lot with this, but it\u0027s not going to be enough for Bertrand. One of the easiest thing you can do is implement a neural network that learns how to stabilize a pole on a sort of cart, which can only go left or right. Once trained, here\u0027s what it looks like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QtA0ukM.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022436\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QtA0ukM.gif\u0022 width=\u0022642\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might not look impressive, but at the slightest move, the pole being in a very unstable situation, it falls. Except here the neural netowrk learned how to stabilize it, not perfectly, but good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, nothing impressive, but to code, it\u0027s actually not that straight forward.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pythonprogramming.net/openai-cartpole-neural-network-example-machine-learning-tutorial/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the best tutorial I found for this specific example\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(The only difference being that the guy uses TensorFlow in this article, and I went for Keras, that I find much simpler to use and work with. I also have more experience with Keras and feel much more confident using it. For this project, that should work, hopefully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me explain to you how this works:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EStep 1\u003C/u\u003E: We tell the agent (that refer to the program that takes the actions, here either left or right) what actions it can take in the environment (here, the game) and how to calculate its score: you gain points each second the pole is straight up, if it goes beyond 15 degrees, you loose. The aim\u00A0is\u00A0 to be able to maximize this score, aka keep the pole straight as long as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EStep 2\u003C/u\u003E: Get some initial\u00A0data to train our neural network on. This is pretty easy in this case: Just ask the agent to take random actions until the poles falls. Since it takes random actions,\u00A0usually it lasts one or 2 seconds before the poll falls more than 15 degrees, but we don\u0027t really care . We just want to see what each action does. We are going to keep track of every aciton the agent is taking, and the resulting position \u0026amp; velocity of the cartpole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EStep 3\u003C/u\u003E: Feed all that data into the neural network, telling it to figure out how to maximize the score (here, this being keeping the pole up as long as possible). That\u0027s what neural networks are good at: finding patterns to maximize (or minimize, depends how you see it) a certain function. Here a very basic neural network is enough. At the end of this stage, the neural network is trained, and ready to make predictions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EStep 4\u003C/u\u003E: At each time step, take the position of the cartpole and the pole, give it to the neural network\u00A0as input, and ask it to predict the best move to make (either left or right) to keep the pole balanced. We take that move, and observe the result, which\u00A0gives us another state. We feed that again to the neural network\u00A0for the prediction on the best action to take this time. We do this for every time step, and voil\u00E0 !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Step 5:?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 6: Profit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there we have it, a neural network trained to steer a cart to keep a pole steady. That took me about 2 evenings to\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Efigure out\u00A0\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0shamely copy, but adding and testing new things along the way to see how different elemts of code\u00A0worked and understanding the ins and outs of that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile that\u0027s pretty cool (Okay, maybe not. I find it cool at least, especially once you\u0027ve worked for a few hours on it). But that\u0027s not really teaching a rocket to fly now, is it? Well, nope. The big difference here is that the cartpole actions only depend on the state at which we are now. So that\u0027s actually pretty easy to figure out. We could take a picture of the cart and ask the neural network what to do; meaning nothing depends on the previous states the agent was in. That\u0027s not going to be as easily possible with a rocket, because each state of flight is different, the atmosphere\u0027s propreties are changing as we go higher, the air resistance also changes with our speed and altitude, and the agent itself (here the rocket) changes mass as the flight goes on, burning fuel. So we need some sort of time dependancies. And that\u0027s what I don\u0027t know yet, and where I need to leave this project aside for some time, while I go learn about that, how they work, and even more importantly what we can do with these, and how to use them. (for people interested these seems to be LSTM layers mostly, also looking at the A3C algorithm, since this seems to be pretty much the state of the art, and what the guys that did this before me used. But that requires multiple instances of the game at once, so another challenge.
