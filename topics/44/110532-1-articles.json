When I do the math my landers have about 5000 Dv, but I tend to run out of fuel way half way back home or even before I have even landed on the surface. After a lot of trials and fails I narrowed my problem down to two things: 1) I am calculating my dry mass wrong and thus think I have more Dv than I actually have. 2) My version of the game is seriously bugged.\n\nThe way I always calculate my dry mass of a craft is I just remove the stage and the have the new mass of the craft. E.G:\n\nA craft consisting of these parts:\n\nStage 2:\n\n1 x [Command Pod Mk1](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Command_Pod_Mk1)\n\nStage 1:\n\n1 x [TR-18A Stack Decoupler](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TR-18A_Stack_Decoupler)\n\n1 x [FL-T800 Fuel Tank](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-T800_Fuel_Tank)\n\n1 x [LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/LV-T45_%22Swivel%22_Liquid_Fuel_Engine)\n\nThis ship has a full mass of 6.89 tons. With the TR - 18A Stack Decoupler, FL-T800 Fuel Tank and LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine removed it has a dry mass of: 0.89 tons. We also have an Isp of 320 in a vacuum.\n\nUsing the Dv formula: dv = ln(FullMass/DryMass) \\* Isp \\* 9.81 we get that our Dv is about 6 424.702, that\u0027s plenty to get to the moon and back (if already in a stable 70 KM orbit around Kerbin).\n\nThis ship only gets to surface and not back. So what am I doing wrong? ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:30:45Z","Content":"You\u0027re not including the mass of the empty tanks and the engines on each stage."},{"CreatedByName":"kUSer","CreatedById":144022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:33:02Z","Content":"So my dry mass is basically my FullMass - WeightOfFuel?"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:33:50Z","Content":"Pretty much, yes."},{"CreatedByName":"kUSer","CreatedById":144022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:37:24Z","Content":"Thanks guys."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:43:16Z","Content":"Not sure if the mass has changed in the latest version (I haven\u0027t got around to try it yet) but the numbers I get are\n\nPod 0.840\n\nTR-18A 0.050\n\nFL-T800 4.5 wet/0.5 dry\n\nT-45 1.5\n\nTotal 6.89 wet/2.89 dry\n\n320\\*9.81\\*ln(6.89/2.89) = 2727.38 which is considerably less than 6424.70. 2727 sounnds about right for a mun landing w/o return ticket.\n\nEDIT: A bit late."}]}
