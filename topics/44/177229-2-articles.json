The first, composed of hydrogen and helium, is believed to have been blown by the solar wind. The second, believed to have been formed by volcanic outgassing, was around 100 times as dense as our current atmosphere, and composed mostly of carbon dioxide with some nitrogen. This was converted into our current atmosphere by two processes. One, the carbon dioxide was scrubbed by chemical interaction with minerals dissolved in the oceans, forming carbonate rocks. Second, the development of photosynthetic bacteria started producing oxygen, which eventually built up in the atmosphere.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EVenus is basically stuck with a stage two atmosphere, because it lacks liquid water.

Planets that are closer to Earth standard might be capable of terraformation in as little as 300 years, so don\u0027t count on it. (As a point of interest, many scientists did theorize that\u00A0Venus\u00A0would be a better candidate for terraformation, instead of Mars, due to the fact that Venus is tectonically active, while Mars isn\u0027t.

While the lunar gravity\u0027s too weak to hold a permanent atmosphere, it\u0027d take thousands of years for a newly created one to dissipate, and in the meantime the Moon could conceivably have blue skies, oceans and forests. It seems like a colossal waste of resources by today\u0027s standards, but the possibility does exist for any future civilization that really wants to go sunbathing on the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the problems with terraforming is an ethical one. If, hypothetically, microbes exist on Mars (which is possible), Terraforming would likely lead to their extinction. This may seem insignificant until you realize that humanity has also evolved out of microbial life, so we would potentially be exterminating intelligent life before it is even able to evolve to that point. This is the subject of a lot of debate within the scientific community with some in favor (Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin, for one) and others opposed (such as the late Carl Sagan). It doesn\u0027t help that the quickest way to terraform is to explode nuclear bombs all over the surface. Another issue is that microbes or chemicals may have been brought to Earth from Mars via asteroid strikes.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EA twist on this was raised up late in the nineteenth century. If Mars does have microbes then the situation could turn into something out of H. G. Wells\u00A0The War of the Worlds. At the very least, both the Earth life and the Mars life would have a long drawn out battle with unpredictable results.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn added difficulty of any theoretical terraforming that real life scientists have seriously discussed is also the issue of maintenance of the terraforming. It would be pointless to expend so much time and effort to terraform a planet only to have it undone. This is one of the reasons why some consider Mars a poor candidate. Mars\u0027s core has long since hardened, which means it has no magnetic field to protect life from solar radiation and from solar winds blasting away its atmosphere. The atmosphere Mars now retains is a mere wisp compared to what scientists theorize it may have once had. Due to Mars\u0027 weak gravity, it\u0027s possible for several atmospheric terraforming facility to initiate the terraforming process by generating atmospheric gases at a rate that outpace the rate of Mars\u0027 atmospheric dissipation. But then again, this would take centuries or even millenia\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223429364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533647659\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118557\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StarStreak2109\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, StarStreak2109 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause we managed to mess up our own Earth, and now we want to do it to yet another world?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022The sun, the moon and the stars would have disappeared long ago... had they happened to be within the reach of predatory human hands.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Havelock Ellis\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-07T13:20:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2018 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-07T14:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223429368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533647980\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n24 minutes ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA\u0027s even done studies on the idea of terraforming the\u00A0Moon\u00A0into an Earth-like world\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstronomers also need to eat.
