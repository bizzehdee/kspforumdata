But does the shape do anything? Like, do bee-pollinated species have pollen that sticks better to bees than say, hummingbirds?"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:43:56Z","Content":"Yes, pollen shape is partially dependant on the pollinator (wind, insects, birds).\n\n![pollentypen.gif](http://www.botany.unibe.ch/paleo/pollen_e/images/gifs/pollentypen.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s one of the evolutionary adaptations.\n\nFor example, pines have vesiculate ones which increase surface area so that they\u0027re easier to carry by wind. And wind is the primary, dominant pollinator of pines.\n\n![lg_ponderosapollen.jpg](http://www.nps.gov/romo/images/lg_ponderosapollen.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T20:52:49Z","Content":"By the way, the fact that they are each very different and particular is very handy for ancient climates reconstitutions."}]}
