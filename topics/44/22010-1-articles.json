My money for the short-term is still on travelling-wave reactors, because of their ability to use good ol\u0027 common U-238. The major benefits there is that we already have all the fuel infrastructure set-up, and it has the same benefits as a thorium reactor would in terms of compactness. No need to go digging for thorium just yet, because we already have piles and piles of \u0022waste\u0022 U-238 just sitting around that we could use as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, I\u0027m not bashing the idea of thorium reactors, just saying that I wouldn\u0027t bet on it short-term.

Wind and solar just can\u0027t cut it; they\u0027re nice supplements, sure, but there are lots of places that couldn\u0027t use them. (Vancouver, solar? Not in winter.

The attractive part is the relatively mild thermal management problem after a serious failure - the history of nuclear accidents demonstrates that decay heat is probably more dangerous than reactivity excursions.
