Are the materials that rare? Is the workmanship that exceptional? Is the labor that specialized? I\u0027m curious how low costs could be pushed without overly compromising quality if there was more of a market and/or something like real competition? I think I\u0027ll start a new thread on \u0022Prospecting Solar Resources\u0022\u00A0and use this point as the launching point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose that one way to address the question, would be to look at the sorts of spacecraft which have now become relatively \u0027common,\u0027 which I presume would be telecommunications satellites. If the price on those has dropped over the years then that is a pretty clear indication that, with more demand, and thus more supply, costs will necessarily be driven down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course at present, there is a market for telecommunications satellites, and not so much for space telescopes. But with the supposed riches to be had in the asteroids, I would think that eventually that will change. Could a Hubble (or Hubble-lite) sort of craft not be used to prospect asteroids for valuable resources?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone who knows better correct me if I\u0027m in error but . . . e.g., rare elements such as\u00A0platinum, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium.\u00A0It is my understanding that these particular elements are\u00A0extremely rare and large quantities of ore have to be dug up and processed to yield small quantities. We may never exhaust the \u0027available\u0027 supplies\u00A0on Earth, but the\u00A0value of these materials has generally increased over time and is likely to continue to do so, even while their historic uses are phased out in favor of less rare materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was discovered that there were some asteroids with sufficient abundance of elements like these . . . or even others which are not necessarily rare on Earth, but simply costly to get into space . . . I would think that entrepreneurs and/or nation states with the economic clout would be falling all over themselves to be the first to haul such an asteroid back to near Earth orbit where it could be efficiently mined, no?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that how it would be done? Hauled back and mined? or would it be mined in situ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr another example, a moon base. Water I would think is one of the biggest bottlenecks for setting up a moonbase of any consequence and hauling enough up there to get going would I think be quite costly. But what if a comet with enough water ice in it were hauled to a low moon orbit and then chunks of it were broken lose and sent into controlled descents? Obviously a big project, but could that actually be cheaper than hauling it up from the oceans?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-26T01:28:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2016 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eelaboration of the point of the thread\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T01:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacecraft cost a lot of money because it involves skilled workmanship for a large number of man hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-26T01:40:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2016 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T01:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222774329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148663\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474854022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacecraft cost a lot of money because it involves skilled workmanship for a large number of man hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell what about telecommunications satellites?

Servicing (most) things in space isn\u0027t practical because the few satellites are widely spread out, in the travel time or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E between them,\u00A0and so any significant failure is final. How viable would a tow-truck business be if there were only three to four thousand motor vehicles total, spread out over the surface of the earth? Likewise, because Earth-based experience often isn\u0027t a reliable guide, many activities in space are effectively brand new without much precedent and thus require extensive testing with expensive facilities. I don\u0027t see any of these factors changing because this is the common experience of any new activity, and until we reach an \u0027alien earth\u0027, everything in the space environment is new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA secondary problem is that spaceflight is a low-importance activity for most people, most of the time. In certain cases of higher immediate importance - the superpowers\u0027 space race, or current day telecommunications - the sponsors do budget for more spacecraft than the bare minimum needed to perform the mission, and do accept the occasional failure as part of the overall program. However, for typical exploration missions at the current time, wider humanity will fund the bare minimum number of craft even when the per-person taxation cost is not enormous (not big enough for voters to take the time to learn how much/little spaceflight is costing them personally). The mission team, for whom the mission is a vitally important thing, will then reasonably say that if there\u0027s only one attempt at the mission during their career, then that attempt must have the highest chance of success humanly possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the secondary problem could be addressed by some change of heart, some insight or aspiration.

You will want a refinery in space, to minimize material you\u0027re trying to bring back, and mining equipment.

Once it\u0027s done it comes back to earth orbit, maybe not even necessarily LEO, and shoots off a capsule that re-enters with the partially refined ore. You would then use big dumb boosters to send up more hydrogen or kerosene to refuel your ship (oxygen will be a primary byproduct of refining the ore) along with another capsule for re-entry of more material. Since the fuel is dirt cheap, and the capsule itself need not be very sophisticated (you could even shoot for a re-usable return capsule, its fuel tank becomes the payload bay and it uses engines for a short deorbit burn) you can get away with BDB because losing the occasional payload won\u0027t be a financial disaster.
