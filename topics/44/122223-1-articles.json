Here is a description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider if we look (using a telescope) into the sky and see a galaxy at 95% of the distance to the cosmological horizon, ie to the edge of the universe. And we say that in some sense there are N galaxies \u0027between\u0027 us and that galaxy. Looking at that galaxy, you are also looking 95% of the way back in time closer to the big bang, so the galaxy you see exists at a point in time much closer to the big bang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if we change our point of observation to that galaxy, and go forward in time back to 13.82 billion years after the big bang, I think the universe from the perspective of that galaxy should look much the same as it is from our perspective. So you should be able to look in the opposite direction from the earth and again see another galaxy about 95% of the way to the cosmological horizon, with N galaxies \u0027between\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we can repeat this procedure over and over, each time discovering more galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea would be that at 13.82 billion years since the big bang, an infinite number of galaxies must have been flung out into space if we can use all of the points in space as reference points for observation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cfds","CreatedById":82109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T18:26:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, could you replace the [Physics] tag with something more appropriate like [semantics] or [Poetry]?
