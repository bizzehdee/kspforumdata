The system is illuminated, ergo it is the former.

This would continue happening until the disk cooled enough to pass out of the UV/high visible spectrum, after which it dramatically falls off because of the complementary wavelengths of hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long and short of it is, if there\u0027s enough light from the accretion disk (or a nearby star) to see by, there\u0027s enough radiation to turn you to ash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
