One of A. T. Mahan\u0027s favorite theories. The problem is, of course, that it ended rather poorly for the Japanese. Such a doctrine led to them tricking themselves into thinking they could attack an enemy force and have it sit still or move in one direction long enough that they could wear it down and then destroy it decisively.

This nation, let\u0027s call it nation A, controls a large, backwater expanse used as a strategic buffer zone between it and the rest of the galaxy. Just bordering the expanse is another nation which is on its way up in the world, at least, according to it. They are tired of not being able to access this expanse, full of unused resources, or perhaps their leaders need to distract from the failings of their totalitarian regime at home. For whatever reason, this nation, nation B, declares war on nation A with the aim of humiliating A and taking over a chunk of the local economic market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation B\u0027s military leader uses rapid, unpredictable strikes to eliminate A\u0027s infrastructure in the region in the opening hours of the conflict. This forces A to extend supply lines from its home bases, or mount attacks from more distant, unaffected locations. If B can win just a couple more victories, they can offer peace terms to nation A under which B keeps a significant part of the buffer zone. If A cannot retaliate forcefully enough to drive out B (because A\u0027s infrastructure was destroyed, they cannot maintain a fleet in the region), and they are under pressure from the rest of the galaxy to end the war, they may opt for conditional surrender.
