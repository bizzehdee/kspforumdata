You\u0027ve got a compressed tank full of nitrogen gas. The energy was put into the nitrogen gas when it was pressurized; open the valve and the pressure pushes the gas out. The momentum of the escaping reaction mass confers equal and opposite momentum on the\u00A0vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA monopropellant thruster (like HTP or hydrazine) comes next. Here the energy is not contained in pressurization, but in the chemical energy of the propellant. When hydrazine decomposes into ammonia and nitrogen gas, it releases heat which in turn accelerates that ammonia and nitrogen gas to produce thrust. It\u0027s important to note that even though the exhaust and the reaction mass are the same thing, here, that doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be the case. You could have a hydrazine thruster that mixed the exhaust with water in order to produce a cooler exhaust with more thrust, even though the water would make the entire affair less efficient. You could even have a hydrazine thruster for a jet aircraft which used a turbofan to compress air and mix it into the exhaust, which would actually be more efficient. The energy source and the remass \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebe separate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne example where remass and energy source are partially separate is actually none other than the Space Shuttle Main Engine. When burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen together, you achieve the maximum amount of energy with two pounds of hydrogen for every one pound of oxygen. However, the SSME actually mixed in four extra pounds of hydrogen to help cool the engine and provide additional remass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a nuclear thermal rocket like NERVA, the energy source and the reaction\u00A0mass are completely separate. The remass is liquid hydrogen and the energy source is the nuclear reactor. You could use any remass -- liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, even water --\u00A0and get a different performance level, but the energy source remains the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hypothetical antimatter engine would work the same way. Antimatter is a way of storing energy. So you would inject a small amount of antimatter into a large propellant flow (like liquid hydrogen or liquid methane or even water). The antimatter would annihilate with a small amount of the propellant, which would heat up the rest of the propellant and push it out as reaction mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-19T16:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will point out again that while we say \u0022reaction mass\u0022, we actually mean \u0022reaction momentum\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing physically impossible about accelerating a spacecraft by either emitting photons from it or reflecting beamed photons off of it.

The I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of a perfect photon drive can be as high as c/g. I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of a steam rocket would be comparable to LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E/LOX chemical rocket, so it\u0027s not a huge improvement at a big increase in cost. There are other intermediate technologies that can use antimatter as power source and a dedicated propellant to produce much higher I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0than a steam rocket, but it\u0027s a bit more complex than just heating water with gamma radiation from a matter-antimatter reaction. Simplest one is firing pellets or plasma beams of antimatter into larger propellant pellets and have the explosion push the damper similar to nuclear pulse propulsion, but there are more creative ideas as well, down to using antimatter to drive a plasma rocket of some sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, the absolute best I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0you can get is if 100% of fuel mass is converted into energy, and that\u0027s a photon drive. That, too, comes with huge technological challenges. We don\u0027t have mirrors that work at these photon energies, which means the shielding behind a photon rocket will be absorbing the radiation. That wastes a major fraction of your theoretical I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. Indeed, the best you can do is c/(2*pi*g) with a kind of photon rocket we know how to build. But worse, it produces enormous quantities of heat you have to get rid of at anything like reasonable thrust. If you want to get full impulse you\u0027ll have to get rid of over 1GW of thermal energy for every 1N of thrust. That\u0027s a small nuclear power plant\u0027s output worth of energy for a few ounces of thrust. If you sacrifice some I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0you can bring that down to about 300MW per 1N, but that\u0027s still an enormous amount of energy to get rid of for any practically useful thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo antimatter propulsion is a bit complicated. It\u0027s not just a problem of making antimatter and storing it, but even turning that energy into useful thrust is very far from being a solved problem. I would go as far as to say that for practical interstellar torch ship, black holes are probably more practical than antimatter. Outside of the problem of making one, the only real difficulty with these is confining that\u00A0black hole, and that\u0027s basically equivalent to balancing a skyscraper on top of a needle point. While clearly not an easy task, I can at least picture how to reduce that one to an engineering problem rather than requiring conceptually new understanding of matter and energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-20T13:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223869965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603142256\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207217\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Dr. Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u2019t the explosion form the two matters trying to eliminate each other be enough or is it more complicated?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it wouldn\u2019t be an explosion in the conventional sense.

When the nuke is triggered, the x-rays vaporize the tungsten and turn it into a jet of plasma that is blasted back toward the ship, delivering the desired impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason you need the pusher plate, though, is because there is a minimum size that a nuke can be. If you have antimatter containment, you can simply feed microgram-quantities of antimatter into a stream of propellant continuously. The Raptor engine, for example, has an energy output of 3.52 GW (yes, that\u0027s three times the infamous\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBack To The Future\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0value). To match that with an antimatter engine, you\u0027d only need a flow of 19.6 micrograms of antimatter per second...that\u0027s just under five gnats per minute. Of course, to match the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethrust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the Raptor engine, you\u0027re also going to need to feed about 700 kilograms of cryogenic propellant into the chamber per second. The more liquid propellant you use, the more thrust you get, but the lower your efficiency is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-20T16:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223869848\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603124380\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsnip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou made me almost lose my breath I laughed so hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI do have a question about this\u003C/strong\u003E.
