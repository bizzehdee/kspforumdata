The main reason it\u0027s not done more is probably the mechanical issues involved... counter rotating fan blades can be surprisingly hard to make, because that means their shafts need to be concentric (one inside the other) and the bearings to hold all this in place suddenly become much more touchy and expensive.

When SR-71 travels at high speed, the body heats up (So much that according to the pilot\u0027s experience, they heat their rations by sticking it on the window) that the airframe is increased in length by \u003Cem\u003Eone meter\u003C/em\u003E. JP-7 is pumped and circulated across the airframe to act as a coolant.\u00A0JP-7 is a compound mixture composed primarily of\u00A0hydrocarbons; including\u00A0alkanes,\u00A0cycloalkanes,\u00A0alkylbenzenes,\u00A0indanes/tetralins, and\u00A0naphthalenes; with addition of\u00A0fluorocarbons to increase its\u00A0lubricant\u00A0properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn more efficiently, and a\u00A0caesium-containing compound known as A-50, which is to aid in disguising the\u00A0radar\u00A0and\u00A0infrared signatures\u00A0of the\u00A0exhaust plume. The SR-71 Blackbirds used approximately 36,000\u201344,000 pounds (16,000\u201320,000\u00A0kg) of fuel per hour of flight. JP-7 is unusual, in that it is not a conventional\u00A0distillate\u00A0fuel, but is created from special blending stocks in order to have very low (\u0026lt;3%) concentration of highly volatile components like\u00A0benzene\u00A0or\u00A0toluene, and almost no\u00A0sulfur,\u00A0oxygen, and\u00A0nitrogen\u00A0impurities. It has a low vapor pressure, and high thermal oxidation stability. The fuel must operate across a wide range of temperatures: from near freezing at high altitude, to the high temperatures of the airframe and engine parts that are being cooled by it at high speed. Its\u00A0volatility\u00A0must be low enough to make it flash-resistant at these high temperatures. The very low volatility, and relative unwillingness of JP-7 to be ignited, required\u00A0triethylborane\u00A0(TEB) to be injected into the engine in order to initiate combustion, and allow\u00A0afterburner\u00A0operation in flight. The SR-71 had a limited capacity for TEB, and therefore had a limited number of available \u0027shots\u0027 of TEB (usually 16) for re-starts, and those had to be managed carefully on long-duration flights with multiple stages of relatively low-altitude air refueling and normal high-altitude cruise flight. It\u0027s not just the fuel cost that ends the SR-71 service, but the difficulty in manufacturing the fuel, and\u00A0the advent of reconnaisance satellite rendered the spy plane concept obsolete\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-28T23:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223423879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532815986\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n49 minutes ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhen SR-71 travels at high speed, the body heats up (So much that according to the pilot\u0027s experience, they heat their rations by sticking it on the window) that the airframe is increased in length by \u003Cem\u003Eone meter\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne meter seems excessive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-28T23:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223423890\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532819133\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Brotoro said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne meter seems excessive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s according what the technician says, dunno if they exaggerated it or not, but the craft certainly increases in length when travelling at high speed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-28T23:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223423879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532815986\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nJP-7 is pumped and circulated across the airframe to act as a coolant.\u00A0JP-7 is a coolant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresumably this is done right before ignition much a hydrogen-cooled rocket.\u00A0 Otherwise there doesn\u0027t appear to be anywhere that could work to radiate the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-29T00:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, first things first, there\u0027s a lot of confusion here about basic turbine engine operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurbine engine compressors are somewhat mislabeled. They\u0027re actually accelerating the air as it passes through each stage of rotors, and then using the stators to straighten out the airflow. This gets up to a pretty good head of speed before hitting the diffusor, just before the combustion chamber, where the air is decelerated and, according to Bernoulli\u0027s Principle, it gains pressure. Centrifugal compressors (aka impellers),\u00A0though lacking the stators, still use the same basic principle, albeit much more dramatically. (Typical compression ratio across a single axial flow stage is ~1.2:1. Centrifugal is ~20:1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the \u0022turboramjet\u0022, yes, the SR-71 had what amounted to one, albeit not as just the J58 engine alone. The complete intake/engine/exhaust system\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0function as a hybrid of a turbine engine and a ramjet. The intakes did ~80% of the compression work when at cruise, in a manner similar to that of a ramjet. However, this compressed air was then fed into the J58 turbojet engine, which then functioned largely as normal, albeit at very high temperatures. Some, but not most, of the air did indeed bypass the J58, but this was used mostly for cooling the outside of the engine and providing cooling air to the afterburner section, not to provide additional oxygen to support combustion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: Blackbird and it\u0027s fuel... JP-7\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quite expensive, as it was only produced in small quantities for the Blackbirds. Most aircraft couldn\u0027t even run on the stuff, as it was exceptionally stable, even for kerosene derivatives. Much of this was to prevent the fuel from boiling at cruise, and so that it could be used as a hydraulic fluid for the engine. It was NOT circulated throughout the entire airframe as a coolant, though it was used to cool important parts of the engine and as the first stage of the bleed air cooling system. Also, the Blackbirds did stretch some in flight, though not a meter. That\u0027d be about 3% of the length of the aircraft, which is far too much to align with the thermal expansion coefficient of titanium alloys similar to those that could be expected to be used under such conditions. A few centimeters would be more realistic. That said, yes, it could get quite hot in the cockpits if it weren\u0027t for the air conditioning they used. There is a story of an RSO whose AC failed for the cockpit, and the cockpit temperature was over 300*F, enough to curl the pages of his checklists and melt the grease pencil marks off them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd turbofans... Yes, most of the thrust is provided by the fan air bypassing around the engine core. Much of the core flow energy is extracted by multi-stage turbines to drive both the compressor section(s) and the fan. Modern designs can achieve bypass ratios in excess of 20:1, i.e. for every pound of air that flows through the core, 20 flows through the fan bypass.

They\u0027re actually accelerating the air as it passes through each stage of rotors, and then using the stators to straighten out the airflow. This gets up to a pretty good head of speed before hitting the diffusor, just before the combustion chamber, where the air is decelerated and, according to Bernoulli\u0027s Principle, it gains pressure. Centrifugal compressors (aka impellers),\u00A0though lacking the stators, still use the same basic principle, albeit much more dramatically. (Typical compression ratio across a single axial flow stage is ~1.2:1. Centrifugal is ~20:1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the \u0022turboramjet\u0022, yes, the SR-71 had what amounted to one, albeit not as just the J58 engine alone. The complete intake/engine/exhaust system\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0function as a hybrid of a turbine engine and a ramjet. The intakes did ~80% of the compression work when at cruise, in a manner similar to that of a ramjet. However, this compressed air was then fed into the J58 turbojet engine, which then functioned largely as normal, albeit at very high temperatures. Some, but not most, of the air did indeed bypass the J58, but this was used mostly for cooling the outside of the engine and providing cooling air to the afterburner section, not to provide additional oxygen to support combustion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: Blackbird and it\u0027s fuel... JP-7\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quite expensive, as it was only produced in small quantities for the Blackbirds. Most aircraft couldn\u0027t even run on the stuff, as it was exceptionally stable, even for kerosene derivatives. Much of this was to prevent the fuel from boiling at cruise, and so that it could be used as a hydraulic fluid for the engine. It was NOT circulated throughout the entire airframe as a coolant, though it was used to cool important parts of the engine and as the first stage of the bleed air cooling system. Also, the Blackbirds did stretch some in flight, though not a meter. That\u0027d be about 3% of the length of the aircraft, which is far too much to align with the thermal expansion coefficient of titanium alloys similar to those that could be expected to be used under such conditions. A few centimeters would be more realistic. That said, yes, it could get quite hot in the cockpits if it weren\u0027t for the air conditioning they used. There is a story of an RSO whose AC failed for the cockpit, and the cockpit temperature was over 300*F, enough to curl the pages of his checklists and melt the grease pencil marks off them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd turbofans... Yes, most of the thrust is provided by the fan air bypassing around the engine core. Much of the core flow energy is extracted by multi-stage turbines to drive both the compressor section(s) and the fan. Modern designs can achieve bypass ratios in excess of 20:1, i.e. for every pound of air that flows through the core, 20 flows through the fan bypass. Modern military aircraft engines for fighters are low-bypass, usually less than 4:1, or even less than even.

Since impeller is designed mostly for subsonic flight, it\u0027ll be ripped apart in ramjet airspeed while ramjet is designed only for supersonic flight. A hybrid design such as SR-71 engine used the shock cone intake adjustment (pushing it forward or backward) to shift between subsonic (where low-speed air entering the turbine) and supersonic mode (where high-speed air directly enters combustion chamber)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
