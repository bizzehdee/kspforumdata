Amounts that goes from 50 ppm to 100ppm, This is equal to 50 to\u00A0100 grams of water by m3 (15m3 for each liter). The good news is that \u0022afternoon\u0022 in venus may last\u00A0some months\u00A0if you are\u00A0anchored to land. Winds are just 10m/s at that height and you can even use some mountains to reduce the cable needs, not sure the best way to collect it, with a scoop or with a big surface a bit more colder to condensate the water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt 48km, we have the biggest h2so4\u00A0precipitation, this is just 10 to 20 ppm, but we don\u0027t need extra energy to collect it, only to separate water in case we don\u0027t want the acid.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMr. Rubisco,\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs really annoying when you drop numbers without have a real idea or reference of what are you talking about \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI made the math, for a 5000 tons habitat, which\u00A0might be 150m x 150m x 2 floors \u002B 100 people (or more floors and less area, this saves insulation), we need between 0,5mw to 1,3mw. (no gigawatts).\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow this cooling air machine may weight 2\u00A0or 4\u00A0tons, I will said 1 or 2 if we make it lighter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlants can help in the cooling needs, If we have all our roof surface with plants (where habitat air can not\u00A0flow with the plants and envelope air, but you can visit this section using doors. What happens is that plants receive light and water.. they evaporate that water carrying that heat to the top of the envelope, this cool down few degrees\u00A0the plants layer\u00A0and the human habitat below.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we use the special emissivity cover to radiate heat directly to space, then that is all we need for plants and us.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA 40m x 12m\u00A0kite at 48 kmh wind, can generate 8 mw.. So energy in venus is not a real problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am an evidence machine, is time that you provide once a while some evidence.. \u0022as the 1gw air conditioner.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nTake a look to the amount of radiation that people receive in airplanes.. then reduce a bit the altitude and increase the time exposure by 50 years.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen try to convince all inhabitants they will not die from cancer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe higher cities are at 4000m in bolivia. \u00A0You may have some towns at 5000m but without much stadistic data. At 5000m you have 2 times the shielding\u00A0than at 7500m.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs easy to notice this just studying\u00A0the atmosphere density curve and the area below:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe if instead 57km, you place it at 54,5 may have more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelium and hydrogen lifting capacity is reduced. Air may increase.. not sure.. if is at higher temperature. You still can do that at 54km, you dont include the habitat inside the lifting envelope, but you deposite there all your waste heat from the machines and you apply special emissivity coefficients to the envelope (different top from bottom) to harvester heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs a good idea, but like different layers means different speeds, you may need to wait quick a lot to to have an interception window (the same as orbits).\u003Cbr\u003E\nif you low the whole lading base for short amount of time (for all kind of isru bases or floating industries), then you might be wasting similar energy in changes of altitude for transport \u0022goods\u0022 that the one you waste in cooling. But well, is pointless try to be so energy accurate now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost all problems have solution, the factor here is find the one that is most cost efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe envelope needs certain thick to support the structure, you can divide that thick in 2\u00A0or 3\u00A0layers.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand, now you want a city at 65km? \u00A0Reduce the day/night cycle\u00A0is welcome.. but not really necessary.. I will put this as last of requirements.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout wind speed, I am not interested in wind speed at certain layer.. I am interested in wind gradient.. the difference of wind speed at different layers.. that is the energy you can harvester.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt lower altitudes from 48 to 50, is when most of the speed change happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nheh, I was trying to said volcano \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh with electrodynamic tether, yeah I know that technique. but yeah, there is no magnetic field here, also.. we know very little about this.. how much damage might receive this skimming trying to trap super fast particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, we already solve those issues you mention.. we need some\u00A0chemist.. also other kind of ideas or math is welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh my gOSH!!WHY\u00A0DO YA ALWAIS TOIP HYJE SENTENSES???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...................WHY\u00A0DO YOU ALWAYS TYPE HUGE SENTENCES???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T19:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222397581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129667\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454834022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156864\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr.K Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Dr.K Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh my gOSH!!WHY\u00A0DO YA ALWAIS TOIP HYJE SENTENSES???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...................WHY\u00A0DO YOU ALWAYS TYPE HUGE SENTENCES???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, the sentence you are reading, this quite long one which I wrote to demonstrate this fact that speaking\u00A0long sentences\u00A0sounds somewhat more sophisticated than a shorter one;\u00A0as opposed to a shorter sentence which can mistakenly imply that a\u00A0speaker wont to forming\u00A0short sentences might not be able\u00A0to come up with\u00A0a more substantial one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sentence is shorter.
