Gravity drag is the second highest dV cost position, after orbital velocity, and is easily five times higher than atmospheric drag. As long as your rocket can still handle max-Q, pushing harder early-on can bring significant savings. (This is true even in KSP, where for example a straight-upward launch still gains efficiency even for increasing TWR beyond 6.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note, though, that the harder early push and the flatter overall trajectory also increases the payload cost for booster recovery.

Absolutely astounding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I think we should see Isp come up a bit due to increased pressure thrust, since the nozzle diameter is unchanged. In other words, the increased flow means the exhaust is now underexpanded at launch. Assuming no increase in actual exhaust velocity, we are looking at a mass flow increase. 846/642 = 132%, so a very broad estimate using the ideal gas law suggests a 32% increase in gas pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can figure out what Isp increase this represents by using the difference between published vacuum Isp and published SL Isp. Assume for simplicity that earlier SL thrust matches atmospheric pressure (even though it probably was already slightly underexpanded). 311 s from 282 s corresponds to a 10.2% increase in specific impulse due to pressure thrust. This suggests that going up by one atmosphere of pressure is a 10.2% increase in mass-specific impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, going up by 32/100ths of an atmosphere is probably going to be a 3.26% increase in specific impulse.

The other issue since this is a trial run for recycling, you kind of want the good publicity of a successful relaunch, and you don\u0027t want to risk that with a overstressed engine failure. If RP-1 is a fraction of the variable cost, and recycling or de-novo production are the primary costs, then you burn a little extra fuel, so what, you still save alot of money on the recycling.
