It\u0027s long, full of infographics, links to videos and gives a few more details that let us guess as to what actually happened. I think that a study that ESA was performing throughout 2014 may have been completed recently. This study apparently looked at the feasibility of concepts that use an engine just like the SABRE. In other words, ESA asked: \u0022if Reaction Engines can actually deliver this engine with these specs, will this actually let us do something useful with it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to that is apparently \u0022Yes\u0022, which is is what the news is about. The article mentions the Lapcat A2, which is a concept for a 300-passenger atmospheric aircraft based on the SABRE engines that will fly at up to Mach 5 and will deliver passengers to \u0022anywhere in the world in four hours\u0022. It looks like a derivative of the Skylon which ditches the spacefaring capabilities for more passenger capacity. It is also mentioned that ESA thinks that the Skylon spaceplane, coupled with an expendable upper stage (I assume for GTO insertions), could cover most if not all of Europe\u0027s projected space launch needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T09:02:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 09:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T15:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFeels like all these small tech sites have scripts set up that read each other\u0027s RSS feeds and when one site posts something, a variant of that is automatically regurgitated by all the others.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh.
