upper, blue part (temperature).\u00A0 We\u0027re all the way at the right edge and, as you can see, things have been relatively constant compared to the rest of the chart.\u00A0 If anything, there\u0027s been a gradual downward trend from a peak temperature about 10,000 years ago.\u00A0 But in the rest of the chart, that same amount of time usually has some serious peaks and valleys, indicating very significant changes in much shorter periods of time.\u00A0 Then note that the recent past appears almost as a wide, solid bar instead of a thin line.\u00A0 This is because in the last 10,000 years or so, the temperature has fluctuated rapidly up and down in very short time intervals around\u00A0an average.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, what\u0027s happening right now

hunter-gatherer and the population was much lower.\u00A0 For most of the 2nd 5000 years, most people on Earth were farmers and the population wasn\u0027t all that much bigger.\u00A0 It\u0027s only been in the last couple centuries that the population has mushroomed and industrialization has become global.\u00A0 But the same sort of short-term, small-scale temperature fluctuation was happening all along.\u00A0 Thus, it\u0027s wrong to say that climate is changing faster today than it has at any time in the past 10,000 years.\u00A0 And it\u0027s also wrong to say that modern human conditions are having a noticeably different effect on climate than back when everybody was a hunter-gatherer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note on the chart that at about 325Kya and 125Kya, it was hotter than it has been at any time in the last 10,000 years.\u00A0 And yet the glaciers came back.\u00A0 VERY rapidly.\u00A0\u00A0Observe the extreme temperature fluctuations between the peaks and their adjacent valley, not just the big ones but also all the little ones.\u00A0 These abrupte changes\u00A0show that the climate of the last 10,000 years, despite the many frequent dips of \u002B/- 4^C, is actually rather more stable than at any time in the previous 400,000 years.\u00A0 .It also shows that nature alone is capable of producting WAY more radical climate swings, one right after the
