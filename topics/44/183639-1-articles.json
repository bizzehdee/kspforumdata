Something very strong vs something very weak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you, with strong enough or rapidly enough applied sources, stop a nuclear blast with bubbles. And how many bubbles how quickly would need to be applied to do so? Would any other techniques work. The nature of the material and nuke are up in the air!! ;d (As in up or debate. They could also be up in the air.) Explosion could be at any distance modify heat and energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, at any point could this be made to work? Materials could also be changed to change the nature of the bubbles or whatever is needed along with nuke and city structure/materials. Anything. Even being as absurd as possible and changing the substance of the earth or atmosphere even. ANYTHING! Although the goal is on earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to be silly about it maybe the bubbles are a person named bubbles. But that would be pretty much mute as you can use any materials already. Good thing I didn\u0027t make the title, \u0022by blowing bubbles!\u0022 \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I know! What if the materials are partially liquid concretes or something that hardens or naturally has a very high heat containing aspects to make thin layers of resistant materials that just get blown apart as it gets heated up? Or on top of this it is blown with massive amount of hydrogen or helium? One of the highest thermal in take materials I saw somewhere was hydrogen but it was flammable. What if you took a missile or other device in abundance and blew some sort of special bubble with hydrogen in the middle and a substance with high heat absorption and blew it in the air so it could absorb heat and blow up as a high thermal absorbing explosion/bubble to counter it? Then on the ground you could have different types from a city water system blowing to help lower it and maybe absorb or deal with other things like radiation for containment if possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the potential for heat capacity and thermal conductivity of magma and natural hot materials in a high heat state. They are already hot in some stages but how much capacity do they have. You could use them in this state to start with. Or assume it will go into such a state. Do any gain attributes at higher levels or already have it naturally. Does the conductivity increase as it heats up. Say something like volcanic rocks or other common earth materials. It would be going against 100,000,000 degree heat already! BTW, how much of the nuke is that hot and how hot is it at smaller points. how does it loose heat etc. Maybe specialized methods could be developed or attributes of it exploitable for instance. Is only a thin layer that hot and afterwords a dramatic reduction or anything? Just the plasma layer or also the inside?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr would this only lead to making a nuke to counter a nuke?! And if so could a specialized one be done with special attributes or other materials used to counter the other nuke without being counter productive? A nuke bubble to counter nukes? Could you get away with less? Hell, if a smaller safer cheaper nuke can be used to counter a bigger more expensive one it would make nukes a little less desirable potentially. Especially if you can make them safer from a radiation standpoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d49TzVF1gmY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-12T05:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2019 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-12T05:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBubbles of melted tungsten could effectively stop the nuke.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPut a thick tungsten plate against the nuke, it melts the tungsten, blows up the tungsten bubbles, then stops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-12T09:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter thinking about this for a few minutes I have decided that probably you\u0027d need such a \u00A0large quantity of bubbles - which are mostly air - to absorb enough energy to dissipate the explosion, that you\u0027d probably end up being at safe-distance anyway.
