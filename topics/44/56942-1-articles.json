There might be an easier way, but this is the way modern physics knows about. So the fundamental idea is definitely possible, even if this particular approach won\u0027t work. (the paper mentions difficulty determining some key characteristics about how a small black hole might behave)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who don\u0027t read the paper, here\u0027s the TLDR :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe starship engine is a black hole emitting 140 petawatts (a 30 megaton nuke going off every second) worth of gamma rays. It is being fed a steady stream of fresh matter to keep the hole the same size. The starship would weigh about 1 million tons, and the engine would just be a (very huge) parabolic gamma ray reflector, with the black hole feeding and movement hardware located where the antenna is on a satellite dish. The reason to do this is that the engine would be insanely efficient, converting mass directly into light, and would also give you a full 1 G of acceleration. You could most likely collect enough interstellar hydrogen to run your ship indefinitely. It would need about 11 grams/second of matter, or 346 tons/year. (compared to 1 million ton mass of the starship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drawback is you cannot turn the engine off, and it is emitting all that energy in the form of gamma rays. I\u0027m not even certain if any amount of shielding you could fit into the ship could protect biological people and leave them a big enough space to live in. The engine must burn forever : if you stop feeding the black hole, it loses mass, and eventually will release all remaining energy in one big flash when the mass is no longer enough to support an event horizon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I find so fascinating about this engine is it\u0027s the only engine design I have ever read about that would really provide a satisfactory starship. Your ship would not be a delicate collection of struts to save mass, and you\u0027d be able to burn the engine all the time without worrying about running out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing could be a real warship : you\u0027d be able to chase down anyone in any vehicle that doesn\u0027t have one, and you\u0027d have plenty of mass for the weapons and armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the other interesting factor here is size. Whatever the minimum size is for a black hole driven ship is, anything smaller than that is trash in a world that had this technology. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final factor that fascinates me : you\u0027d be able to see someone coming in a vehicle using this engine system a long, long, long way away. Probably on the order of light-years. No stealth at all, and since the black hole can\u0027t be turned off, it would be completely impossible to sneak up. (since even if you turn the engine exhaust the opposite direction, you have to vent all that waste heat). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note : since the black hole is electrically charged in order to move it with the vehicle, atmosphere would be Kryptonite to this kind of engine. Once it is no longer charged, the black hole would fall out the bottom of the ship and probably end up in the core of the planet you were to land on. Assuming the black hole cannot eat faster than it loses mass, it would dissipate harmlessly...or it might destroy the planet. Either way, a big problem. Just a funny thought that a million ton starship powered by the mightiest engine imaginable, releasing 5000 times as much energy per second as all of humanity uses today, can\u0027t go anywhere near a bit of wind. The ship would be forced to carry shuttles, that, amusingly, would have a tough time getting back out of deep gravity wells using most engine technologies. You might have to beam power to the ships and use a heat exchanger or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to build one : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou build a big sphere near the sun of gamma rays lasers focused at the same point in the middle. The power to run the lasers comes from solar panels. The sphere is not more massive than other objects humanity has already built, and it is assumed that you have self-replicating robotics which would make the job fairly straightforward. You\u0027d need an asteroid or two to mine for the raw materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the center of the sphere, all the gamma rays will overlap into a tiny point about the wavelength of one gamma ray. Light has mass, and there would be enough mass in one place to generate an event horizon. You\u0027d leave the lasers running for several years as the black hole grows in size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHawking radiation would cause the black hole to emit gamma rays made from the mass inside the black hole. It would emit about 140 petajoules worth every second when the black hole is around the right size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the black hole is big enough to eat small particles, you would feed it a steady diet of electrons and protons in the form of a particle beam aimed right at it. The paper mentions this may be a problem : it is uncertain just how big a particle a black hole in this size range can actually eat. It mentions a couple of work-arounds if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would move the black hole by electrically charging it by giving it an imbalance of charge by feeding it too many electrons or protons. You would now be able to move it using electrostatics or big honking electromagnets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T23:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I read this paper some time ago..

Sure the black hole is bad, but it\u0027s a bright object you can\u0027t lose track of. Though, I am wondering how the heck you could get an \u0022escaped\u0022 black hole back to your ship, since even if you have secondary thrusters to move your ship to the black hole, the darn thing will push you away when you near it. As silly as it sounds, a \u0022practical\u0022 black hole starship might use several separate engines, each with their own BH for redundancy. So it would not be a 1 million ton vehicle, it would be 5 or 10 million or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines would be on unimaginably huge rotating joints, so you could point them at angles to give you the thrust vectors needed to collect an escaped black hole, once you repair the damaged engine. A ship this big would be able to fit the factories needed to make every single part used in itself, so it could remanufacture the broken components to build new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple engines solves another big problem : when you arrive in orbit around a destination planet, how do you load and unload your shuttlecraft? It would be very tricky to maneuver your ship to collect shuttles since you are acclerating at 1 G all of the time. With multiple engines, you just point them in different directions to make your net thrust 0. The only problem now is approaching this ship in a shuttle on a course that won\u0027t expose you to petawatts worth of gamma rays and fry it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that I think you\u0027d use biological humans at all for this kind of thing, but even electronics have trouble with too many gamma rays. Apparently they damage the crystalline lattices used in high density solid state electronics - and solid state hardware sufficiently complex to emulate a human mind would be much, much denser than any electronics humans have built so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter, on the other hand, has to be isolated from normal matter, and to get similar performance to a black hole starship, you would need about 5% of the mass of your ship to be antimatter or more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the real problem with antimatter is it is apparently trash for acceleration and specific impulse, comparatively. A huge amount of the energy is lost because the gamma rays that come out have too much energy, and, apparently, various particles that will just escape will be produced. The antimatter engine proposals on atomic rocket are basically trash for performance, comparatively. They either have good ISP and bad acceleration, or they have great acceleration and bad ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook here : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u003C/a\u003E .

The black hole is giving you an exhaust velocity of 300 million.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is apparently antimatter is horribly energy inefficient to produce. You\u0027d need a much larger power plant near the sun to make the antimatter, and when you run out of it, you are in trouble. With black holes, you could use the energy produced by one to build another one, far away from any star.

That is, the very moment it forms, you have a bunch of equipment built to force more energy in to it to get the black hole above the mass level needed to keep it fed.
