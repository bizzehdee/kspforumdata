The fusion of hydrogen atoms in a \u0027hydrogen-bomb\u0027 is triggered by the heat and pressure waves of a fission explosion usually using the \u0022gadget\u0022 model of nuclear exllosion devices. The gadget model uses plutonium or uranium (typically higher yield with plutonium) in a sphere with a dimpled polonium activator in the cenfer surrounded by specially shaped and bilayered explosive charges which compress the plutonium to supercritical levels. In a hydrogen bomb this gadget is shrrounded by a thin separating layer, then a highly pressurized layer of hydrogen, typically enriched with deuterium, then a strong containing wall and bombshell.

But it\u0027s still dramatically higher than probability of more than two protons fusing together at the same time. And so as slow as it is, it\u0027s the dominant process in a lot of stars.

The early weapons used roughly spherical polonium neutron sources coated in a beryllium reflector that were located at the center of the \u0022physics package\u0022 and compressed with the fissile material to start the reaction. Later designs (as in, 1951 or so) switched to using external initiation with a miniaturized betatron neutron source contained within the bomb case that would provide extremely precise initiation timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReactors are not designed solely to maintain exact criticality (if they were, they couldn\u0027t be started up or shut down), but instead to have highly controllable levels of criticality. During the startup process, a certain degree of supercriticality is maintained to bring the core reaction rate up to full power levels; during a shutdown, subcriticality is created to stop the reaction. The big thing about a weapon is that it goes \u003Cem\u003Eprompt\u003C/em\u003E critical, generating enough prompt neutrons to acheive runaway supercriticality and, rather than have the reaction reach a level of stable criticality, instead just keep generating more and more power until the released energy blows the core apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major aspects of nuclear weapon design that are still \u0022I could tell you, but then I\u0027d have to kill you\u0022 level secrets are things like the precise geometry of the physics package and the mechanisms by which the radiation implosion process for fusion ignition works. That said, I could *probably* construct a highly-inefficient gun-assembly weapon that would yield a fizzle in the 250 ton to 1 kiloton range in my stepfather\u0027s garage, solely using what I know from open-source materials... but now that I\u0027ve triggered a dozen NSA red flags, I\u0027ll specify that I\u0027d first need to get my hands on enough fissile material to build three or four proper Little Boy weapons, and that this is entirely theoretical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for published descriptions of the operation of nuclear weapons in fiction, all of the ones that go into detail deliberately leave out one or two critical steps to make sure that they can\u0027t be used as a how-to manual by terrorists or rogue states... and according to actual weapon designers, there\u0027s one or two items that they\u0027ve kept hidden from all the open-source literature all these years, too, just in case.
