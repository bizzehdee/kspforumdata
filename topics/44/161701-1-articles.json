Why isn\u0027t the moon (Luna/Mond ...) a satellite of earth (Terra/Erde ...) ? I have absolutely no problem with that, i\u0027d just be happy if i get a defintion of moon or satellite. Common barycentre apparently is no criteria fo you if i follow your thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt effectively comes down to whether star or planet pulls harder on the satellite in question. If satellite orbits primarily the planet, the pull of the planet is stronger. That would imply that at least for a portion of the orbit, the satellite is pulled towards the planet, away from the star. As such, if we look at the full orbit of the satellite around the star, it will have a few parts in its trajectory that curve away from the star. This is the case for every moon of every planet in the Solar system save for one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur own Moon does not behave this way. Its orbit around the Sun is almost a perfect ellipsoid, but most importantly, it is entirely convex. At every single point along this trajectory, the Moon is curving towards the Sun, even as the Moon passes between Earth and Sun.\u00A0This is because gravitational pull of the Sun is stronger than that of the Earth. Moon orbits the Sun first and foremost, and gravitational perturbation from Earth are causing it to go to slightly higher or lower orbit, leading or lagging Earth, resulting in relative motion of Moon around Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might seem like a very subtle distinction, and for Earth-Moon system it is, but for an extreme case of this interaction, look at\u00A0Epimetheus and Janus as they orbit Saturn. As they pass close to each other, they exchange orbits, one going slightly higher, the other slightly lower, and they separate again until the faster of the two catches up with the slower, and they swap again. You would never call that orbiting each other. But these two objects are co-orbiting Saturn together in a lot of ways the way Earth and Moon co-orbit the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch classes of behavior prompted a suggestion that distinction between satellite and co-orbiting bodies shouldn\u0027t depend on location of barycenter, but rather on how strong the pull from the star is in comparison to mutual attraction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a follow up example, consider Charon as it orbits Pluto. There is currently a suggestion that it should be classified as a dwarf planet due to the fact that the barycenter is located between Pluto and Charon. However, the mutual attraction between these two bodies is far greater than pull of the Sun on either of them. And with Charon being only 12% of Pluto\u0027s mass, it is clear that Charon does in fact orbit Pluto making it a moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, while no bodies I know of within this Solar system fall under this, there is a very serious potential problem with using barycenter definition as we start looking outside of the Solar system. Consider two planet-sized bodies orbiting each other in highly elliptic orbit. As the distance between them increases, barycenter leaves the interior of the heavier body. So according to barycenter definition, the orbiting body is only sometimes a moon? This isn\u0027t a problem when we look at trajectory around the star. If both bodies have convex trajectories around the star, it\u0027s a double planet. If at least one of them has trajectory that is not strictly convex, it\u0027s a planet-moon system. This is more general, closer to what we understand as concept of orbiting each other, and gives us cleaner classification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason we haven\u0027t switched to this definition yet is because under it, Moon isn\u0027t a moon, and that seems to scare people more than the lack of a clean definition of what actually constitutes a moon. I say screw that.

And two, does that not implicitly make the definition of what\u0027s a\u00A0satellite dependant on the distance to the next major gravity well? In other words, if Mars and Earth would swap places in the solar system, Earth\u0027s gravity would still be just as strong, and but the Sun\u0027s would be weaker, so even if the Moon had the exact same orbit around Earth, it would suddenly curve outwards here and there from the point of view of a solar orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...In fact, isn\u0027t this all a matter of using different reference frames in the first place?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might just be me, but a definition of a satellite that is dependant on the exact orbital parameters, which additionally change with the distance to the sun, and/or which reference frame you decide to look from, sounds rather impractical and flawed.

Compound this with the very varied lifetimes of stars and all sorts of counter-intuitive results will emerge.
