Relative velocity is your friend, as it increases the potency of any kinetic weapons you have and makes you vulnerable for less time. Just as in modern war, outranging your opponent provides you a tremendous advantage. If we\u0027re only concerned with engines with Isps on the order of thousands of seconds you may see hyperbolic engagements, but orbital mechanics are not totally irrelevant. I doubt boarding will be a likely occurrence, since any ship carrying cargo worth boarding for also has the capability to thoroughly destroy itself, and likely anything within boarding range of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, one major difference between terrestrial war and space war is the element of surprise.

Additionally, any powerful weapons and/or propulsion systems will likely be detectable far beyond weapons range, making surprise attacks difficult and rare\u00A0but not totally impossible.

If missiles need to actively evade anti-missiles or point defense, they probably have weaker \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, much smaller size, and higher thrust to weight than ships themselves, with less delta-V. Is it possible to force a missile or a constellation of them to burn through it\u0027s finite delta-V by doing slow, stay maneuvers after it\u0027s launched?

The question is, if you spam missiles that lead the target in different directions can they intercept further away than the one missile can. And can you ever force missile intercepts against more maneuverable opponents, or at least deny them a risk free intercept on you. With individual KKV missiles or salvos of them that aren\u0027t coordinated into constellations I can\u0027t see them actually extending the force intercept range and the range at high relative velocity should give the more maneuverable ship a free shot before breaking the intercept of the less maneuverable one. But if you start talking about dumping, e.g. 500 kkvs that each maneuver to lead the target, I\u0027m not totally sure how that will affect the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trivial situation where ships joust at much higher relative speed than the delta v of the missile, and there is only one missile per target, gives the more maneuverable ship a completely safe undodgeable shot with parity missile specifications. If you plug some actual numbers you see that just burning through a 4 km/s missile\u0027s entire reserve of delta-V at 4 G (remember this is probably an NTR or something, so that\u0027s quite a strong engine) takes 100 seconds.

Because someone can just do low thrust high efficiency burns to evade the missile at that point and it\u0027s virtually guaranteed the missile doesn\u0027t hit because the ship can bleed it\u0027s fuel to nothing. As for being able to apply meters per second of delta-V and evade a missile with it, I don\u0027t see how this is the case.
