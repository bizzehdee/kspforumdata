However, this isn\u0027t so much about black holes as it is about their effects. As you may/may not already know, black holes are so massive that time dilation near them is extreme, to the point the universe ends as you reach the event horizon. Also, of course, the closer you get to the black hole, the more time is dilated for an observer. Now my question is, is there ever a point where small differences (think about a foot or two) have significant differences in time dilation? This would mean that possibly different parts of your body would age with considerably different rates, with stuff happening like (if you fell head first) the cells in your legs dying so quickly that your legs decay and other fun stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

Your feet will feel more time than your heart/lungs, so your heart rate slows down a good deal from their view. The blood coming into that region, and going out from it, corresponds to the upper body\u0027s time, not their own time, so if the feet see 10bpm heart rate, they will get maybe a sixth of what they expect, bloodwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, the head will see maybe 80bpm, (just a rough guess around a 60bpm normalish heart rate. Probably it will be abnormally high considering the circumstances (unless your name is Jebidiah)). This would make it so that the brain gets more blood passing through it. The middle heart region maybe should get good flow rates, but it will be probably extra oxygen depraved or enriched based on how fast it is going elsewhere. Your heart will also be processing blood faster than your lungs should receive it. Depending on the circumstances that may be able to be overcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this make sense?

Changes in time is tied to other physical things in general relativity. If you change just time and neglect other things you can lose conservation laws and many other very basic properties of our world. To tell exactly you should define exact assumptions and calculate. If you just neglect things probably you get answers that some part of your body responds slowly or \u0022feels odd\u0022. And if dilatation is high, you die.

Overall energy scales in general relativity is very high. For example if blood would disappear at some rate comparable to flow in veins, that would cause enormous energy imbalance. Would that energy just disappear or would initial assumptions of our modified physics lead to some kind of energy conversion?
