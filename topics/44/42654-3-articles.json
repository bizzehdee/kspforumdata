Light is a horrible, horrible way to do that. The MIRACL laser can produce about 1 megawatt of beam power over 70 seconds giving it a total energy transfer of 70 megajoulle. A 10kg slug only needs to travel at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev = sqrt ( 2 * E/m) = sqrt (2*70*10^6*10^-1) ~ 3.8km/s to contain the same energy.

If you want to hit a large area you just fragment the slug a short time before impact, or you leave it intact to trash a small area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll you need to ward off a laser is a large heatsink on the surface that can take some heating. That MIRACL laser on a full 70 sec duration outputs enough energy to boil about 200 liters of water (starting at room temperature). So if you are in a spaceship you just make the water tanks cover the hull. This is beneficial due to radiation shielding anyway.

You\u0027re also carrying kinetic kill missiles and multi-megaton nuclear missiles. You have an efficient fusion drive that can do 5 g\u0027s even with a full fuel load, and that\u0027s carrying enough fuel to burn for a solid 24 hours. There are colonies on the moon, mars, and in orbit around venus, and asteroid mining - but you and others like you are on station because there\u0027s also been some incidents of space piracy, and people need rescuing sometimes, and to keep the colonies from turning into lawless frontiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething is seen boosting for earth from the asteroid belt; they tried to hide the burn by making it a long slow orbit that only burned when Earth was on the far side of the sun, but they didn\u0027t know you have automatic detection gear in orbit around Mars. According to your computers in 6 months\u0027 time it\u0027s going to pass near Venus; course projections say that another burn there would let it pass through Earth\u0027s vicinity at a high relative speed 4 months later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the rate of delta-V your detectors caught it was only able to burn at 2 g\u0027s; your coast guard cruiser can out-manuever it easily.

Whoever tears out the enemy\u0027s life support/control computer first wins. In point of fact, the WW2 air warfare analogy works on almost all levels - you\u0027re trying to get the drop on your enemy, and if that fails, kill him as quickly as possible using short maneuvers and unguided weapons, with little more than radar support from the ground (or your base station). The only armoured vehicles would be base stations/carrier ships, but they would also be poorly armed - unguided kinetics only really work in space if you can maneuver fast enough to track your enemy, and deflection-shoot far enough ahead to hit him. They would rely on swarms of fighters/drones to do the actual combat - finish off the enemy\u0027s fighters, then finish him with something a bit bigger (though I doubt anything nuclear - too risky for you, and not terribly effective without a medium for blast pressure to propagate through).

The more efficient drives burn even hotter and are more easily detected, and usually have to be left running for hours or days to make major orbit changes; but even the relatively weak space shuttle main engines could be detected from Pluto with current technology if you had sensors aimed at earth during the right 10 minutes.

Power systems always eventually result in heat directly proportional to their power output, and you can\u0027t just throw away heat into the surrounding space via conduction or convection. Between power systems to keep your crew alive, power systems to operate your electronics, and power systems to operate your weaponry (if not chemical-rocket missiles, which goes back to detectable by seeing the exhaust) you have at least kilowatts of heat to radiate away, and more likely on a warship mega- or gigawatts.

If this was possible, we wouldn\u0027t be having so much difficulty looking for asteroids that present danger to us. The only reason radar works so well here on Earth is that the distances are so laughably short. Say I have a ship 50m across 1 light minute away. I\u0027m going to look for it using a dish or an array that\u0027s 100m across.

First, in terms of IR and visible lasers. The idea there is that while mirrors can be used to reflect anything you throw at them, mirrors of sufficient quality will be heavy. If you are talking about something like missile defense, covering entire missile with high quality mirrors is just not practical. Best you can do is cover them with some foil, and sufficiently powerful laser will get through that. So an IR laser can be used to shoot these down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are talking about something like ship-to-ship combat, things get more complicated. Here, covering ship with mirrors is much more plausible. At least from direction you expect attacks from. The solution is going into UV and soft X-Ray where mirrors just don\u0027t work. This, of course, brings up problem of building the actual laser. There are several solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Forget the mirrors. Make lasing medium long enough to lase on a single pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build a loop. Soft X-Ray can be reflected at small angles, making it possible to loop around in multiple reflections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these are going to result in something rather large. Probably not suitable for actual ship-to-ship, but could be used as orbital defense or something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you can forego an actual laser. You don\u0027t really need a laser beam. Just any old beam with sufficient energy density will do. And if you need a really powerful beam of soft X-Ray or hard UV, the best way is to build an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eundulator\u003C/a\u003E.

Power systems always eventually result in heat directly proportional to their power output, and you can\u0027t just throw away heat into the surrounding space via conduction or convection. Between power systems to keep your crew alive, power systems to operate your electronics, and power systems to operate your weaponry (if not chemical-rocket missiles, which goes back to detectable by seeing the exhaust) you have at least kilowatts of heat to radiate away, and more likely on a warship mega- or gigawatts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, what possible reason would you have to put crew on a combat spacecraft? They\u0027d just be a liability. Your ship would be bigger, heavily, slower, more vulnerable, less stealthy, require vastly more support and be able to keep station for a lot shorter time if you manned it. No combat spacecraft will ever be manned. Even if you were talking about combat somewhere beyond Earth\u0027s orbit you\u0027d still be better off providing a human in the loop from a remote location that was within an acceptable control distance (eg: under 10 light seconds). Absolutely no need to have them riding in the actual combat vehicle pressing the trigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think a small robotic combat spacecraft cruising with most systems powered down would present a large thermal signature. Spacecraft are inherently low power. One that had a low thermal signature included in the design from the start should have no problem being quite stealthy. I think this alone would rule out the idea of large \u0022warship\u0022 type combat space vehicles. They\u0027d just be too easy to find compared to small ones. FWIW naval combat on Earth has already gone this way. The advent of small, fast moving stealthy vehicles with powerful weapons (aircraft) has already forced warships to become as small as they practically can.

ProjectRHO, Ken Burnside describes weapon lasers as blast furnaces that produce coherent light as a byproduct. Rick Robinson describes them as an observatory telescope with a jet engine at the eyepiece. Laser cannons are going to need seriously huge heat radiators. And don\u0027t forget that heat radiators really cannot be armored. Any serious laser cannons or batteries are going to generate vast amounts of waste heat, limiting you to firing only a certain number of times before you and your crew burn up. Even unmanned ships would have to stop at some point, electronics and base materials can still melt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with that in mind, you can either armor yourself up and take a beating, waiting to get in range for missiles, kinetics, and or your own lasers. Most vessels might want to draw in their radiators when they can actually be shot up, to avoid overheating later on, so your limited to whatever your internal heatsinks are. So you can just saturate any point defense units with kinetics or missiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to counter the lasers themselves, with other lasers.
