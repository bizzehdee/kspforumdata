Both rockets will have the same dV. But that\u0027s not what the Oberth effect is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oberth effect says that it is a more efficient use of dV if you burn while going fast. It has to do with orbital energy, to quote myself on the matter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EOberth is rather hard to explain without indulging in some math.

So if you go 10 times as fast you contain 100 times as much kinetic energy. This is where the Oberth effect gets important, since the rocket always has the same amount of delta V regardless of velocity. As you say, the rocket doesn\u0027t care how fast it goes.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESay your rocket has 10m/s of delta V. If start out stationary you start with 0 m/s and end with 10 m/s. Thus giving you 100 units of kinetic energy.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENow imagine that your rocket starts out at 100 m/s. After your burn you\u0027re moving with 110 m/s. This means your burn gave you 110^2 - 100^2 = 2100 units of energy.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAs you can see you gained way more energy than from the stationary burn. Normally this is just a matter of reference frames, from the perspective of a train moving at 100m/s along your rocket you still only gained 100 units of energy. But when you include a gravitational field things get interesting because an orbit is a constant exchange of potential energy and kinetic energy. As you fall closer to the planet you lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy and vica versa. Your orbital energy is always constant and equal to your kinetic energy relative to the planet and your potential energy. So if you want the maximum bang for your buck you need to fire your engines when you go fastest since this increases your kinetic energy the most.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EA \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wF6pBViU6ws?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E would be the old party trick with a tennisball and a basketball that drop at the same time. When the basketball hits the ground it bounces up and hits the tennisball causing it to fly much higher than your initial drop height. When you go down (Fall to periapsis) your spacecraft consists of both the basketball (fuel) and the cargo (tennis ball).

It\u0027s not really an effect at all, but instead is an observation based on two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1. Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2. Reaction drives that carry their reaction mass with them have a fixed amount of velocity change rather than a fixed amount of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe observation is: The faster you are going, the more a change in speed changes kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 should be familiar to anyone who\u0027s done high school physics. For most Earth-bound drives, it means that the faster you are going, the harder it is to accelerate further. Going from 10m/s to 11m/s costs 10.5 joules/kilogram; going from 100m/s to 101m/s costs 100.5 j/kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 is what changes everything, and confused even rocket scientists at first. If you can exchange a given amount of fuel for a given velocity change, you change the kinetic energy by a larger amount if you do the velocity change at greater speed. Using the above numbers, a 1m/s prograde burn adds 10.5 j/kg at 10m/s, but adds 100.5 j/kg at 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are used to thinking about delta-V in our mission planning in KSP, but the truth is that it\u0027s really specific orbital energy change that is important, that gets us to our destinations. The amount of delta-V a given vessel has is determines by its mass ratio and engine efficiency, but we can extract more orbital energy change from that delta-V through clever use of the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of delta-V as the currency we use to buy a change in specific orbital energy; the Oberth effect lets us buy it at a discount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConservation of energy is observed because the expended propellant (exhaust) changes kinetic energy by exactly the opposite amount of the ship. The Oberth effect allows more energy to be exchanged between ship and propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGatesofLogic","CreatedById":58468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T17:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eefficiently, it takes more energy to do it EFFICIENTLY.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
