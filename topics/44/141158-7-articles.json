To get back to the parking lot requires a boostback burn to\u00A0get the rocket travelling in the opposite direction, back to the launch site. This requires a surplus in propellant, which the Falcon 9 doesn\u0027t have for GTO missions. It has enough fuel to decelerate and land, but not to boost back to the launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the extra propellant for landing, parachutes are actually heavier. Parachutes could not land you precisely enough to aim for\u00A0the space center\u0027s parking lot, especially if you are descending slow enough to not damage the rocket. Parachutes (especially large custom-built ones) are expensive to make, to check,\u00A0and to pack. And most importantly, parachutes will not slow you down to 0m/s and 0m altitude. They will land your fragile rocket at a constant velocity, around 20m/s, which is going to break it unless you add even more weight for airbags, retro-rockets or super strong legs, all of which are more complex and heavier than the small amount of extra propellant needed for a soft landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-16T06:10:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2016 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T14:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222633002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466054211\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111598\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFerret\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, LordFerret said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E who makes those statements.

To get back to the parking lot requires a boostback burn to\u00A0get the rocket travelling in the opposite direction, back to the launch site. This requires a surplus in propellant, which the Falcon 9 doesn\u0027t have for GTO missions. It has enough fuel to decelerate and land, but not to boost back to the launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the extra propellant for landing, parachutes are actually heavier. Parachutes could not land you precisely enough to aim for\u00A0the space center\u0027s parking lot, especially if you are descending slow enough to not damage the rocket. Parachutes (especially large custom-built ones) are expensive to make, to check,\u00A0and to pack. And most importantly, parachutes will not slow you down to 0m/s and 0m altitude. They will land your fragile rocket at a constant velocity, around 20m/s, which is going to break it unless you add even more weight for airbags, retro-rockets or super strong legs, all of which are more complex and heavier than the small amount of extra propellant needed for a soft landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s not really \u0022a small amount of propellant\u0022. It\u0027s on the number of several Tons. Parachutes aren\u0027t really heavier, just harder to reuse and more complex, going against a lot of SpaceX philosophy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I wonder if it would be possible for a barge to \u0027catch\u0027 the rocket from a parachuting rocket by moving quickly around.
