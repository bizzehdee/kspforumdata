Those have control over the rotor to rotor line by varying the blade angles on either side of said line. Cyclic control could make two engine situations survivable, however the cost and complexity would be exorbitant. Technically doable, though. RC helicopters existed already in the 80s, probably earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224413053\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221722959700\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes its two out but I assumed the reminding two would reduce the velocity it was falling at greatly reduce damage to drone and target under, 3rd rotor could help keep it balanced but this would require it to be able to run in reverse.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnless you have that i think it would be hopeless unstable pretty soon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the rotor could run in reverse, you would lose all torque control in that situation and start rotating wildy around the vertical axis. Another unsurvivable scenario right there. You simply need at least four and an even number of fixed rotors working to have control of the flight attitude. You can replace one rotor by adding tilting on another, but the total number of moving mechanisms stays the same. Plus you complicate the math, add to the count of different parts required and one rotor needs to be connected via a moving joint. All things conspire to make four rotors the optimal number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-07T09:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there spray on products to patch holes in spacecraft hulls due to micrometeorites?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume epoxy works in space since the hardener is part of the mix.\u00A0 But, I\u0027ve never seen spray on epoxy.\u00A0 I believe it could work.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about spray foam like great stuff?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anything like that been tried?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-07T11:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224413227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221723023531\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there spray on products to patch holes in spacecraft hulls due to micrometeorites?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume epoxy works in space since the hardener is part of the mix.\u00A0 But, I\u0027ve never seen spray on epoxy.\u00A0 I believe it could work.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about spray foam like great stuff?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anything like that been tried?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Something like this was used in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Expanse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand many other sci-fi movies and books.\u00A0 It would be hard to conceive that someone out there isn\u0027t trying to make it real.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Expanse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E, every compartment on the Martian warship had an emergency sealing kit in a box on the wall, iirc.\u00A0 In many sci-fi stories EVA suits either have a sealing kit attached or are magically self-sealing if compromised\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would need to work in a vacuum or at normal pressures and at extreme temperature ranges.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat or one would select the correct \u0022tube\u0022 of stuff for the situation (I\u0027m picturing a caulk gun like thing that can take different types of products, or dual ganged squeeze tubes for binary content dispensing).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything for use in a pressurized hab env would need to not outgas toxic fumes too much or at least not beyond the ability of life support filtration to remove\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-08-07T12:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/duct-tape-saves-day/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.nasa.gov/image-article/duct-tape-saves-day/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
