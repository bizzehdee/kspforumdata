The Pentium has two cores, the i5 has four, and neither have hyperthreading. There are a few other differences but they\u0027re relatively minor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running a single program that\u0027s not been designed to use multiple cores (ie is \u0022single threaded\u0022), and its performance is limited by the CPU (and not the graphics card, the hard drive, or anything else) both processors will do about the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running a single program that has been ideally designed to use multiple cores (ie is \u0022multi threaded\u0022), it will run about twice as fast on the i5 as on the Pentium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running three or more programs, even if they\u0027re individually not designed to use multiple cores, then you may get better performance from the i5 than the Pentium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for hyperthreading, well think of it as adding an extra \u0022half-core\u0022 to each regular core. An i3 has two cores with hyperthreading (and most i7 are four cores with hyperthreading). Running a program or combination of programs that uses three or more cores, the i3 will do somewhat better than an equally-clocked Pentium but somewhat more worse than an equally-clocked i5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s talk about your system.

So it\u0027s that \u0022single thread rating\u0022 you need to look at for KSP. Your current processor is about as good as anything you\u0027ll get that fits in the same CPU socket in this respect. If you have a good motherboard (and with that chip you probably do) you can try overclocking it, which will probably bring you a 20 to 40 percent speed boost. If you do go for overclocking there are plenty of guides around, but make your first step giving your PC a good clean-out with some canned air so that its cooling is running at top performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs regards a new PC, I suggest one with the Pentium G3258 \u0022Anniversary Edition\u0022 and a motherboard using the Z97 chipset. That particular Pentium is \u0022unlocked\u0022 which helps for overclocking; the Z97 motherboards are also best for that. Even at stock speeds it will be about twice as fast on single-thread speed, which is what matters for KSP, and equal or better with your current processor on multi-threaded speed. Overclock it and it\u0027ll play KSP as well as anything and do a fine job on most modern games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA complete budget gaming system will probably run \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3500-600, I can\u0027t speak for prices in Poland. If you want to keep the cost down you could just get a new motherboard, processor, and memory, and maybe CPU cooler, that\u0027ll cost you about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3200 or so. You may need to buy a new copy of Windows (because \u0022OEM\u0022 copies aren\u0027t valid if you upgrade the motherboard), so another \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3100 for that, or alternatively install Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T00:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHonestly, not a lot of software makes use of multi-core.

There are two things that happened. First, amount of physical memory has skyrocketed. Every process has to have a chunk of memory dedicated to it. But you can easily run more processes that you have memory for. That\u0027s because addressing happens in virtual memory, rather than physical. Anything that doesn\u0027t fit in the physical memory is written to the disk in the page file. When processes switch, page file might have to be accessed. If there is a lot of data there, that can take a while. This is the biggest reason why sometimes a window appears to freeze when you switch to/from that window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other factor is that there have been a lot of improvements in Windows kernel and drivers. Linux machines never really suffered from these problems to begin with. Nor did general code under Windows. You can write \u0022while(1);\u0022, and that will not slow down your computer for a second. Why? Because that infinite loop can still receive an interrupt at any moment. So your PC can switch to and from a task caught in an infinite loop just like any other. In general, it doesn\u0027t matter if your process is doing something important, idling, or stuck in an infinite loop. You can switch to/from that process all the same. Though, you can save OS a bit of time by using sleep() calls, since it tells OS that it can skip switching to this task for a while. For example, it\u0027s often a good idea to have sleep() in your code when window goes out of focus. Unless, of course, it\u0027s meant to do some background computations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason programs would freeze, temporarily or permanently, is because it\u0027s possible to set a flag on CPU that prevents interrupts. However, only kernel or driver code can actually do that. There are some technical reasons why you don\u0027t want to interrupt some of the driver code. And a lot of Windows drivers have been just written as one big no-interrupt block. That means, if there is an infinite loop there, such as an error in a piece of code that\u0027s supposed to wait until some buffer is ready, your entire computer freezes. This has been a huge problem with W95/98 code, and has been steadily improving over the past decade as Microsoft has changed a lot of their paradigms on kernel design and driver licensing. In big part, because these sort of problems weren\u0027t plaguing *nix platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I do seem to recall a way to ask Windows not to switch tasks during a certain block of code. It\u0027s relevant for some sensitive call-backs, like buffer switching in audio playback. But I\u0027m pretty sure that it\u0027s either completely in software, or OS does the interrupt switch for you. Process level code physically shouldn\u0027t have access to the no-interrupt flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T14:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
