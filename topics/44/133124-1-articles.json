Having room for the rotor is more of an constrain and this was why it used the\u00A0shack for loading or unloading.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor probes it might be more useful especially in setting where you ned to stand pretty upright like if you want to unload an rover, it could also be build far simpler just using the suspension in the landing legs. first legs just flex, then 2-3 hit the ground they lock and the rest of the legs continue to move downward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSgt Baloo","CreatedById":154529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T20:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding probes in uneven or steeply sloped terrain would be easier if we had landing legs that weren\u0027t all the same length when deployed, but adjusted as they made contact with the ground, so as to maintain an upright stance. ISTR someone had made such a mod for landing legs, but I can\u0027t find it anymore. Even the lunar landers had some provision for uneven terrain, although it just amounted to shock absorbers and springs in the L/G. For winged aircraft, even rotary-winged ones, it\u0027s less of a concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T20:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SSgt Baloo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T21:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole jointed-leg thing seems unnecessarily complicated.
