I only bothered writing the prologue and then got too busy to continue it. Now that I have more free time I have made it up to chapter four but I won\u0027t be in town for two weeks so I can\u0027t continue the mission in KSP (you know, it\u0027s a story based on a mission).

The same company that did the rabbit kidney experiment actually did freeze a slice of brain tissue. The problem is, ice crystal formation is strongly related to the speed at which you freeze an object. For a thin slice, you can spray coolant directly on the slice and get it to cool extremely quickly (which is how that company did it). In fact, there\u0027s a method for preparing neurons for viewing with an electron microscope that basically involves dropping them directly into liquid nitrogen. This method causes the least damage and leaves very clear and intact internal structures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you need to cool a whole brain at the same rate as dropping a few cells from that brain directly into liquid nitrogen, how can you do it? Find a solution to this problem and you can probably make cryotubes work. I don\u0027t know of any method that is likely to work, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method that cryonicists - people who freeze the recently deceased in the hopes of future revival - expect to work involves a complete rebuild. They think you would need to tear the brain down and scan it at the molecular, maybe even atomic level. One method to do this is you slice the brain into 50 nanometer slices using an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/science/connectome-project/atlum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EATLUM \u003C/a\u003E(a very thin slicing saw that does exist today) and scan each slice with ~1000 beam electron microscope (a 192 beam model exists today). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scanned brain would be emulated with a supercomputer built of custom brain emulation chips, similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wired.com/2014/08/ibm-unveils-a-brain-like-chip-with-4000-processor-cores/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis \u003C/a\u003Eone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, any brain emulation supercomputer built with near future technology is going to be gigantic - probably office building size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the brain you are emulating did fit into your skull - so a ~1 kilogram computer that consumes approximately 12 watts of electric power is theoretically possible.
