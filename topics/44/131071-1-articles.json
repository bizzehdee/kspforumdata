At the same time, they evaporate only very, very slowly even in vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some applications, where you need really high quality vacuum, ionic fluids are used instead of regular oils. These are fluids that consist of two kinds of ions with opposite charges. As a result, they have almost zero vapor pressure. If a molecule tries to leave ionic fluid, it\u0027s pulled right back in by the resulting electric charge. So they effectively do not evaporate in vacuum. They are, however, more expensive and have narrower temperature range. I think it\u0027s going to be simpler and cheaper to just refresh the mineral oil in the seal every once in a while on a space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving rebuilt quite a few vacuum pumps its a bit of a different situation, Vacuum pumps actually create a dynamic equilibrium, which would not work well except most good lab pumps have dual stage. The vanes on a vacuum pump aren\u0027t really designed to capture all gas, just most of it, as the gas finally reaches the second stage it cant get back to the first, and once it is expelled to the second stage the gas is heated, expands floats up and effectively its not capable of reversing. The reason these pumps work like this is that rotary pumps can remove alot of gas before kicking into the second stage, and BTW is you put your hand over the outlet, it will get sprayed with oil, on most of the pumps I used for flash evaporation I had to build a muffler to trap the oil, oil may not be volatile, but when you are through putting couple litters a second it is quite atomizable. If you turn a vacuum pump off without releasing the vacuum, the oil and some gas will go back up the tube, thus the application of energy is essential to keeping the vacuum. In this space application the separation of pressure needs to be more passive, but I suspect they probably have a secondary seal and a pressure monitor with a backup evacuation system (along with pressure doors somewhere close by). Technically speaking the ISS setup does not even need to hold pressure while turning, the could simply pressurize the bearing while stationary transfer the naut and close the pressure doors on both sides, then depressurize the ring seal. That toroid needs a ballast anyway, just put a purificaiton system in there. Non-inertial or not that vessel is not an effective barrier cosmic radiation and x-rays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe had a vacuum pump that was just barely able to boil water at ambient, it got to the lyophilization limit, when I took it apart I found one vane had a rusted inelastic tensioner spring and the other vane was stuck. Not ideal of course, but just goes to show that a good position dynamic equilibrium (that is turning those vanes rapidly enough). The biggest bane to vacuum pumps is moisture or acids in the vanes, they swell up either freezing the pump or freezing the vanes in the retracted position. The way to prevent this is to every now an then dump a couple cups of vacuum pump oil down the inlet to sort of wash god-only-knows-what through the pump, then turn it off quickly, wait a while and drain the heavies from the bottom of the pan. Things like ether rapidly reduce the viscosity, on the low pressure side they can bind to the oil despite high volatility and vacuum pump is nothing if not viscous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vacuum pump on an ultracentrafuge is a diffusion pump, it is almost completely a dynamic process, horribly inefficient but reasonably compact and suitable for circumstances were limited through put of volatile fluids is expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T04:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably start with a labyrinth seal to significantly lower the pressure difference, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E use one of the solutions listed above.

For all we know, we can fight bone loss with medication and exercice. We\u0027ve proven that people can live on the ISS for over a year. By the time we ever need long duration spaceflight, we might have pushed that limit to two years or more...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even if it is necessary, why bother when you can rotate the whole spacecraft. You\u0027re going to introduce a whole slew of fragile parts that need replacing and maintenance (seals, lubricants, etc...), along with a whole bunch of new failure modes.\u00A0I know it looks cool (like wings on a spaceship), but rotating segments are\u00A0just another solution looking for a problem. Keep it simple !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T08:24:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
