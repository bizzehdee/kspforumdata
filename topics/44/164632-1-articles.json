One is single stage, and the other is multistage. (These aren\u0027t accurate numbers, just an example) The single stage rocket\u0027s dry weight is 250 pounds, with another 750 as fuel. The first stage of the rocket weighs\u00A0dry at 250 lbs, with 500 being fuel, and the second stage is 100 lbs with 150 being fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe single stage rocket, once it has finished burning 500 lbs of fuel, has to use the rest of the fuel to lug push rocket which it can\u0027t just seperate from. The multistage rocket though, once it has finished burning 500 lbs of fuel, simply seperates, (and lets just say it is a Falcon 9 and had some extra fuel for landing) then lands to be reused. The second stage,\u00A0unlike the single stage rocket, jettisons all of the extra weight and can use the rest of the fuel to push a lighter weight, and get more delta-v than\u00A0the single stage rocket with the same amount of fuel, because the single stage rocket wasn\u0027t given the change to jettison extra weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTell me what you think and if my argument makes sense.

Less than 3. Less than the A4/V-2 mass ratio.\u00A0Of course, you need an engine with just as much isp on the ground, or averaging 1000s during the ascent. But with a mass ratio of e, and current high propellant mass fraction tank designs, even with a heavy engine setup we could get significant payload mass fractions. For a 500 Tonne rocket, empty mass would be about 180 tonnes. About 36 tonnes of that would likely be tankage (and that might be a stretch, considering that shuttle ETs were about 27\u00A0tonnes empty at their lightest). That gives us about 144 tonnes for engines, structure, and payload, guidance, and so on. 50 tonnes of payload shouldn\u0027t be impossible, seeing as an Atlas V can get more than 10\u00A0with inefficient chemical engines and something around 300 to 400 tonnes of rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalving exhaust velocity squares the required mass ratio for a given Delta-v.

One is single stage, and the other is multistage. (These aren\u0027t accurate numbers, just an example) The single stage rocket\u0027s dry weight is 250 pounds, with another 750 as fuel. The first stage of the rocket weighs\u00A0dry at 250 lbs, with 500 being fuel, and the second stage is 100 lbs with 150 being fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe single stage rocket, once it has finished burning 500 lbs of fuel, has to use the rest of the fuel to lug push rocket which it can\u0027t just seperate from. The multistage rocket though, once it has finished burning 500 lbs of fuel, simply seperates, (and lets just say it is a Falcon 9 and had some extra fuel for landing) then lands to be reused. The second stage,\u00A0unlike the single stage rocket, jettisons all of the extra weight and can use the rest of the fuel to push a lighter weight, and get more delta-v than\u00A0the single stage rocket with the same amount of fuel, because the single stage rocket wasn\u0027t given the change to jettison extra weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation presented is naive and doesn\u0027t represent the actual situation you would have with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, thus gives a bad comparison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy give them equal weight? The constraint on launch is cost. You can always throw more engines on it. Given the complexity of staging, by removing a stage, you immediately save money that can increase the thrust, and therefore just add more fuel (which has negligible cost so we can effectively throw as much in as we need). You also don\u0027t have to pay for the second stage\u0027s engine, allowing a way bigger rocket for the same cost, and a much larger relative amount of fuel to rocket\u002Bpayload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven a vertical launch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, yes, this would give a bad payload fraction - but payload fraction\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emakes no difference\u003C/em\u003E. Are you getting the payload up there? For the same or less cost? Then the rocket is superior to the two-stage it\u0027s potentially replacing, as it\u0027s definitely more reliable for having less failure points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVertical launch on Earth doesn\u0027t quite work for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E due to fuel performance, as LH2/LOx didn\u0027t live up to Tsiolkovsky\u0027s predictions, and ozone/fluorine/FOOF oxidizers turned out non-viable on practical sides. It is technically possible, but the margin is too small for you to convert the staging costs into fuel well enough to make a good return. It does, however, only need a small improvement to be quite viable.

Up to 450 seconds at 9500-10000 m/s doesn\u0027t work, 570 at 9500-10000 does. Okay, what about 450 seconds at 6500-7000? Just quick back of the envelope, 10000/570 is nearly 18, 7000/450 is about 15.5, so if you could reduce the orbit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement, then you can get back into comfortable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E territory, with a little bit of margin to play with to attain that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reduction. We need to take off 3000 m/s - 1500 m/s is often taken from gravity losses quite early just getting up to speed, so if we can start at some altitude and non-zero speed we get that down to 1500 remaining to take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1500 is just over mach 5 - can we get our non-zero speed to be 1500 m/s? Turns out, possibly, with fancy enough engines! This is why IRL SSTOs are generally thought of as spaceplanes, as they would need to fly up to speed \u0026amp; altitude on lift and airbreathing power. But, given how little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reduction is actually required compared to the total, less than a third, in order to put \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E in a comfortable area, there are potentially engines that can airbreathe that fast, that can work on current technology rather than finicky scramjets.

There\u0027s always the potential to improve it by adding stages, even if the mass ratio required is only 1.5 - but do you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0want to pay for two stages to make it 1.3 overall, when you could just stick with one stage at 1.5?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an additional note, it\u0027s really not that hard to get an engine that\u0027s efficient across the whole range. There are even flown examples of bell nozzle engines of both hydrolox and kerolox that pretty much equal or beat suggestions for altitude compensation like aerospikes across the whole range, at high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor hydrolox, the RS-25 SSME gets near-optimal performance at all altitudes, and has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 68.5 - one of (or the?) highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of any hydrolox engine ever made. Is expensive to operate, but the RS-25 arguably came at a bad time before much computer aid could be used in the design; hydrolox is a very gentle fuel, as shown by the consistent reliability and refire-ability of the RL10, and there\u0027s really no reason its performance shouldn\u0027t be possible to match on an engine that is much easier to maintain with modern design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor kerolox, there\u0027s the NK-33 and -43, and the whole RD-171, -180, -191, -193 family, which have a surface-level impulse that beats the vacuum impulse of many or most kerolox engines, for some of the highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0ever observed on any type of rocket. The only two engines that can beat the NK-33 for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E don\u0027t come close to it in impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless of fuel choice, a\u00A0high-performance engine in both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and Isp, across the whole range, is entirely possible. This is the basic requirement of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E - the second is simply to pull the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirement down to where the fuels available to choose from can do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-26T17:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2017 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-26T17:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223157926\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164632\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503766712\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222116\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iskierka\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Iskierka said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation presented is naive and doesn\u0027t represent the actual situation you would have with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, thus gives a bad comparison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy give them equal weight? The constraint on launch is cost. You can always throw more engines on it. Given the complexity of staging, by removing a stage, you immediately save money that can increase the thrust, and therefore just add more fuel (which has negligible cost so we can effectively throw as much in as we need). You also don\u0027t have to pay for the second stage\u0027s engine, allowing a way bigger rocket for the same cost, and a much larger relative amount of fuel to rocket\u002Bpayload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven a vertical launch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, yes, this would give a bad payload fraction - but payload fraction\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emakes no difference\u003C/em\u003E. Are you getting the payload up there? For the same or less cost? Then the rocket is superior to the two-stage it\u0027s potentially replacing, as it\u0027s definitely more reliable for having less failure points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVertical launch on Earth doesn\u0027t quite work for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E due to fuel performance, as LH2/LOx didn\u0027t live up to Tsiolkovsky\u0027s predictions, and ozone/fluorine/FOOF oxidizers turned out non-viable on practical sides. It is technically possible, but the margin is too small for you to convert the staging costs into fuel well enough to make a good return. It does, however, only need a small improvement to be quite viable.
