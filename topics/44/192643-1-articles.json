You could also have a moon in an \u0022orbit\u0022 that just goes up and down through the middle of the hole. Both of these options are probably quite unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other interesting things about the donut planet that aren\u0027t explicitly related to orbits:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMapping is nice. Not only does the left side cross onto the right on a rectangular map, but the top and bottom are connected too! There\u0027s still some distortion around the edges, but you can get around that by having separate maps of the outer and inner regions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe outside and the inside of the donut, which we named the Outer and Inner Circles, respectively, have some distinguishing properties. They are separated by the North and South Circles, which are analogous to Earth\u0027s poles except that they are long loops instead of spots. Seasons and daylight on the Outer Circle work just like they do on a sphere (for reference, we decided to give this planet about 45* axial tilt, you\u0027ll see why it needs more than Earth in a moment).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossing over to the Inner Circle, though, we encounter some very odd changes. First of all, timezones are phase-shifted by half a day! So you\u0027ll have to change your clocks by 12 hours going over the poles. Nighttime occurs when the Sun is behind the ground, but a lot of the ground is actually in the sky now! That\u0027s problematic because if the planet has low axial tilt, most of the Inner Circle won\u0027t ever get any sunlight! This is why we gave the planet high axial tilt. The Inner Circle is still in darkness during the spring and fall equinoxes, and thus is likely much colder than the Outer Circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, when you\u0027re in the Inner Circle you can see the other side of the donut hole above you. The horizon actually has negative curvature when you\u0027re looking to the equator, and positive curvature when looking to the poles! During nighttime you can see the part of the Inner Circle that\u0027s in daylight above you, so most of the time the night is quite bright.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis effect is even noticeable in the Outer Circle. The polar radius of the planet is quite small, even smaller than Earth, but the equatorial radius is enormous. Thus, if you\u0027re standing on a mountain looking around on a clear day, you\u0027ll be able to see extremely far in the equatorial directions, but a very short distance in the polar ones. Standing on the inner edge of the poles, you\u0027d be able to see that walking longitudinally you\u0027d go in a big circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-26T18:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the truth is we can\u2019t treat real planets as spherical - they\u2019re not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTerms like the J2 term are used to describe unequal mass and geometrical distributions as alterations to the point mass model.
