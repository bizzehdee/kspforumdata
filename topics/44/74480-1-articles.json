Forget about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe middle atmosphere, however, is quite pleasant. At about 50 km up, above the sulfur-clouds, you find abundant sunlight (the clouds block sunlight from reaching the surface), atmospheric pressures of around 1 Earth atmosphere, and a useful mix of Nitrogen, CO2, and aerosol droplets of Sulfuric Acid- which can serve as an easy source of hydrogen for water and rocket propellant...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell-known processes exist for preventing acid-corrosion of metals (relying on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathodic_protection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECathodic Protection\u003C/a\u003E, for instance), and already see regular use here on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, in Venus\u0027 middle atmosphere, Nitrogen-Oxygen gas mixture is lighter than the surrounding air (which still contains large amounts of CO2, for instance), and thus acts as a lifting gas- allowing easy development of floating cities that use their breathable air to keep equivalent density with the surrounding atmosphere (for greater density, smaller supplementary balloons of less dense gasses could also be deployed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has lead a NASA researcher (Geoffrey A.

This, combined with Venus\u0027 much greater scale-height, and the much greater availability of energy for solar beamed-power, means you could ascend much of the distance to orbit from 50 km aerostats without requiring any actual internal propellent...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus\u0027 atmosphere at 50 km has many of the elements necessary for life in macro-scale quantities: Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulfur, and Carbon- as well as abundant solar energy (not only is a great deal of energy available from above- the cloud layer is so reflective a nearly equal amount of sunlight can be obtained by aiming solar panels *down* at the clouds below... (this also opens the way for potential use of two-sided solar farms)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these factors (minus the bit about Thermal Turbojets and ascending back to orbit) added together led to the idea of such a set of floating cities in Venus\u0027 upper-atmosphere being nicknamed \u0022Landis Land\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rather interesting idea- and the closest we\u0027ll probably ever come in real life to the \u0022Cloud City\u0022 of Bespin in Star Wars... Except instead of Tibanna Gas refineries, we might have asteroid-refineries (it actually takes LESS Delta-V and time to reach the asteroid belt on a minimum-energy transfer from Venus than from Earth, due to Venus\u0027 higher orbital velocity around the Sun and the Oberth Effect) and mining of surface deposits with advanced robotics technology (conventional circuit boards melt at those temperatures, so one approach being looked at is micro vacuum-tube designs for computers...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E/EDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027m going to point everyone at this blog post as well, because it\u0027s very high-quality and has a lot of useful links.

It\u0027s quite useful considering Venus\u0027 atmosphere contains huge amounts of CO2 (a much higher partial-pressure than Mars), and the Methane you produce is lighter than the surrounding atmosphere- making it relatively useful as a safe (combustion isn\u0027t much of an issue in Venus\u0027 atmosphere, which lacks free Oxygen) filler for uninhabited balloon envelopes for the aerostat-cities...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already discuss the savatier process in the previus topics, so I knew about that, but it does not change the fact that get water is not so easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you dont want only to survive there, you wanna grow up as civilization.
