When even a modest space rock might meet demand for metals like platinum or gold for centuries, it is little wonder storytellers have long fantasized that to harness cosmic riches could make, and break, fortunes on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with no way to bring much ore or metal down from the heavens, new ventures that have backing from some serious - and seriously rich - business figures, as well as interest from Nasa, will focus on using space minerals in interplanetary \u0022gas stations\u0022 or to build, support and fuel colonies on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may be gold up there, but the draw for now is water for investors willing to get the new industry off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernments believe it has a future; Nasa has a project that may put astronauts on an asteroid in under a decade and on Mars in the 2030s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if the costs seem high, grumblers are told that one day the new skills might just save mankind from sharing the fate of the dinosaurs - if we can learn how to stop a massive asteroid smashing into Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We are dreamers,\u0022 declares the website of Deep Space Industries (DSI), next to an image of a wheel-like metal station hooked up to a giant floating rock.

Most dramatic of all, the company sees a \u0022harvester\u0022 craft heading out in 2019 to capture and divert the most promising asteroids so that they settle into orbit around Earth by 2021.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn these, Gump said, DSI would try to make propellant and mine nickel and iron to make the building components for new structures in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If we are successful producing resources in space then it makes what Nasa wants to do, which is going to Mars, that much less expensive,\u0022 he said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It costs a lot of money to launch everything from the ground.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetary Resources plans to send telescopes into space to study asteroids between Earth and the Moon. In a later phase, it will send out craft carrying deep-space lasers to gather data on some of the thousands of more distant asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022By 2020 we will have begun processing asteroidal material in space, and we will have our first interplanetary fuel stop,\u0022 Planetary Resources\u0027 Anderson said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A mission can leave the Earth and stop by the trading post and gas themselves up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while commercial gain from asteroid exploration is drawing investors, the rest of humanity also has an interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA shift in climate caused by a big asteroid strike may have killed off the dinosaurs and Nasa is taking the risk of another such impact seriously enough to go looking for similar threats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mining expert Blair put it: \u0022For survival of the human species, we have to address the asteroids, or they will address us.
