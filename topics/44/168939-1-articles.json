The efficiency to get those ratios at a given speed will be\u00A0 determined by the propeller pitch, RPM and airspeed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have to remember that thrust off a propeller is like lift off a wing, if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E (see image below) is too high or too low the propeller will fail to generate thrust.

At high speed the pressure builds in front of the blade, but you need to move a larger volume of air (but because you are traveling at high altitude a lower mass of air per volume) the pitch of the blade increases due to the speed of the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nblade relative speed = SQRT(AS^2 \u002B (wr)^2) along arctan (As/(wr)) relative to the axis of rotation. If the blade speed is held constant and AS increase the blade relative angle of the wind increases. The force vector generated by the blade is the coefficient of lift * the area * the relative speed, however the lift vector is not always point the same direction. The optimal angle of attach is less than 17 degrees relative to arctan(As/wr) and more than 8 degrees; direction vector of the blade relative speed is typical in the teens at the start of the flight, thus the pitch is in the degree 20s. As AS increases the direction vector of the blade increases, and thus the pitch also needs to increase. Remember that energy is force over distance and power is energy/time. So over a unit time we want force applied with as large a volume passing between the blades as possible. Its the blades travel through the wind per unit time as well as the pitch of the blade so that while it appears that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is everything, if you can get higher blade travel relative to the columm of air moving across the propeller, then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E needs to come down, it will create less drag anyway.\u00A0 That blade needs to advance to increase that volume up to the point where the motion becomes turbulent, then the blades are turning the air and not pushing it around in the blades plane of rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022450px-Lift_curve.svg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022369\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Lift_curve.svg/450px-Lift_curve.svg.png\u0022 width=\u0022450\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo prevent this from happening you need to keep the blade below a certain RPM and the Angle of Attack (relative to blade relative flow direction vector) in the linear range (away from the top of the curve). Turbulence around the blade and vibration one of the most feared enemies of high flying propeller type aircraft and so the closer to mach the more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E and other factors (RPM, engine imbalances, firing rotation, etc) add up. Since the blade is always at an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to the wind, except when feathered, the blade tip will always encounter the Mach effects before the blade relative airspeed reaches Mach speed. Blade tips, wing tips and other peripheral structures of aircraft do not like Mach Effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does this differ with Turbine, in turbines the air flow is pressurized and slowed down, because the air is moving slower and under pressure the Mach effects are postponed to much higher speeds, finally after pressurization the air is fed out a restrictive outlet increasing its speed markedly and creating a reaction momentum capable of moving the craft closer to the speed of sound or beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, one way to think about the curve above is to note at the highest charted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E above change to non-linearity, that change is something most pilots don\u0027t think about and want to avoid, but what it is, is one of the most effective airbrakes on the aircraft, that deviation is pretty much drag friction. Inertia converted to vertical lift is returned when the aircraft falls, the horizontal component of lift vector is deceleration as an airfoil \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E tilts up past 13 degrees both drag and lift in the plane of motion increase, this can be used with great caution to rapidly slow a moving aircraft to a speed such that as long as the aircrafts vertical motion is negative (otherwise a full stall will occur). And it surprising that you can actually put an aircraft going down into a semi-stall, and it will actually slow down and fall faster. Its one of those situations where the set of airflow aprioris are more determinant than the average analysis would predict, it works well for fast moving aircraft bacause there is alot of energy to be transformed by slowing down and speeding up wind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the tricks I used to do on FS is to slow a bit roll up an aircrafts nose to just about 15 and roll very slowly up\u0027 and wait for the vertical motion to lay the aircrafts VS to negative, then begin to drop the nose as ascent angle decreases as the ascent angle increases you can get closer to a full stall (its impossible to be in a stall with the nose pointing strait down while the plane is falling so the closer you are to that fall vector the easier it is to pull out of a stall, but the faster you will need to do so), at some point you basically are in a controlled fall and throw out flaps as IAS falls, gear, spoilers .\u00A0 . . .its more or less like an albatross trying to land. But once you are a certain elevation, say 3000 feet, spoilers come in nose drops speed increases lift increases VS stabilize. No need for ILS on this approach you can pick your picnic spot on the runway waiting for the MGH to burn off. If it were a real plane I can only imagine the puke flying around in the passenger compartment. On a typical jet aircraft you can increase the loss of inertial energy by 10 fold over a normal descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the point is that unless your are planning to exploit stall turbulence, its best to stay clear of it,\u00A0 alot of power lost in the stall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-29T08:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m actually liking the idea of monoprop powered atmospheric engines.
