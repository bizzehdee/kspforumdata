The most common recovery methods are parachute and streamer. The parachute is usually blown out by the engine\u0027s ejection charge, which pops off the nose cone. The parachute is attached to the nose cone, making it pull the parachute out and make a soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatherweight recovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest approach, which is appropriate only for the tiniest of rockets, is to let the rocket flutter back to earth after ejecting the motor.

Any rocket that will enter a stable, ballistic trajectory as it falls is not safe to use with tumble recovery. To prevent this, some such rockets use the ejection charge to slide the engine to the rear of the rocket, moving the center of mass behind the center of pressure and thus making the rocket unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENose-blow recovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother very simple recovery technique, used in very early models in the 1950s and occasionally in modern examples, is nose-blow recovery. This is where the ejection charge of the motor ejects the nose cone of the rocket (usually attached by a shock cord made of rubber, Kevlar string or another type of cord) from the body tube, destroying the rocket\u0027s aerodynamic profile, causing highly increased drag, and reducing the rocket\u0027s airspeed to a safe rate for landing. Nose-blow recovery is generally only suitable for very light rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute/Streamer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA typical problem with parachute recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachute/streamer approach is used most often in small model rockets, but can be used with larger rocket models given the size of the parachute greatly increases with the size of the rocket. It uses the ejective force of the motor to deploy, or push out, the parachute or streamer. The parachute is attached to the body either directly, by means of a ripcord, or indirectly, when it\u0027s attached to the nose cone, which attached to the body by a ripcord. Typically, a ball or mass of fireproof paper or material is inserted into the body before the parachute or streamer. This allows the ejection charge to propel the fire-proof material, parachute, and nose cone without damaging the recovery equipment. Air resistance slows the rocket\u0027s fall, ending in a smooth, controlled and gentle landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlide recovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn glide recovery, the ejection charge either deploys an airfoil (wing) or separates a glider from the motor. If properly trimmed, the rocket/glider will enter a spiral glide and return safely. In some cases, radio-controlled rocket gliders are flown back to the earth by a pilot in much the way as R/C model airplanes are flown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome rockets (typically long thin rockets) are the proper proportions to safely glide to Earth tail-first.

The helicopter recovery usually happens when the engine\u0027s recoil creates pressure, making the nose cone pop out. There are rubber bands connected to the nosecone and three or more blades. The rubber bands pull the blades out and they provide enough drag to soften the landing. In some rockets, the fins are used as the blades as well. In these, the ejection charge pushes a tube inside that has tabs sticking out of the rocket that hold the fins during launch. Then the tab releases the rubber band-pulled fins than pivot up into helicopter position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T00:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UpsilonAerospace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UpsilonAerospace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, breaking the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nar.org/NARmrsc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENAR safety code\u003C/a\u003E (rule 10) is punishable with a fine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all rather depends on the country you are in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T00:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore quick calculations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a 5:1 TWR, Total Rocket Mass must be a maximum of 122.48 grams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine weight: 24.7 grams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the assembled rocket (without motor) must weigh under 97.78 grams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute design tips.

They\u0027re nice because they\u0027re made of quality materials, and will withstand many launches (my most-flown parachute has more than 30 launches on it). You might make one out of plastic bags, but they generally don\u0027t work as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the NAR safety code, I have never seen a rocket that \u0022returns safely and undamaged and can be flown again\u0022 (direct quote!) without a parachute on a C motor. There\u0027s a first time for everything, but I\u0027ve seen at least five B- or C-motor powered rockets auger into the ground in a very unsafe way that is generally frowned upon. It\u0027s possible to safely return a rocket to the ground without a parachute, but I wouldn\u0027t do it my first time... or my second time... or my third time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T02:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UpsilonAerospace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UpsilonAerospace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, breaking the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nar.org/NARmrsc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENAR safety code\u003C/a\u003E (rule 10) is punishable with a fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a paracute, however, it remains unused, and the rocket returns unharmed and can be used again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerpenWolf","CreatedById":83222,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T03:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually looking into making a two stage model rocket that uses a Arduino micro with an accelerometer for staging, I\u0027m probably going to Need to check the local laws first though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T11:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m actually looking into making a two stage model rocket that uses a Arduino micro with an accelerometer for staging, I\u0027m probably going to Need to check the local laws first though.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou actually don\u0027t need that for staging, you can use the ejection charge of the previous stage to ignite the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T13:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou actually don\u0027t need that for staging, you can use the ejection charge of the previous stage to ignite the next one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, unless DerpenWolf staging composite model rocket motors (which I assume he\u0027s not.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere, have a good newsletter on how to stage model rockets!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.apogeerockets.com/Tech/How_2-Stage_Rockets_Work\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://www.apogeerockets.com/Tech/How_2-Stage_Rockets_Work\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T21:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll right. First of all, I strongly recommend downloading \u003Ca href=\u0022http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOpenRocket\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s an open source simulation program for model rockets, and it allows you to verify that your rocket will actually be stable, etc. Unstable rockets are VERY dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for TWR, you generally need to be moving at least 13 m/s at the end of the launch rod/rail for the rocket to be stable. With a \u0027C\u0027 engine, you will most likely use a launch rod about 1 m long. This means that your rocket must accelerate at 85 m/s^2. Add 10 m/s for the force of gravity, plus a safety factor, and your rocket needs a minimum TWR at launch of 10. If your motor produced constant thrust, your rocket would have to weigh less than 61 grams. Fortunately, real rocket motors do not produce constant thrust. According to this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thrustcurve.org/motorsearch.jsp?id=21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.thrustcurve.org/motorsearch.jsp?id=21\u003C/a\u003E the C6 has a \u0022spike\u0022 of much higher thrust at the start of its burn, with a maximum thrust of 14.1 N. With a real thrust curve, simple math won\u0027t allow you to predict how heavy the motor can safely lift. However, my simulations show that the maximum safe liftoff mass for a rocket with a C6 motor is about 100 grams. With a low-drag rocket, an ejection delay of 5 seconds is appropriate for this mass. However, higher-drag designs may require you to use C6-3 motors instead. Again, get OpenRocket and simulate your design before you build anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T22:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried out OpenRocket, and it seems as if the rocket I had designed would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere would be the specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength: 24 cm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Diameter: 2.54 cm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass with motors: 58.1 g\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApogee: 425 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Velocity: 122 m/s (Jeez, Mach 0.36)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s stable.

To avoid losing the rocket, make sure that you keep your descent relatively fast (minimizes wind drift and time spent at out-of-sight altitude). For a rocket that size, you can probably land safely with a streamer instead of a parachute. The streamer should also be either highly reflective or a bright color such as fluorescent orange, for maximum visibility both in the sky and on the ground. For the vast majority of rockets, the deployed parachute or streamer will have a much larger cross-sectional area than any other component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, for larger (and more expensive) rockets you can take other measures to making losing the rocket less likely. For example, personal keychain alarms are compact enough to fit in many low-power or mid-power rockets, but loud enough to be heard from over 100 feet away. While rockets often land farther away than that, if a rocket lands in tall grass being able to locate it by sound is very useful if you know the general area. Larger rockets may disperse colored powder or smoke for better visibility in the air, and be equipped with radio transmitters or even GPS modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
