In general, the toughest armor on a tank is on the front. If a tank had to round a corner to engage an enemy, it could turn its turret to fire, but its weaker side armor would be exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hovering tank wouldn\u0027t need a turret because of its ability to side strafe, keeping its strong front armor facing the enemy. It could move effortlessly across any form of terrain and even across water. Its ability to cross water would allow it to rapidly deploy on beaches without the need of naval transport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Leaving aside the potential problems with the actual hovering bit, the whole issue with urban warfare is that you can\u0027t assume your enemy will be in front of you. A vehicle with thin side, back, and top armour in an environment where every window or rooftop could harbour a guy with an RPG is a spectacularly bad idea. Vulnerable thrusters/rubber skirts/sidewalls/impossibly powerful magnets/throatwarbler mangroves are just the icing on the cake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T23:10:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kryten\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qeveren","CreatedById":10381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T23:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGround-effect vehicles are too fragile, unmaneuverable, and terrain-limited to be useful in urban combat.
