They either warp the fabric of the universe, speed up a ton(in the looser sci-fi like Star Wars), or go through a wormhole of some sort. I wanted to be original. Well, I realized I remembered seeing something about a relationship between time and speed, like when you go close to light speed you appear to be moving \u0022slow\u0022 to everyone else. I looked around for a while and found that both gravity and velocity strengthen the time dilation effects. And then it hit me! Why not use anti-gravity(assuming you DO have it, in sci-fi you normally do) and make time dilation reverse, shooting your spaceship through time? You\u0027d have to freeze the crew members or something, as the trip would likely be LONGER for them, but Earth wouldn\u0027t have to wait a hundred thousand years for it\u0027s starships to send the \u0022we made it and we\u0027re okay\u0022 message to prove it was worth it.

For your antigravity, you need some kind of exotic matter we don\u0027t have yet in sufficient quantities. For the ship to move at apparent FTL from the point of view of outside observers, you need to be able to manipulate spacetime in front of the ship quickly enough.

As you said, the crew would need to be frozen though, as awakening during transit would mean you live out decades or even more during transit, while on the outside it looked like a few hours/days to travel to your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, you could theoretically have a bubble inside a bubble. If you can create a \u0022faster time\u0022 bubble, why not a \u0022slower time\u0022 one to? So if the ship is going really fast, the crew inside could be in a \u0022safe\u0022 area in the bubble. It could also be used for shielding, slowing down incoming projectiles. It would also mean little to no communication while in flight (possible but hard) and dangerous transit if someone launched an escape pod during flight. Perhaps the escape pod only crosses the border of the bubble for a few seconds, but inside the pod days go by...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T18:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aliens franchise\u0027s FTL actually does this, time speeds up for everyone on the ship hence the reason why they need cryo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T00:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why?

The time dilation effect isn\u0027t huge, and you do get around quick. But for far distances you would want hibernation. Heck, just always use it. It\u0027ll take a decade nearly to get to the nearest star system, so it would be a good idea.
