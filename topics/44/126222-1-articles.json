A dark matter galaxy is an oxymoron. If stars are circling a core, then its a galaxy. The claim is that the relative mass is much higher than the visual would predict, based on estimating the velocity vectors of marker stars.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T14:53:00Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027llanthas\u0027]Occam\u0026#39;s razor is gonna come down hard on this.

I simulated a galaxy collision in Universe Sandbox 2 and it left both black holes with nearly no stars orbiting each. The mass of the cores didn\u0026#39;t change of course. It could also have formed very massive, or it used to be larger and something sapped the stars of their orbital kinetic energy and they became part of the black hole.
