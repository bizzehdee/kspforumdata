Its development has been pushed back in order to concentrate on Ariane 6.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdeline is basically a tiny, propeller-powered plane that detaches from the 1st stage booster, and flies itself back to a runway on a launch site- recovering not only the 1st stage engine (like Vulcan) but also the entire engine bay, and the rocket\u0026#39;s avionics.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough it apparently reduces payload capacity by 10% (which is fine, since Ariane 6 is pretty big, and can carry all future GEO/GSO satellites in the near term future, its primary destination) it recovers 80% of the 1st stage cost (or at least it\u0026#39;s supposed to- though looking at the cost for the Atlas V first stage [[url]http://i.stack.imgur.com/aY2w2.jpg][/url] , I\u0026#39;m going to take this with a grain of salt:wink:.)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T06:50:45Z","Content":"\nI doubt it.
