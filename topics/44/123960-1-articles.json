Optimally, you\u0027d have a mothership with a powerful nuclear-electric power generator of some type. Best way seems to be aneutronic fusion where you decelerate helium ions escaping from the reaction for direct power conversion, but if that never ends up being workable, you could use a conventional nuclear reactor to pump hot sodium in a circle and extract energy from the moving sodium directly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, the reactor is heavy, and then there\u0027s all those heat radiators and the radiation shield. There\u0027s also no convenient place to \u003Cem\u003Eput\u003C/em\u003E the reactor on a lander - you have to have this big heavy radiation shield as well, and you want part of the shielding to be distance, so the reactor should be on a long boom away from the astronauts. Just doesn\u0027t work for a lander design though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your lander has a \u0022roof\u0022 of a microwave receiver array. You have a larger array on the mothership beaming power to it. You use some kind of efficient but also lightweight electric thruster. I read that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoplasmadynamic_thruster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMPDs\u003C/a\u003E are a good way to do it, because the thruster itself is very lightweight and simple, and you only need it to work for about 10 minutes on landing and ascent and then you can rebuild it in the machine shops on the mother-ship. Maybe a few hours of total burn time if you are using the shuttle to ferry materials to and from the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou use hydrogen as propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
