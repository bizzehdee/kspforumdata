The organization believes that they can at least provide $300 million dollars (a third of which provided by Dennis Tito) and have so far been unable to convince the US government to invest the extra ~$700 million or so dollars. Despite this I still think that they may be able to pull the mission off with the $300 million (or at least reasonably close to it). I think I have a few reasonable ideas on how they might be able to pull this off but I want you guys to yell at me when something won\u0027t work and be sure to suggest ideas of your own!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpected requirements:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Life support lasting for 501-589 days depending on the launch date\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-About 1360 kg of dehydrated food stuffs (Noting this as it is a known required payload mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Reentry capsule with a heat-shield that can survive \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Additional module of some kind probually for living, life support, and other key things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Heavy lift vehicle that can get everything on a trans-martian orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Some way to do small adjustment maneuvers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat I\u0027m thinking about:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter pondering some of this stuff for awhile I realized that SpaceX may actually be able to provide Inspiration mars with two essential components of the mission, the capsule and the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The Falcon Heavy is expected to start flying in 2015 and is expected to be capable of delivering around 14,000 kg on a trans-Martian orbit which might be enough to pull the mission off in a single launch if weight can be kept down. I think that the expected launch cost is about $100 million but I\u0027m not certain on this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The Dragon Capsules (either variant assuming that they are going to be very similar in construction) should be able to survive up to two years in space (meaning that the seals wont go bad or something like that, life support wont last nearly as long) in addition to that we know the dry mass of the dragon 1 should be about 4200 kg and has room for about 6000 kg to orbit. I have no idea what the exact specs of the dragon 2 (any data on it is massively appreciated) but I\u0027m assuming the mass of the thing will be about 5500kg or so. Dragon 2 is the preferred capsule as it has the Draco thruster package that works as a launch escape system as well as pre installed propulsion system that I assume could be used for course adjustments. My main concern is that a custom heat shield might be required, not sure on this though do to conflicting data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pretty much leaves us with the extra module that will be holding pretty much all of our life support, supplies, and other various things with an allowed mass of about 8500 kg. (we probually have spent about $170 million on the launch and dragon capsule, leaving $120 million left to be spent) Now I\u0027m Assuming we can probually make a pressurized tube to fit all of this stuff inside for about 3500kg (this estimate is based off of what a striped down dragon capsule might weigh if you removed a lot of unneeded mass, ie, heat-shield, other junk). So now we have about 5000 kg of mass left and we know we need at least 1360 kg of food so that gets brought down to about 3640 kg left to work with. The question is that enough for everything else? (recycling systems, water, etc. Preferably packed in such a way to provide a good amount of radiation shielding)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of this rough idea? Possible?
