Although this one is a static platform it seems.\n\nEdit: Nvm, I reverse search that and found the thing. Make sense. I remember they use such mobile platform for planting wind farm out in the ocean. So using a similar one for launching rocket is possible.\n\nSeems like the manga use that as an inspiration, even.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T18:53:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T18:49:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That looks almost exactly like the ship from manga.
