You have a pair of virtual particles. One will fall into the event horizont, the other will become hawking radiation. But why? Why can\u0027t both particles just be hawking radiation. Because if you wan\u0027t virtual particles to actually do anything useful (like being hawking radiation), you have to invest energy into it. The energy-invest-mechanism at the event horizont is the virtual particle falling into the event horizont. The black hole loses the energy in the process in the exact same quantity as if it just would have created the hawking radiation out of energy. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E There\u0027s not actually an energy transfer in the black hole. 99\u002B% of the time, both particles fall in or both particles escape. But if the aintparticle falls in first, the black hole is some immesurably tiny amount smaller and the particle escapes easier- conversely, if the particle falls in first, the black hole is more massive and more likely to absorb the antiparticle, canceling out the virtual particle growth. This tiny imbalance in favor of particles escaping over antiparticles is what causes hawking radiation, not \u0022energy transfer\u0022 past an event horizon.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T12:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting caveat follows- if the amount of power you pump into the Cannae/EmDrive did not lead to more virtual particles appearing (in actuality, it\u0027s theorized to do precisely* that), then you would get exponentially declining Thrust/MW due to the equations above. Luckily, pumping more energy into a space *IS* theorized to increase the generation of virtual particles- though once again unless using twice as much power led to twice as many virtual particles, I would expect Thrust/MW to decline (reaching an ultimate limit at the efficiency of a photon-drive) the higher the power-level you put into the system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe efficiency of a Cannae/EmDrive should indeed reach a limit of that of a photon-drive, as some people have stated: but they are incorrect about the relationship- a Cannae/EmDrive should reach a MINIMUM efficiency equivalent to that of a photon-drive when it is accelerating the virtual particles to the speed of light.

I think the system becomes more efficient at corralling and accelerating particles that it can resonate with, that\u0027s all. Virtual particles according to uncertainty should come and go out of existence in complete spontaneity. Or lets just put it another way a 16W resonator is not likely to put enough strain on space time to alter the appearance of virtual particles, a quantum singularity that becomes unstable might \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the accelerations are not via a nozzle, the particles are being accelerated by some sort of inductive resonator but if they approach the speed of light, they will gain virtual mass and slow down, which can also be push against since the push is EM in nature the reaction force can act over space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, though, you can generate changes in momentum with mirrors in space. There are these things called Solar Sails- have you ever heard of them?

You can point a photon-drive any direction you\u0027d like, but a Solar Sail can only accelerate you in a combination of six directions: prograde, retrograde, normal, anti-normal, or radially outwards from the Sun (but NOT radially inwards)- all assuming a circular orbit around the Sun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solar panel takes ~40% of a photons energy and delivers it for whatever purpose, a mirror captures less than 5%. If a solar panel uses its energy efficiently in could convert up to 50% of the energy gained into acceleration of the space-craft. This means ~20% could end up in acceleration.
