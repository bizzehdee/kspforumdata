Actually, calling it an upgrade isn\u0027t really fair - building the LHC was more like building a completely new accelerator in the LEP tunnel. I don\u0027t how much it cost to dig out the tunnel in the first place, especially compared to the cost of all the actual equipment that goes in there but I\u0027m thinking it was still quite a cost saving for CERN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Chinese accelerator will need to start from scratch, so even allowing for lower labour costs, I\u0027d be surprised if the eventual costs are close to $10 billion.
