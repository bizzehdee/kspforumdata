Since WW2, only Korea, Falklands, Indo-Pakistani wars, and Iran-Iraq come readily to mind. Of those only Korea had anything like AWACS used in theater. I discount the wars of Israel because while the numbers say \u0022peers\u0022 the results are very lopsided. Rest of the candidates either feature only little air warfare or so large imbalance of forces that the AWACS could fly about their mission unthreatened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly,\u00A0 because AWACS are a very high value asset so they are protected accordingly. In case it or anybody else detects an incoming enemy that just might be a threat to the AWACS, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E in range will abandon their current mission to protect the AWACS which itself will move to evade the aggressor. Therefore, as to attack an AWACS the enemy needs to commit a very large force against a very large force, a serious attack on an AWACS is barely distinguishable from general offensive counter air warfare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRussia, and Soviet Union in its time, has developed some very long range air-to-air (and lately surface-to-air) missiles. Those have been dubbed \u0022AWACS killers\u0022 in public despite being more important for intercepting bombers over the vast swathes of Siberia. Other nations haven\u0027t really bothered, and as the Soviets and Russians haven\u0027t fought peers since the Sino-Soviet border conflict theirs haven\u0027t shown their true effectiveness either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I believe had the cold war gone hot, plenty of AWACS and other C3I planes would have got shot down on both sides in short order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-11T13:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224075925\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641902003\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022monophonic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, monophonic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbecause large-scale air conflict between peers is very rare\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168061-ars/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168061\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168061-ars/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ARS\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAWACS systems don\u0027t fly over contested airspace.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey fly high and see far to help first tier militaries gain and maintain and extend air superiority.\u00A0 Only (until recently, and because of proliferation) top tier militaries have the ability to penetrate deeply enough into the controlled airspace to threaten AWACS...
