There were 2 main proposals to the SLS Advanced Boosters. One was Dynetics, which would have used 2 RP-1/ LOX boosters to power the rocket.\n\nThe other, which was chosen, was a Carbon-Fiber SRB called \u0022Dark Knight\u0022, but used a different, higher ISP SRB fuel than the Shuttle SRBs (They needed more power; the Block II requirements pushed the limits of SRB Tech). This is similar to the FWSRB proposal. (The new boosters also look pretty badass:![Z313.jpg](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Z313.jpg)"}]}
