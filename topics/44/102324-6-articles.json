Both, rather than trying to do the whole job themselves, are taking additional energy from surrounding systems, and are using their input energy to manipulate that, rather than to provide energy directly. Thermodynamics only say that energy cannot be created - but that\u0027s never what we measure with efficiency of some useful device, we measure the energy we are required to provide directly compared with the energy resulting. If we have some nice trick where some ambient energy gets added alongside input energy, then that\u0027s a helpful thing we\u0027ll take and is entirely capable of putting measured efficiency above 100%.\n\nThinking of another thing - how efficient is wind propulsion? It requires some energy to manipulate and hold sails, but one human is enough to control and move a several-tonne boat at potentially speeds of over 10 m/s. That boat is receiving at least dozens of kW of propulsive energy, possibly hundreds in some cases, yet the only \u0022input\u0022 to the system, from the human perspective of what we need to put in, is less than 100 W or so. That\u0027s somewhere between a hundred thousand percent to possibly tens millions of percent efficient. Because we can steal ambient energy from the wind, but that\u0027s not our energy, so we don\u0027t need to consider it as part of the propulsive efficiency. And then if you simply tie the sails off, and stop actively sailing, you can genuinely make it infinitely efficient.\n\nSo if we\u0027ve had the capability to make infinitely efficient systems for thousands of years, perhaps we should stop asserting that a system of 120% is impossible? It\u0027s perfectly acceptable to question how, and I did initially think \u0022is that possible?\u0022 on reading it, but I continued reading, and saw what was meant, where excess heat from other systems can be used to allow reduced direct input. Any claim of efficiency \u003E100% should be questioned, but don\u0027t automatically assert it\u0027s impossible when infinity is possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T13:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T13:33:54Z","Content":"My\n\nMajor problem with electric cars are their terribly inefficent batteries.

It will use hydrogen.\n\u003E \n\u003E The only that hydrogen needs is wait not more than 5 to 7 years to some technologies reach the market.\n\nYou forgot to account for the fact that at a dedicated electrolysis facility, which is what you\u0027d want for this perfectly \u0022ideal\u0022 hydrogen supply for your fuel, you\u0027d also be dealing with the same 6.6% transmission loss and, the same loss from the renewable plants, and the same pollution from fossil fuel plants, as you would from a battery-charging source.\n\nIf the renewable plants are storing their energy in hydrogen fuel cells and this is more efficient than gigantic batteries, then your stated efficiencies for their storage losses for electrical energy are clearly flawed. Their storage losses are going to be *identical*, because they are the same facility whether they send out the power as a hydrogen-oxygen mix or as electrical energy.\n\nThen we can realize something else: the price of getting the fuel mixture to the fuel station is *not* simply the cost of electrolyzing the water. This is why accounting for the cost of electrolysis and temporary storage for the hydrogen car, while caring for the transmission losses for the electric one, is truly nonsensical.\n\nWhen you deliver the hydrogen to the station, it is either by direct pipeline or by a truck with a large, pressurized tank. This tank has a limited size, and as others have pointed out, hydrogen, while being very energy-dense when it comes to mass, has a rather low volumetric energy density (you need a much larger volume to contain an equal amount of energy, basically, and the main limitation on these tank sizes is volume at this point). Both of these introduce further losses to the system, because you are either constantly building these expensive, insulated pipelines that aren\u0027t even economical on this scale with high-density fuel that doesn\u0027t have issues with boiloff, or you\u0027re delivering it by a truck that, by the way, needs to be fueled, which means it needs an extra-large fuel tank, further cutting into the volume of hydrogen that you can transport.\n\nYour transport, and distribution losses for hydrogen, just in the form of it boiling off into the air, account for an estimated 10% losses *eventually*, when we master the art of it.\n\nElectrical transport and distribution losses, as you\u0027ve said, are 6.6%, right now.\n\nTell me again, how is 10% better than 6.6% loss?\n\nThen again, you do ridiculous things like here:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...=1#post1799538](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113563-Electric-or-hydrogen-cars?p=1799538\u0026viewfull=1#post1799538)\n\nThe article, [http://www.nature.com/news/1998/030609/full/news030609-14.html](http://www.nature.com/news/1998/030609/full/news030609-14.html) that you link here literally confirms that it\u0027s an ozone-depleting chemical that will worsen ozone depletion if we move to it.

There are other losses involved here too, of course. Which means, no, it\u0027s not a good choice *right now*. And the entire issue is about *right now*.\n\nThen, let\u0027s do something else to all of this, something fun and annoying:\n\nLet\u0027s add in that the maximum theoretical efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%. That is essentially equivalent to the \u0022charge-discharge\u0022 efficiency of a battery.\n\nThis is the best your fuel cell will ever get, without even caring at all for all other losses, this is where you can get at max, without any losses to transportation, storage, or production. Most modern fuel cells, however, only have an efficiency of 40 to 60%. You yourself have already stated that modern, in-use batteries have 80% efficiency from charge to discharge, others here have given higher numbers, higher than the maximum efficiency of a fuel cell.\n\nBefore any other losses have even been calculated, the battery has already won.\n\nFor the battery, we already have the infrastructure, we already have the ability to make the batteries, and we already know the technology very well. *Right now*, the batteries are better than the fuel cells. Twenty, fifty years from now, who knows what will be the ideal choice.\n\nThis also comes back to bite you about the comparative losses, by the way.\n\nI\u0027ll be nice and use your loss numbers here, just to show you what the issue is.\n\nLet\u0027s start with some electricity, since both systems need electricity at the beginning. The hydrogen needs it to electrolyze the water, after all. Since I haven\u0027t seen any numbers for loss of hydrogen over time in storage or for electrical losses in storage, I won\u0027t use them.\n\nLoss just from making hydrogen from electricity: 5% 95\n\nEstimated loss from transporting and distributing hydrogen once we\u0027ve gotten very good at it: 10%\n\nLoss from using a fuel cell to produce electricity, ignoring hydrogen leakage from storage over time: \u003E17%, current tech generally has 60-40% losses.\n\nBest case total loss when we master this: 29.035%\n\nLoss from making electricity from electricity: 0%\n\nLoss from transporting and distributing electricity: 6.6%\n\nLoss from using a battery to store and then produce electricity, ignoring discharge over time: 20%\n\nBest case total loss right now: 25.28%\n\nEven when we have absolutely mastered hydrogen fuel cells and gotten them to somehow reach maximum efficiency (something that we\u0027ve never succeeded at doing at with any system, I might add), the electricity we have right now is already better.

So in the times that you dont need base load (or at least a %) you can produce hydrogen by electrolysis using the same waste heat from the reactor.\n\nIn all these examples, you dont have 6.6 % lose in transmision or extra pollution.\n\nBut in your case you want to use the energy from fossil fuels to generate hydrogen with the electricity created in the thermal plants.\n\nThis is a very bad way to do it.. Instead that, you extract the hydrogen from all kind of hydrocarbons first (with a 80% of efficiency, this is how the 95% of the world hydrogen is produced) and then if you want to generate electricity, you do it with a fuel cell plant, which are much efficient than any thermal plant.\n\nThe problem is still the prices of the catalyst used which it will drastic change in the next 10 years.\n\nSo with this way, you capture all CO and CO2 from the begining, and you recover a big part of the effiecient lost with the fuel cell plant, or... you just sell and transport the hydrogen.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When you deliver the hydrogen to the station, it is either by direct pipeline or by a truck with a large, pressurized tank.

If thats the case Hydrogen is way better than electics in my opinion.\n\nElectric cars are heavy which makes them inefficient. They are also bad for the environment because their batteries use hazardous materials and the walls they plug into are supplied by coal power plants mostly. Electric cars also take a long time to charge up, meaning you can\u0027t go on long drives. The batteries in electric cars also deteriorate quickly.\n\nHydrogen is abundent on Earth thanks to our large supply of water. Hydrogen goes into the car just like petrol and can run the car for a similar distance. If it runs out you can just refuel. Hydrogen cars don\u0027t need lots of batteries like electric cars so they can last longer without servicing. Finally Hydrogen is completely clean energy that doesn\u0027t require sourcing the power grid which currently runs off of coal and other fossil fuels.\n\nI think in the future our power plants will use hydrogen fuel cells (If we don\u0027t work out fusion) and our cars will also run on the stuff. The apparent dangers of hydrogen are exactly the same as those with gasoline, so theres nothing new to combat. And best of all, we already have fuel stations set up all over the world. We can just slowly convert them to hydrogen pumps as more and more people use it over the ever rising price of gasoline.\n\nOf course I\u0027m not saying electric cars don\u0027t have their place.

Electric cars will be good for shot commutes while hydrogen will power our trucks that need to go long distance and our trains that can\u0027t stop to recharge.\n\nNow I think about it.....as fuel prices rise, planes need a new fuel source.....what will that be?
