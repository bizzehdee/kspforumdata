Does ISRO have any plans for extending the first liquid stage? If they ignited the liquid engines at liftoff and put enough extra fuel in the tanks so that the engines could burn through SRB separation and on for another few minutes like they usually do, what would that do to the rocket\u0027s payload capacity? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably simpler to do this than to design a new rocket. The L-110 engines might have to be tweaked to enable them to burn for the extra time, and obviously they would need bigger tanks, but it seems like it might be worth doing. It can do 10,000kg to LEO as is, but how much extra could they get out of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT* I read up-thread that they are planning on replacing the hypergolics with RP-1/LOX in a few years. If they do that, they might have a man-worthy rocket here. If they can get some extra payload capacity out of it, well the Apollo CSM was only about 15,000kg, and things might get interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T15:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dkmdlb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T15:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorta like Energia M then??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T17:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorta like Energia M then??\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it??\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E E-M GLSV-MK3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoosters : RP-1/LOX Solid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore :LH2/LOX HP, RP-1/LOX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd stage:LH2/LOX LH2/LOX\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
