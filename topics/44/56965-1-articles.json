That birds are in fact, dinosaurs has now become accepted as effectively proven, a scientific fact. This follows after the discovery of numerous feathered dinosaurs and some creatures that we can\u0027t even tell if they really birds or dinosaurs. The line separating dinosaurs and birds is not just blurred, it is erased. For example, while Jurassic Park shows \u0022raptors\u0022 as being lizard-like, we now know that they were, in fact covered in feathers, and it\u0027s a little questionable whether we should call their forelimbs \u0022wings\u0022 or \u0022arms\u0022.
