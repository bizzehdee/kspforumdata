Then again, nature figured this out. So it is certainly possible. Given enough time we could probably build something that reproduces. Although I have to question why we would ever invest in something like that. The main value behind self replicating machines is that they allow you to make lots of useful stuff for very little investment. If your machines start to evolve the ones that use less materials to make goods for you start to overtake the helpful machines.

Basically- if you understand what all the DNA does, then you can design your own animal. However, by the time that it is possible to do this, I find it unlikely that we will be able to truly call our civilization a \u0022human civilization\u0022 anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that you are using an assumption that may be short-sighted. This assumption is that Earthlings will still be limited to just \u0022mankind\u0022 in the future. I think that, eventually, Earthlings will include humans, machine intelligences, and perhaps genetically enhanced, \u0022uplifted\u0022, non-human animals. Further into the future, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the line between machine and biology becomes very blurred; after all, biological creatures are just very complex chemical machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider that if we know enough about how DNA works to design an animal from scratch, it is very likely that we mastered complex genetic engineering long before that point. So it might be relatively \u0022easy\u0022 to fiddle with the DNA of naturally-evolved animals in comparison. So I find it quite possible that we might fiddle with the DNA of promising mammals (and maybe birds) to bring them up to highly intelligent levels. The most intelligent animals non-human animals, such as dolphins, apes, elephants, and even some birds such as some corvids and parrots, are already intelligent enough to use tools and recognize themselves in the mirrors, and can outperform four-year-old humans on some tests. It might not be hard to raise them up to even higher levels of performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider that within a decade, it is likely that the first supercomputer will exceed the power of the human brain. Up till now, the primary barrier against human-level machine intelligence has been that we simply didn\u0027t have a single computer system as powerful as the human brain. Once we have a computer system that exceeds the calculating power of a human brain, once we have computers that exceed the calculating power of 100 human brains... machine intelligence truly just becomes a software problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people point to the fact that we don\u0027t know how the human brain works and imply that we won\u0027t be able to build a machine intelligence until we know how the human brain works. However, that makes several flawed assumptions- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) That the human brain uses the simplest method to build a self-aware, intelligent entity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) That we even need to know how the human brain works to build a self-aware, intelligent entity. If it was possible to scan every neuron in a human brain down to the molecular, it seems likely you could even just upload your brain to a computer. You wouldn\u0027t even need to know how it the human brain worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, there could be ways to simply evolve an intelligence using evolutionary algorithms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once had a professor who showed me this antenna that was designed by evolutionary algorithms. Basically, you take a certain starting configuration. The computer induces \u0022mutations\u0022 to that starting configuration, then tests all the configurations, letting the best survive, and getting rid of the worst ones. This forms the next generation, and the process repeats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after several thousand generations, the antenna that was spat out didn\u0027t look like anything sensical. It didn\u0027t even look like it should work. And yet it worked far better than anything else that was tested. It took the professor MONTHS to figure out why the antenna worked so well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my point is, we don\u0027t need to actually UNDERSTAND something to build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, finally, another counterpoint to the argument that we must understand the human brain to build true machine intelligences is the development of heavier than air aircraft. For centuries, everyone thought that the path to creating heavier-than-air aircraft lay in studying how birds fly. But the truth was TOTALLY different. Nature takes a convoluted approach to avian flight that we still don\u0027t understand. The fundamentals of aerodynamics that you need to know to build an airplane are MUCH more simple, and our airplanes and helicopters do not resemble birds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, so to answer the question more exactly, I do not believe it likely that \u0022mankind\u0022 will one day be capable of building an animal from scratch. If such a capability is developed one day, then it implies the mastery of technologies that likely lead us to the creation of other intelligent races that share the solar system with us, and as such, we will no longer be just \u0022mankind\u0022 anymore. Personally, as lonely as the universe appears to be, and considering the poor decisions we have made recently, I think that we could benefit greatly from the guidance from other forms of intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-28T17:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2013 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T17:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorobotics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBiorobotics\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T22:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I hope we don\u0027t \u0022uplift\u0022 other creatures from our planet.

Ecology is an n-th derivative of it and is extremely complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is that artificial organisms should not be released outside labs. The same goes for species with potentially invasive behaviour. Not only that could force a new, problematic for us, equilibrium... but the genetical cross contamination with similar species might occur. Problems might multiply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say let\u0027s experiment a lot, but keep it in the test tube, or at least if we\u0027re releasing something like enhanced plants (something that will help end the starvation), design them to have a weak spot, so they can\u0027t spread around and fight other domestical plants. It\u0027s already done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T13:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve all seen Jurassic park right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELIFE FINDS A WAY MAN, LIFE FINDS A WAY!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T14:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s the cross contamination I\u0027m talking about.
