I was wondering if anyone has every just tried to design a very rugged unmanned glidder to watch tornadoes develop. something cheap enough you can do repeated hit and miss attempts to get as much of a tornado formation as possible and just watch them form. Even try to rotate around one and or get in the middle to catch all aspects of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would seem like a cool project since you would need to account for alot of things and potentially armor it like a tank. It might be fun to try to develop more advanced and light weight ways to bounce stuff of a plane to deal with the high velocity objects.. Assuming they are that high velocity that is. If not it would be a fun way to to play with aerodynamics. Would it be difficult to get it to be aerodynamically sound in all point of a tornado? I would think that might effect things a bit with the sheer wind speed and directional changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-28T06:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/student-storm-chasers-develop-drones-to-probe-killer-tornadoes/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/student-storm-chasers-develop-drones-to-probe-killer-tornadoes/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlas, not much info in this article, and it\u0027s kinda old (2014).
