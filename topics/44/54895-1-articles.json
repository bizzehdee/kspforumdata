If you could vary velocity of the exhaust, launching it at the speed equal to that of the rocket maximizes energy benefit in the chosen frame. (There is some question of frame choice\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E, but they are easy to resolve for a 2-body problem.) But energy is not the only thing you have to worry about. Consider a rocket traveling at 6km/s in low Earth orbit. Energy-optimal exhaust velocity is going to be the same 6km/s in the other direction. If you expel 1kg of mass, you\u0027ll gain 18MJ of energy. Now, suppose, the same rocket is traveling near Geo-stationary orbit at just 3km/s. If it can achieve exhaust of 3km/s, it\u0027s going to have the same energy-efficiency as before. But now to get the same 18MJ difference, it has to expel 4kg of mass. Clearly, lower orbit is more efficient in terms of propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of a realistic chemical rocket, you are dealing with an engine that produces constant exhaust velocity.

Now, suppose there in alien on a nearby asteroid, and that asteroid is buzzing by fast enough to observe the rocket moving by at velocity 2v. So from perspective of the alien, rocket should be accelerating exhaust to 2v. Who\u0027s right? Well, it doesn\u0027t matter. Trying to optimize energy only makes sense in problems with gravity.
