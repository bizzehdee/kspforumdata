What if the robot is 2d in a 2d universe. The possibility of 3 dimensions still exists (we know it does, not just as a possibility but an actuality) but can it physically detect the 3rd dimension? It could mathematically theorise the existence of one. I\u0027m not sure it could \u0022detect\u0022 it from within, it requires the 3rd dimension to intersect or interact with it. As in your example of a mountain, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC a 2d universe can exist (but there are some limitations, I fail to recall and need time to find the wiki page on it...), thus so can our 2d robot.

It had a start at the big bang. Measurements from standard brightnest supernovae in other galaxies can be used to measure the rate at which the universe is expanding. The measured rate of expansion determines that it is expanding faster that the gravitation of everything in the universe can slow it down (Its travelling faster than escape velocity, like a rocket leaving kerbin\u0027s SOI in KSP). Therefore there is no end to the universe it will last forever (or if you understand general relitivity it is not a bound universe, it has a saddle geometry). However saying it will last forever, you have to realise as the universe expands everything flys apart untill the universe pretty much appears empty (You couldn\u0027t reach the next object closest to you in your lifetime, even traveling at the speed of light). So in any useful sense it does end for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the expanding problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you have to comprehend what we mean by infinity and expansion. Its not easy by any means as this kind of expansion is like nothing you have witnessed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all lets imagine the universe is an infinite sheet of rubber (2D for simplicity). And by infinite we really mean literally goes on \u003Cstrong\u003Eforever\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagien stretching a small part of this rubber sheet, pulling it inwards towards you. Its possible right? the rubber compresses near you and stretches further out? Gradually that stretching reduces to basically nothing far out from you. Now imagine the opposite, pushing out and stretching the rubber near you. It compresses further out, until eventually really far out you can\u0027t tell that the rubber is compressed at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we\u0027ve measured (with those supernovae) that the entire universe is expanding. It isn\u0027t getting compressed somewhere else. So how does that work? where is the compressed bit? Well thats the trick, with an infinite universe you don\u0027t need a compressed bit. You just need the furest parts of the universe from you to constantly move outwards. If the universe were finite that would mean the outer edge moves into a new area. But the universe is \u003Cstrong\u003Einfinite\u003C/strong\u003E so all you need is for the infinitely far away section of the universe to be traveling away from you infinitely quickly. It never moves into a new area beacause we aren\u0027t taking about a point in space when we say infintely far away from us. We are just talking about the fact that as we get furthar away from our observation point, the point we moved to is flying away from us faster and faster. Even exceedign the speed of light at a large enough distance (This doesn\u0027t break relativity, nothing is actually travelling faster than the speed of light locally, it just appears that way from our point of view).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essance you can do want you want with an infinite space because its very definition means you don\u0027t have to worry about the edge of it doing anything naughty, because it doesn\u0027t have one!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T15:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key is that our universe must be borderless.
