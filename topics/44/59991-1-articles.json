The ETA is 300 years (the actual travel-time to the nearest potential \u0022Earth Mk. II\u0022 is a discussion for another thread, I choose 300 simply because it means the last several generations onboard would\u0027ve been born on the ship, and have accepted existence on it as a fact of life.) We can\u0027t put people in cryosleep for 3 centuries and bring them back out, so we have to go with a \u0022generation ship\u0022, the people who depart from Earth have children, age, die and pass control of the mission to their children, who repeat the process, until they get to the destination. Contact with the rest of humanity is impossible (whether the world has ended, or someone forgot to install the receiving dish is up to your imagination), so the \u0022spacers\u0022 are completely cut off from their home, only having a repository of all knowledge and culture the human race has collected up to the day the ship leaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to reach Earth Mk. II without everyone killing each other during the transit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would humans have to adapt from a social point of view in order to succeed? Ignoring any sort of physical alteration, how would we have to change the way we interact with each other, how we organize ourselves, our very behaivour?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T01:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see three possible scenarios, The first... everyone holds hands and sings kumbaiya, given what I know of human interaction this seems highly unlikely.

Humans, some way or another will find a way to create a social structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the best way to pull it off, in my opinion, is to have the ship have very few automated procedures, so it forces as much of the crew as possible to work, thereby keeping them out of trouble and in shape. The whole thing would most likely have to be military, as it gives you a basic hierarchical structure to go off of, along with some order, and a basic judicial system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, you need to make sure that each of the 250,000 people on board are people that will benefit society as a whole, and/or help keep the ship in order (\u0022order\u0022 being both physical and social). This includes mechanics, doctors, members of the military, lawyers, farmers, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to take into account food. A ship designed to sustain 250,000 people for 300 years can\u0027t just haul freeze dried food and/or K-rations. Space farming will need to be done, and this can only be achieved by hydroponics, and a very efficient water filtration system to allow liquid waste to be purified back into water, and the leftover products used as fertilizer for the plants, or possibly burned as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince people are going to be born and die on this ship, appropriate actions are going to need to take place. Taking care of the dead allows for two possibilities. You could either burn them, and try and use the materials in the ash, or chuck them out of an airlock to reduce the mass of the ship to make the fuel usage that much less. Births will be a bit more complicated. Due to physical complications with micro-gravity fetal development (at least in rats, but this is probably also true with humans), a large centrifuge will have to be a part of the spacecraft. Such a centrifuge will contain temporary living quarters for pregnant women, maternity wards, and (if need be) where the child will grow up for the first few years of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that about does it as far as I can tell.

Some reactor designs can actually burn fission products, but it\u0027s not particularly efficient, and the quantities produced by natural decay are tiny.. In fact, if you\u0027re reflecting neutrons back at the stored fuel instead of letting them escape, they\u0027re probably going to cause a few fissions on the way back, actually making the fuel decay faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost materials used as nuclear fuel are stable over the mission duration anyway.

We had very strict rules where I worked when doing anything near the fuel, Only 4 people were allowed in the room when there was fuel in it, in case the water in our bodies was enough of a moderator to cause criticality, and if you wanted a refreshing drink of water, the closest you were allowed to bring it was about 50 metres down the corridor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninjad!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunkrobot","CreatedById":58034,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T15:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ship in the scenario has already been designed and built for it\u0027s mission.

If it is a moderator as well your fuel can even go into meltdown. So you want the nuclear fuel in an isolated environment that keeps it cooled and preferably out of reach from the public (Don\u0027t want those things to get lost, you need that power). So you would probably encase it in thermally conductive plastic (Also helps deflect the cosmic radiation a bit) and bolt it to the outer hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I suspect a rather interesting society will form. At first I expect major psychological trauma on a wide scale thanks to survivor guilt, not to mention that a spaceship isn\u0027t a very pleasant environment: They are built for function, not pleasure. So I think you\u0027ll see a lot of suicides and psychological breakdowns in the first few years. Since people with a fragile mental stability in a spaceship is a very deadly combination the government would have to be extremely strict. A real police state that monitors your every move and takes you to forced therapy under 24/7 surveillance at the slightest hint of depression or mental breakdown. It won\u0027t necessarily be a bad place to live, that would just work against their own goal of keeping people sane. But if you have a weak mind you\u0027re going to have a bad time. The world from the anime Psycho Pass is pretty close to how I would imagine this society (Minus the Sibyl system). Utopian from the outside, but with deep moral flaws to keep the system running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue capitalism and a free market are out of the question. I doubt the engineers would build in enough overpass on resources so that 1 person can have significantly more living space, energy and food than another and still have both survive. It simply isn\u0027t efficient engineering and morally dubious: \u0022Yea, we could totally safe 1000 more people! But we need that overpass to make sure the rich guys can stay rich...\u0022 So food, beds and water and other essentials would be freely supplied by the government. If there is a currency system it would focus purely on luxury goods such as leisure time, rooms with windows or access to entertainment systems. And even then it would be heavily regulated to avoid a small minority ending up with most of the goods. The space ship is a closed system, so you can\u0027t just import new goods to keep the rest happy. Jobs would likely remain much the same. Even in space you\u0027ll still need barbers, nurses and plumbers. Though I think they\u0027ll place a lot of focus on engineering and entertainment. Engineering to keep people alive and entertainment to keep them sane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf humanity manages to stumble their way through the first few years people will likely relax a bit and start to form families. Birthrates would be heavily controlled so the ships recycling system doesn\u0027t get overly taxed. The kids themselves would be fine, according to the OP they\u0027re in a O\u0027Neil cilinder, so they\u0027ll be subjected to a comfortable 1G. This also raises demand for teachers, so that field will likely see a major boom. Their science lessons are going to be awesome, just take the elevator to the central axis and you can float in 0G while your whole world spins around you. A trip of just a few minutes for the best demonstration of Action = Reaction, centripetal force and momentum conservation in the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 25 years I think the government will start to cut some slack to humanity. Most of the population is now either born on the ship and thus accustomed to living in space, or has been around long enough to know that they wont crack. I also doubt that humanity would reach a high enough birthrate to keep the population constant. Even in first world countries today the birthrate is below replacement levels and we aren\u0027t floating around in a tin can with limited resources. So as the population drops the government can relax its hold on the economy a bit since there is more to go around per person. Since there are more resources available I think some extinct forms of art will resurrect. You aren\u0027t going to waste atoms on paint if those could also be used to feed someone, but now that there\u0027s a bit more to go around people can afford things like painting, sculpting and generally making the ship feel more like a home than a nuclear submarine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience, especially big physics would grind to a crawl. The ship isn\u0027t equipped with sensors accurate enough to allow physicists to get the data they need. So we won\u0027t see hoverboards powered by Higgs fields by the time we reach the destination. But other fields suffer as well. Biology, for example, has essentially turned into bookkeeping. You can\u0027t observe the behavior of chimps if you only carry a few frozen embryos. So most biology would focus on gene sequencing, observing the population of crops and humans to detect problems and study their behavior in a closed system. We would still keep everything we know today around (Data storage is light and cheap), but we won\u0027t expand on it much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T19:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you replace the people with space cores.

If they know that they will die, and still murder someone. Then if your police force is \u0022lazy\u0022 and give up the investigation, and pick someone at random to take the blame, then who is to stop them?
