After some thinking and research, I have come up with some basic ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Calcium oxide: Present on both Mars and Luna, with a ten percent concentration on Luna, Calcium oxide can be useful for life support, it will (albeit slowly) absorb carbon dioxide to become Calcium carbonate, better known as Chalk, which can be heated to release carbon dioxide and be used again, acting as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E CO2 scrubber. It can also be reacted with water to produce Calcium hydroxide which absorbs CO2 much faster, but if at all possible I would advise against wasting water on this and using calcium oxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Perchlorates: Martian perchlorates in regolith tend to have to be removed for safe agriculture, most \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E systems discard them, but that is not the best of ideas, since they are oxidizers, used often in fireworks, they could be used as solid rocket fuel, or alternatively, be heated to produce an oxygen supply for the base, without having to electrolyze water, which would allow water to be saved, potentially enabling bases to be constructed in less water rich areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any other ideas on utilizing less discussed resources? I\u2019d love to hear them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: is there any other hydrogen containing compound that is at least a tad easier to get in space than water? If there is, we can use oxygen from other sources and hydrogen to make water, which is currently one of the biggest bottlenecks for bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-12T16:08:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the answer - but I like where you are going!\u00A0 Be interested in the responses from those who have solid chemistry backgrounds!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-12T17:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, turns out Harvard beat me to it, I found a paper which discussed extracting regular hydrogen (just H2) from lunar regolith, according to the apollo mission samples the concentration ranged from 50-220 parts per million (average of about 150 grams per ton of regolith), not much of course, but it\u0027s everywhere, and we have industrial capacity and automation to play with. They discussed using bacteria to do it, but they also stated that it could be baked out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could have a bunch of rovers which take in regolith on the front, bake the hydrogen out in the middle, and spit rocks out of the back, then when they have gotten, say a 150 grams of hydrogen (which could be done in 20 minutes if they can process 50 kilograms per minute, which ought to be feasible with sufficient heat and/or sufficient numbers), they go back to base to deposit it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably not just on the surface level though, so you could mine down into everywhere else, and since you already would need other mines, you could extract the hydrogen first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-13T15:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIron oxide: Heat it up and react it with carbon monoxide (it needs to be hotter, but it saves you the trouble of getting carbon, though you could still get carbon) to make iron.

Especially when you don\u0027t really need to worry so much about environmental damage (can\u0027t make the moon MORE dangerous for instance). I\u0027m not dismissing the difficulty of heat and power management but, say on the moon for it being close, enough stuff can be sent to have plenty of power. That makes aluminum...I want to say trivial. But that leads to the thought of radioactive materials. If you have fission reactors on the moon, can you refuel them with locally sourced materials? (a quick search revealed an article from 2009 about the discovery of uranium on the moon, so maybe). If everything comes down to heat or electricity, wouldn\u0027t power be the most important? With enough power we can always use the preferred human method of brute force for anything we need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if you have aluminum (non-oxidized) but you need iron (unsure of how you would end up in that situation) and all you have is iron oxides, thermite is a fun and exciting reaction that lets off some heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-16T00:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is not the oxygen.
