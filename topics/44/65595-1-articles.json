The spec arises out of the role a piece of equipment would play, so what possible job could a walking vehicle fill? Let\u0027s ignore for a minute the issue of whether legs are actually any better or worse than wheels or tracks, and assume that you\u0027ve got a requirement for a specialist walking vehicle for urban combat. If you\u0027re not carrying troops then what role are you fulfilling? Walking is too slow for things like convoy escort, but weapons carrier acting in support of infantry would work. You\u0027d need machineguns, and a standoff weapon good at ranges from point blank to a max of about 1km. Ability to breach buildings and fortifications would be useful. I\u0027d go for something like an RCL or unguided rocket launcher firing thermobaric or HESH warheads. You could also go for an AGL or autocannon, preferably with smart airburst and/or breacher munitions. An AGL or RCL would be useful for non-lethal warheads too. Autocannons would be more useful for counter-sniping, as they\u0027re a bit more surgical. Flame throwers are very nasty in urban warfare, but people are a bit squeemish about those these days. A walking mech breathing fire would certainly have shock effect though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor crew, you\u0027re probably looking at 2-3. You could get away with 2, but that would limit your ability to fire more than one weapon at a time. Combat experience has taught that having at least two independently operable machineguns is a good thing in an ambush, hence the amount of guns you see stacked onto vehicles designed to fight at short ranges like the M113 ACAV and the Achzarit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe height of a walking vehicle would be a liability most of the time, but could be turned to an advantage. If it was tall enough to access upper floors and could breach a building it could be used to assault buildings. Build the thing with ladders running up the back. Infantry quite rightly hate assaulting buildings from the ground floor, they\u0027ll always go in through an upper floor if they can. A vehicle that could make a hole, advance on the building laying down suppressive fire and provide assault access to even the first floor (second floor for you Americans) could actually be quite useful, if somewhat niche.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtection wise, you\u0027re probably looking at aluminium armour plus slats or ERA to about the standard or an IFV. You\u0027d need to at least have a reasonable chance of taking an RPG-type shot from any angle, or it\u0027d just be a liability down town. Having legs might actually be quite good for mine protection, if you don\u0027t mine the thing falling over in a heap afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is weight and mobility. It would be too slow to accompany wheeled and tracked vehicles. It would be ok with dismounted infantry, but it would need transport to keep up with them once they mounted. A big flatbed truck would be easy, but would suck off road. If you could get the weight down towards the 10t end of the range you could marry it up to a Sky Crane/CH-53/CH-47/Mi-26 type helicopter and give it to air assault units. You\u0027d probably be sacrificing a fair bit of armour for that though, especially if you wanted to operate hot and high. You\u0027d end up with something about as well protected as the Wiesel mentioned above, but heavier and more bulky so it would have to be an underslung load instead of being carried internally like the Wiesel can. If your mech ended up towards the 20t end of the scale I think it would start getting pretty dubious, as you\u0027d be back to moving it around by truck on roads. Even in urban combat being able to operate off-road is useful for a weapons carrier, as you\u0027ll want to be able to maneuver on the outskirts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T10:41:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechs are cool, but not a realistic combat vehicle.
