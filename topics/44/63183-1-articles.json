Disadvantages would be no increase in I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E and/or thrust at zero airspeed, slightly lowered TWR due to the air duct\u0027s weight (though they could be discarded once out of the atmosphere), and maybe cooling problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like your opinions on the feasibility, expected gains and losses, and possibility of this design actually flying in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, here\u0027s one company\u0027s take on it: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sei.aero/eng/papers/uploads/archive/SEI_SCAAT-2013_PublicBrief.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sei.aero/eng/papers/uploads/archive/SEI_SCAAT-2013_PublicBrief.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo intentions to advertise, but their launch vehicle looks really cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T14:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.

The only thing a rocket engine needs to be air-augmented would be installing some sort of shroud around the engine that has an intake scoop.

That\u0027s because of the equation used to calculate multiple Isp\u0027s. It\u0027s complicated, but you would get less D-v in your rocket. Might not be a good idea.

Very exciting performance. The great thing about air-augmented rockets is that they\u0027re dead simple compared to (say) a SABRE (with that nightmare of a precooler) in that you\u0027re just using air as extra working mass for a regular rocket engine in addition what you get with your fuel and oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that with solid rockets you can double ISP from ~250 to ~500 in atmosphere. You\u0027re carrying more structure, mind, but at a certain point this could probably be offset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-16T05:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2014 05:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sauron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
