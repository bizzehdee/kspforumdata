It didn\u0027t raise any serious red flags for me at that time, but since I\u0027m not an expert either, this probably doesn\u0027t mean very much. Basically, using pure deuterium as your source material (since you would be breeding your own He-3) would be a great advantage as you could skip dealing with the expensive and radioactive Tritium entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for point 2), with any claim that seems too good to be true, there is a substantial chance that \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E.
