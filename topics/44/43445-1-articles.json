Rocket engineers try to increase the speed of the exhaust whenever possible, by making the exhaust hotter, as that reduces the weight of fuel needed to transfer the needed momentum. (This efficiency of momentum transfer is measured by \u0022specific impulse\u0022, abbreviated I(sp). Bigger I(sp) numbers mean greater efficiency.)

I\u0027ll explain the engineering aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor simplicity, let us assume a monopropellant engine, whose primary components are composed of a propellant tank, an ignition valve, a reaction/combustion chamber, and a nozzle. Let\u0027s also assume a single type of monopropellant, to ignore the chemical side for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest type of liquid fuel rockets are pressure-fed rockets. This has no turbopump, so the pressure needed to transfer propellant to the chamber are either supplied by a separate pressurant gas, or provided by the propellant\u0027s own vapor pressure, using a heating element in the tank. This design is often used in engines designed to operate fully in vacuum, including the Apollo SPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile simple and efficient, this system has a limited maximum thrust, because the pressure in the chamber goes up in proportion to the thrust. At some point, the pressure generated by the pressurant gas or propellant vapor pressure will fail to exceed the chamber\u0027s, resulting in no more thrust being produced by the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the solution is simple: install a pump. Turbopumps are chosen for their high power-to-weight ratio (the amount of work it does, compared to its mass), to keep the engine\u0027s overall TWR high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, the turbopump brings its own problems, the most notable of which is that it requires power to operate. Some designs simply route some of the gases from the chamber into the turbopump, some others install a separate chamber for the turbopump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next question regarding the final performance of the engine is: where does the turbopump exhaust go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne solution used often is throwing it overboard from an exhaust pipe. This gives the maximum thrust available, as the turbopump runs efficiently on its own, delivering the maximum propellant flow rate into the chamber. However, since the propellant used to run the turbopump is thrown out, it is no longer available to produce thrust, resulting in lower specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design, called a gas-generator cycle, is used frequently in engines used for lower-stage work, one notable example being the Saturn V\u0027s F-1 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other solution is piping the turbopump\u0027s exhaust into the main chamber of the engine. This is to reduce the loss of efficiency associated with dumping propellant off to the side, resulting in a more efficient engine compared to the gas-generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since the turbopump exhausts into the main chamber, it has to deal with back-pressure from the reaction in the main chamber itself, needing a separate chamber with a higher pressure. In addition to lowering the turbopump\u0027s performance (leading to lower mass flow, therefore lower thrust), it also exposes the turbine blades to much harsher working conditions than a gas-generator engine\u0027s, requiring exotic and/or advanced materials. This makes the final engine more complicated and expensive, but gives more specific impulse than a gas generator, at the expense of lower TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design, the staged-combustion cycle, is used for upper-stage engines or in engines that are never staged away even if other engines are, a notable example of which is the Space Shuttle Orbiter\u0027s RS-25/SSMEs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, there are other engines that work on slightly different cycles that I may have missed (one cycle simply heats the incoming propellant via regenerative cooling of the chamber and nozzle, rather than reacting it, and using the expansion of said heated propellant to drive the turbopump), but the most common chemical rocket engines in service today typically use one of these three cycles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s a little bit of rocket science from the engineer\u0027s side.

There are engines like the Merlin 1D, which scored a new world record in TWR; but you have to keep in perspective what this means. Basically, new materials and improved manufacturing allowed the shaving off of a couple kg\u0027s of dry mass from the engine compared to older designs. That\u0027s it.

In terms of molecular weight, oxygen is much lighter than kerosene (having somewhere between 6-16 carbons per molecule). In a rocket engine, for a given chamber temperature and pressure, the exhaust velocity is higher the lighter the exhaust gas molecules are. For the Russians, this means cramming as much oxygen into the chamber as possible. As a result, some of the oxygen simply becomes hot without actually reacting with the kerosene, then gets quickly dumped out of the nozzle. Oxygen, however, is notoriously corrosive at high temperatures, so the engines using this mix are understandably of non-reusable designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets using liquid hydrogen as fuel (Space Shuttle, Ariane 5), however, face a backwards situation: their fuel is much lighter per molecule than their oxidizer (LOX).

But there does tend to be a tradeoff. The reason for that tradeoff has to do with energy and power. So isp for a thermal rocket engine is a function of engine pressure ratios, combustion chamber temperature as well as the ratio of specific heats and the molecular mass of the propellant. Here is the equation itself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/eq1-22.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022eq1-22.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that isp=Ve/g0. So you\u0027ll notice a few things about this equation. Namely that Ve, and hence isp, goes up if the temperature gets hotter, if the molecular weight gets lower, and if the pressure at the nozzle exit is close to zero. This is why a NERVA type nuclear rocket engine gives such good isp compared to a chemical rocket, M=2 for molecular hydrogen vs. say something like 18 for the hydrogen-oxygen (for a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio) used on the very best chemical rockets. Assuming everything else stays the same the nuclear rockets get about 3 times the performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets look at thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/eq1-00.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022eq1-00.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF is thrust, q is the mass flow rate, Ae is the area of the nozzle exit, pe, and pa are the exit pressure and ambient pressure respectively.

This is the problem. If we treat power as a constant, then it is obvious that if we increase thrust, Ve has to go down. This makes sense from a intuitive stand point. If you are trying to heat up cold water flowing out of a pipe, if you reduce the flow rate for the same set amount of heat the water will be warmer, if you speed up the flow rate the water coming out will be colder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can always build rockets with more energetic processes. For example the 200 kW VASIMR thruster currently in testing produces only 5 N of thrust (which is a heck of a lot compared to most electric thrusters, but it is still only like 1.1 lbf). If we could pour 200 MW of juice into a scaled up version of the same VASIMR we could supposedly fly to Mars in only 39 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there is a practical problem with just continually adding \u0027moar power\u0027.

It\u0027s rolling with a beam core anti-matter propulsion system that has a isp of .6*c/g0=18.4 million seconds:) The engine thus produces 8.8 TW of thrust power (this is about half of the world\u0027s 2008 energy production). This isn\u0027t a super realistic example for several reasons, but let\u0027s say the engine is 99.99% efficient. It still produces 882 MW of waste heat, which you then have to get rid of somehow.
