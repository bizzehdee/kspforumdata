I would get a professional to clean them up. It\u0027s too easy to knock a lens out of alignment. Depending on what kind of Telescope you have you may have to get the rest of it cleaned up and adjusted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasic Telescope instructions:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) find a object.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) adjust your eyepiece to it\u0027s lowest magnification level.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) focus on an object (the moon is a great place to start. Lots of little craters).\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) slowly increase the magnification and adjust the focus as you go. There is a point where the images will get smeary. That pretty much means that you have gone too far and the lenses can\u0027t focus that tightly when the magnification is that high. Back off the magnification until the images improve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, depending on the size of the scope, you will easily view the moon, you probably can view Jupiter and it\u0027s Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede), Saturn and it\u0027s rings,\u00A0Mars on a good day, and Venus at the right time of the year. The ISS will be a tougher object to track because it\u0027s moving across the sky so darn fast, but you will make out the superstructure and the solar arrays.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, as for photographs, I will have to tenuously say \u0022No\u0022, simply because I haven\u0027t seen the scope (No pic in your post), I have no idea on what kind of focuser assembly you have, and most Astrophotography rated Telescopes are very VERY expensive (they start at $4000 CDN for a basic one, well over $15000 for a good one) and without some kind of tracking mechanism, most of the pics will be blurry and smeary because the Earth rotates and the stars and other objects move too!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, Astronomy can be fun.

That\u0027s good since refractors tend to be fairly robust when it comes to lenses, and cleaning them up is far easier than mirrors as long as you are gentle and patient. Mark all the pieces so they go back together the exact same way it came apart if you feel the yen to tinker.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy guess it\u0027s a 60mm F7 telescope. Not bad. F7 is a good focal length for magnification verses field of view. As long as the 60mm lens is Achromatic (2-piece lens)\u00A0it\u0027s a keeper to start with. If it\u0027s not (single lens) then it\u0027s a conversation piece, and not much more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLarge knob is the main focus.

Also, it has zoomable eyepiece. Now that\u0027s not precisely a good thing to have, as zoomable eyepieces tend to have lower quality yet more complicated mechanics than single focus eyepieces. The smaller knob seems to be the focal length changer (zoom) while the larger knob seems to be the focuser. Have to agree with GDJ that it might be f/7 or lower, so it\u0027s a fast telescope, meaning it\u0027s best suited for viewing very extended yet dim objects (comets, nebulae, galaxies, clusters) - you\u0027ll need to observe in some very-dark-sky sites though. Also, do you get a mounting for that ? If not, using them will be quite hard. Photography with that... sticking phone camera might be fine. ISS transits, guess the magnification is too small ? To be honest the design looks like some of the cheap telescope the gov\u0027t gave to high schools, but given the steel tube it must be of a higher build quality.
