You still need sensors that can detect objects that merely have to contain a laser, a power supply, and some sort of heat-sink (presumably a liquid and vacuum chamber that can keep flooding the chamber so you can mask the IR until the laser has fired). Expect this to be few meters in a sea of millions of km. About the only real advantage you have is seeing that IR signature pop out against a 3K background, but you still need either outrageous resolution (or more likely sensors *everywhere*). Hubble can resolve about 25km on Mars (and I would assume this means pictures taken in 2003 with the 56 million km distance), this won\u0027t help at all with a stealthy ship.

You have two ways that the opponent laser can mess with your sensors, either you are over saturating them with data (imagine a flash-light being shined into a camera, the camera is working but it can\u0027t show anything useful) or you have destroyed their sensing elements (it\u0027s actually physically broken). Both of these are actually in their own way fairly easy to get around. We\u0027ll start with the harder case, where components are being destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have, generally speaking, two ways you can go about making this work. The first is that you just have a crapton of disposable sensors and you don\u0027t care that they are getting burned because they last long enough to be useful and are cheap to replace. On a spacecraft with mass restrictions, this option is less than ideal, but still workable. The second is that you increase the robustness of your sensor system in some fashion. Here\u0027s an example, you have a filtered pane of glass in front of your camera lens that blocks something like 90\u002B% of the IR (or whatever) coming through, make it multispectrum blocking if you want. Then you just ensure that your active cooling systems (coolant flowing around inside your ship) are keeping that pane nice and cold (which you are likely doing anyway for the camera\u0027s thermal stabilization). What this means is that you can have a terribly sensitive camera that is protected from the attacking energy as most of the IR is getting soaked up by the pane which is ideally cooling enough to minimize (though of course not actually stop) vaporization/drilling. What would this sensor see? Most of the time probably nothing except for the sun, nearby planets, very nearby drive plumes, possibly (but unlikely) a few stars, and any time someone fires an IR beam at the ship/camera, they\u0027ll show up like a nice bright spot. What was it you were trying to do with this camera? Find a bright spot of IR that is your enemy so you can target them? Sweet deal! Free beacon targeting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in the case of your sensors being blinded, this is just a matter of crafting your sensor correctly. An example would be a camera with a fish-eye lens. If you shine a blinding light at it, the system has enough data it can pick up from other directions (where your oppressively blinding light is not shining from) that now the centroid of the light blob can be determined, what\u0027s at the centroid of this blob? Why the ship causing the blob! Free beacon targeting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern day ECM/ECCM is WAY beyond \u0022I\u0027ll just spam out noise that they can\u0027t penetrate.\u0022. Sure, that works on some of the lower tech countries, but for people like US vs Russia the game gets very interesting. We\u0027ve worked on the problem enough that \u0022noise spamming\u0022 a tactic that you intentionally do to get the enemy to shoot at whatever is causing the noise spam instead of something more important. But then when people started doing that (like dropping the spammers on missiles/drones), we also figured out a variety of ways (doing things I mentioned above pretty much) to look past/through the spamming to find out what we want. These days the game is more about trying to confuse the radar returns to make it look like the plane is either something that it is not, or to make the radar think the plane is somewhere it isn\u0027t. That\u0027s the thing though, ECM/ECCM warfare really only gets that chess-gamey on radars and such because the enemy DOESN\u0027T have a radio beacon announcing where it is in the middle of a firefight (IFF is different, shush). That\u0027s what the IR signature of engines or your ship is, a beacon announcing to everybody where you are at all times. There is not a lot you can do to play ECM games with that. You can pump out a blob of hot gas now and then and that might draw their targeting off to the side, but that is a losing game on your part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T20:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can pump out a blob of hot gas now and then and that might draw their targeting off to the side, but that is a losing game on your part.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it?

Hiding them during/after launch seems next to impossible, hiding crew changes just makes it worse. Radio (recievers) barely take any power: anything capable of radiating away ship-killing laser blasts can dissipate the IR trace down to next to nothing. Making the laser, power supply for laser, attitude control, radio, any navigation abilities (not to likely) all work at 3K is probably a much harder problem (although by this point space engineering is almost certainly common enough to solve this with easily available off the shelf parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d assume that the reason you don\u0027t have a total kill first strike is that you can\u0027t find all the ships sneaking around (especially outside the elliptic).

From what I understand the only things worthy of colonization and thus strategic control are planets and asteroids, said asteroids and planets also have a massive advantage over nearby spaceships due to their massive capacity for heat, thus allowing truly massive lasers to be added.
