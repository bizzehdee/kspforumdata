This way, it can traverse faster than the main turret, an obvious advantage when acquiring a target within a very limited time frame. It also means that the missile can carry several targeting turrets rather than relying on the main laser turret, which means the anti-sensor laser now has several eyes to blind, increasing the chances of the sensors acquiring a target before it gets blinded.\u003Cp\u003ENote that I used \u003Cem\u003Efairings\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003Eshutters\u003C/em\u003E. An ablative fairing similar to aerodynamic fairings used in orbital booster rockets can be simpler to build and open than a shutter system. Coupled with the fact that the laser turret won\u0027t survive firing the laser (due to having no radiators, resulting in it, along with its power source, overheating to Hell), the ablative covering doesn\u0027t need to be closed again, rendering the point of shutters moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can even imagine a nastier version. Replace the directional optical sensor turrets with a passive omnidirectional sensor. When its fairing pops open, it lets itself get fired upon by anti-sensor lasers, thereby acquiring the position of the anti-sensor laser turrets. Train the main laser turret to this location, and pop the ablative fairing microseconds before firing.

Though it probably is possible to build a missile that can handle ridiculous G\u0027s.\u003Cp\u003ELaunching a missile with a railgun has two huge advantages: number one, the missile isn\u0027t using any of its own fuel to launch, giving it longer range. And second, the missile has a much smaller launch transient. It\u0027s not producing a huge fireball as it leaves the launch tube, making the launch much harder to detect. (stealth weapons are never about eliminating a craft\u0027s signature--that\u0027s impossible. it\u0027s about reducing the signature enough that enemy radar and IR detection don\u0027t pick it up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it IS producing a huge fireball leaving the launch tube.

Depending on the size and speed of the target, that can easily turn into a clean miss.

There\u0027s a couple of issues with laser targeting at extreme ranges - target movement aside:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The laser is going to have problems with jitter caused both by vibrations from the vessel\u0027s systems as well as from thermal stresses as the ship contracts and expands. In fact all non-missile weapon systems are going to have that problem. I\u0027m pretty sure you can damper most of it, but not all. Thus I would speculate that the maximum effective range of a laser, under combat conditions, would be under 1 million km simply because precision at that range in combat conditions is likely not achievable. An error of 1/1,000,000 mrads at 1 million km means you miss by 10m. In comparison the ALS with its vibration isolated optical bench and beam steering mirrors are only capable of a maximum of about 1/6,000 mrads precision (it may be a little more, it may be much less... the info is classified); for those that think that 1/6,000 mrads precision is meh, consider that current high end stabilized weapon mounts struggle to get better than 1/2 mrads precision. So yeah, lasers are stupid precise compared to anything else. And remember, I\u0027m talking about robust ship mounted weaponized lasers, not fragile high maintenance hyper-accurate low power laboratory lasers on a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sensor error is another factor that we\u0027ve overlooked. I don\u0027t think there is any military-grade sensor that, outside of laboratory conditions, returns 100% accurate readings, and we\u0027ve not even bothered with EW and optical countermeasures. Those errors, compounded with the jitter caused by the vessel, will likely create an embarrassing number of misses at extreme ranges. I bet distant orbital path calculations are likely to have multi kilometre-radius errors, making my earlier theoretical area denial tactic even more difficult to implement... unless we\u0027re talking kilometres\u002B wide area denial weapons, in which case YIKES!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to speculate in terms of pK \u0026gt;0.5, I would say that Wedge is right in that we\u0027d see most engagements take place close in; I would speculate that we\u0027d see maximum ranges of about 100,000km (yes, the 1/6,000 mrads means that the ranges would be in low thousands of km, but we\u0027re talking way off in the future here where weapon mounts are vastly improved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo people will see each other long before anyone can do anything effective to each other; and when they start to get close, it will be the ship with the most accurate sensors coupled with the most precise blinding weapon that will win. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T23:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
