What are the forcing tides\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Gravity moon earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fluidity of water at earth surface temperatures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The timing of tides is dependent on the rotation of the earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The amplitude is dependent on the earth moon distance which is indirectly dependent on the earths rotation and tide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The sun also tides but the gravitational attraction is much less\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we have concepts, so what is the primary, in this we consider the target, earths large oceans. This leaves 1 and 3, one determines the amplitude and the other is timing. just about any rotation will cause tides, even if the earth did not rotate, the moons cuurent orbit wiill cause tides, so weighing the two it leaves moon\u0027s gravity as what the questions intent was trying to extract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T01:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got 12/12. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
