Dunno what would be best to measure though, maybe doppler of disk edges? I know it ain\u0027t 100% reliable but it\u0027s a start. Also, since you are probably especially interested in habitable planets, you take measurements of star energy output to establish borders of Goldilocks zone. Anything else you can divine about star can be useful. Young stars may still be in early bombardment period, ones with low metalicity may not have planetary systems at all and so on. Lot of this can be measured from afar, so your crew may have pretty good idea what to expect even before setting foot inside system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext step would be deploying one or more probes for paralax observation. Warping them across system or above ecliptic would be handy, but not strictly necessary. If you can\u0027t afford a dedicated probe, you will just compare sky images along the way, but this will be way slower \u00A0to catch moving objects and less precise at determining orbital parameters, so I guess probe is worth the money. Or, if you have precise star maps, you can construct image of what starfield at target system should look like, and then look for objects that do not belong. Optical/infrared observation will tell at minimum orbital parameters and light curve, which should correspond to rotation period of body. Radar could be then used to gather at least very precise distance and relative velocity info. Once you know some planets, you can start constructing orbital stabilty and resonances models. Obviously, planets are carefully\u00A0explored for satellites - their orbits will provide good idea of mass. With rudimentary info about size, you can approximate planets density. All of this should give some basic idea\u00A0what you are dealing with, and note that you don\u0027t need fancy equipment like kilometers sized radar arrays. Now that you know where to look and what to look for, its probably good time to make use of any and all technology you have. And obviously, you are scanning for any active sources at any wavelength all the time, in case there is something like Jupiter that shines on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222831864\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477928714\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002253585\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stargate525\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn Monday October 31, 2016 at 4:45 PM, Stargate525 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this odd notion of firing small probes at cardinal directions off of the main ship, then tracing their trajectory to get a gravitional map of the system\u00A0 as they\u0027re deflected by the various planets.

Otherwise, you\u0027d need a lot of probes to get some directional information and it still would be hell of a job to separate signals.\u00A0 And move them pretty fast to sweep whole system. Definitely doable, but I doubt it would be faster then optical observation. Measuring orbital deviation should not be a problem though, you just equip probes with precise time beacon and measure signal delay. This is very accurate, even with current level technology. And you definitely want to observe orbits of everything AFTER you mapped system to make sure you didn\u0027t miss something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
