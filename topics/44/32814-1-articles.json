Frank Borman was furious at the idea and almost recommended that this sort of risk taking by astronauts should be grounds for err, grounding. I read this in Buzz\u0027s own semi-biography entitled \u0022Men from Earth\u0022. He explained that he didn\u0027t feel it to be a risk at the time, but he also felt that Borman was really simply vehement towards any kind of \u0022wild\u0022 ideas he had--remember, he had the reputation and nickname of \u0022Dr. Rendezvous\u0022, because he was so obsessed with rendevous techniques, it was all you\u0027d ever eventually talk with him about, even at parties. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
