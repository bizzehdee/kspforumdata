Probe gathers its data, returns to the drill, re-attaches and climbs back up, transmits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr better yet. Drill assembly returns to the surface where it attaches the science module to the lander which returns to an orbiter and the orbiter goes home. Because we get more science points for returning samples right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T13:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T14:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the best we can hope for in the immediate future is a probe that flies through the ice-plumes, or one that samples the surface ice near the cracks to check for organic traces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
