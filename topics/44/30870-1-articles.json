It is expected that the moon will eventually drift so far from Earth that solar gravitational effects will become significant, the moon\u0027s orbit will become irregular, and it will eventually leave Earth altogether. There will then be a somewhat dangerous time when it might collide with Earth (which would be truly spectacular - for those far enough away to view it dispassionately) but if not then successive close encounters with Earth will eventually separate them and it would become a planet in its own right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of moons being heated by tidal interactions, the energy comes from a combination of their own axial rotation and from their orbital momentum: as a moon on an even slightly elliptical orbit moves closer to and further from its parent body, so the degree of gravitational distortion increases and decreases, leading to a massive flexing of the moon\u0027s crust which generates heat.

The bulge has a slight frictional affect on the Earth, slowing its rotation ever so slightly. In the short term this is pretty meaningless, but I think the existing geologic record shows some evidence of a current slowing of several hours already. The sun will burn out before we ever become tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways back to the OP, the energy is basically from internal friction due to the gravitational tidal forces acting on the moons of Jupiter. Io sees the worst of it because it is so close in, and gravity drops over distance squared. Even a few hundreds of kilometers (radius of the moon) can cause a pretty big difference in gravitational force (and thus gravitational potential energy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIo is small enough that it SHOULD have been geologically dead if it were around another planet such as Earth (much like our own moon). However because it is so close to a massive body like Jupiter it gets squeezed and bulged and stressed constantly. It is not really right to think of the energy \u0022coming\u0022 from somewhere. Thinking of energy that way is a little off to begin with, unless you want to get down to the quantum level where you describe mass as energy waves. Besides which, you mentioned that the energy is conservative, and this is not the case.

They are also moving slowly outward from Jupiter due to tidal interactions (for the same reason Earth\u0027s moon is moving away). This tendency to move outward would be greater for Io (since it is in closer where tidal affects are stronger), and as it moves out, the interactions with Europa that maintain their 4:2 orbital resonance will tend to pump Europa\u0027s orbit higher at the expense of Io\u0027s orbital motion...and the slight changes in eccentricity that these interactions cause as they do their work result is Jupiter flexing the moons and heating their interiors (tidal forces by Jupiter work to circularize the orbits of the moons). So there are a lot of things going on simultaneously, but the ultimate source of the energy for this comes from Jupiter\u0027s kinetic energy of rotation, which decreases as tidal forces cause its moons to move outward into larger, higher energy orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T21:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why my anti-tidal power campaign is called \u0022Keep The Moon\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T22:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an easy way to visualize what\u0027s happening tidally in the Earth-Moon system. Imagine the Earth and the Moon from the perspective of a co-rotating coordinate system, so that the positions of the Earth and the Moon are fixed. In this system, there are two forces acting on each body: gravity, wanting to make the Earth and the Moon fall towards each other, and the centripetal force which holds them apart (this force is \u0022fictional\u0022 - due only to the rotating coordinate frame - but it\u0027s real enough from this perspective). The centripetal force scales as 1/r, whereas gravity scales as 1/r^2, so there\u0027s a force gradient across both the Earth and the Moon which generates mechanical strain (this is the tidal force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this mechanical strain, the surface of the Earth wants to elongate along the axis between it and the Moon. If the Earth were tidally locked to the Moon then eventually this tidal force would completely deform the Earth until it was slightly egg-shaped so as to relieve this stress. However, because the Earth is spinning, the direction of that strain changes on timescales much too short for the strain to be relieved. On the other hand, the Earth\u0027s surface is not homogeneous, and the air, water, and rock all respond to the strain on different timescales; importantly for our consideration, water responds much more quickly than rock - this is why there is a tidal bulge in the ocean. If the respond were infinitely quick, that bulge would point straight to the Moon; however, it takes time for water to flow, which means the Earth has rotated slightly, so the bulge will always be slightly East of the Moon. Because the Moon orbits in the same direction as the Earth spins, that bulge constantly leads the Moon in it\u0027s orbit. Furthermore, the bulge itself gravitates, causing the Moon to want to fall \u0022forwards\u0022 ever so slightly, picking up energy (which it steals from the Earth, causing the Earth\u0027s rotation to slow down), which (as anyone who\u0027s spent time playing KSP knows) means that the Moon is slowly drifting away from us as it orbits. Eventually, if not for solar effects, the Moon would drift out and the Earth would slow down until the Earth became tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second interesting case of tidal effects is Neptune\u0027s Moon Triton, which has a retrograde orbit. Because of this, the tidal bulge actually trails Triton\u0027s orbit, causing it to lose orbit and spiral inwards. Eventually, Triton will reach Neptune\u0027s Roche limit and will be torn apart by the tidal stress (forming a new and rather spectacular ring around Neptune in the process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s happening with Jupiter is more complicated, because Jupiter has multiple large moons including the heavy weight champ Ganymede. Because of inter-moon interactions, both Io and Europa have slightly eccentric orbits, which produces non-constant gravitational strain in a similar way that rotation does for the Earth. However, because Jupiter is a bully, the forces involved are much, much larger than they are for the Earth-Moon system, leading to substantial internal heating from frictional forces as Io and Europa try to reshape themselves to relieve the strains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is why my anti-tidal power campaign is called \u0022Keep The Moon\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly backwards.
