landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon, which liquided off the USSR, although in general my mother\u0027s generation enjoyed the successes of the Soviets in space, although we did not like the USSR as such, for example Gagarin Flight was very covered in Poland because\u00A0 made a mockery out America, because the Americans had ridiculed the Slavs earlier, so it was nice when the Slav of Yuri Gagarin overtook Mr. Shepard in who would be the first man in space, and the American rockets of that period had too little power to send these little capsules of the Mercury program into orbit.\u00A0My mother said that the Russians sent a woman Tereshkova into orbit, and the Americans were too big sexists to let their woman fly Apollo, my mother died in 2017, I think that she would
