However, the psychological and social effects of applying said advances in everyday life, almost universally escaped them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA perfect example: last year I read a 1960s futurology book by some Romanian scientist (can\u0027t recall the name unfortunately). While the guy was able to more or less correctly predict existence and properties of the internet (among other things), he thought that global computer network, giving instant access to the sum knowledge and culture of mankind will somehow elevate its users... He fantasized we will all learn higher math and listen to classical music (and, of course, communism will universally prevail \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E).

Payback does not have to be profit but also usefulness. Development of fast planes stopped up as it is very expensive and has limited usefulnesses, military stopped being interested then missiles could shoot down high flying fast planes, better to go stealthy and low, civilian use is limited because of the high cost, it would only atract they who currently fly first class. Only other use is space launches where you need an very large and fast plane who again is to expensive and you have no use for the steps getting where.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnologies who will advance fast is things who don\u0027t cost to much to develop and is useful from the start. Microprocessors is one example, mobile phones another. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusion is interesting as its the opposite, hard to do but the payoff once you get something working is large to extreme. First is power generation, rocket engines is secondary and also a bit different, an rocket engine does not have to produce lots of energy just high isp who is easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENanotech is one of the useful from first step technology, everything from surface treatment to processors, later you improve the technology. My guess is that later use will be sensors, chips who manipulate small stuff like dna and thin things like displays and variable surface properties, let you set reflectivity and absorption on an surface. Unlike fusion lots of this will be consumer products. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrganic computers has one downside, they have to be better than existing ones to be useful this is hard, upside is that they just has to be better in one area to become interesting. This is true for many types of technology. Notice that nothing has been able to replace standard computer ram, ssd and flash can compete with standard harddrives on everything but price/GB, in the start they had only the small size, robustness and low power use benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T15:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought Star Treck (both the original and the next generation) was wierdly good at predicting the future.
