The tail of the gas stream is flung out of the system, but the leading edge swings back around the black hole, collides with itself and creates an elliptical cloud of material. According to one research team using data spanning from infrared radiation to gamma rays from Swift and other observatories, this transformation best explains the Cow\u0027s behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve never seen anything exactly like the Cow, which is very exciting,\u0022 said Amy Lien, an assistant research scientist at the \u003Cu\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.umbc.edu/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0e7ee0\u0022\u003EUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/u\u003E and \u003Cu\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/goddard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0e7ee0\u0022\u003ENASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/u\u003E in Greenbelt, Maryland. \u0022We think a tidal disruption created the quick, really unusual burst of light at the beginning of the event and best explains Swift\u0027s multiwavelength observations as it faded over the next few months.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLien and her colleagues think the shredded star was a white dwarf - a hot, roughly Earth-sized stellar remnant marking the final state of stars like our Sun.

Based on those observations, the team suggests that a supernova could be the source of the Cow. When a massive star dies, it explodes as a supernova and leaves behind either a black hole or an incredibly dense object called a neutron star. The Cow could represent the birth of one of these stellar remnants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We saw features in the Cow that we have never seen before in a transient, or rapidly changing, object,\u0022 said Raffaella Margutti, an astrophysicist at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.northwestern.edu/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0e7ee0\u0022\u003ENorthwestern University\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/a\u003E in Evanston, Illinois, and lead author of a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10720\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0e7ee0\u0022\u003Estudy about the Cow\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/a\u003E to be published in The Astrophysical Journal. \u0022Our team used high-energy X-ray data to show that the Cow has characteristics similar to a compact body like a black hole or neutron star consuming material.

The team proposes that the bright optical and ultraviolet flash from the Cow signaled a supernova and that the X-ray emissions that followed shortly after the outburst arose from gas radiating energy as it fell onto a compact object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically, a supernova\u0027s expanding debris cloud blocks any light from the compact object at the center of the blast. Because of the X-ray emissions, Margutti and her colleagues suggest the original star in this scenario may have been relatively low in mass, producing a comparatively thinner debris cloud through which X-rays from the central source could escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we\u0027re seeing the birth of a compact object in real time, this could be the start of a new chapter in our understanding of stellar evolution,\u0022 said Brian Grefenstette, a NuSTAR instrument scientist at Caltech and a co-author of Margutti\u0027s paper. \u0022We looked at this object with many different observatories, and of course the more windows you open onto an object, the more you can learn about it. But, as we\u0027re seeing with the Cow, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean the solution will be simple.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7314\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7314\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-11T12:20:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2019 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThread title changed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-11T03:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E what I expected from the thread title.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Which is probably a \u003Cu\u003Egood\u003C/u\u003E thing.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill interesting, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaelommiss","CreatedById":115679,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-11T06:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know just enough to take wild guesses, but not enough to identify why I\u0027m wrong.

The article mentions that a blackhole of this size could not destroy a larger star from tidal forces, but if a larger star passed so close to the black hole that a portion of it passed within the Schwarschild radius (or close enough that mass was lost) could we see a larger star get disintegrated?

and a spectrum not usually used to study supernovae: hard X-rays, which are 10 times more powerful than normal X-rays.\u00A0 Unlike a regular supernova, the Cow has very little material swirling around it, which it enabled the team to peer straight into its heart.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022The most striking feature in the Cow is what we find in the hard X-rays,\u0022 Dr Margutti said.\u00A0 These powerful X-rays indicated that lying deep within the core of the Cow was a central engine that continued to pump out energy for at least 100 days after the blast.\u00A0 This kind of long-lasting energy source is not known in normal supernovae or gamma rays, but could occur as material swirls around a compact object such as a newly forming black hole or fast-spinning magnetar.\u00A0 \u0022The big question we\u0027re trying to find out is why in the first place we have a little amount of mass.\u0022\u00A0 Dr Margutti said the blast could have been created by the death of a massive blue supergiant star, many times the mass of the Sun.\u0022They should explode, but we don\u0027t see them,\u0022 Dr Margutti said.\u00A0 \u0022There is a possibility that those types of stars just go

shorter wavelengths by team leader and Caltech astronomer Anna Ho and her colleagues, using telescopes in Hawaii and Chile.\u00A0\u00A0 \u0022The fact it was getting brighter with time and particularly in higher frequencies shows there must be something that was still powering the explosion pumping energy into this material,\u0022\u00A0 Dr Murphy said.\u00A0 \u0022It wasn\u0027t just this explosion that happened and then was fading away, there must be something that was still there that makes it different from the typical supernova we see.\u0022\u00A0 She said the radio data pointed to the presence of a magnetar at the core of the supernova.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever it is, it does not fit any of the models, said Dr\u00A0Daniel Perley, an astronomer from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK who led another of the international teams.\u00A0 \u0022It has very different properties from anything we\u0027ve seen before,\u0022 Dr Perley said.\u00A0 When word got out that a strangely bright object had been spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood by the ATLAS telescopes on June 16, astronomers scrambled to observe its rise and fall using a global network of telescopes.\u00A0 \u0022It may well be the most intensely observed astronomical source ever,\u0022 Dr Perley said.\u00A0 \u0022The only thing that competes would be the gravitational wave detection from a year-and-a-half ago,\u0022 he said, referring to the observation of fireworks created by the \u003Ca

telescopes to follow the Cow every night for more than a month.\u00A0 The focus now is to find more objects like the Cow to definitely work out how they were formed, Dr Perley said.\u00A0 \u0022This shouldn\u0027t be one of a kind,\u0022 he said.\u00A0 \u0022There were some events that had similar properties that were seen in previous surveys, but no-one really recognised them ... and they were never followed up in real time or even discovered in real time.\u00A0 \u0022So, now we know what to look for, we\u0027re pushing forward to find more and to get more data.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr Brad Tucker, of the Australian National University, did not study the Cow but has investigated supernova events detected by Kepler and now, the TESS telescope.\u00A0 Of all the hypotheses put forward by the teams, he leans towards the creation of a black hole by a failed supernova.\u00A0 \u0022I don\u0027t know if the data favours this one way or the other. But the reason I like that is it\u0027s simple \u2014 it doesn\u0027t require any special physical mechanism.\u00A0 \u0022We know that black holes exist, but we\u0027ve never been able to pinpoint the birth of a black hole.\u00A0 \u0022We know blue supergiants exist and explode. We know they explode at different regimes. What\u0027s not to say that this could create a black hole?\u00A0 \u0022Every time we see a blue supergiant, something is weird about it.\u0022\u00A0 Less likely, he thought, was the idea of a tidal disruption event.\u00A0 \u0022If it\u0027s not a supernova we always say, \u0027Is this a tidal disruption event?\u0027 and you take a look at it and generally the answer is \u0027no\u0027,\u0022 Dr Tucker said.\u00A0 \u0022But again, these are things we\u0027re just finding more and more of and just trying to understand.\u00A0 \u0022We\u0027re narrowing down and ruling things out, but what we can definitively say is there is another type of explosion or type of star that goes bang in the night that we\u0027re just starting to uncover.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-01-11/cow-cosmic-blast-supernova-black-hole-magnetar/10703320\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-01-11/cow-cosmic-blast-supernova-black-hole-magnetar/10703320\u003C/a\u003E *Quotes have been reorganized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-12T05:09:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2019 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling and additional data\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-12T09:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cspan\u003E!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting that somebody considers a failed supernova of a blue supergiant as being less improbable than a tidal disruption, which there is another examples of (Arp299).
