I made 3 rockets. Basicly the same one, able to reach orbit with a capsule with some orbital maneuvering possible, and/or deorbit, and a docking ring. I.e. a useful launcher. The rocket had a single large SRB as the first stage, a tank for liquid fuel and a matching engine as the second stage, and the capsule with a small tank and engine as the third stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did 3 launches, the first to test the rockets capabilities, it worked. The two first stages deorbited on their own after separation, the third stage sircularized orbit nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second launch, I added a probe part to the first stage booster, launched, and where I would normaly have followed the top part of the rocket, I instead followed the now empty booster on it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s return to the ground. Two radialy mounted parachutes are enough for a safe splashdown. Two parachutes and 4 medium leggs seems to be enough for a safe dry landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third launch, I moved the probe part to the second stage, launched, and when the second stage separated, I followed that one. This stage had a small extra tank of fuel, a drogue chute, leggs and radialy mounted engines for the last few meters. It worked nicely, the chutes slowed it down enough, manual stabilizing with a single drogue on one side is not for the faint of heart when the ground is closing up fast. But, I somewhat managed a landing. The engines slowed it down enough to reach a safe-ish touchdown speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no pictures of this, but it can easily be replicated and improved upon. That doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t realy matter much, since in the cases where I saved the first and second stage, I lost the cargo, due to KSP\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s way of handling things. But it does show that such ideas, atleast within KSP, is a possibility. Wether or not it is practical will depend on other aspects of the game. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s not an acurate simulation, so the result can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t directly be translated to RL conditions, but I do think the Grasshopper is a very interesting way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T12:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHang on, I forgot my hat.
