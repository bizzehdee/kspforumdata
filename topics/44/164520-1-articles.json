Even a regeneratively cooled combustion chamber will melt to slag in any extended burn if its reactants are pure-stoichiometric. With other propellant combinations, you can run ox-rich for the same effect if running fuel-rich would result in coking.

Because of how energetic the LH2-LOx reaction is, the reaction fails due to being too hot when stoichiometric, limiting out at around 3600-3800K, but with pretty much the exact same impulse as a 5.5:1 fuel-rich engine. Because of the reaction stopping, there\u0027s actually a very wide range of fuel mixes with basically identical impulse, the advantage to fuel-rich being that the excess hydrogen keeps it cooler for the same impulse - the 5.5:1 engine might be under 2600K, making it much easier to cool and otherwise manage. The impulse gets a flat range because yes, a lighter exhaust is faster for the same temperature, but you lose temperature at a balanced rate as you add hydrogen, so it doesn\u0027t provide any extra performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor fun (or disappointment knowing we can\u0027t do it), note that if the reaction didn\u0027t fail at high temperature, LH2-LOx would be capable of towards 570 seconds stoichiometric. It\u0027d also be on the order of 6700K chamber temperature, so good luck holding the engine together, but if you can solve the cooling it would be outstanding. More energy adds more than throwing in light material - it just balances out with hydrolox due to the temperature-limited reaction, making the energy unavailable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alternative choice, which in the above list from Gaarth you can see that modern engines start to prefer, is that if you mix in more oxidizer and accept the increased heat, you significantly improve overall propellant density, allowing smaller tankage. Hydrogen isn\u0027t dense at all, so using relatively large amounts increases the overall size of the tank for the fuel mass to get your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Using less, and more dense oxygen instead, small tanks that are easier to manage, and potentially lighter. As such you see the Vulcain 2, the most modern first-stage engine, where it makes the most difference, pushing all the way to 6.7:1. Note that the flat range of equal Isp for all mixtures only applies when fuel-rich, however; it\u0027s another property of hydrogen being light that it can cool the mixture and keep high Isp. Heavy oxygen doesn\u0027t work, so the goal is to push towards stoichio, and ideally leave it there for maximum propellant density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for nuclear thermal rockets, they\u0027re not just somewhat cooler, they\u0027re significantly cooler - even 1500K would be very hot. They still get high Isp due to how light hydrogen is, and that they can get that temperature with no need for a fuel reaction at all - therefore they can push the equivalent ratio to infinity fuel:oxidizer, without losing energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
