The pressure of my sucking was causing it to rotate in the cup. I figure it was having more come towards to low pressure than there was available to enter my mouth.\n\nCould this rotation be harnessed, say in space, to generate energy from the vacuum? My concern is that space has no energy, so where is it coming from? Space sucks. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI figure the energy is coming from the pressure of the water, which would be stored in the water on earth.\n\nWater battery?\n\nIt could be done with any fluid, theoretically.\n\nWill it work for power generation?"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:38:38Z","Content":"It\u0027s the ambient air pressure that\u0027s pushing the liquid up into your mouth, and earth\u0027s atmospheric pressure won\u0027t allow you to suck a column of water higher than about ten meters, as that\u0027s where the pressure of the extra water in the straw matches the atmospheric pressure.
