We can\u0027t breathe those things. There are so many\u00A0other related things which are understandable if you read the following. I present to you, the Laythe Theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Laythe\u0027s orbiting with\u00A0other large objects near it. Plus it\u0027s on rails. This means it goes through a lot of tidal\u00A0stress as its mass is trying to move towards Vall and Tylo but the object is stuck in its current orbit. It actually doesn\u0027t get that much tidal stress as Io. See, Io orbits a 318-Earth-mass object. Laythe orbits an 80-Kerbin-mass object. Much less tidal force acts on Laythe.\u00A0That is why the surface isn\u0027t molten completely, and Jool\u0027s low\u00A0mass relative for a Jovian planet is also the reason\u00A0why radiation doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem ingame on Laythe. Jool simply isn\u0027t capable of causing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, we need to address Laythe\u0027s water. Jool was much hotter back when it and its\u00A0moons formed. This meant that no ice could accumulate around Laythe\u0027s orbit, it was all boiled away. Laythe needs to have gotten its water some other way, more recently. My theory is that geologically very recently, a small icy dwarf planet\u00A0entered the Jool system, shattered into tons of tiny bits due to tidal forces,\u00A0and most of\u00A0the bits collided with Laythe. Remember, objects in KSP are on rails, but passing through an object\u0027s SOI can change your orbit. And tidal forces obviously exist in KSP, there are things that are tidally locked. That showered the moon in water. It already had a thick atmosphere, at Kerbinlike pressures,\u00A0and an average temperature only a bit below\u00A0freezing. The water vapour that entered the atmosphere began to heat the moon up as it deposited near the poles as ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the moon is warm enough that it can have widespread water. Suddenly oceans appeared across the moon. The polar ice deposits, snowed on by water vapour put into the atmosphere by entering, evaporating ice asteroids, are beginning to melt. This explains why Laythe\u0027s former polar caps were grounded, even though they were well below sea level. They were there before the water was. So Laythe is eventually covered in a global sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me tell you what happens with tidal forces. Yes, those are still important. They put stress on the crust and cause volcanoes to pop up everywhere. On Laythe, these are all underwater. Sometimes there is a mega-eruption that has effects above the shoreline. A few weeks ago, a fellow KSP player posted a picture of a very large region on Laythe looking \u0022sick\u0022.\u00A0It looked to me like dark volcanic sand. Probably a very large eruption happened and covered the old ground up. Anyway, when these are underwater, they have the effect of boiling a ton of water. This all goes to the upper atmosphere as water vapour. This means most of Laythe is covered by clouds at any given time.\u00A0\u00A0Water vapour is a strong greenhouse gas. So it heats the atmosphere. It\u0027s also high enough above the bulk of the air that solar radiation can get to it. Solar radiation can\u0027t get to the surface,\u00A0but at the edge of the atmosphere it\u0027s as strong as it should be. Laythe gets 1/16 the light Kerbin does. There is still enough to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, especially considering Laythe\u0027s lack of a magnetic field (spins too slowly) and its orbit being in Jool\u0027s main radiation belts. We have a crisis. Welcome to the Laythocalypse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a preview\u00A0on that environment\u0027s demise.\u00A0The water vapour, which now makes up a significant part of the atmosphere, is breaking up into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is escaping. The atmospheric pressure\u00A0in 1.0\u00A0(0.6 atm)\u00A0is only three-quarters what it was in 0.90.\u00A0The water vapour is heating up the moon. The average temperature in 1.0 (16 degrees, IIRC) is, like, 12\u00A0degrees higher than it was in\u00A00.90. I am hearing preliminary reports that by 1.1, the polar caps are 100% gone. Not a trace. The milder temperatures are keeping water vapour from condensing for longer, letting more be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Volcanoes are causing massive changes to the land. The air is disappearing\u00A0and the radiation in space is getting closer and closer to the ground because the air can no longer protect it. Eventually most of the air is gone and Laythe cools down again, this time to far below freezing as there are now frozen oceans to reflect light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Laythe got water from a shattered dwarf planet. It got\u00A0oceans. Then\u00A0Laythe\u00A0clouds over,\u00A0overheats, then\u00A0loses most of\u00A0its air\u00A0and almost all of\u00A0its greenhouse effect, and as a result it becomes a cold\u00A0wasteland reminiscent of Duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf something doesn\u0027t make sense about this, let me know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T04:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222519694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460950365\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139989\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Findthepin1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Findthepin1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJovian planet is also the reason\u00A0why radiation doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem ingame on Laythe.

Only the other muns would cause waves to worry about, and they are never all aligned at once, so the tides should be quite manageable for anything below the low-tide line.
