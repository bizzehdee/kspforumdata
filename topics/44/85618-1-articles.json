The US and the USSR both toyed with the concept during the 60s and 70s. The Skunkworks managed to get a working nuclear jet engine, but the engine was lethal to the crew without shielding, but required no fuel. Once you added shielding it became to heavy for the power it was generating. The other method was to have the ignition caused by the reactor itself, but this lead to a heavy radioactive exhaust which is just bad all around.
