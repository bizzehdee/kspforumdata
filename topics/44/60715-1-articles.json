Because there is a significant difference between the 2. In the former case we would never be able to achieve chemical spaceflight. You\u0027d need so much dV you\u0027d need an orion drive just to get to orbit. In the latter case surface gravity is only 0.01G.

We handwave away the physics that says this planet shouldn\u0027t exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, we\u0027d obviously have a lot more resources to play with. Jupiter\u0027s radius is about 10 times as large as Earth, so we\u0027d have about 100 times the surface area. If we assume that our current civilization was somehow transported to this new planet we could relax. We\u0027d have plenty of resources to give everyone a very comfortable lifestyle while still keeping vast wildlife reserves around. Furthermore, the ecosystem of such a planet is much more stable. We\u0027d have to pump out 100 times the CO2 to have the same effect on the global temperature as we do on our earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolcanism would be on the rise however. Earth doesn\u0027t really like big tectonic plates, they trap too much heat under the center which causes them to break up. So we\u0027d likely see the big continental plates fracture after a few million years. This isn\u0027t as dramatic as it sounds, it just means some volcanoes pop up in areas you wouldn\u0027t expect (African mainland, east coast of north america etc) and over the next few 100 million years they\u0027d drift apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a reason for concern is the weather. Even on earth rainclouds often have trouble reaching the middle of a continent. If it has to travel 10 times the distance most continents will become very dry. So we\u0027d likely see large scale desertification around the world. Meanwhile the coast has bigger issues. Hurricanes tend to build up energy while over warm water and lose energy while over land. On earth this means that can\u0027t get all that strong since they\u0027ll eventually reach land and run out of juice. On the new super earth they can stay over the hot ocean for months, building up immense power. If one of those hits the coast you\u0027re going to have a bad time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat gradients across the globe are also 1/10th of what they used to be. So a lot of things we take for granted simply stop working. Europe will get very cold without the gulf stream providing warm water for example. And a lot of the prevailing winds will also likely shift. So weather would change on a global scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we manage to adjust to our new climates we still have some other issues to contend with. The larger distances make trade a lot less economical than it is today. So expect the economists to start crying. The larger distance also means slower data transmissions. If you\u0027re playing a game in europe on an american server you\u0027ll see a significant increase in latency. Flights to other parts of the world will also take longer and require more refueling stops. A trip across the atlantic takes about 9 hours today. So using the same plane it would take nearly 4 days on the new planet. This means transatlantic passenger flights are a no go and they have to divert over the arctic with a few refueling stops along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027d probably survive, but the world economy would become a lot less prevalent with more focus on local production.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T11:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I think he means is what if the Earth had the same surface area as Jupiter and kept the same conditions we live in now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObvious, however this would have other impacts like gravity gradient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how the weather patterns would be like, anyway if we assume earth like conditions on surface it would have little impact until you started to get decent boats, now you get an age of exploration who would last far longer, you would miss out continents until you had radios and planes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore place for both animals and cultures to evolve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T11:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigher variance in plant and animal life, resistance to mass extinction events, that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T12:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if all plants \u0026amp; animals were proportionally bigger.

This means your structure can support 4 times the stress. But the volume goes up by a factor 8. Since weight is a function of volume your structure weighs 8 times as much. 8 times the weight on just 4 times the structural integrity means your structure is now weaker relatively speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why ants lifting 100 times their own body weight isn\u0027t that impressive. If we shrunk down a human to ant size (s)he could do the same. Making everything 10 times bigger has the opposite effect. A 20 meter tall human wouldn\u0027t be able to stand since his legs would snap under the weight. He would pass out if he even tried since his heart can\u0027t muster the pressure needed to pump blood to the brain. Lifting an arm would be nearly impossible and likely disjoint the shoulder. All in all, we\u0027d have a pretty bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
