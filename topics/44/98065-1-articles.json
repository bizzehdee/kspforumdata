Simply send the components required into low earth orbit, and assemble a ship there. Head out to a nearby asteroid a kilometer or two across, and set up a mining operation. Refine the resources either at that location or near another, more suitable location and vent the toxic fumes into space... Or find some other suitable way to dispose of them. Fuel can be obtained from water sources on ice moons, and the facility can be powered through either a fission reactor or a solar array. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial start-up costs are obviously going to be quite high. That doesn\u0027t matter, because the payoff that one could receive for bringing a metric ton of refined platinum, or whatever it is that you manage to mine out of the asteroid would be rather large. Rare resources on earth may be more common in asteroids. In order to save money, probes can be constructed to land on and then \u0022prospect\u0022 potential asteroids to find out the materials contained within, with rare metals such as gold being prioritized over more common elements, such as aluminum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the more basic material can be brought back to earth orbit after it is refined, and then machined into parts that are assembled in spaced allowing for more mining facilities to be constructed, increasing output. Contracts can be taken for space stations and ships, which are then assembled in orbit for a large fee. The truly rare resources are essentially a massive source of profits, and so by returning these to earth we allow for an expansion of industry on the planet, with rare resources suddenly not quite as rare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may be some challenges associated with this, but these can almost certainly be overcome, if not at this moment in time then within the next decade.

Many oil deposits are located in areas (oceanic crust) where the crust is young, only a few hundred million years. The oil and coal is located right int he middle of sedimentary layers of rock. How did it get there if it wasn\u0027t through biology? Oil can\u0027t melt its way up from the mantle like magma, and the high temperatures of the mantle would destroy it anyway. So either oil has a biological origin or the great Oil God simply dropped it out of the sky. This proves that it was something that was not born with this planet, but created afterward. Oil and coal are concentrated carbon, and carbon does not make up very much of this planet. The only way to concentrate it to such degree is through biological processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is it possible to create oil without biological processes? Sure.
