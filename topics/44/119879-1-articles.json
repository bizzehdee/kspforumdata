The concept of trying to create a dispersive magnetic fiels from satelittes or isolated magnetic fields on the surface will not work, the magnetic field lines from two poles even separted at one end by entanglement will be distorted through the planet, or travel point to point on a surface array. To top that off the entangled pairs may force the lines throuh the fictitious wormhole.
