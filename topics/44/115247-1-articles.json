Being a huge KSP Interstellar fan, I obviously steered towards the Thermal Turbojet, but decided not to include a Quantum Vacuum engine, for its feasibility is anything but solidly proved. \n\nFor those who don\u0027t know, a Thermal Turbojet is an engine which works by running the atmospheric air from the Intakes over the walls of a working reactor, which heats it to high velocities before it gets expelled from the nozzle. This allows an aircraft to fly (in theory) without consuming any fuel other than the reactor fuels, as long as it stays in the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, I realised that this kind of engine could work anywhere in deep space, as long as there is a gas flowing through the assembly. Obviously, this gas cannot come from the environment of the ship, but could be derived from gas stored on high pressure in internal tanks. This would consume the internally stored air, of course, but the propellant would still be an absurdly abundant resource that it could be refueled with on terrestrial (or other planet\u0027s with an atmosphere) soil for as long as humans have air to breathe.\n\nSo, which are your opinions? Would such an assembly actually work? Would an element I did not know of prevent this? Would I need impracticably huge tanks to accomplish this? Am I missing something else? Am I ready for the funny farm after proposing such a concept? Whatever it is, let me know!"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:19:01Z","Content":"What you\u0027re proposing is basically a combined-cycle nuclear-thermal engine that can use either internal propellant (which should be stored as a liquid because high-pressure gas tanks have abysmal mass ratios and density) or external air.

I\u0027m not sure how feasible it would be to make one that worked *well* because your cooling channels need to be either compatible with both liquid and gas or you need multiple sets of cooling channels.\n\nHmmm, I see your concern. First of all, yes, I hadn\u0027t taken the mass ratio of air in account. Well, that would complicate the refueling process slightly, but we can liquify air can\u0027t we? (Well, at this point the handling difficulties and propellant inefficiency might be so large we might as well turn to specialised fuels as hudrogen, which beats the purpose a little -since the engine is now literally a NERVA in all ways possible. I\u0027m not too sure, though ) \n\nAnd well, the whole point is that the Thermal energy is transferred to the propellant which is then expelled, simplifying the cooling system. Now, how different cooling systems are for liquids and gasses, I have no idea, so someone will have to indulge me on that. And a possible workaround for this would be liquidating the air from the Intakes on the fly -but at this point, again I think this is too similar to a proposed engine concept. I would think SABRE without being sure , but if that\u0027s the case, there is still the matter of the reactors presence to differentiate them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So... basically a RAPIER thermal turbojet?\n\u003E It would require a very large amount of air stored.\n\nActually...

The problem\u0027s very simple - thermodynamics means that at a given temperature, a gas with heavier molecules has a slower average velocity.\n\nSo for a nuclear thermal rocket, the temperature of the rocket jet has to be low for 2 important reasons :\n\n1. If it\u0027s too high, the reactor parts or the engine bell will melt\n\n2. You\u0027re getting rid of reactor waste heat by the gas flowing through the reactor\n\nIf you use pure hydrogen as propellant, you get impressive ISPs of about 1000 or more, but if you use air - oxygen and nitrogen in a 40/60 mix, say - you get worse performance. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_speed)\n\nIf the ISP with hydrogen is 1000, a gas that has a mass of 1, oxygen has a relative mass of 16 (we don\u0027t care what units they are to use this mathematical relationship). If you look at the equation, you are dividing by the mass and taking the square root. Anyways, it means that you divide by the square root of 16, or 4, so you get an ISP of 250 using oxygen.\n\nThat\u0027s awful. So now your nuclear scramjet has to have this gigantic tanks of liquid oxygen, since it\u0027s going to need impractical amounts of it, and that adds drag, and so it can\u0027t get as high a velocity in the upper atmosphere, and basically we aren\u0027t going to space today. \n\nOh, several more show-stoppers :\n\n1. The neutrons and gamma rays coming off a respectable nuclear scramjet engine will fry any astronauts in the same vehicle, giving them a lethal dose in seconds. You would need impractically heavy amounts of shielding - 50 tons or more of it.\n\n2. If you ever do make it to space, you better deploy some radiator fins fast, because your nuclear thermal rocket is emitting many gigawatts of waste heat. Going to be hard to get rid of that - droplet radiators are a lightweight way to do it, but you can\u0027t deploy those until you\u0027re in real vacuum. \n\n3. If you use tanks of liquid hydrogen, the only practical way, then your reactor core has to survive both exposure to hydrogen (reduction) *and* high temperature oxidation. It is very difficult to find a material that resists both at high temperature. Not sure if it\u0027s chemically possible. \n\nI did this exercise as well. I concluded that you want a rocket with several stages that each boost the next one up, and you propulsively land the stages back on the planet. You refuel the stages with ISRU - on an earth-like planet, this would be really easy since there\u0027s huge amounts of water, C02, and oxygen in the air. You basically give up the ISRU plant, and the lower stages of your rocket permanently - but you can reuse em over and over if you had the technology to maintain them in the field.\n\nNuclear is just a bad idea. It\u0027s ok if you\u0027re going to stay in a vacuum and you don\u0027t need as much thrust and you can have the reactor really far from the crew on a long thin boom.\n\nBut for leaving a planet, in a way, a rocket is a vast pile of chemical energy that you\u0027ve set up in just the right way to release all that energy very quickly. You could use a nuclear reactor to supply the energy to run the ISRU plant to make the fuel, but you don\u0027t want to carry that reactor on your lift vehicle. For one thing, the weight of the reactor is dead weight, it represents potential fuel you could have carried instead.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T03:32:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T08:42:29Z","Content":"The US airforce tried nuclear planes in order to design the ultimate strategic bomber.
