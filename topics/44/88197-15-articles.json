That\u0027s kind of the point. There are loop-holes in just about everything that you might practically want to do. It\u0027s kind of what applied sciences are all about. The key is to distinguish understanding all of the rules, and knowing how to exploit them to achieve seemingly impossible goals, from charlatans or honestly misguided individuals who simply press on under a naive delusion that any rule can be broken. Any rule can be \u003Cem\u003Ecircumvented\u003C/em\u003E, and that\u0027s far from being the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConservation of energy and momentum are \u003Cem\u003Ethe most\u003C/em\u003E fundamental principles we know. I\u0027m prepared to discuss that with anyone who actually understands where these come from. If one doesn\u0027t understand Noether\u0027s Theorem, and one wishes to keep insisting that we can\u0027t possibly know for sure that these are fixed, one would be much wiser to just shut up. Trying to bet on any tech that violates these is beyond dumb.

In fact, that condition is always violated for virtual particles. They don\u0027t have to even be moving in the same direction as their momentum points. More usefully, it is violated by warp drives. FTL travel results in causality violations, and there\u0027s a pretty well-argumented conjecture in GR that suggests that it will always require exotic matter, which may or may not be possible to attain in any significant quantities. But on the other hand, no such restrictions exists for sub-light warp. I\u0027m not aware of a viable configuration that allows sub-light warp without exotic matter, but at least that\u0027s on the table. There is nothing says that it doesn\u0027t exist. In fact, a lot of things suggest that it probably does. A good ion drive, a power supply, and a sub-light warp, and you can go anywhere in the Solar System within hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is far beyond anything the EMDrive is promising, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E plausible.

Worse, we get a bunch of people with no expertise in the area saying, effectively, \u0022Hur, dur, you can\u0027t know it wont\u0027 work.\u0022 Oh, and every time one of these mentions virtual particles, it reminds of a line from Idiocracy. \u0022Duh. It has electrolytes.\u0022 First you learn what a virtual particle is. No, not read about them in Wikipedia, but actually study some basic Field Theory to actually understand what it means. Then you can talk about them as if they explain something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you see, I hope, why I\u0027m a bit uncomfortable comparing this to cold fusion. Cold fusion isn\u0027t impossible. Some very specific ideas about it are, but someone could, foreseeably, build a cold fusion reactor. Yeah, it will be some sort of \u0022cheating\u0022 or other. Whether with a catalyst or some other trick. But there is nothing \u003Cem\u003Efundamentally\u003C/em\u003E wrong with fusion at room temperature, and so there could exist workarounds of the obstacles within the rules. This is not at all the same as someone suggesting that momentum could be not conserved, or get absorbed into something other than radiation, outflow, or environment. That\u0027s not working around the rules. It\u0027s pretending they don\u0027t exist for lack of knowing better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm...

All of these paths contribute to virtual particle exchanges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entirety of your knowledge seems to be picked up from popularized science shows and articles, and maybe a bit of Wikipedia. If you want to actually be able to talk about virtual particles, you need a course in Classical Mechanics, Electridynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity, Introductory Particle Theory, and Introductory Quantum Field Theory. Typically takes about 3-4 years in college into the first year of Master\u0027s program.

That\u0027s kind of the point. There are loop-holes in just about everything that you might practically want to do. It\u0027s kind of what applied sciences are all about. The key is to distinguish understanding all of the rules, and knowing how to exploit them to achieve seemingly impossible goals, from charlatans or honestly misguided individuals who simply press on under a naive delusion that any rule can be broken. Any rule can be \u003Cem\u003Ecircumvented\u003C/em\u003E, and that\u0027s far from being the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConservation of energy and momentum are \u003Cem\u003Ethe most\u003C/em\u003E fundamental principles we know.

If one doesn\u0027t understand Noether\u0027s Theorem, and one wishes to keep insisting that we can\u0027t possibly know for sure that these are fixed, one would be much wiser to just shut up. Trying to bet on any tech that violates these is beyond dumb.

In fact, that condition is always violated for virtual particles. They don\u0027t have to even be moving in the same direction as their momentum points. More usefully, it is violated by warp drives. FTL travel results in causality violations, and there\u0027s a pretty well-argumented conjecture in GR that suggests that it will always require exotic matter, which may or may not be possible to attain in any significant quantities. But on the other hand, no such restrictions exists for sub-light warp. I\u0027m not aware of a viable configuration that allows sub-light warp without exotic matter, but at least that\u0027s on the table. There is nothing says that it doesn\u0027t exist. In fact, a lot of things suggest that it probably does. A good ion drive, a power supply, and a sub-light warp, and you can go anywhere in the Solar System within hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is far beyond anything the EMDrive is promising, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E plausible. And here we are, instead of funding theoretical research into things we could actually do, we throw money away on sending leaky microwave ovens into space. Worse, we get a bunch of people with no expertise in the area saying, effectively, \u0022Hur, dur, you can\u0027t know it wont\u0027 work.\u0022 Oh, and every time one of these mentions virtual particles, it reminds of a line from Idiocracy. \u0022Duh. It has electrolytes.\u0022 First you learn what a virtual particle is. No, not read about them in Wikipedia, but actually study some basic Field Theory to actually understand what it means. Then you can talk about them as if they explain something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you see, I hope, why I\u0027m a bit uncomfortable comparing this to cold fusion. Cold fusion isn\u0027t impossible. Some very specific ideas about it are, but someone could, foreseeably, build a cold fusion reactor. Yeah, it will be some sort of \u0022cheating\u0022 or other. Whether with a catalyst or some other trick. But there is nothing \u003Cem\u003Efundamentally\u003C/em\u003E wrong with fusion at room temperature, and so there could exist workarounds of the obstacles within the rules. This is not at all the same as someone suggesting that momentum could be not conserved, or get absorbed into something other than radiation, outflow, or environment. That\u0027s not working around the rules. It\u0027s pretending they don\u0027t exist for lack of knowing better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm...
