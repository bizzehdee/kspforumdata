However the dust praticles traveling at that speed would easily burn an exposed ankle for anyone warking around bare foot. Note: calculation base on 1/100 martian/earth basal atm pressures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T12:02:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no \u0022kph\u0022.

The wind isn\u0027t very strong, but it\u0027s enough for the dust to get in everywhere. It\u0027s abrasive, so you have to design your equipment with seals and filters to prevent ingestion and clogging. It\u0027s also toxic, so you don\u0027t want to get it inside the vehicle. This is why NASA is looking into suitports rather than airlocks for most EVA activity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
