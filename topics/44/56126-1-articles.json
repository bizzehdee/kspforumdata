We think that organisms require water and DNA and RNA simply because every organism on Earth has these things. That is an incredibly limited sample size when we look at the scale of the universe. My point is that because its all we\u0027ve ever seen, its all we are capable of thinking about. Life on other planets may use some other self-replicating molecule or it could be silicon-based instead of carbon because silicon, being a metalloid with a \u002B4 oxidation state, has similar properties to carbon. I do agree that water and carbon\u0027s versatility makes them prime factors but I am also going to say they are not the only things life would require\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I cannot with any certainty say what lifeforms other planets would look like or what they would be made of. However I would contended that we would immediately recognize them as living.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Simple. Life is all a question of meeting certain basic requirements. Does it reproduce? Does it respond to its environment in a meaningful, non-random way? Does it exhibit a complicated, multifaceted chemical structure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even though we may not be able to anticipate what life on other planets might look like exactly there are probably things that are going to remain pretty consistent. For instance, perceptive organs. Eyes are going to be pretty much the same because of the nature of light. If you have some other way of focusing light other than a lens with an aperture, I am eager to see it. Ears would be pretty recognizable as well. Maybe less so because other organisms may transduct sound directly rather than through a fluid-filled cochlea like in humans. Noses / nostrils, especially if the being depends on atmosphere for respiration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Black_sod","CreatedById":96750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T21:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust want to point out that this isn\u0027t MY definition of life, merely what I have been taught as the stance of biologists.

Worker bees, mules or freshly detached limbs are pretty much alive, but they don\u0027t really reproduce.

We have computer programs that decrease their own entropy by using electricity and computing power, some of them can even reproduce sexually. Companies consumes resources to grow, attack, and sometimes absorb, each other, split, mutate.

No one designed us, we arose naturally out of the organic soup and then come to where we are today through lucky chance and Darwinian evolution. Emergent life forms were \u0022designed\u0022 by the blind hand of Darwin, and are not likely to be as fit as well-designed Designed or hybrid life forms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Designed life forms are created by an intelligent civilization. They may be biological (chemical) in nature, they may be mechanical, they may be some combination of the two, or possibly, something we haven\u0027t even imagined yet. Because there is an actual intelligent designer responsible for the evolution of Designed life forms, they are theoretically capable of being far more fit and adaptable that the solely Emergent life forms. We do not yet have any examples of purely Designed life forms, though we know it is theoretically very possible. If we completely crack the DNA code, or computers crack it, then theoretically we can build any kind of organism we want, if we can find a way to piece together the desired DNA sequences. Alternatively, a sufficiently intelligent computer system, capable of reproducing itself or shaping its environment to its own desires, could also be considered a Designed life form. There is the question, however, of whether to class life forms with at least part of themselves designed via evolutionary algorithms as \u0022Emergent\u0022 or \u0022Designed\u0022. I\u0027m leaning towards \u0022Designed\u0022 however, as the conditions of the evolutionary algorithms, and what features are favored across the artificial generations, IS a very much designed set of parameters. The features that true Darwinian evolution favors are not under anyone\u0027s control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Hybrid life forms are what we humans are just beginning to dabble in through genetic engineering. Hybrid life forms will probably start as some Emergent organism that is modified in some desirable way. We have the very first of these now, as genetically engineered plants and animals, but these organisms are still like 99.99% Emergent. Of course the, strength of Hybrid life forms is that they can be created by such intellectual dunces as our 100% Emergent selves, because we don\u0027t have to understand how the entire organism works. It\u0027s a lot harder to make a major mistake, as Darwin has the bases covered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is my hope that humans will eventually overcome the stigma of \u0022playing God\u0022 and start modifying ourselves, once we have the means to do so in a safe and humane manner, that is. We are likely to give birth to Designed or Hybrid offspring (intelligent computers, at the very least, if not uplifted non-human animals, too), and unless we modify ourselves, we are likely to get very outclassed by our Designed or Hybrid descendants. Right now, humans are just wild animals. Think about it- we domesticated dogs, cats, cows, etc. to make them more compatible with humans. But we never underwent a program to make humans more compatible with humans. Never tried to increase our intelligence, and decrease our violent tendencies. We never tried to increase our fitness. We\u0027ve also never had to the technology to do so in a safe and humane manner either, but that is very likely to change. For example, if genetic tailoring becomes possible, all it takes is a small number of individuals doing it voluntarily to pass the positive benefits to the rest of the population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, with the likely advent of Designed and Hybrid life forms, perhaps not even the sky is the limit as to what kind of life we could expect to find in extrasolar planetary systems. If an advanced civilization had an influence or is still active, there could be life forms living among the asteroids. Designed life forms do not even need a habitable world, as long as they have energy and building materials, they can go and live anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I think that intelligent civilizations likely change the very definition of what counts as life. Darwinian evolution, and maybe even biology, may just be the stage that life forms go through before an intelligent race is evolved that acheives the requisite level of technology. Once that happens, the intelligent race takes over, replacing the blind hand of Darwin with more purposeful and infinitely more adaptive DESIGNED life forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, most emergent biologies will likely never progress to this stage, but some should, and they will be the most \u0022powerful\u0022 life forms in the universe, nearly infinitely adaptable, and thus, likely nearly immortal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this sounds a little crazy, but if our technological progress has taught us anything, it is to not discount the possibility of something that is not prohibited by the laws of physics. That is especially true for technologies we are ALREADY developing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T20:37:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
