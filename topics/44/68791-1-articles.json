A giant quad rotor might be a more suitable solution but the thin atmosphere would mean the rotor blades would need to travel at extreme speeds, meaning it would need a huge amount of power to generate enough lift to leave the surface, the only way to produce such a large amount of power would be to have a thermonuclear generator or a conventional chemical engine generator, both options would be ineffective since they would add so much weight to the craft (in the form of an oxidizer for the liquid fueled engine) it would need to be ludicrously big to lift off. which would prevent it from being effectively launched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to use a lighter than air aircraft filled with the natural atmosphere and using a thermally absorbent material for the balloon to provide almost free lift during daylight hours, then using a conventional electric propeller for propulsion, which could be powered by banks of solar panels.
