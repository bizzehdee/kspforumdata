Which is why I inquire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(From what I understand,) Orbital decay is the acting of particles in the \u0022vacuum\u0022 of space on an object in orbit - say, a satellite. Because the continued force applied, the velocity slows more and more until the orbit coincides with the atmosphere - that is, where the atmosphere is thick enough to cause enough friction to make the satellite get really, really hot, eventually to the point where it asplodes, certainly rendering the satellite useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, instead of using the occasional rockety burniness to fix the orbit to keep the very expensive, very heavy satellite in the target orbit, as I understand is usually done to space stuff which they want to keep in space, why not use consistently an extremely-high efficiency, extremely-low thrust engine - say, something along the lines of an ion engine? Or is KSP\u0027s rendition of ion engines markedly different from current real technology, in the attempt to make the gameplay more fun and simple? If so, why not use some real world equivalent that applies such a minute, carefully calculated thrust as to provide a force that combats the force of the particle friction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat say you to this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T01:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have actually been satellites that do just that. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Field_and_Steady-State_Ocean_Circulation_Explorer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGOCE\u003C/a\u003E is an excellent example.

This is basically the same propulsion system on Deep Space One. They actually use it for final orbital insertion and station keeping. This saves a good bit of weight over typical chemical systems (hyrdazine arcjet, etc.).
