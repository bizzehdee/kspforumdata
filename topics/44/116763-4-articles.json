Great for limited production quantities, but not very useful if one wants mass-production capabilities, even small-scale.\n\nA more likely scenario for orbital mass production would be to launch one Dragon filled with more production equipment, but no feedstock. Instead, a second Dragon docks in carrying feedstock a bit later, and stays docked while its cargo bay is slowly depleted of feedstock, and filled with products. When the second Dragon is filled with products, it undocks and deorbits; at the same time, a third Dragon goes into RDV with the first Dragon, carrying another load of feedstock, and docks not long after the second Dragon undocks. The cycle then repeats.\n\nThough, I agree that nobody has taken up this kind of offer yet.

Yes, this is a very interesting question. Namely, because there are a lot of misconceptions and the sheer range of the argument usually makes people mix up their timeframes.\n\nFirst, let\u0027s clear the air on some things. I\u0027m very dubious that solar power stations for ground use will ever be a serious thing. Too many issues when you look close at it besides cost, like garbage or simply available space on geosync, and it is probably not *neccesary*, so we\u0027ll crack the sustainable energy generation problem some other way for the foreseeable future. I\u0027m also very dubious the most commented-about schemes of asteroid mining ever work out, like platinum mining. Like people have said, they would crash any market if they had to pay back their infrastructure costs. Just my humble opinions there, being realistic.\n\nAnd yet, I think that the economical case for space is immediately obvious, and undeniably true: *Earth\u0027s resource base is limited, and we are already running against some of its limits*. Consider the mid to long term future. With a population of, say, 50 billion, how the hell do you give everybody a car? Or a house? How about with 500 billion? Do we all live as moles under the ground on closed ecologies to preserve some semblance of biosphere under our heads? So, I don\u0027t care what the costs of setting up in space are, or the technological challenges: either we want to keep growing our population like we have always done since the paleolithic and settle in space, or we stay stagnant on Earth until our eventual extinction. \n\nOf course you also have to consider that we have little conscious control on our growth, and we seem to be very bad at thinking about the environmental consequences, mid to long term, of the actions we undertake to survive and thrive in the near term. If you throw that into the equation, I can come up with an economical case for space: *environmental cost*. The environmental cost of ground-based activities will continue to rise in the future as the energy consumption per capita and the total population grows. At some point, it will be cheaper to settle space and eventually supply Earth from off-world resources... or we will have to stop growing before that, one way or another, and that is going to be painful (as in, war and calamities, maybe extinction).\n\nIn the meantime and short term, there *are* markets that could keep on making technological progress happen, until the cost/benefit makes viable the ultimate goal of a space-based primary economy. Commsats are the first and already proven, but I really think tourism can work, and scientific data, even though we don\u0027t pay for it directly, also has value, otherwise we wouldn\u0027t fund university R\u0026D, for example. And you can\u0027t buy the kind of wows Curiosity or Rosetta create any other way, so governments will continue to be a stable market. Ditto for defense spending, of course, that is only going up with the budget.\n\nRune.

If you dont prepare the path to the change, it will reach a point where all the world will face an economic collapse, because you need to leave fossil fuels but you dont have any alternative.\n\nSo even if something is not cost efficient right now, it will be a good investment if you know that is the path that the world will transit some day, so you can charge for patents or technology already develope by you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T14:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T15:04:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And yet, I think that the economical case for space is immediately obvious, and undeniably true: *Earth\u0027s resource base is limited, and we are already running against some of its limits*.

The first time we send astronauts back to the Moon we\u0027ll have a self-replicating factory for them to operate. So what if it takes 50 years to get there? It makes technical and economic sense. We absolutely can develop such technology with the raw materials already present on earth. We can send lightweight robot probes to study our solar system in the meantime, and stay in low earth orbit until it makes economic sense to go elsewhere.\n\u003E A self replicating factory - note there\u0027s intermediate versions of it, basically a roomful of 3d printers and CNC machines that need a constant supply of tiny high end parts like ball bearings and microchips - also makes the rockets to do all this a lot cheaper as well.\n\nOk. You win ten lotteries at once and become a billionaire. You look for something that can be manufactured at the Moon. Ideally, something light and valuable. Let\u0027s say (and I don\u0027t know) that manufacturing microchips in the Moon is, from an engineering viewpoint, feasible. You take your newly found fortune, you buy AMD and you move the factories to self replicating factories in the Moon\u0027s South Pole. And you begin to manufacture microchips.\nNow, here\u0027s the problem: all your customers are on Earth. A reusable vehicle would have to be able to return to the Moon from the Earth. It\u0027s cheaper to build, at the Moon, a vehicle that would go to Earth and doesn\u0027t return, specially if you also build a space elevator at the Moon. But that means you loose your freighter every time you send a shipment back to Earth.\n\nIn the meantime your competition, Intel, continues to manufacture their products from their factory in Costa Rica, aka, the country next to Panama and its canal. From there, they ship worldwide with ships, which are several orders of magnitude cheaper than a disposable Moon-to-Earth spaceship and are, well, reusable.\n\nHow does Space AMD competes with Ground Based Intel under such conditions?\n\n\u003E And yet, I think that the economical case for space is immediately obvious, and undeniably true: *Earth\u0027s resource base is limited, and we are already running against some of its limits*.

It will not reach 50 billion, let alone 500 billion.\nThe one economic activity that can take place in space is tourism for billionaires. Maybe, if the sabre engine works, launch costs will drop for light payloads. But that\u0027s about it. Real life isn\u0027t Firefly - space is a terribly hostile environment, extremely expensive to reach and which isn\u0027t commercially viable. Even if someone could make the point of (somehow) manufacturing spaceships in space so they don\u0027t need to get out of the Earth\u0027s gravity well, that still begs the question of who\u0027s buying those ships.\n\nAnd sorry, no, no NASA. Space agencies work as a way for the State to directly invest in strategic, highly valuable manufacturing which produces a lot of jobs and boosts the countries economies (as well as providing a front for military research and procurement - it\u0027s easier to tell the world that your country is developing a civilian, peaceful, rocket to put satellites in LEO than to announce an ICBM program). Take away the economy boosting effect of space programs by moving manufacturing to places where the country nationals won\u0027t be working, and that space agency has just lost a huge reason to invest that money."},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:02:53Z","Content":"Be carefull about those population asumptions.
