Pressurized tanks aren\u0027t actually that heavy compared to the alternative, which is a solid-fuel motor casing designed to withstand chamber pressures of 100 bars or higher with a very high safety margin. Plus, the vehicle will undergo very high accelerations compared to a launch vehicle, and experience very high aerodynamic loading, which means that the structure is heavy anyway. For an amateur-sized vehicle capable of supersonic flight, you\u0027d be very lucky to get 50% of your launch mass as fuel.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @SAI Peregrinus : wow gasoline and gaseous oxygen ? the Isp must be terribly low !\n\nI don\u0027t think the isp is that bad, although gasoline contains some compounds that would eventually mess up an engine. The main issue is that tankage for gaseous fuels is very heavy and takes up a lot of space. I doubt a GOX design would ever be used for a flyable vehicle. More likely oxidizers are nitrous oxide, which is relatively easy to work with and is used for most amateur hybrid rockets, or LOX if someone really needs the extra isp. Another potential oxidizer is hydrogen peroxide.\n\nFor fuels, I know ethanol and methanol are common. Propane should also be a good fuel; it\u0027s commercially available and very easily liquefied at room temperature. However, commercial propane contains additives to give it detectable smell for safety reasons; these could mess up an engine."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:20:38Z","Content":"So a turbopump I take it is a pump that works like a turbo, meaning that like in my car, it is driven by the exhaust gases and increases the input pressure to the ignition chamber which in turn increases the exhaust gas velocity?\n\nI assume the danger comes from a runaway situation causing an \u0060overpressure event\u0060\n\nWith a restriction baffle in the liquid fuel outlet would that not self regulate?\n\nSounds very simple to make and make safe for a one shot amateur rocket as long as it can be made strong and light enough.\n\nI\u0060ve obviously not thought enough about this."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T21:09:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So a turbopump I take it is a pump that works like a turbo, meaning that like in my car, it is driven by the exhaust gases and increases the input pressure to the ignition chamber which in turn increases the exhaust gas velocity?\n\u003E I assume the danger comes from a runaway situation causing an \u0060overpressure event\u0060\n\u003E \n\u003E With a restriction baffle in the liquid fuel outlet would that not self regulate?\n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds very simple to make and make safe for a one shot amateur rocket as long as it can be made strong and light enough.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0060ve obviously not thought enough about this.\n\nFar more complex, the turbo in the car run on the exhaust, however its already burned and not very high pressure.
