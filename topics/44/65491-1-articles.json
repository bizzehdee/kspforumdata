The Goldilocks zone refers to an area around a star where the conditions that would allow life to form are just right: not too hot, not too cold, not too much light, not too little light. The Earth sits in the middle of this zone, and has life. Yet every other planet, whether it is Mars or Venus, is inhospitable: too cold for ice to melt, too hot for water to stay liquid.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you even read the whole OP? If Earth was moved toward the orbit of Venus it could sustain liquid water, and it could if it was moved out to Mars\u0027 orbit.

Even at its current position, Earth has experienced times when its oceans have almost completely frozen over. I see no reason to expect that Earth would maintain any open surface water if it were located at the distance of Mars. I also would expect Earth\u0027s atmosphere/hydrosphere to have evolved differently if it were closer to the Sun where Venus is located. The higher temperatures there would have kept the water vapor in the atmosphere (instead of almost all of it condensing out into the oceans) where photodissociation would have split it into hydrogen (which escapes) and oxygen (which reacts with surface materials). There is certainly a distance from the Sun where the Earth would have been too hot for our liquid water oceans to form, and there is certainly a distance from the Sun where Earth would be completely frozen over. There will be similar boundary distances for planets with other masses or compositions (but those distances may not be exactly the same as for Earth), so the boundaries of the Goldilocks zone are fuzzy because of this. But the concept of the zone is valid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T21:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPublic North Carolina US school.
