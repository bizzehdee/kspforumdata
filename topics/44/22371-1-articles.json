His proposal would have used three Saturn IB launches--one to put an Apollo CSM just like the one that actually flew into Earth orbit, one to put a lander stage into orbit (essentially, a modified Apollo Service Module with a bigger engine, minimal consumables other than propellant, and landing legs), and one to put a transfer stage into orbit (basically, that one would have flown without any payload, but with a lengthened S-IVB to provide enough fuel for the transfer. Once all three are in orbit (and I don\u0027t know the order of launch, sorry), they\u0027d have the manned CSM dock with the lander stage, then have the combination of those two dock with the transfer stage, and off they\u0027d go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, while the official reason for using LOR was that it allowed the lowest total mass (and thus, theoretically, the lowest total cost), there were other reasons it was selected, too.

In fact one of the main reasons he supported LOR was because it would eventually lead to a more efficient EOR method, one based on a lighter and more efficient command module. At that time, with the current command module design and materials, LOR was preferable. He said, \u0022We believe the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous mode using a single C-5 offers a very good chance of ultimately frowing into a C-5 direct capability.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can read about those reasons, and other comments, in this actual NASA document from 1962. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/apollo6.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/apollo6.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more interesting thoughts that are rarely mentioned: \u0022We agree with the Manned Spacecraft Center that the designs of a maneuverable hyperbolic re-entry vehicle of a lunar landing vehicle constitute the two most critical tasks in producing a successful lunar spacecraft. A drastic separation of these two functions into two separate elements is bound to greatly simplify the development of the spacecraft system.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, the two craft could be designed separately at the same time with only very little consideration for each other. This allowed for a very simplified lander design that only had to consider landing and supporting 2 men on the moon and being able to dock back with the mothership. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to the OP: There really aren\u0027t any official designs that are specific for the other methods, because they were knocked down before they went beyond concept stages.
