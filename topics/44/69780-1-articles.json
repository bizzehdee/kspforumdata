However, the booster seperation will be approximately 500km downrange from the launch site, from what I understand and from comments from Elon Musk. Are these boosters supposed to turn around and come back to the launchsite? Surely not. Where will the site of the booster recovery be? On land, from what I understand, as is the whole point of powered rocket landing as opposed to using parachutes into the sea. Is there a specific targeted site? Is the flight plan of the recoverable boosters to just free fall until a certain altitude, re-fire the engine, re-orient to vertical, and touch-down? Or will it powered-flight to travel to a distant landing site?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurning around is exactly what the boosters will do.
