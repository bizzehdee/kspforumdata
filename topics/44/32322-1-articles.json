For example, i have 1 TNT stick, and i detonate it under ground, and it blows 1m x 1m hole (spherical). Now lets say i have 10 TNT sticks, and i detonate it underground aswell, so it will be perfectly 10x bigger than with 1 stick?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T17:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it will always be a solid.
