Why have two different cut-off dates for the crew vehicle and the rocket?\u00A0 I\u0027m sure you have reasons but, if you want to avoid the appearance of bias, you\u0027ll need to state them upfront and be prepared to defend them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore generally, \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E time that you\u0027ve had to make a choice about which data to present, you\u0027ll need to be prepared to defend that choice against accusations of bias.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that basis, the one-per-company rule is maybe not the best idea since any debate about companies and why one company\u0027s hardware is included but another\u0027s isn\u0027t, is where any Twitter debate is likely to get emotive. You\u0027ll also get the intransigents who define \u0027bias\u0027 as \u0027any opinion that differs from mine\u0027 but there\u0027s not much you can do about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might be better off having one set of criteria for vehicles which you\u0027re going to include in your database and then including everything that meets those criteria. For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Hardware under development\u00A0 for crewed spaceflight but which, to date, has not yet flown it\u0027s intended crew to its intended altitude.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would cover (if I recall rightly), Starship / Superheavy, SLS / Orion, Dreamchaser, SpaceShip 2, New Shepard, New Glenn, Vulcan, and Starliner. It would exclude Dragon 2 / Falcon 9 altogether (have flown crew to intended altitude) and Electron (not intended for crewed flight). SpaceShip 2 gets a pass because its intended crew are commercial passengers who haven\u0027t yet flown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere your narrative becomes: \u0022This is a database of up-and-coming crewed spacecraft. My definition of up-and-coming is this. Here are all the spacecraft that I\u0027ve had time to research which fit that definition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, Blue Origin get two vehicles on the list - but that\u0027s because they\u0027ve got two vehicles under development. That\u0027s not bias - that\u0027s just presenting all the data. It\u0027s also somewhat diplomatic - if\u00A0any idiot SpaceX fanboi gets all bent out of shape because Dragon 2 isn\u0027t included, then you can point out that Dragon\u00A02 isn\u0027t an \u003Cem\u003Eup-and-coming \u003C/em\u003Evehicle since it\u0027s already flown to the ISS with commercial crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you want to go broader.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Rocket propelled vehicles which have been under development since Year XXXX, where vehicle is defined as a single Block or version of an overall vehicle series.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would let you keep all your previous data but might also include Falcon 9 and Electron, depending on your cut-off date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like that anyway. Picking unbiased questions to answer is hard - just ask anyone who\u0027s had to draft a question to put to a political referendum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way of avoiding bias of course, is just to throw everything you can find into your database and then let folks mine that data any which way they like.
