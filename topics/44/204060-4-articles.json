we all know (or should) that the issue of climate change and the subset of arguments about anthropogenic climate change are hot-button topics which have been unfortunately politicized over the last several years.\u00A0 There is a tendency for those who spend intellectual and especially emotional energy in this space to bring the baggage of past arguments (and the associated emotional feelings) into new discussions.\u00A0 This is especially true for people who have previously engaged with others who express themselves emotionally and from a place of ignorance or willful denial.\u00A0 My perception of Slashy\u0027s comments was that they were in keeping with the generally approved conduct of this board - in that he had an opinion, stated it and claimed to have done research supporting that opinion.\u00A0 From what I read, he did so in a respectful manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my criticisms of how these arguments play out is firmly centered upon the emotionalism that both climate change deniers and exasperated anthropogenic climate change explainers bring to the table.\u00A0 The extreme proponents of both sides actually hurt their cause by focusing on the extremes.\u00A0 On the one side you have the \u0027Nope, nope, nope, nuttin happenin\u0027 group and on the other we get \u0027the worst case is going to happen, cataclysmically, and soon.\u0027\u00A0 Neither are true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people are not extreme in their beliefs.\u00A0 Some anthropogenic climate change deniers do accept that natural processes are causing a change in climate.\u00A0 Some anthropogenic climate change activists recognize that the Earth is resilient and that the processes will take time (decades to centuries) to play out.\u00A0 Many skeptics believe that something is happening - and it makes sense to reign in our pollution.\u00A0 In this space, education and good policy making can occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that it\u0027s the alarmists and the offended who get airtime.\u00A0 Some alarmists want us to abandon all technology and go back to subsistence farming like the Amish.\u00A0 Some deniers just don\u0027t care a whit about ecological damage if it means any reduction upon their wealth and convenience.\u00A0 The two sides scream and snipe at one another, which causes a lot of people to roll their eyes and wish everyone would just quit shouting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe takeaway I have from a lot of reading in this space is this: climate is hard.\u00A0 With everything from natural processes like the sun, the moon, volcanoes, Earth\u0027s orbit and our own wanton human pollution contributing to climate on the one planet we have... we should address the one part we have control over.\u00A0 Pollution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as seeing rivers catch fire in the \u002770s caused reasonable people to require change in industrial practices, I\u0027m fairly certain that reasonable people are seeing the effects of air pollution and are demanding change, now.\u00A0 It may not be happening as fast as some wish... but it \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Ehappening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---End of general lecture---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I will never have your education in math and science and I respect your knowledge.\u00A0 I will caution, however, that some of your arguments here have danced on the \u0027sudden, cataclysmic collapse\u0027 realm, as if all of the land-locked ice was imminently going to melt and flood the oceans as an \u003Cem\u003Eevent\u003C/em\u003E.*\u00A0 I don\u0027t point this out to challenge your authority on this issue -

we all know (or should) that the issue of climate change and the subset of arguments about anthropogenic climate change are hot-button topics which have been unfortunately politicized over the last several years.\u00A0 There is a tendency for those who spend intellectual and especially emotional energy in this space to bring the baggage of past arguments (and the associated emotional feelings) into new discussions.\u00A0 This is especially true for people who have previously engaged with others who express themselves emotionally and from a place of ignorance or willful denial.\u00A0 My perception of Slashy\u0027s comments was that they were in keeping with the generally approved conduct of this board - in that he had an opinion, stated it and claimed to have done research supporting that opinion.\u00A0 From what I read, he did so in a respectful manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my criticisms of how these arguments play out is firmly centered upon the emotionalism that both climate change deniers and exasperated anthropogenic climate change explainers bring to the table.\u00A0 The extreme proponents of both sides actually hurt their cause by focusing on the extremes.\u00A0 On the one side you have the \u0027Nope, nope, nope, nuttin happenin\u0027 group and on the other we get \u0027the worst case is going to happen, cataclysmically, and soon.\u0027\u00A0 Neither are true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people are not extreme in their beliefs.\u00A0 Some anthropogenic climate change deniers do accept that natural processes are causing a change in climate.\u00A0 Some anthropogenic climate change activists recognize that the Earth is resilient and that the processes will take time (decades to centuries) to play out.\u00A0 Many skeptics believe that something is happening - and it makes sense to reign in our pollution.\u00A0 In this space, education and good policy making can occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that it\u0027s the alarmists and the offended who get airtime.\u00A0 Some alarmists want us to abandon all technology and go back to subsistence farming like the Amish.\u00A0 Some deniers just don\u0027t care a whit about ecological damage if it means any reduction upon their wealth and convenience.\u00A0 The two sides scream and snipe at one another, which causes a lot of people to roll their eyes and wish everyone would just quit shouting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe takeaway I have from a lot of reading in this space is this: climate is hard.\u00A0 With everything from natural processes like the sun, the moon, volcanoes, Earth\u0027s orbit and our own wanton human pollution contributing to climate on the one planet we have... we should address the one part we have control over.\u00A0 Pollution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as seeing rivers catch fire in the \u002770s caused reasonable people to require change in industrial practices, I\u0027m fairly certain that reasonable people are seeing the effects of air pollution and are demanding change, now.\u00A0 It may not be happening as fast as some wish... but it \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Ehappening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---End of general lecture---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I will never have your education in math and science and I respect your knowledge.\u00A0 I will caution, however, that some of your arguments here have danced on the \u0027sudden, cataclysmic collapse\u0027 realm, as if all of the land-locked ice was imminently going to melt and flood the oceans as an \u003Cem\u003Eevent\u003C/em\u003E.*\u00A0 I don\u0027t point this out to challenge your authority on this issue - but rather to suggest that people like me are turned off by unnecessarily\u00A0alarmist language as much as we are by the categorical and wantonly stupid deniers.\u00A0 I\u0027m not implying\u00A0that you went full on \u0027the sky is falling\u0027 - but the frustrations you\u0027ve felt in trying to communicate in other arenas was evident, here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, I agree with you that we need to take pollution seriously, and change our habits.\u00A0 And we are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E (Event in human-scale terms, as opposed to a potential, lengthy process and gradual change over time).\u00A0 Nothing I have read leads me to finding that plausible.\u00A0 Perhaps it is something that - if our wanton polluting were to remain unchecked could happen over time - and ultimately cause us as a species some discomfort and economic problems.\u00A0 But as an \u003Cem\u003Eevent\u003C/em\u003E, that happens, suddenly, shockingly and catastrophically?\u00A0 No.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to comment that both \u0022denial\u0022 and \u0022alarmism\u0022 should be acceptable so long as actual data is provided. The way I took it from your post, alarmism is not good simply because it is a \u0022turn off\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this is not the same case, but if someone was interesting in swinging an axe at their head \u0022to see what happens\u0022 in the next five minutes, and I was frantically trying to convince them not to, would the frantic nature of my concern for this hypothetical person be \u0022alarmist\u0022? Despite myself having \u0022data\u0022 that swinging an axe at one\u0027s head will positively, undeniably result in death or serious injury?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to climate change, I think the denial has been pretty well disproven by others. As to the other end, are people really claiming that all of the bad effects of climate change are going to happen within the space of months or hours one day? Even among the likes of media outlets that claimed that 16 Psyche cost a billion quadrillion dollars or something, I have not seen such claims. Even if it is \u0022by 2050\u0022 (IIRC one of the earliest dates for the \u0022really bad stuff\u0022 to come into effect) it seems everyone recognizes all of this will take time. It is just that when it does eventually reach \u0022full force\u0022 it will be very, very bad (although the exact details of \u0022very very bad\u0022 are undetermined). Maybe not for those in the US and other first world countries with robust emergency response organizations, but for everybody else it will be. And of course, for\u00A0the other complex organisms on the planet too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the entire reason climate change is such a \u0022hot-button topic\u0022 is because it is politicized by its very nature. One of the major solutions/remedies to climate change is cutting back on CO2 emissions. This idea obviously would displease any (dirty) energy CEO. Those directly involved with dirty energy (those who rely on the oil industry for employment) also don\u0027t like that idea. These CEOs and employees of dirty energy companies were aligned to one political faction prior to climate change \u0022becoming a thing\u0022. Thus when climate change \u0022became a thing\u0022, those politicians naturally took up the cause of downplaying or denying climate change to save their supporters, either because they actually care about the cause of their supporters or simply because they want to be re-elected. And then that politician\u0027s/political faction\u0027s other supporters- ones who have no connection to dirty energy and otherwise likely don\u0027t care about how their energy is produced- tag along, keeping in line with the political faction\u0027s policies and beliefs.
