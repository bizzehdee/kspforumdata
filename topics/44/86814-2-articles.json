If you think of the space around the ship as a \u0022container\u0022 for the ship itself, the Alcubierre drive is moving the container, not the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that you won\u0027t be able to look into the past any further back than when you launched the ship with the Alcubierre drive on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the ship gets to 100LY out and stops (which would take AT LEAST 100 years from the Earth\u0027s frame of reference), if you wait a hundred years on the ship you can get news from \u0022100 years in the past on Earth from the ship\u0027s frame of reference\u0022 like you imagine.

Those same theories state that this process of reverting to a black hole is extremely violent even on a stellar scale. By that, I mean it can vaporize STARS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, time machines are possible, but not causality breaking time machines.
