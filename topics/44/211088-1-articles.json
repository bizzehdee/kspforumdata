Military uses satellite communication a lot, and civilian use of satellite internet and phones is becoming more common, but civilian use isn\u0027t at a point yet where it makes a strategic difference, I don\u0027t think. The most common use case for civilian use of satellite phones is for emergencies while far away from civilization, so that\u0027s people who live far away from any cities and occasionally some adventurous types who bring them on trips to the wilderness. Most of these will also have very limited data capabilities - it\u0027s there to call someone and request help if you\u0027re in a bind. For any other use, satellite phones are just too expensive. And the satellite internet is just starting to pick up, and it only makes sense to pay for it if that\u0027s basically your only option. So again, mostly places far from any major cities, very scarcely populated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference is pretty clear. If you are moving your forces through an area that has any sort of a population, the odds of somebody snapping a picture and posting it to Twitter, Telegram, Whatsapp, or whatever, is basically a certainty. Likewise, any sort of theft from civilian population by your military is going to result in some cell phones stolen and misused. Obviously, that latter bit will happen \u003Cem\u003Ea lot less\u003C/em\u003E in a disciplined army, but I don\u0027t think you can get it to zero incidents with any military force. These are things that can still happen with satellite phones, but it\u0027s in the category of a limited risk. With cell phones, it\u0027s just going to happen, and you have to deal with it one way or another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T07:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt allows recon by literally anyone, with GPS accuracy.
