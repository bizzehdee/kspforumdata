She recognizes my sister and myself most of the time, but can\u0027t communicate her thoughts very well if at all, and we want to know if she is aware of what\u0027s going on around her. If she can actually retain anything, if she is stuck in her own head and aware of what\u0027s going on... Is there any way to detect that through brain activity or neural responses? This is more for curiosity than anything.

That article is rather interesting... We ask her to move her right foot when my grandfather attempts to walk her to a chair, and after several requests, prodding, tapping the foot she is able to shift or move it slightly. It shows she is able to process certain things on a moment-by-moment basis. But is there some way to see if she understands what is going on around her? If you ask her a question and give her option A or option B, she will choose option B. Ask her again, option B or option A, she will choose option A, the last thing you had said. Whether this is simply her inability to properly verbalize things or an actual absence of cognitive understanding between the choices, well, I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T19:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that some useful steps were made in research in this area the last couple of years, though that focussed more on coma patients. Apparently they have a lot more tools to differentiate between vegetative patients and people that are just not able to communicate, among which scanning equipment (MRI or another variety). Apparently some patients are even able to answer simple questions through purposefully triggering certain brain responses, though that is a bit controversial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure I can tell you more useful information about that as I only read about it a while ago, but maybe it is a starting point to find someone that can help you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you talk to the doctors?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just read the link PakledHostage posted.
