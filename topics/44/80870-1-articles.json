By number of bombers it probably was Dresden, but the late war fire bombing of Tokyo was more intense, killed a lot more people and devastated a much bigger area. Fewer bombers were used because they were the big late war B-29s. With fewer aircraft they laid waste to an area more than twice as big as in Dresden, killed five times as many people, and they did it all in a single night. Tokyo was bombed a lot, but the March 9 Operation Meetinghouse raid was the single most concentrated slaughter of the war, bigger even than the A-bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T09:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 09:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Seret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T07:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that most of those mass city bombings would today be considered war crimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.onlinemilitaryeducation.org/posts/10-most-devastating-bombing-campaigns-of-wwii\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.onlinemilitaryeducation.org/posts/10-most-devastating-bombing-campaigns-of-wwii\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T11:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn term of bombers engaged, which is the biggest bombardment?\u003Cp\u003EWhen did it happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, finally, how many bombers were engaged?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs has been noted, the most devastating raid, ever, was against Tokyo.
