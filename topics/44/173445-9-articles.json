Given the dire warnings of cooling phenomena I\u0027ve heard floating about - polymerisation, coking and sulphur - how common is using kerosene to cool?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if they have to be careful about where they source their RP-1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerosene polymerization/coking temperature (at least for reasonably pure kerosene) is actually comparable to the coking temperature for propane. As long as you have enough of the stuff flowing through the cooling manifold that you aren\u0027t completely cooking it, it\u0027ll be fine. Here, however, the problem was that its tank temperature was too high to begin with, leading to it boiling (and possibly coking) due to changes in flow speed which lowered its boiling point thanks to Bernoulli, which meant a vapor gap, which meant not enough kerosene in the cooling manifold, which meant cooling manifold burn-through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t use kerosene for an expander-cycle engine, though, because its boiling point is too high to have a significant pressure change without a phase change. Methane and hydrogen (and to a lesser extent, propane) have a much wider temperature and pressure range in which they stay supercritical and thus avoid the dreaded phase change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also do things like the RD-180, where you use helium as coolant with a secondary heat exchanger to transfer that heat to another propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-02T00:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3395414082\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/kemp/status/1653025927578935301\u0022 style=\u0022height:562px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-11T13:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/astra-plans-reverse-stock-split-seeks-to-raise-up-to-65-million.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/astra-plans-reverse-stock-split-seeks-to-raise-up-to-65-million.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstra plans a reverse stock split, seeks to raise up to $65 million in offering\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacecraft engine manufacturer and small rocket builder Astra plans to conduct a reverse stock split at a 1 to 15 ratio, the company disclosed in a securities filing Monday.

For a number of reasons, no provider will capture 100% of that market\u2014but even if they did, it\u0027s just not that much money. I mean a small company like Astra might be happy with some 10s of millions in revenue per year, but that\u0027s only a thing until one of the 900 lb gorillas nearby show up... Starship and New Glenn. Both are large vehicles, and even at \u0022just\u0022 45t to LEO, NG\u0027s payload volume is huge, and if competitive with F9 makes \u0022small sat\u0022 sort of pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think many of these small startups at some point just hope to develop IP that entices a bigger competitor to buy them.\u00A0 Not a bad strategy if you have the IP to back it up I suppose\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStoke comes to mind.\u00A0 Even if they can\u0027t get market share, they have some interesting IP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-04T21:52:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2023 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 4\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-09T14:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3928855047\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1722601299949039682\u0022 style=\u0022height:103px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satnet","CreatedById":147366,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-13T05:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found an article covering their merger with a SPAC (Holicity): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.space.com/astra-launch-company-public-nasdaq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.space.com/astra-launch-company-public-nasdaq\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the article: \u0022The merger with Holicity values the company at $2.1 billion and is expected to provide Astra with about $500 million in cash proceeds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$30 million is a pretty steep discount from what they were valued at a couple years ago.
