Not that rocket engine exhaust was depleting the ozone, it was punching a hole, a gap, an actual area void of ozone... which would over time close up. The fact it created a \u0027hole\u0027 however was a concern. A few universities and publications such as National Geographic and Nature touched the topic. I do believe NASA itself also addressed the issue, but it seems to have gone away because there was no appreciable actual \u0022depletion\u0022. However, I myself wonder this issue, now that so many agencies and nations are doing launches. It seems almost every day (not literally of course) that someone is launching a new communications or weather satellite, or resupply to the ISS, or whatever. With the increase in these launches comes an increase in these \u0027holes\u0027. And while one of you (\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStreetwind\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E) mentions the exhaust from the liquid fuel rocket engines is not much more than water vapor, the solid rocket boosters ever-so more prevalent in use these days \u003Cem\u003Edo indeed\u003C/em\u003E contain exhaust elements which deplete the ozone... although the amount of depletion from such is still cited as being less than tenths or hundredths of a percent - which in time, and with increased launches on a regular basis, will rise as a contributing factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll note here the failure of NASA to successfully launch the QuikTOMS ozone monitoring satellite in 2001... and unless I\u0027ve missed something somewhere along the line, there\u0027s been nothing launched since to replace it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html#5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html#5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ. Is it true that launching the Space Shuttle creates a local ozone hole, and that the Space Shuttle releases more chlorine than all industrial uses worldwide?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cp\u003E A. No, that is not true. NASA has studied the effects of exhaust from the Space Shuttle\u0027s solid rocket motors on the ozone. In a 1990 report to Congress, NASA found that the chlorine released annually in the stratosphere (assuming launches of nine Shuttle missions and six Titan IVs -- which also have solid rocket motors -- per year) would be about 0.25 percent of the total amount of halocarbons released annually worldwide (0.725 kilotons by the Shuttle 300 kilotons from all sources).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The report concludes that Space Shuttle launches at the current rate pose no significant threat to the ozone layer and will have no lasting effect on the atmosphere. The exhaust plume from the Shuttle represents a trivial fraction of the atmosphere, and even if ozone destruction occurred within the initial plume, its global impact would be inconsequential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Further, the corridor of exhaust gases spreads over a lateral extent of greater than 600 miles in a day, so no local \u0022ozone hole\u0022 could occur above the launch site. Images taken by NASA\u0027s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer at various points following Shuttle launches show no measurable ozone decrease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, where are these images?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the ESA has (at least) addressed the issue somewhat...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/What_about_ozone/%28print%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/What_about_ozone/%28print%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not looking to be an alarmist or some kind of Eco-nut, but this was (still is) an issue and I do from time to time wonder why it\u0027s not been given notable attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T01:47:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the rocket launches combined are still trivial.
