I took a look at planetary composition back a bit for roleplaying / story purposes, but gave up part way through from the effort involved. A new element would be one way to address the densities issues. The angle I looked at it from was that the KSP Universe had similar, but different, scaling for materials and elements for lack of a better word.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an example, let\u0027s look at Kerbin. Density is 58.48 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3. Earth is at 5.514 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3. So an order of magnitude difference and some change. For this thought experiment, we can assume that materials are roughly 10x denser in the KSP Universe if we fix Kerbin\u0027s composition (silicate crust and mantle, iron metal core) to Earth\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJumping to our nearest neighbor, Mun / Moon, we have 29.13 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 to 3.3464 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3. Again, close but not quite, but like Kerbin to Earth the composition is probably close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings start to break down a little when we go to Eve / Venus [85.22 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 to 5.243 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3].
