Even so, not all of this can be utilized by any PV, because of wavelengths. Rosetta have 64 m^2 panels that generate ~325 W at 5 AU - dragging it to 10 AU would yield only 1/4 of that (~ 80 W) if the dimensions are the same. Now I\u0027m not sure, Rosetta weighs ~3000 kg already and NH needs 228 W at Pluto and weighs only ~500 kg. It\u0027s not hard to tell that a mission to Saturn needs to carry a fair amount of fuel...

Freeze below that, and the probe is toast, no matter how big the panel is or how little its instruments draw. Also note that the cells that power you on the outer system are also receiving solar radiation when you leave Earth... how hot can they get, and how much power can the transformers handle without melting? You are asking both extremes out of the same equipment during the flight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That is right, but those radiators are not only needed to reject the heat from the small solar panels, they are also to reject the heat received over all the sat surface.\n\u003E So is not a good example to compare the direct relation between (PV area---\u003E radiator area needed), and I remember you that RTG or nuclear power will also need radiators which size also depends on how close are you to the sun.\n\nNot really, the wattage out of a reactor is constant, so the only variable would be the solar radiation on the ship itself, which mainly depends on its cross section (and the radiators would be edge on to the sun, obviously). A solar system\u0027s heat output goes up as it receives more power, and down as it receives less, just the same as its power production varies. So a less dramatic variance for nuclear powered system, especially when the power considered is high with respect to the mass of the spacecraft.\n\nMe, I hope we see some space rector finally flying one of these decades. Once we get over our nuclear phobia and have some reactor operating safely for a few years, people will realize what a huge waste of time electric propulsion is in general, and we can get on with the thermal rockets that can truly open up the solar system to, you know, humans. VASIMIR and the like are a horrible diversion that doesn\u0027t stand up to the slightest scrutiny: that type of technology will *never* push humans, on account of humans not wanting to fry themselves spending weeks passing through the radiation belts. And they would never, ever, make a trip to Mars shorter, if anything they would make it *longer*. That particular bit always irks me when I read it.\n\nRune.
