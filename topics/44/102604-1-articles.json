I do not have knowledge of the situation there and any of my opinion is about as valid as a sneeze in the wind. I am simply saying that, while it is objectively better to have an actual medical professional looking into health problems, there are cases that we can\u0027t get those objectively better things, and have to settle for shady methods, which sometimes work thanks to placebo effect. Kind of like acupuncture. It doesn\u0027t do any actual medical effect that we know of. But it doesn\u0027t harm people in any way physically, and the placebo effect helps people feel better. \n\nOf course, this is all out of the window when someone is trying to peddle placebo for actual treatment for the same price. That should be shut down.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T01:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T17:31:54Z","Content":"Just give them a shot of 1ml of morphine mixed with 99ml water that helps a lot with headaches"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T17:50:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But it doesn\u0027t harm people in any way physically\n\nYou don\u0027t think smacking somebody repeatedly in the head is physically harmful?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:08:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t think smacking somebody repeatedly in the head is physically harmful?\n\nAs I said, if it is only superficial instead of actual smacking that can cause concussion.
