In the kerbal universe, gravity is a force applied by gravioli particles. These are material manifestations of quantum energy that are attracted to matter. Planets exert a strong pull on them. The pull of gravioli particles towards a planet pushes on spacecraft in orbit of that planet, forcing them towards the surface. Negative gravioli particles have the opposite interaction with matter and harnessing them would lead to anti-gravity technology. This is why the kerbals have a sensor for it. The problem is taht it is repelled from matter, thus always being pushed away by the presence of the detector, making the search pointless.\n\nThis is complete and utter BS made up on the spot.
