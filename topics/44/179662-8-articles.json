Clearly not locked nuts... Why not have the door-plug otherwise more door-like, and have the latch only on the inside, and nonetheless covered by the interior trim panel. It can then be removed (opened) easily for maintenance, and the only care required is to lock the door. All the functional doors have latches, after all, and they certainly take intent to unlatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video you posted explained this.

(I am sure the door monitoring system has an acronym, but avionics wasn\u0027t my specialty so I don\u0027t know it off the top of my head.) The system is likely already capable of supporting that door. The service bulletin will probably have a deadline for installation of the wiring and sensor(s) of 24 months to allow planning and implementation at a regularly scheduled heavy maintenance opportunity. And if they\u0027re worried enough about something coming loose during those 24 months, they will probably also include a requirement for a repeat inspection until the sensors are installed. Alert Service Bulletins aren\u0027t automatically Airworthiness Directives (ADs), but I would also expect an AD to follow, mandating that the Alert Service Bulletin be completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-11T20:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8805065522\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1745491519266542047\u0022 style=\u0022height:606px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-12T15:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore from FAA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-increasing-oversight-boeing-production-and-manufacturing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-increasing-oversight-boeing-production-and-manufacturing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) today announced new and significant actions to immediately increase its oversight of Boeing production and manufacturing.\u00A0 [...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actions announced today include the FAA conducting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- An audit involving the Boeing 737-9 MAX production line and its suppliers to evaluate Boeing\u2019s compliance with its approved quality procedures.
