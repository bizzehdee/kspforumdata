NASA\u0027s questionably-fated Space Launch System promises to (well, \u003Cem\u003Eintends to\u003C/em\u003E, at the very least) send 70 tons or more to the same place, on a mounting plate 8.4 meters in diameter. Blue Origin has a slightly smaller bird than those two in development with the New Glenn, and the Russian Energia corporation has also spoken about building a super heavy-lift launch vehicle (I\u0027 using Wikipedia\u0027s term here, I hope it\u0027s the correct one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, big rockets are fun and all (that very fact is presumably part of the reason why most of us are right here right now), but common criticism against these projects goes along the lines of \u0022they have no payload\u0022. This might be true for the SLS in particular, since it\u0027s very big and very capable, but not built to the specifications of any mission. The Falcon Heavy has also been mentioned to have problems integrating the heavy payload - lifting it to space is not an issue, but lifting the rocket from a horizontal to a vertical position might be. Let\u0027s just assume that the rockets work as intended without significant payload integration problems for the purpose of this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this thread I\u0027d like to discuss what all this super-heavy launch capacity could be used \u003Cem\u003Efor\u003C/em\u003E. What could you possibly (or feasibly, or economically) bolt to the tip of such large rockets and send into orbit with a meaningful purpose? I suppose \u0022recreating the Apollo missions\u0022 could be an answer, but let\u0027s try to be more creative than that. Besides, the Saturn V was even larger than the SLS, so presumably the latter wouldn\u0027t even be suitable for that purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI presume an obvious payload candidate would be whatever will success the ISS. Some perhaps-not-directly-applicable-to-real-life KSP experiences suggest that you can get away with fewer launches to build a space station if you assemble more of it on the ground and launch it in fewer, heavier parts, but volume might be an issue. Also, with limits of 8.4 meters and 70 tons to play with, you could probably launch a very big and capable space telescope. Or perhaps another rocket stage with a smaller payload destined for some far-off location - but where, and how?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T21:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think large probes could be sent out, like the ultimate probe, think Cassini, both Vikings,\u00A0and throw in a few Junos too, why not.
