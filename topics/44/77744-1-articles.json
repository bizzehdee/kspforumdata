In other countries you may need explosive licenses to buy or store AP or AP motors).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlack powder isn\u0027t a very good propellant for making your own motors, but most rockets use it to eject their parachutes.

The smallest I know of that are currently on the market are Aerotech\u0027s 18mm Ds, which are about the size of a black powder C.

These are out of production for a different reason: the hard-packed black powder used in model rocket motors is very brittle compared to AP, and in larger motors the propellant grain is vulnerable to cracking during handling. A cracked propellant grain means more surface area, which means a much faster burn rate, which means a case overpressure and catastrophic motor failure (CATO) which usually means a damaged or destroyed rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027re lighter than a BP motor for the same specs, but they still use a black powder chute deploy charge just like the standard BP rocket motors do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.

Steel requires a lathe and is heavy, so that\u0027s for serious, large rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo fat gypsum is my favorite. If properly made (it can be reinforced using nails and wire) and dried, it\u0027s tough enough, it\u0027s lightweight and it can be machined using standard available borers. You can even make a crude de Laval nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people use bentonite clay and ram it with a hammer, but they get a porous plug that easily chips away and will probably be pooped out as schrapnels when a more serious engine starts working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T17:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about aluminium? it\u0027s a soft and light metal that can be worked with tools made for wood (that will damage the tools though), and the melting point is over 600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopper is more expensive and heavy, but it has a much higher melting point, and is still relatively easy to machine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T17:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Idobox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Idobox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about aluminium? it\u0027s a soft and light metal that can be worked with tools made for wood (that will damage the tools though), and the melting point is over 600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.\u003Cp\u003ECopper is more expensive and heavy, but it has a much higher melting point, and is still relatively easy to machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAluminium will react with moist nitrates over the time, especially with ammonium nitrate.
