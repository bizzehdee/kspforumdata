In fact, I doubt it needs power, just judicious locking of articulations at the right times so the astronaut can exert force in the desired direction. At most, a complicated software and some accelerometers to keep track of things, at best you just have to train with it in order to learn when to lock each section of your legs, during each step, from your glove controls, or something along those lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
