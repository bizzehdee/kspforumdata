I figure out approximately how much time I need to burn to kill my orbital velocity and use that to determine when to start burning. When I\u0027m close to the landing site, I then use pitch to fine tune where I will touch down. It\u0027s a matter of practice, and one can get fairly close to the figures quoted in delta-v maps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T08:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that unless you want to visit an anomaly/easter egg site or perform a surface rendezvous, your landing precision isn\u0027t that important. Very few airless bodies actually have you passing over the surface at any significant speed (hello Tylo) in a low orbit, and even tiny biomes like Midland Craters or the like are many square kilometers across. Even in my most noobish of days I have never missed my intended target so far that I ended up in a different biome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if all else fails, you can still do a hybrid approach... go into a very low circular orbit (between 8 and 10 km). Then, instead of planning a maneuver node on the opposite side of the Mun that makes the periapsis touch the ground at your intended landing site, push the maneuver node closer to your intended target and increase the dV so that the periapsis disappears into the ground slightly behind your intended target. The further forward (closer to landing) you push the maneuver node, the more dV you will have to invest to achieve this trajectory, but also the steeper the descent curve will be. It\u0027s worth noting that this approach is often more useful in practical application than the idealized variant anyway, since the idealized variant ignores the fact that the Mun has topography and will sometimes result in plastering yourself into a mountain or crater rim while coasting to periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re now just slightly overshooting, you just coast down and, when you\u0027re directly above where you want to be, just perform the old \u0022kill horizontal velocity, drop straight down\u0022 maneuver. At this point you\u0027ll be only maybe a kilometer above the surface and moving very slowly already, so you won\u0027t really loose much in the way of efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JtPB","CreatedById":103925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T08:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei have the trajectories-prediction mod, which tells me where will i impact by considering the rotation of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso can i just burn in radial direction(away from the surface. yep i know this is bad idea for using in dV, but nonetheless) to land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T08:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour calculation describes the following landing profile:\u003Cp\u003E- Stop the orbital velocity completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drop straight to the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stop exactly at ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut consider the following landing profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burn retrograde until the periapsis is at ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Coast to periapsis (ground level).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- stop exactly at periapsis (ground level).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second landing profile is more efficient, you will need much less deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you optimize the second landing profile, you see that the lowest possible orbit is the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond profile is, in fact, the optimal policy if you allow for infinite thrust.
