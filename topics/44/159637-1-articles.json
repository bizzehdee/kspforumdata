Cassini-Huygens mission took almost seven years to reach Saturn flyby, and it\u0027s a one-way trip.

With helium-3 from Saturn to refuel possible fusion power reactors and fusion drives, a space colony in Saturn system is an ideal place to resupply food, water, air for the humans, and fuel and propellant for the spaceships. The problem is that there is no metal asteroid nearby, so the colony needs to import metal for expansion and building spaceship from asteroid belt, unless somehow they can substitute the metal with locally produced polymers, which is another story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gkirmathal","CreatedById":135480,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T11:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon;t know if you are talking about current day levels of technology or if you meant near future levels of technology (\u002B100 years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion if we become technologically evolved enough to a point where we can build (manned) large scale missions to Saturn, probably using (SC/GC) NTR propulsion, using local methane as the reaction mass would be very beneficial (ignoring the engineering issues of soot buildup for a second).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if humanity skipped NTR propulsion and got straight to fusion drives.

If you want something about as big as modern oil tankers, you\u0027d need either laser sail propulsion or some kind of nuclear pulse propulsion to scoot around the solar system at decent speeds. 100 km/s is actually pretty decent, as you can cross 10 AU in about 6 months. The real challenge is building a spaceship with enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. But we can do that, using nuclear pulse. That should be old hat by now, but we\u0027re not so lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we\u0027re looking at modern civilization, then of course it\u0027s insane to mine Titan. The cost is huge, the benefit won\u0027t pay off the cost for centuries, and we\u0027re beginning to move away from the biggest use of hydrocarbons: burning it. But in the far flung future? Any raw material, especially volatiles, will be extremely useful. Titan is perfect for this. Earth\u0027s carbon cycle shouldn\u0027t be interrupted to terraform Mars, or build colonies in free space. Titan is a great source of carbon and other organic molecules. Terraforming is super pie in the sky, but orbital colonies aren\u0027t so much of a stretch. They have the potential to evolve from space hotels. They can start as rotating bolas and eventually become cities in their own right. After all, hotels need staff. And they need to actually have other things to do in their area... It\u0027s not as much a fantasy as terraforming, at the very least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible, the laws of physics do not forbid it. Economic concerns, as well as technology, are the main prevention. Even so, eventually we\u0027ll be able to extract resources from Titan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no way we can have the technical ability to create 100x as many hydrocarbons than there are already are on this planet. Physics doesn\u0027t allow that. There\u0027s only so much Carbon in the Carbon Cycle. Would we need it? Most likely not. But even if we did, by that time it would be very likely that most humans wouldn\u0027t even be living on Earth anymore. You\u0027d need a solar system wide civilization for the economy and technology to mine Titan. As well as the demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush only goes so far. Eventually the bird in the hand will no longer be in the hand, and the two in the bush is way, way bigger than the one in the hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe infrastructure, from extraction to transportation, is actually very expensive, even on Earth. The average cost of an offshore oil rig is 650 million USD. Given a total of 1470 offshore rigs in the world, that\u0027s almost a trillion dollars worth of drilling rigs. So why is oil so cheap (relatively)? Because it produces a \u003Cem\u003ELOT\u003C/em\u003E of it, for a long time. What can a trillion get us for Titan mining? Hard to say, although it isn\u0027t likely it will be cheaper than Earth-based platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is certainly a lot of Detla-V. But if we\u0027re talking minimums here, it\u0027s about as much as going from Earth\u0027s surface to LEO. Heinlein wasn\u0027t kidding when he said that orbit is halfway to anywhere. Remember that both Earth and Titan have atmospheres, which will help braking for our minimalist approach. \u00A0A cheaper way to orbit will go a long way. As will nuclear thermal/pulse rockets, at least in space and far from Earth. And if the trend of greater energy availability per person continues, the energy to go from Titan to Earth will be negligible in the not so far future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not inherently ridiculous to ship it to Earth. It\u0027s entirely possible that future law will prevent oil and hydrocarbon extraction on the surface of Earth. Not likely, but possible. Meaning that the best source would be Titan. The energy cost per kg for a 100 km/s round trip from Titan to Earth is about 280 USD as of now, not counting inefficiency. But that can easily be cheaper in a future with a solar system wide civilization. Of course, this would only really apply to a laser sail...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, Titan will be great for any activities in the Saturn System.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelium-3 isn\u0027t worth it at all when mined from the Moon. The sheer amount of material you\u0027d have to sift through to get a decent number would make the thing very impractical.\u00A0Saturn still outshines the Moon even for Helium 3. It has far more, and it\u0027s easier to sift through gasses than solids, and easier to actually work on, as Saturn only has slightly more than 1g of gravity at it\u0027s \u0022surface.\u0022 The only issue is distance, but if we have fusion by then, we basically have torchships, and then distance doesn\u0027t matter nearly as much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBulk hydrocarbons\u00A0are necessary for a solar system wide civilization. Even beyond fuel, it\u0027s truly amazing. Used in everything from medicine, to plastics, to synthetic fibers, to lubricant for moving parts, to artificial tires, it\u0027ll be very important for a long time to come. And if we ever leave Earth, we\u0027ll need a much larger source than the home world has\u00A0to support our civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-11T07:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining titan only makes sense for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, In Situ Utilization... not sending back to Earth.
