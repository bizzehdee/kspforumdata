The cheapest launch vehicle I\u0027ve been able to find is the US navy NOTSNIK program; orbital launches with a six-stage solid rocket put together from weapons components, launched from a supersonic aircraft. Cost for the \u003Cem\u003Eentire program\u003C/em\u003E, including four orbital launch attempts, was $300,000 1958; about 2 and a half million today. Of course, there\u0027s the minor issue that NOTSNIK didn\u0027t actually work, but that was due to component issues, and rocket motors and guidance systems are a lot more reliable today than in 1958. Poland has F-16s with better performance than the F-6 used by NOTSNIK, and I\u0027m pretty sure they have plenty of weapons components lying around; air launch means they can do it over the north sea, away from populated areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
