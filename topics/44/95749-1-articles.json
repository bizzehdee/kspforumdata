Arguably Michael Crichton\u0027s greatest novel and Spielberg\u0027s greatest cinematic achievment. The book contained some of the most credible fictitious science involvement around and the film featured the most scientifically accurate Non-Avian Dinosaurs ever to be seen to date. But there has been one species featured in both the novel and film alike that have had people scratching their heads. The Velociraptor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe film and book describe a birdlike creature as tall as a man and around 4 or 5 metres long. It has a long, tall and relatively rounded head which is about two feet in length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life the most well known species of the genus, \u003Cem\u003EVelociraptor mongoliensis\u003C/em\u003Eis barely three feet high and about seven feet in length. In real life it was covered in a downy plumage, with long, quill like feathers on the arms and tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is it that the two depictions are so different? Most people say that Spielberg liked the size of larger dromaeosaurid relatives but preferred the name Velociraptor, over things like Deinonychus or Tsaagan or Utahraptor. The reality is far from this speculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Book\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the novel, the amber and DNA was said to have been recovered from Mongolia, so this rules out Deinonychus or Utahraptor. The amber was said to contain the blood of a \u0022giant species of Velociraptor\u0022. In the flaming cliffs region, where Velociraptor remains are normally found, there is only one over species of dromaeosaurid big enough to fit the description - Achillobator giganticus. Now at this time, since Velociraptor was the first dromaeosaur to be discovered it would be that all other similar dromaeosaurs were to be renamed Velociraptor. But this was considered for ALL dromaeosaurids, which were all renamed Velociraptor. So Deinonychus antirrhopus became Velociraptor antirrhopus and, Achillobator giganticus became Velociraptor giganticus. But this was for just a brief period. Even so the damage had been done and it had been Achillobator masquerading as Velociraptor giganticus that made its way into the novel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Film\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same short lived idea of synonymous dromaeosaurs made its way into the film too, but not as Achillobator. In the movie it is clearly stated that the Velociraptor remains Grant was excavating were in Montana. This narrows it down to two creatures - Deinonychus antirrhopus and Utahraptor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you are familiar with raptors, they clearly have the look of Deinonychus in the film, but almost the size of Utahraptor.
