Inertial, or relativistic mass increases. Invariant, or rest mass is going to remain exactly the same. In modern physics, the word \u0022mass\u0022 typically means the later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, gravitational mass is, indeed, identical to the relativistic mass. But it\u0027s still a little more complicated than that. Source of gravity isn\u0027t just mass, but the stress-energy tensor. For a point object, it depends not only on object\u0027s mass, but also on its momentum. An object moving really close to speed of light is going to have a different gravitational field around it, but not in such a trivial way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this is way outside of what you can describe with classical physics. This really has to be treated from perspective of GR, where the answer is going to be governed by a Lorentz-boosted Scwarzschild metric. Qualitative effect, however, is going to be a lot like magnetism. You will experience stronger pull if you are moving in direction opposite to the object, but a lesser pull if you are traveling in the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T23:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank goodness that the gravitation doesn\u0027t become nearly infinite! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T00:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t become infinite, but might approach infinity (along with relativistic mass) as the object approaches c.
