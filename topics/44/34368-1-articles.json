Anything that even has a remote chance of hitting the ISS would need to be at the same altitude as the ISS,anything at the same altitude as the ISS would need relatively the same speed as the ISS (Give or take 5-15 Mph) How does debris travelling a relative 10 Mph pose any threat? (Solar Panels just maybe but I just can\u0027t see it) And is my logic about the speed and altitudes even sound? Well I just thought about retrograde debris,but doesn\u0027t the USA launch all space flights to the East?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RulerOfNothing","CreatedById":14,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T02:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, orbital debris is not always in a circular orbit, so it is possible for debris in more eccentric orbits to collide with the ISS or other satellites with a much higher relative velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yourself","CreatedById":4465,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T02:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso not all orbits have the same inclination. Inclination is really what makes it a big deal. If the inclination of two objects differs by just one degree in LEO, the relative velocity between them at the collision point will be about 130 m/s. Now consider that the ISS has an orbital inclination of 51.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Anything in a similar equatorial orbit (with inclination 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) will have a relative velocity of about 6.7 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T02:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention that, even if the debris were in an orbit with the same perigee, apogee and inclination, it could be crossing the ISS\u0027 orbit by as much as 90 degrees (assuming both are prograde).
