Probably an expendable one, given how nasty NTRs can be. So \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is still important. The \u0022reverse staging\u0022 approach has its own problems, as I noted above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, we should definitely use an airbreather to some degree. One of the reasons I like using a turboramrocket (whether it has tilting nacelles or is a \u0022pure\u0022 VTVL) is that it allows for some neat storytelling. A pure NTR or even a ramrocket NTR will turn the landing site into a flaming radioactive crater with no reasonable chance of safe egress, but if the landing can be done on fan thrust alone (although this will still need the coolant loop), then touchdown can leave the landing zone relatively intact. Should be easy enough, since the lander will be virtually empty at touchdown. This also allows for high-speed extractions; you can drop in, pick up your people, and then immediately take off again to head for a safer zone to refuel and launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis gets interesting in the story. Suppose you\u0027re coming in for a landing when you realize your landing zone has been compromised and there are enemy troops waiting in ambush. Why, all you have to do is come in like you normally would, then kick the NTR into gear and flood it with propellant a few hundred feet above the landing site. You pull a couple of gees and blast away to safety while the enemy combatants find themselves staring into the tail end of a nuclear thermal turborocket on full afterburner...which is not a particularly safe place to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/embarking.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is why I prefer rotating nacelles or dedicated landing engines to allow a belly landing.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypercosmic","CreatedById":154181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-06T02:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223010621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491413396\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this idea too, but the catcher stage is going to need to be better than an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E all in its own right.
