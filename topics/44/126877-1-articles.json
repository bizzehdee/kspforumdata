I assume you know how to get to Mars in Google Earth.\u00A0You need to be viewing the CTX mosaic instead of the regular Mars globe\u00A0in order to see the following stuff.\u00A0There\u0027s polygon patterned ground at\u00A045\u00B054\u00275.56\u0022N\u00A017\u00B051\u002726.91\u0022E. The polygons here are usually over a\u00A0hundred meters wide.\u00A0There are what looks like glaciers everywhere surrounding that for miles. At\u00A045\u00B049\u002746.39\u0022N\u00A018\u00B040\u002723.19\u0022E there\u0027s a mesa with an obvious drainage basin with two major channels, and on the northwest corner of\u00A0that same mesa is a crater that looks like it formed\u00A0in mud. At\u00A045\u00B045\u002722.39\u0022N\u00A020\u00B052\u002756.16\u0022E there\u0027s more polygon ground, and it\u0027s more defined. You can clearly see it\u0027s patterned like that. At\u00A046\u00B0 3\u002753.42\u0022N\u00A021\u00B054\u002744.30\u0022E there\u0027s a landform that looks like it was a lake. You can see an outflow channel at the north of it, that drains the basin into one of the main channels in the region. At\u00A044\u00B0 2\u002744.28\u0022N\u00A046\u00B017\u002719.83\u0022E there\u0027s a mesa with a large crater, that was literally\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecut in half\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0by what is probably moving ice. At\u00A046\u00B046\u002726.00\u0022N\u00A049\u00B043\u002714.10\u0022E is something, I\u0027m not sure what but it looks like a geological boundary of some kind. I don\u0027t know what might have caused that, but it\u0027s between something that looks like it was/is viscously flowing and some underlying solid material. Lots of activity in this area, glaciers or otherwise, it\u0027s geologically significant.\u00A0Look between any two mesas and you\u0027ll probably\u00A0see signs of movement\u00A0everywhere. I have yet to find a definite moraine. There are several candidates but they aren\u0027t obvious enough. You might want to check out the area around those coordinates. The easternmost glacier-like thing I\u0027ve found in this continuous chain of them\u00A0is at\u00A031\u00B0 2\u002745.24\u0022N\u00A073\u00B021\u002716.95\u0022E and the westernmost is at\u00A040\u00B045\u00277.99\u0022N\u00A011\u00B045\u002754.87\u0022E.\u00A0Also, I found a weird thing at\u00A040\u00B058\u002742.29\u0022N\u00A08\u00B054\u002741.56\u0022W, a straight ridge in a crater\u0027s ejecta field (another one that looks like it formed in mud).
