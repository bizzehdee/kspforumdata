If we ignore the power requirements and only look at the space requirements and only look at the space-time requirements, and the power density. There is no point in the known universe where this could be done. It would be silly, it would be like building a bridge to the moon to get a better view of an anthill on the other side of the earth. It would take time, at least 1.6 million years to do, and it would take the technology (or something comparable) that one was attempting to build to create a foundation to complete the task. The laser power density is generous. The current energy production of the earth is about 2500 GW which means for the Earth surface (6400 r). The earths current electrical output is 1/51,550,000,000 th of what it would need to be to be a power source. Alternatively you would need a battery capable of storing 51552611369 seconds of power to produce on Gj, againt batteries cannot be counted on to deliver as sizable amount of power in 1/600,000th of a second so the battering would have to be many 100s of times more powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe short answer, its impossible, theoretically plausible but technically impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
