A VERY long time. In fact I don\u0027t believe it would ever happen unless some gentle asteroid slowly and gently pushed the satellite onto a sub-80 km perigee. Solar winds and the Moons gravity does have an effect on the orbits of those satellites, yes, as do the tidal motion of the Earths oceans, but it is not something that will actually force the satellite out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for a satellite in geosynchronous to leave geosynchronous? That happens a lot. In fact i does require more or less constant stationkeeping maneuvers to maintain a geosynchonous orbit. Therefore, most geosynch satellites do not have a perfectly synchronous orbit, as that would use up their maneuvering reserves a lot. I am not sure about the tolerances, but once a satellite gets too far away from the original position, it will be maneuvered back, and once the fuel reserves are nearly depleted, it will be boosted out to a \u0022graveyard orbit\u0022 slightly beyond geostationary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if that answered you question, but hell it\u0027s the best I can do, haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T09:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will take a while, which is why international law requires that GEO sats must be boosted to a graveyard orbit at their end of life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to leave it there forever, it becomes a hazardous debris in a very crowded and strategic location, which will make the entire global space industry very angry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T10:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, we are creating another Kessler death zone just beyond geostationary orbit?
