Where I live, the local stations that come in perfectly are not the type of music most employees care to listen too, and/or being too into the \u0022power rotation\u0022 format of repeating the same songs 5 times a working day. But there are 2-3 other stations that come in less-than-perfectly with a much better music rotation. Usually these stations fade in and out of crystal clarity, presumably depending on the local weather and/or electromagnetic environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally there are several older second-hand-grade stereos placed around the shop floor, with the general agreement they stay on the same station to avoid stereo wars. Some have better reception than others, naturally. Much time is spent fiddling with antennas to get the clearest reception to little avail, as the reception changes as soon as the meaty bag of salty water moves away. Some stereos have the old telescopic antenna, while others have the flexible wire (I know the loop antennas are for AM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresumably the best solution is to convince the boss man to install a master receiver / repeater, similar to what is commercially available. The transmitter would probably need to be mounted up on the roof truss to avoid interference from the machinery, and higher-power than the commonly available consumer-grade solutions. So probably not the simplest/easiest solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve learned from playing around with antennas is the grounding them is bad. It often seems that touching the antenna is not the best, but being inches away from touching it with a meaty bag of salty water often brings in perfect reception. Getting away from metal objects seems to be helpful (I\u0027m well aware of the Faraday Effect), but is complicated by being inside a standard truss-roofed warehouse building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if anyone has any tips and tricks for improving reception on cheap stereo antennas, I\u0027d love to hear them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T21:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you touch the antenna, sometimes even just stand really close to it, you become part of the antenna. \u00A0Sometimes that helps, sometimes not. \u00A0In any case, it\u0027s not a good solution, because eventually you will want to stand somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like your issue is the antenna(s). \u00A0Being located inside a steel building does not help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasiest solution is to try to make the antennas better, by making them longer. \u00A0If the radio has inputs for a FM antenna, use any two-conductor wire. \u00A0Attach one end of each conductor to the FM Antenna input. \u00A0Then try running them up or perhaps up together, then branch them out to make a \u0027T\u0027 shape with them. \u00A0The ends of the conductors which are not attached to the radio should ideally be not electrically connected to anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the only FM Antenna input is the extendible \u0027whip\u0027 antenna, you may be able to improve that reception as well. \u00A0Try taking a single-conductor wire (stranded will work better for this than solid..). \u00A0Strip a few inches of the shield off of one end. \u00A0Then wrap the exposed conductor around the whip antenna, just try to make a half-way decent electrical connection. \u00A0Now you can run the wire up higher or in different directions, you essentially just made a longer antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough stranded wire probably works better than solid for attaching to a whip antenna, any copper wire will function fine as an antenna. \u00A0Don\u0027t use shielded coax (Cable TV wire) cable as an antenna, the shielding will prevent the signal from getting through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I do not recommend attaching antenna wires to parts of your metal building- you\u0027ll get a lot of electrical noise, and it\u0027s not safe. \u00A0Leave the shielding on the wire you use, only strip off the shielding where you need to connect it to either the FM Antenna terminals, or to the whip antenna itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest solution would be to have a decent antenna installed on the roof of the building. \u00A0Run shielded coax from the roof antenna to a single receiver, and put speakers throughout the facility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T21:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224351737\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703451642\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022198538\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002218Watt\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, 18Watt said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest solution would be to have a decent antenna installed on the roof of the building. \u00A0Run shielded coax from the roof antenna to a single receiver, and put speakers throughout the facility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf only we could get the bigwigs to agree to that.
