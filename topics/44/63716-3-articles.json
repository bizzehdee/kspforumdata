It seems likely that Mars could keep gaseous nitrogen (28), as well, but for some reason doesn\u0027t have any.

Let me crunch some numbers on it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s say Mars needs an atmosphere with a mass of 2.5*10^18kg (same rough figure I was working off earlier, it should at least be of the right order of magnitude). I\u0027ll assume it is reduced to 1% of its original density after 10 million years (which I think is far faster than it would actually happen, but as a lower bound, it\u0027s conservative).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the falloff in density follows an exponential curve, that means after 1 year there will be 99.95396% of the atmosphere left, or 0.04604% of it gone. This would be equivalent to a mass of 1.15*10^15kg. That\u0027s a block of ice 10km x 10km x 10km. Or five Halley\u0027s comets. That\u0027s a lot of mass! Comparable to the mass of the impactor that killed the dinosaurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we say that the atmosphere is reduced to 1% after a billion years, that means you\u0027re multiply all the time scales by a factor of 100. You now only need to replenish 1.15*10^13kg of gas per year (your block of ice is now down to 2.2km x 2.2km x 2.2km). That\u0027s still a lot for one reentry, but what if it was spread out over the course of the year? Now you\u0027re looking at 3.15*10^10kg/day. Your cube of ice is now down to 315m x 315m x 315m. This is still a pretty big lump of ice, which means it\u0027s probably not the best idea to smash it into the surface of an inhabited planet (you\u0027d supposedly get a 6km wide crater). To avoid having fragments hitting the ground, they need to be smaller than about 50cm in diameter. So you\u0027d need to blow it into 250 million pieces to ensure that none of them reached the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, orbital bombardment perhaps isn\u0027t the best way to go about ensuring Mars keeps an atmosphere, we\u0027d probably be better off trying to manufacture it on the surface once there\u0027s an atmosphere in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
