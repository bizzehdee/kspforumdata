That paper apparently still needs some work as the dimensions in the first three equations are more or less ommited (Hey, let\u0027s substract 200 from a height and then create an exponent that is not dimensionless)....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to discuss and share your own findings....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-25T21:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a remark: arxiv is a pre-print server, the papers in there are not reviewed or published.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only did a swift fly-by of the paper.

So, doing a few more gravity assists should be sufficient. ... Guess I just got the funding to let old geostationary satellites accelerate in the exosphere...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
