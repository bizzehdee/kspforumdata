But, for a milacre a interplanetary exploration vessel discover hydrogen traces in Moho\u0027s atmosphere (remember mission Koulomb?) shortly. Naturally it would be considered \u0022better than Kerbonite and Kethane, in the middle of crisis\u0022 by the R\u0026D Subsidiary manager, I mean, they naturally would extract! From Moho, yay!\n\n**In other words...**\n\nHere I have an theory on how they would have made it, presented in the best PhD format for an twelve in elementary school.\n\n**Basic understandment requirements:**\n\n- Knowledge in contrary particles, i.e. positrons\n- Fresh high-school knowledge in basic chemistry, electrolysis, pH and hydrogen bonds\n- Knowledge in thermic isolation, seal systems, dissolution and etcetra\n- Optional: ability to read a text scheme into a imaginary, \u0022built\u0022 one\n\n**Schemes:** \n\n**Extraction**\n\nReactor 1\n\nThe vessel that extracts H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E from Moho dissolve the captured air in a tank of accidized Kerbal^(adjective for Kerbin)^ water (Reactor 1) and react positrons in the solution where H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is separed from the rest of atmosphere, when hydrogen bonds are formed between the water particles. The atmospheric particles which remain in the tank (i.e. everything but Hydrogen) after the water have been put in the Reactor 2 is exhausted back into atmosphere.\n\nReactor 2\n\nBefore entering the reactor, the just-hydrogenized water is centrifugated to remove other solved compounds (other elements from Moho atmosphere dissolved in Reactor 1), which are then exhausted. Once in the reactor, solar panels generate power to react the water with Electrons to separate the hydrogen bonds (i.e. hydrogen from Mohovian atmosphere) which just formed with positrons (the panels also make energy for everything else electricity-related here). The water, once the hydrogen has separated, returns to Reactor 1 for another cycle (the extraction system/cycle) and the hydrogen enters in a depressurized tank. When returning the pressure valve and the entering to the H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E tank are sealed to prevent future leaks.\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\nWhen the vessel returns, the hydrogen is cooled at a Ultra-Low Temperature (ULT, the inverse of UHT), to form liquid fuel, and keeped in thermic-isolation tanks to sell to KSP. Kerbals are ecologic; KSC sells back the isolation tanks (read: cans) for ecology and discount. KSC is to cool to enter bankruptcy.\n\n*Note: I didn\u0027t mentioned the crisis included oxidizer, so let\u0027s just assume KSC already have excedents of it and only mixes with liquid H*\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003E2\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E *for further missions.*\n\nP.S.: Remember bombarding Neodymium with Cerium results in Ununoctium which rapid Alpha decay can be used to power electricity!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T22:08:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gustavo6046**\n  \nY\u0027 know it, formatting!"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T21:45:03Z","Content":"welcome to the forum..
