Now imagine this augmented virtual reality directly interfaces with your neural network so that there is no \u0022edge\u0022 or \u0022boundary\u0022 because the entire world is \u0022in your head.\u0022 Let\u0027s also pretend that the technology allows nearly instantaneous processing of introduced stimuli and thought.
