You could find a small planet if it orbits very close to the star, since it covers a large portion of the star, but then it won\u0027t be in the habitable zone. Or you could find bigger planets further away, but you will also need more time to confirm them since you need a couple of revolutions at least to confirm your findings, and that means a few of their years.
