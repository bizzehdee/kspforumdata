So if your face mask leaked just a little, you could eventually die from CO2 poisoning. That said- please someone with more knowledge on the subject chime in- I think we\u0027d do fine for short periods of time even at relatively high percentages of CO2.

Spread some heat-absorbing material on top of the polar caps. Maybe it could be as simple as just spreading some black carbon material. It will absorb heat and cause the CO2 underneath it to sublimate during the Martian summer (when the Sun will be above the horizon continuously). At some point, run-away global warming is supposed to take over and melt the rest of the CO2. Mars is in the habitable zone after all, so with a thick enough atmosphere it can be Earth-like. \n\nWho knows, maybe the only thing keeping Mars\u0027 CO2 frozen now is \u0022inertia\u0022- clearly, in the past, when the Sun was dimmer, Mars settled into an atmosphere-frozen-out state because there simply wasn\u0027t enough solar radiation. Maybe now, the Sun is bright enough that Mars\u0027 atmosphere is in a sort of \u0022metastable\u0022 state, and if we melted all the ice caps, then it would settle down into a permanently unfrozen state, and not slowly revert to its current state (at least, until atmospheric loss impacted it). Maybe all it awaits is the proper trigger and its atmosphere will come back.

Does it become mitigated *enough*? I don\u0027t remember, maybe we don\u0027t know for sure because we don\u0027t know for sure how much radiation of this type we can take or are willing to take.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:12:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:24:10Z","Content":"No AFAIK it does not.

Magnetospheres are needed.\n\nNo, actually, there\u0027s a big difference between *needed* and *helpful*. I know for a fact that magnetospheres are not 100% necessary for radiation shielding. If you have a thick enough atmosphere, it will block cosmic rays just as well as a thinner atmosphere and a magnetic field. I can guarantee you that Venus has much lower levels of cosmic radiation on its surface than Earth, despite having essentially no magnetic field.\n\nAlso, you are forgetting that during geomagnetic field reversals, Earth\u0027s magnetic field essentially disappears for a time, maybe thousands of years even. Last time it happened was like 100k years ago or something like that; our ancestors didn\u0027t even notice it (though maybe they saw aurora popping up in unusual places and thought the gods were angry at them or something). But they certainly had no problems surviving. Who knows, maybe some mutations caused by slightly increased levels of cosmic radiation were critical in the evolution of our species.\n\nSo thickening Mars\u0027 atmosphere *does* drastically reduce the amount of radiation due to cosmic rays on the surface, but I don\u0027t know if it reduces it to safe levels. (Of course, it does nothing to stop the ultraviolet light- at least on clear days- unless you add an ozone layer.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:42:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:06:27Z","Content":"You say you don\u0027t need a buffer gas, but plant life depends on nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere.
