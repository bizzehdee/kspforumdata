You let it drop and observe the difference in velocity compared to an apple without a paper rotor blade attachment.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Explain the principle of work for such*\n\u003E *a parachute and study the dependence of the drag force on the descent*\n\u003E \n\u003E *rate and on the sizes of the propeller\u0027s blades.*\n\nNow they want you to look at your data and figure out how the paper rotor works. Specifically how do the sizes of the paper rotors affect descent rate and overall lift-to-drag ratio.\n\nI hope someone who has taken a physics course in the last decade can correct any errors."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T03:46:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The effect in general is called autorotation and it is how an autogyro flies.

Zuni, if you want to actually experiment with it, pay careful attention to what are termed the driving section and driven section of an autorotating rotor. If you mess that up, your rotor will stall, and it won\u0027t do anything."}]}
