However, after a short time, the earth-fixed velocity vector began to curve toward the east as the rocket naturally followed the surface path of a great circle. At the same time the rocket\u0027s flight azimuth also turned to the east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point in time the trajectory had not yet attained the required 32.5o inclination. The rocket must maintain thrusting in a direction north of the velocity vector to continue pushing the orbit into a higher and higher inclination. It is possible to set and maintain the flight azimuth, i.e. the thrust vector, in a fixed relationship to the earth-fixed velocity vector for the remainder of the ascent. The small angle separating the thrust and velocity vectors is that necessary to attain the final orbital inclination, and is determined by trail and error. Denoting the azimuth of the earth-fixed velocity vector aEF, the following has been found to approximate the flight of Apollo 11:\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-30T16:47:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2015 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T16:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ll find the pitch in the table called \u0022pitch angles\u0022.

I think that means it is the angle the velocity vector makes with the horizontal in the space-fixed frame of reference. So to start with, at time zero, the rocket is stationary on earth. In the space-fixed frame, the rocket is moving horizontally because the earth is rotating, and the angle is zero. Just after lift-off, the rocket is moving up as well as across at the speed the earth is rotating at, so it makes an increasing angle to the horizontal. As the rocket pitches over, it stops gaining vertical velocity and starts gaining more horizontal velocity, so the angle stops growing and starts to fall. Eventually it reaches orbit, and at that point it is travelling horizontally again, and the angle goes back to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sense?
