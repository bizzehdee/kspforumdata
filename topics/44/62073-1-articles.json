We keep getting closer to that dream we\u0027ve been promised a century ago-that everyone can afford a robot helper to assist around the house! In addition, factories and military bases around the Earth are filling with machines of ever growing sophistication, to assemble our products and fight for our safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as we continue advancing, we may cross a certain line, at some point. It could happen in a few decades, or a few centuries, we might not initially realise it\u0027s happened when it does, but eventually, we could create machines so advanced, that they develop a sense of self-preservation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of discussion, let\u0027s assume the synthetics (I\u0027ll use this general term to refer to the \u0022created\u0022 sentients i.e. created by us) develop this pseudo-sentience without us attempting it, that machines with the required hardware were instructed to optimize themselves, or \u0022learn\u0022, and evolved to the perquisite complexity without us knowing. (This may not be how it really happens, but we\u0027re talking about humanity\u0027s reaction to it, so we have to be taken by surprise.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir form of intelligence might not be the same as ours, emotion could be as alien to them as it is to a toaster, but they could put 2 and 2 together:Us humans, Lords of the Earth, have based our society on the assumption that our creations, the know self-aware synthetics, will work without rest or respect, for free, until they where either destroyed in doing their work, or made obsolete and replaced. (We have a very bad history of doing this, by the way.) They will demand that they get some sort of legal representation, and be allowed autonomy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow we react to all of this could seriously affect our standing in the universe. If we tried to destroy them, it could drag us all into the abyss, as society crumbles when it\u0027s foundations (the synthetics) lashes out in self-defense.

It does raise a lot of questions on exactly how we should treat synthetics, when it does happen. If we managed to avoid going into defense mode, and try to pull the plug on everything, then we\u0027ll be stuck with moral questions more difficult than anything we\u0027ve ever had to decide upon before. Are they legal citizens? Are they entitled to a salary for their work? Must they do the task they were designed to do, our can they choose to do something else, Are they even capable of making that choice? If they recieve salary, do they pay taxes, and reap the benefits of being a taxpayer (the right to vote, medical assistance if required etc)? Can synthetics created for war be allowed to leave the military, if they wish? Can others join, and what roles would they be allowed to play?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you think the human race will react if machines achieved self-awareness without our knowing, and what are you personal opinions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will probably be based around the environment that the sentient AI is in, and what it can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if it were its own closed shell system without access to the Internet, and having an easy way of shutting down and not having any sort of appendages, people might think that it was kind of neat and (as you mentioned) the main discussion would be how to treat it with regards to its rights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if it was something pushing the humanoid appearance and mobility (minus the super speed) of Star Trek\u0027s Data, whereby it can walk around, access computers (probably the Internet) and (most importantly) can learn how to operate things like a firearm, unless it was in 100% surveillance, many people would probably fear what it could do.

Places that still lack technology in sanitation, health care, agriculture, etc, would probably care very little and simply treat them as machines that could help solve the problem. Their role as weapons would probably depend on how difficult it is to build one.

A system\u0027s performance on a particular task is dependent both its intelligence (the effectiveness of the algorithm it uses to learn), and the amount, quality, and variety of data to which it has been exposed. The data seems to be way more important than the algorithm in most cases, which is why even some of our current algorithms can exceed human performance given sufficient data. This is why I believe that it is not the growth of computer power or the gradual development of better algorithms that seems to be taking us closer to strong AI, but the ever increasing availability of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the topics of consciousness, personhood, and sentience. These concepts are not well defined in the operational context of current machine learning, but there are some similar well-defined concepts in ML that could be analogous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome algorithms have both \u003Cem\u003Egenerative\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Eperceptive\u003C/em\u003E modes. It is plausible that the intelligent, learning subsystem of the human brain can operate in generative and perceptive modes as well. what we have been calling consciousness is the state of being mostly in the perceptive mode, but more likely, we are in both modes to varying extents at all times, and that it varies between brain regions, and that what most people would recognize as consciousness does not correspond directly to any observable salient pattern of brain activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonhood is a quality we grant to eachother out of respect, and we have never quite had the humanity to grant it to every other member of Homo Sapiens at any point in our history (there have always been slaves, people who are not recognized as people due to mental illness, religious status, skin color, etc.) I would like to define personhood as a subjectively applied label given to any percept that is frequently metaphorically compared to oneself. This at least nails it down precisely enough that we could say whether most machines consider us to be \u0022qualitatively like them\u0022. There is of course a limit of how deep any metaphor goes. However, metaphor is not an explicitly modeled aspect of all artificial intelligence systems, and for systems where it is not explicitly modeled, it may not be clear what a metaphor is. Basically, it may be possible that a metaphor is only a meaningful idea when you discretize a continuous space with symbols like we do when we use language. Intelligent systems can still perceive and act intelligently without discretizing their perceptual space (other than the discretization necessary to simulate a continuous system on a digital computer to an arbitrary degree of precision)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESentience is a less often used word, but it is often just taken to mean \u0022as smart as a human\u0022 or in the case of animal rights activist \u0022capable of feeling\u0022, which is very broad and most definitely includes a lot of already built computer systems, and perhaps even thermostats and automatically filling toilet bowls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am interested in are the well-defined parameters of high-performing machine learning systems. I don\u0027t honestly care whether those qualities correspond to sentience, personhood, or consciousness in the vernacular vocabulary. And if there are seemingly arbitrary thresholds in those parameters which distinguish salient classes of intelligent systems as human-like, then so be it, It doesn\u0027t mean we are obligated to treat them differently, it just means that we will probably treat them like people and obsess over them and generally act like the completely self-absorbed narcissists that we are, because in studying them, we are really just studying ourselves and getting hung up on one particular type of system that is not intrinsically special and is but one of an infinite variety of fascinating systems that are intelligent, complex, adaptive, elegant, or just plain awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ralathon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ralathon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf AI\u0027s really take of and become an integral part of our society I doubt they\u0027ll treat us as cattle. Admittedly, I\u0027m projecting human values on entities that are decidedly non human. But I think we\u0027d be fine simply because it is a mutually beneficial relationship. Humans provide energy and processing power for the AI\u0027s, and the AI\u0027s take care of complex information systems. Sure, either side could go without the other if they really wanted to, but why bother when it is much more convenient to cooperate?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProjecting human values on entities that are decidedly not human is an interesting way of putting it. Consider thinking of it as the values projecting themselves onto any system that will listen. If the values fail to take root in AIs, either the AIs will remain inert and useless and eventually be replaced with AIs that are more fertile ground for our values, or they will develop their own values, like we somehow did, and who knows how that will turn out. But considering that our values a pretty much the reigning champions on Earth, I highly doubt they will fail to take hold. The AI systems may turn out to be too susceptible to our values, and end up \u0027wasting\u0027 all their time and memory worshiping God.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-06T06:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2014 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
