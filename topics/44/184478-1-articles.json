Which boils down to fuel and seats. Everyone else has hammered the former topic so I\u0027ll skip discussing it for now. Addressing the second factor, seats, is a matter of airline economy on it\u0027s own. Due to the vast variation on seat number, seat pricing, and seating arrangement, we\u0027ve seen airlines operate with a wide verity of different structures.

Wealthy people are willing to buy a luxury seat, but as the novelty of supersonic flight once again fades, the luxuries provided on super sonic flights will need to improve to keep their edge on \u0022luxury quality\u0022. Most airlines make the bulk of their profit from economy seating and not first/premium seating. Getting the most money by utilizing as much of the cabin space as possible.
