The gamma range has a background radiation the isnt derived from the sun, things like radon, potassium, iodine, etc give off a few hundred CPM, although these hv are relatively powerful you would have to many many times more to amount to anything, which lucky for us they dont. the actual dpm per cubi meter is much higher, you would have to go to considerable more effort to capture it. unlike the sun gamma comes from local matter so that the collector has to placed in the ground close to the highest source. What we do is take the most active earth, separate the most radioactive elements, purify them and place them in pellets and let the fission process create heat, causing steam to boil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA photomultiplier tube is a device used to detect by amplifying an initial electric signal created by gamma rays.
