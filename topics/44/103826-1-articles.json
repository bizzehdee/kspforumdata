The two rear corners are charged to a potential V. The forward corner is charged to a potential \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u2122V. The 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle on the corner creates a line charge density singularity that produces a huge horizontal electric field pointing from the back to the front of the craft which is also parallel to the sides of the triangle. An array of horizontal slot antennas located on the sides of the triangular hull produce an electromagnetic wave with the electric field polarized in the vertical direction. This combination of fields produces a spacetime force in both the vertical and horizontal directions such that the spacecraft receives a lift force and a force of propulsion.\n\n![US20060145019A1-20060706-D00000.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US20060145019A1/US20060145019A1-20060706-D00000.png)\n\nI am not entirely sure if this patent makes sense or not...what do you think?\n\nSpacetime force...what the heck is that?"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T06:26:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am not entirely sure if this patent makes sense or not...what do you think?\n\nThat you are wasting time looking into crackpot spaceships ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSeriously, just because there is a patent for it does not imply any practicality, not even possibility.

They just keep track of claims and assign claims to inventors. Proving something works or not depends on the inventors.\n\nSort of. The claimed invention must be novel, non-obvious and capable of use (amongst other criteria) and it\u0027s absolutely the examiner\u0027s job to verify those criteria. However, you\u0027re right in that whether something works or not (apart from extremely limited cases) is not normally the examiner\u0027s concern.\n\n \u0027Capable of use\u0027 is the notable criterion here - if something does not and cannot work (for example, a perpetual motion machine) then it is not capable of use and not patentable. This is an interesting case though - I\u0027m not sure if claim 1 would be rejected as being incapable of use.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.

However, claim 4:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To create, by claims (2,3), an interaction of the electrostatic field (2) with the electromagnetic wave (3) such that a combined spacetime curvature pressure is generated on the hull in the upward and forward direction to produce lift and propulsion respectively.\n\nIs gibberish and would almost certainly be rejected."},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T12:01:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps the patent is based off a found ship, similar to the one supposedly described in the Rendlesham Forest incident\n\nThat\u0027s exactly what it reminded me of.\n\nSo someone tried to patent what was already a popular UFO \u0022design?\u0022\n\n\\*cough\\*\n\n![Blacktriangle.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Blacktriangle.jpg)\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_%28UFO%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_%28UFO%29)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T12:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 12:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Firwen","CreatedById":140631,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T12:26:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So someone tried to patent what was already a popular UFO \u0022design?\u0022\n\nIf you have a quick look to the others \u0022inventions\u0022 registered by the same guy, the UFO patent looks relatively reasonable compared to the rest.\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p\u0026tbm=pts\u0026hl=en\u0026q=ininventor:%22John\u002BSt.\u002BClair%22#](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p\u0026tbm=pts\u0026hl=en\u0026q=ininventor:%22John\u002BSt.\u002BClair%22#)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T12:35:08Z","Content":"[This one](https://www.google.co.uk/patents/US20040164824?dq=ininventor:John\u002BSt.\u002BClair\u0026hl=en\u0026sa=X\u0026ei=msInVejlEoO8adPtgfgD\u0026ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK) includes hyperspace *and* subspace.
