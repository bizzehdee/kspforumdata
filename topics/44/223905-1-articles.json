The effect is much the same as a normal rocket. You get the blow back effect from the exhaust and the sound of the roar of the engines in atmosphere, just minus the rocket plume even though the nozzles are lit up. Different models of drive have different operating time limits, but the protagonist\u0027s starship has 1000 hours of drive acceleration before needing an electric recharge (done at moon bases covered with tall solar panels, which combine all their collected energy to charge new drives and visiting ships that need a recharge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax acceleration for the protagonist ship with full payload is 5g. Which the ship cannot go past due to drive limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrive Limits: Due to weird drive physics, the highest acceleration that has ever been achieved was 9g, but the operating time was only an hour before a recharge was needed. 9g drives also take longer to recharge and are expensive to purchase. In practice manned vesssls often have drives with lowered maximum acceleration limits such as 5g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Happens If You Attempt To Accelerate Past Your Acceleration Limit: Your thrust will invert, meaning instead of emitting extremely repulsive light rays, you will start emitting ATTRACTOR rays. Meaning your nozzle will create a vacuum suction effect, sucking up anything nearby with the same force it was emitting extremely repulsive exhaust with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for example if a 500 ton vessel was accelerating at 5g, if it tried accelerating with engines beyond 5g it would find that it\u0027s engines would create an equivalent vacuum suction force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat. Is some serious suction folks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvice For Pilots: Don\u0027t do that in an atmosphere. Why? It would increase air pressure inside the throat of the nozzle (which is plugged at the throat bottom because of the emitter lens), eventually warping it out wider than it should be. Too much air pressure and you would crack the emitter lens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn space converting your repulsor drive into an attractor ray won\u0027t cause any harm so long nothing crashes into your nozzles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Question: Even though I know this is scifi, I trust I got the physics on inverted thrust correct.... right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisclaimer: The inverted thrust only applies to the scifi drive acceleration. Obviously if you strapped rocket boosters to your ship for extra thrust you could increase your acceleration since you would not be relying purely on the scifi drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited
