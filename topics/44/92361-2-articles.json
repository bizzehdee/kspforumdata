You can build a low-quality rocket engine (definitely *NOT* up to standards for use in space) for a fraction of the cost of a Microwave Transmitter (a gyrotron), Microwave Thermal Receiver, or for that matter, a jet engine. A 1 MW gyrotron, by contrast, goes for $2 million a pop (Microwave Thermal Rocketry is cheap because you \u003Cstrong\u003Eleave the gyrotrons on the ground\u003C/strong\u003E, and can re-use them literally *thousands* of times before they eventually wear out...)\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of researching Microwave Thermal Rocketry on even a small (1 Megawatt) scale means very few laboratories/universities can afford to do so in the current economic climate. ESPECIALLY when there isn\u0027t exactly a lot of government support for this kind of research (unlike, say, research on high-powered lasers...) We\u0027re lucky that NASA just recently shelled out $2 million to actually buy a Microwave Transmitter unit for use specifically in Microwave Thermal Rocketry research...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027ll be cheaper when technology demonstrators have been fired/flown, mass-produced, and after many spaceports have gyrotrons installed, launching microwave thermal rockets regularly. Until then, I suppose we can only wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s also a small private company called Escape Dynamics working on the technology, by the way- for which the lead NASA researcher on the project is an adviser. They hold some patents related to the technology, and are working on designing working spaceplanes using the technology (the \u003Cstrong\u003EMUCH\u003C/strong\u003E higher ISP than chemical rocketry makes spaceplanes actually feasible- and spaceplanes can lift off with a TWR less than 1, meaning you can lift a heavier vehicle with the same amount of beamed-power...)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat, some progress.
