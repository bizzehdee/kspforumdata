It actually requires a different theory, which can be distinguished from QM. Of course, every experiment so far has fallen onto the side of QM, which lead PW proponents to keep adding features to try and bring it to parity. Which, granted, doesn\u0027t automatically disprove the entire approach, but it makes it very dubious at best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for space-time characteristics, this would have been a good argument back in Michelson Morely experiment, if you tried to argue that we might not need Special Relativity, but we moved on quite a bit past that. Relativity effects are no longer considered a curious feature needing an explanation. They are a direct consequence of the underlying symmetries, proof for which comes from absolutely every corner. Special Relativity, General Relativity, conservation of energy and momentum itself comes from the same principles. Saying, \u0022We might simply not understand how it works,\u0022 while isn\u0027t technically wrong, is not very productive. Until we find an actual smoking gun in the theory, like if EM drive turns out to actually operate at above photon-drive efficiency, I say we assume these things are fundamentally correct.
