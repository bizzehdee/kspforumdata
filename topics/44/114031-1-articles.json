You use a fume hood unless the exposure is unimportant or very rare. For example opening a bottle and transfering a small quantity using an automated pipette to a test tube once in a while next to a window is something that won\u0027t kill you immediatelly or gradually. It is a dangerous chemical, but not a boogeyman. There\u0027s way more danger of labs where solvents are kept in an inadequate storage area where they are exposed to heat and are keeping a constant, unhealthy level of vapors in the work area. That\u0027s when a gas mask is applicable, although it\u0027s of course logical to do something about the source than to spend a fortune on filters during the years.\n\nOf course 3M will try to spook the crap out of everyone.

That\u0027s never good.\n\nFume hood can be old, but if it pulls the air and keeps a negative pressure in the room, and you aren\u0027t spilling benzene over the floor or in shallow trays, or keep exposed beakers and flasks of it around, and you don\u0027t do this often, I see no problem.\n\nUndamaged MCU-2/P is more than adequate, but remember that solvents cross the skin barrier. Chronic exposure to higher levels of vapors with mask only is not healthy as benzene will enter your body through your skin.\n\nAlso, remember that filters are rated for vapor concentration and time they provide *healthy enough* air to breathe.\n\nI don\u0027t know the US standards (I bet they\u0027re different from the rest of the world like everything else), but in an unlikely case you\u0027re using EU standards, use type A filter (brown) with the approapriate class rating (1, 2 or 3). 1 should be enough because if you need 2 or 3, you really need a protective suit.\n\n![Mask_filters_UE_grades.jpg](http://www.gvs.com/flex/images/9/6/c/D.b5d3ff1bd9e8c13cfda0/Mask_filters_UE_grades.jpg)\n\nI must say that, if you don\u0027t know these things yourself, or couldn\u0027t find it yourself, you probably shouldn\u0027t work with benzene.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T21:59:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Djsnowboy267","CreatedById":34545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:13:37Z","Content":"Trust me, this isn\u0027t the only place I\u0027ve asked. I have been looking around other forums as well as looking over safety sheets and manuals for the mask and chemicals. The reason I put this up on here is mainly for further input, I wouldn\u0027t trust the sole opinion of one person on here, or anywhere else, but I know most people on the KSP forums are above average intelligence and could at least give some additional input.\n\nAlso, regarding the requirement for an air supply/positive pressure mask, that only applies for high or unknown concentrations of the chemical. At the moment I don\u0027t know how much and am trying to figure out, but respirators and full face masks with filters work for lower concentrations.\n\nRegarding the fume hood and facilities, I haven\u0027t gotten a chance to use the fume hood, all I said is that it was old. Could work great for all I know.\n\nAlso, you are correct in saying I am definitely not trained for activities like this. I am working with a small group at the University of Iowa, and I mainly run the vacuum pump and do some testing with PMTs. I suppose it is my fault for wording my posts as if I am the only one using the masks. I don\u0027t think I would even be handling the benzene much, it would be older, more qualified people. I was told we might do some work with benzene but safety recommendations were to have a respirator, and I mentioned I have two at home. I want to know if those are sufficient, but unfortunately I can\u0027t say for certain unless I know the concentrations we are working with, which are most likely not that high but I am unsure. Trust me, I\u0027m not going to run around a sealed room with benzene doing nothing but wearing a mask that may or may not be effective.\n\nOnce again, I come to the KSP forums for a bit of additional advice, because I know most of you guys are smart, kind people. Not gonna take anybodies post as a 100% guarantee of being correct. I like being able to ask direct questions to a knowledgeable person and get at least an educated along with professional, standard info.\n\nI am not a terrorist (but that\u0027s totally what I would say if I were a terrorist!?!?!?!?!)\n\nThanks for the advice."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:15:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well as someone who worked with benzene in a laboratory, I can assure you that you don\u0027t use a gas mask for it.
