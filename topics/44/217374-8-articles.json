Say the robot costs $160k (a year of 32 hr weeks with 2 weeks vacation), and is only half as productive as a human... the trick is it will not have to work 32 hours, it can maybe work 112 hours a week (the rest recharging). It\u0027s still doing 1.75X the labor of the human it replaced, and after 1 year, it\u0027s paid for, and the cost is just electricity.
