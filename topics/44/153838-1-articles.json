The Team America Rocketry Challenge, which seems more high school oriented (Similar to FIRST robotics if you are familiar with that), however the deadline for that closed December 2nd. I would prefer something I can enter individually, as a senior in high school at this time in the year, the bureaucratic processes necessary to get the school linked with a challenge might take me past a potential signup deadline. So I am curious if anyone on these forums has experience with similar challenges and could point me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, what is a good scope for any of my attempts. Should I go all out and try to mathematically optimize any submission as much as possible? Or should I go for a blend of style and effect?
