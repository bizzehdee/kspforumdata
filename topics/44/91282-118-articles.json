This is because it orbits nearer the sun than we do. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn all orbit farther from Earth, meaning that their positions across the sky are readily predictable using reasonably predictable epicycles, deferents, and so forth. We can observe Jupiter at many times of the year. In contrast, planets nearer the sun like Mercury and Venus are only visible close to sunset or sunrise, so it is more challenging to track their movements and recognize that they are, indeed, planets.

I\u0027ll start with the latter. Except for a very small class of frozen orbits, most low lunar orbits pass over mass concentrations (leftover from the Late Heavy Bombardment) buried just below the regolith; these mascons will aggressively perturb any low orbits and eventually cause surface impact. For this reason, microsatellite orbits originating from the surface are impractical. It\u0027s also impractical because you have to take extra mass down to the lunar surface; if you are already going to be in orbit at some point, and so you\u0027re much better off pulling an Apollo and just dropping the satellites while still in orbit. Granted, such maneuvers are limited to the plane of your manned vehicle\u0027s orbit, but if you have an active enough manned lunar landing program that you can afford the mass budget for a shoulder-fired orbital launcher, you can probably afford to come in for a landing (from LOP-G or whatever) in the desired plane.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven setting aside those considerations, it is hard to imagine a situation in which the risks of firing a rocket in close proximity to an astronaut on EVA would be outweighed by benefits. Would be much better to go tripod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to the question of energy.

The very different (but also man-portable and nearly shoulder-fireable) Javelin launches an 8.4-kg warhead at up to 600 m/s.\u00A0The shoulder-fired PZR Grom, from Poland, has a 1.3-kg warhead that reaches 650 m/s and has a ridiculous range of 5.5 kilometers. It is similar to the Russian\u00A09K333 Verba, which launches a 1.5-kg warhead at similar speeds. The fastest shoulder-launched short-range SAM in the world is the two-stage British Starstreak, which launches a 2.7-kg cluster warhead to around 1400 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiring on the moon would obviously improve performance.

It would not be implausible to imagine\u00A0a man-portable, shoulder-fired two-stage missile launcher that would get a 1-2 kg payload into a nearly orbital trajectory which could then self-circularize with ease.
