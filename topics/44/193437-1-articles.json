We\u0027re thinking they were Starlink satellites or similar, but I wanted to check on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe observed a series of lights moving across the sky from west to east. I can\u0027t give a precise point at which they appeared due to buildings, trees and clouds on the western horizon. However, I would say they tracked from the WSW to east across the sky. In addition, they disappeared at about due south from my point of view, maybe 45 degrees above the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were multiple \u0022clusters\u0022 of these lights. Per my dad, the first included five or six lights, this was followed by several individual lights and a final \u0022cluster\u0022 of at least two dozen. All of these lights seemed to follow the same path in the sky and moved around 1/4 to 1/2 degree per second across the sky. I would estimate a magnitude between 2 and 4, but take that with a huge grain of salt as I\u0027m horrible at this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said, I\u0027m thinking these were Starlink satellites, but I can\u0027t confirm this. Would Starlink satellites behave in this fashion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-27T19:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s almost certainly what you saw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-27T19:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, sounds about right! That\u0027d be the most recent batch of 60 Starlinks as the others will have spread out to their operational separation and not be clustered.

This can take quite a few days, and since the last launch was just 5 days ago, they are still very close to each other. Once they achieve their final orbit and proper arrangement, they will be much less noticeable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-27T20:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou saw Starlink, and if you had been out there at about 9:07 you would have seen a bunch more even more closely spaced, along the same path, followed by two loners, then the last group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a visualization showing where all those new sats are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.heavens-above.com/StarLink.aspx?launchid=2020006\u0026amp;lat=51.5074\u0026amp;lng=-0.1278\u0026amp;loc=London\u0026amp;alt=0\u0026amp;tz=GMT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.heavens-above.com/StarLink.aspx?launchid=2020006\u0026amp;lat=51.5074\u0026amp;lng=-0.1278\u0026amp;loc=London\u0026amp;alt=0\u0026amp;tz=GMT\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re closely packed like that because they just launched on Wednesday and are spreading out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
