However, it is difficult to design an aircraft that can close the 10-11 km/s Delta-V gap to orbit without staging: especially once you consider jet engines don\u0027t really work well past about 2 km/s atmospheric speed (and that\u0027s with pre-cooled intakes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, Lift/Drag ratio declines the faster in the hypersonic regime you end up flying, jet engines are deadweight past about Mach 4 or 5 (or in the case of something like SABRE or KSP\u0027s RAPIER, just a heavier rocket engine for the thrust they provide- although lighter than a separate dedicated rocket...), and wings are of course completely useless once you finally climb past the Karman Line (the altitude at which no meaningful lift can any longer be generated) and start the final burn to orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, why not deploy payloads from spaceplanes on a \u003Cstrong\u003ESUBORBITAL\u003C/strong\u003E trajectory, and have them complete their burns to orbit using dedicated rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe benefits of this vs. a simple rocket that takes off from the surface are numerous:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(1)\u003C/strong\u003E You gain some altitude and horizontal speed with a stage (the spaceplane itself) that is essentially 100% resuable and can benefit from airplane-like economics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2)\u003C/strong\u003E The first couple km/s of Delta-V to orbit are *BY FAR* the most expensive from a fuel, Thrust, and thus overall cost perspective. Due to the Rocket Equation, it takes much less fuel and thrust to achieve the 3rd and 4th km/s of Delta-V than it did the 1st and 2nd km/s for a given rocket design (put the other way around, it takes exponentially more fuel and thrust on the launchpad for each additional km/s of Delta-V you design into a rocket...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(3)\u003C/strong\u003E Because the rocket is deployed and operates above or at the very edge of the atmosphere, its engines can be optimized ENTIRELY for vacuum operation, rather than operation at sea-level... In practical terms, this means the rocket can use a relatively MUCH larger engine nozzle (which results in a higher Exhaust Velocity, and thus Vacuum ISP) without having to worry about extra drag or ISP-loss from over-expanding the exhaust stream relative to atmospheric pressure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also utilize MUCH lower chamber-pressures, because chamber pressure has hardly any effect at all on Vacuum ISP, and really only affects atmospheric ISP (but is one of the most stressful factors on a rocket, and thus results in needing much heavier, more expensive, and less reusable engines...) Even a simple/cheap pressure-fed rocket engine can still achieve respectable ISP outside the atmosphere...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(4)\u003C/strong\u003E The spaceplane can take off from the runway with a TWR significantly less than 1. TWR values of as little as 0.1 or 0.2 are easily viable in real life with a long enough runway...

(due to the low G-forces experienced during the spaceplane-portion of the flight, it\u0027s also possible to load the crew into the rocket section AFTER taking off from the runway...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of these advantages are already reflected in KSP (except for the part about engine-design: but even KSP, and mods especially, offers a variety of rocket engines optimized for atmospheric or vacuum use...) I can understand players not wanting to go through the extra hassle vs. a pure spaceplane in KSP (especially considering you need to install a mod like Flight Manager for Reusable Stages to be able to swap back to the spaceplane and fly it back to the runway after rocket-deployment....) but the advantages of such an approach in real life are hard to ignore- especially when you consider that suborbital spaceplanes are probably the *ONLY* type of Horizontal Takeoff Horizontal Landing spaceplane we\u0027ll see in the reasonable future unless SABRE/SKYLON or Escape Dynamic\u0027s Microwave Beamed Power Spaceplanes pan out...

The problem with commuter air-travel is, partly, that it faces a lot of competition from inherently cheaper transportation technologies like cars/buses and trains. So they can\u0027t raise their prices, and the floor is very low. A spaceplane would operate in an environment where the prices (and revenue streams) are currently VERY large. So, they don\u0027t have to be cost-effective on NEARLY the level of a commuter aircraft, and I don\u0027t expect them to be. $500/kg would be an extremely reasonable cost for LEO payload, but it would be unimaginably expensive for commuter air travel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes do have a major competitor; rockets, whether they be expendable or VTVL.

The XB-70 could carry the weight of a fully fueled and loaded f9 upper stage heading for leo. But only to 20km and Mach 3, well bellow the 80km and Mach 10 at which the stage is designed to ignite.

You load up with fuel and take off, meet the tanker. fuel up, continue on jets up to mach 3, start the rocket engine and go suborbital, release upper stage with payload and returns.This might also be relevant for skylon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe obvious problem is the only comparable aircraft is the SR-71 blackbird. If you\u0027ve ever had the chance to look down the nose of one of those, you will see that its cross-sectional area is *tiny*. Pretty much as small as Kelly Johnson could get it (for obvious reasons). It isn\u0027t all that long and it would be hard to imagine it carrying something much bigger than a pegasus (and even that \u0022only\u0022 carries 1 Tonne). For something made in the Apollo era (listed as 1966) it still isn\u0027t clear that we could duplicate much of it (what can we produce for a superstructure that is better than titanium? My guess is that a modern \u0022blackbird\u0022 might not leak: *huge* in lowering fuel costs, and I suspect it desperately needed artificial stabilization (as did the U2), but little real advances in making it a launch platform.Anyone who really thinks spaceplanes are the answer really ought to price out the jet engines needed for such a beast. Modern commercial airlines barely break even (or worse) on 20 minute turn around. If that jet engine isn\u0027t in the air/space \u0026gt;80% of the time, things are going to get seriously expensive. Rockets make a lot of sense when the craft is expendable, and fuel use is irrelevant. Rockets make even more sense when you can use them a few times (and SpaceX isn\u0027t claiming more than 10 uses for any rocket, and throwing at least one away every Falcon 9 flight).After reading the title I was assuming that this thread was more likely about Skylon flying suborbital flights to NYC or similar. Sadly, it appears to need nearly as much to accomplish that (deltaV around 7km/s) as to get to orbit. I can\u0027t see Skylon being remotely profitable either way (orbital or suborbital).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T20:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superluminaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Superluminaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could probably slap a payload on white knight, however it would be small.
