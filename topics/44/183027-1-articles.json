Nothing particularly strange about that, except they were published in 1977, so the space shuttle was something in the future spacecraft section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy family also used to have an illustrated encyclopedia from 1913, that had a description of the solar system without Pluto in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T16:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI picked up some nice 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s literature on space weapons \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIronically from a CND charity bookshop \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTiny bookshops are the best. Often the science books are quite obscure because nobody that routinely go to charity shops recognise them, or are interested. And some of them can be quite rare -\u00A0Those books I mention, I think I spent \u00A320. I looked them up on amazon and the total was closer to \u00A3200.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and I picked up a quantum physics primer published in 1946 just the other day.
