I know that (in the US at least) amateurs launching small (well, I guess it would be large for amateur rocketry) sounding rockets have to receive clearance from the FAA and have airspace cleared to launch. In the case of an orbital craft, I would assume that you\u0027d have to clear a much larger area, as well as a larger altitude band (although I\u0027m not sure the altitude increase would be as large a problem, as most commercial flights tend to stay below 40,000 feet or so). Does anyone know how that might affect the difficulty of receiving clearance, or how \u0022friendly\u0022 the FAA is in general to amateur rocketry?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso... I\u0027ve never heard anything about informing the secretary general of the UN. I don\u0027t think the GoFast team that launched a sounding rocket into space in 2004 did that, and IDK if CS has either. I\u0027m not sure exactly how one would go about doing that -- it\u0027s not like you could just call the UN and ask to speak with the secretary-general about getting clearance to launch your amateur cubesat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, I don\u0027t intend to launch anything into orbit, especially not on a homemade rocket \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E as I have neither the knowledge, time, or money to do so (especially not the money...).
