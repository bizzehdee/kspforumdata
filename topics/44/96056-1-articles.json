A while ago I tried finding out how cost-effective this recovery/refitting was, but I couldn\u0027t find any concrete numbers. Scott Manley released a video today about mods that recover dropped stages if they have enough parachutes and it made me think about this again. So if anyone knows/can find numbers on the recovery/refitting of Shuttle SRBs, I\u0027d love to know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T22:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SRB\u0027s weren\u0027t refitted, they were dismantled and some pieces used to assemble new ones.

Their biggest selling point was being able to move the 6 pieces of SRB via train instead of by ship and have them assembled by NASA. Salt water corrosion did much of the damage. But in the wake of the Challenger disaster, pieces had to be retired much earlier due to exhaust gas eroding the joints between sections. If I remember correctly, individual pieces of SRB lasted maybe 40% of their advertised life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T03:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThiokol did the manufacturing of the motors and solid fuel segments.
