Insurance will be a factor since there aren\u0027t alot of electric cars out there compared to conventional vehicles so there may be an increase in yearly payments (statistical models, cost of parts, claims, etc).

There isn\u0027t much of a second hand market yet, because the batteries represent a good proportion of the cost of the car and a significant risk to buyers. That\u0027s why I think Renault\u0027s solution of renting the batteries on a subscription basis has merit. It removes the risk of owning and buying batteries. When they stop holding charge, you just bring them in and replace them. Last time I looked, the cost of renting the batteries and charging was comparable to the fuel cost of a diesel vehicle, and cheaper than a petrol/gas car.

There isn\u0027t much of a second hand market yet, because the batteries represent a good proportion of the cost of the car and a significant risk to buyers. That\u0027s why I think Renault\u0027s solution of renting the batteries on a subscription basis has merit. It removes the risk of owning and buying batteries. When they stop holding charge, you just bring them in and replace them. Last time I looked, the cost of renting the batteries and charging was comparable to the fuel cost of a diesel vehicle, and cheaper than a petrol/gas car.

That in and of itself is worth it. On my old car the repair shops could never get it right on my olds, and I ended up having to do it myself. The prius in terms of reliability, hands down, the best car that I have ever owned. I replaced one little half-size battery for about 60 bucks, remote control they dealer wanted 400$ for but I bought the case on line for 12.00$. What else, my friend told me synthetic oils on prius are a waste because the engine hardly runs hot, if you are taking a long trip with high speed, use synthetic, otherwise just change oil every 6 months. There are intangible benefits of own a hybrid. Milage may very, in Utah I was getting around 60 miles to the gallon. I remember we drove from Chisos basin down to Bocillas de carmen, \u0026gt;100 mpg. The engine in a prius is only running half the time, it ages at about half the rate of a regular car.

While I can make a methane powered, ethane, acetylene, propane, or butane powered vehicle virtually emmissions free (excluding nitrous oxides) it is very difficult (as we have seen from the latest scandel with volkswagon). How you want to prevent this is cold-burning efficient combustion, the best choice is a fuel cell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiesels have a problem, because they have a high compression ratio (the center of ignition is very hot), they make more particulates and NOx exhausts. This news story here is the tip of the berg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two diseases that shorten the working life of workers (which Germany really cares about due to declining fertility rates and xenophobia) that people really don\u0027t think are environment related but really are. I could mention the one you think of, lung cancer, but this shortens your work life but also shortens your life. Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are also affected by particulate emissions and smog. Studies have found the people living along roads in industrialized areas are at much higher risk for RA, even if they never get cancer or emphysema. Environmental particulates cause inflammation, this can become systemic causing exacerbating other problems (causing lost days at work). The worst affected are the ones you want the most to keep working as they get older. So here is the basic problem . . . .we have (in my case had) been looking at the cause of inflammation for many diseases, almost all the incidence rate in the population is on the rise, in some places in the magnitude range. In a few cases with more common diseases we have the numbers to define common but not all causes. In most cases we don\u0027t have the sample size to see the environmental causes. However the identical twins separated at birth studies tell us that in the case of most inflammatory diseases, environment is about half the cause are known. For example in systemic sclerosis, most types, environmental pollution is suspected. In heavily polluted areas people tend to stay indoors, this can be a risk factor for type 1 diabetes\u00A0 (particular in children born from maternal parents who avoid sunlight) .\u00A0 There is 100 other diseases out there were particulates and NOx could be a part of the risk, we just will never have the numbers to prove it. . . .\u00A0 So, yeah, I agree, diesel should be a fuel reserved for regulated industries and scrubbed emissions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut going electric also goes along with Germany\u0027s desire to be largely run on alternative energies in the near future. But will not eliminate all pollution, the tires on cars also create emissions as the rubber on the tires is ablated or oxidizes as a function of exposure to the elements (including smog).
