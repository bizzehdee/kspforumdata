SLS Block I lifts 70 metric tons to orbit, Block II lifts 130 metric tons. It\u0027s also designed by NASA (albeit the engines and components are designed by various other companies, as was the case with the Apollo program rockets).

Sure, Falcon Heavy (and SpaceX\u0027s other products) is reusable, but reusability in the way SpaceX plans on doing so means that fuel is being used to land those rocket stages that could be used for lifting the payloads. Falcon Heavy doesn\u0027t have the power to lift the types of heavy payloads the SLS can. We\u0027re going to need to launch some pretty hefty stuff if we\u0027re going to Mars.

A lot of people these days bash on NASA, but think of what they\u0027ve done. Much of the technology for spaceflight comes from NASA and their heritage. It\u0027s been 41 years since Apollo 17 and no one has still beat us in sending astronauts to the Moon. NASA is still the world leader in space exploration (though until 2017 Russia or China will hold that title), and after 2017 they will further cement that position. A private company like SpaceX won\u0027t ever surpass NASA.
