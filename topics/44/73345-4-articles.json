I was waiting for someone to make that video because I was facepalming so hard when douchebags started spreading the original viral video around. It\u0027s unbelieveably stupid.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, actually, as usual, he has absolutely no clue what he\u0027s talking about. Friction coefficient of the glass to rubber is as good as that of concrete, and you can get the rest with modifying the surface. The road is only responsible for these last few parts of the millimeter. The rest is handled by the tire. Ever wondered why it has treads, and why it\u0027s illegal to drive on a bald tire? Anybody with the most basic understanding of physics knows that glass is a good driving surface. And glass isn\u0027t hard? Compared to what? Granite? Unfortunately, we don\u0027t build roads out of that, either. These panels need to last 2 decades at the most, because that\u0027s the life time of the solar cell, and glass is sufficiently hard for that. You know what isn\u0027t? Asphalt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason we use asphalt in so many places is because it is \u003Cem\u003Echeap\u003C/em\u003E. Other materials have better longevity (no potholes every spring) and better traction. If thunderf00t ever got off his fat ass and traveled through some southern states, he\u0027d notice that they rarely use asphalt there. Because it frigin\u0027 melts. What do they use? Concrete panels. They are larger than solar road panels, but they still use panel design, essentially, and they don\u0027t have any problems with it. In fact, roads last for many years without needs for significant repair. It\u0027s more expensive, but it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the glass tiles are going to provide a surface with sufficient traction and durability. So on the most important feature, strike one. They are perfectly functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, we get back to the costs. As I\u0027ve said, the only reason we use asphalt is because it has decent properties, not good, but passable, and it is very cheap. So, thunderf00t looks at the cost of the glass panels, and screams that it\u0027s too expensive. Of course, if he\u0027d bother to look at the price of a solar panel with the same surface area, he\u0027d realize that it\u0027s much more expensive. So by his logic, obviously, nobody would ever consider installing a solar panel because of its costs, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the real world, we like to look at what we are actually getting out of the solar panel. And even in United States, a solar panel pays for itself over its life time almost double. A solar panel with a tempered glass pane will also pay for itself even at current prices of electricity, and these are sure to increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo strike two. Even though these things are very expensive in the short run, the electricity they provide over life time costs more. And you get a road you don\u0027t have to repair every year as a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on. The last part of it all that I consider important. Distribution network. Every morning when thunderf00t wakes up, goes to the bathroom, and flips the light switch, the light bulbs instantly explode, because he forgot that he has a 30kV line leading directly to his home. What? He doesn\u0027t? But how does he get the power, which can only be efficiently distributed using high voltage lines? Oh. He gets it from a transformer nearby, which gets its power from a sub-station which has already reduced the voltage? So moving power over shorter distances at lower voltage is ok? So all we really need to do is have the solar roadways plug into an AC converter every few hundred yards, and then collect power from larger and larger area to be directed to sub-stations? Huh. In fact, this can probably be done using the same infrastructure that already exists to light a lot of the roads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that would be strike three. Power distribution isn\u0027t a problem at all. It might be in some areas. But the nice thing about the project is that we don\u0027t have to try and cover all of the US at once. We can start with medium sized cities in the South, where they already know the value of building roads to last, where they have more sunny days, and where there is sufficient number of roadways with power distribution in place already. There, it\u0027s simply going to make economic sense to build with these tiles instead of concrete tiles next time the road does happen to need repair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these are the only things that matters. The rest are just gimmicks. Though, thunderf00t clearly doesn\u0027t realize how little power LEDs would need to provide some functionality at night or during the rain to make roads so much easier to navigate. But I don\u0027t even care about that. Or about the whole \u0022recycled materials\u0022 crap. I don\u0027t care how they sell this idea. I\u0027m not even sure this particular product is ever going to make it. But the idea of using solar panels to pave roads is absolutely solid. It makes both environmental and economical sense, and we are going to have that sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T04:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReasoned argument isn\u0027t a baseball game.
