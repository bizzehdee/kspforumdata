First, let me say I am very interested in this project and would like to lend a helping hand. I think it has great potential but I have some major concerns. I read a little here and most of the threads on the mossat website. Maybe I missed something, but I\u0027m going to quickly outline my concerns here. I suppose I\u0027ll make an account there sometime this week and voice more specific concerns and suggestions there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The available baseline data on the selected moss species and selected technique for growing it. What made you guys decide on this species? Do we have a list of published research on this species, how to grow it, nutrient requirements, light requirements, response to microgravity (0G), ability to grow under zero light conditions with selected media, response lighting from the flash for the camera, etc? There is a plethora of information we need to have clear on this species so that we can form a proper null hypothesis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once we have that information on this species, we need to begin running experiments on it ASAP. We need to start an R\u0026amp;D type program to develop the best techniques for propagating the species and help rapidly prototype the holders, starting atmospheric conditions, etc. needed to get success. That way we have a baseline set of data to compare our data with. It will also give us metrics to measure. Taking a picture sounds great, but we need ways to interpret that data once we get it. We can take pictures and then measure all sorts of things so that we can correlate the pictures from space vs. what we already know. For example, (assuming we decide to change the experiment and allow a light source) we can measure photosynthesis levels or some other metric of the health of each plant based on color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Design of experiment. How are the samples going to be mounted inside the cubesat? Radially along the outside walls? I see some discussion on the website but I can\u0027t view any of the pictures posted for some reason. I think I may have a novel idea which will allow us to conduct two gravity level experiments simultaneously. I think this is absolutely needed because it simplifies other aspects of the design and minimized the variables for each sample. Besides the simplicity of less sensors, less need to modify/control the climate which leads to abrupt swings in parameters, etc., I think the solution I have will mean less crossover of initial conditions from the previous experiments. What I mean is, if you do a .3G test first, then do a .6G test, how will you prove that the first G load didn\u0027t affect the second G load test and so on. I suppose you could have separate compartments, have some way to suspend the growth of the moss and then somehow restart it\u0027s growth. I think that is the intention by just sending up seeds or something and then hydrating them? That gets VERY complicated. This thing should be simple. with as few things to go wrong as possible. Having multiple samples each with it\u0027s own climate control systems for O2 and CO2, plus sensors, plus mechanisms to add water selectively, etc... That\u0027s way too complicated, IMO. My solution will keep all samples in the same atmosphere, provide two different G conditions at the same exact time which can be chosen during the design phase and have all samples in the experiment running together. I\u0027ll explain my solution to these issues if someone shows interest or will just prepare something for you guys over on the mossat site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone is wondering what my background is, I have a BS in Agronomy-Plant and Soil Science in which my concentration was Crop Management. I also have a minor in Environmental Management Systems. During college I worked for a research farm for LSU so I\u0027m familiar with designing, implementing, gathering, collecting and sorting data for research trials for plants and to some extent fungi, insects, and bacteria. I currently work at a chemical plant as an operator, and I\u0027m routinely (currently almost daily) designing and troubleshooting systems (by systems I mean both process systems and computerized control systems) along with our engineering group. I think this is a great project and hope that I can help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T21:12:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cdugas4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, im new here, but... how are we going to actually fund this?
