I was thinking of some kind of electromagnet/capacitor release, with the magnet attached to the first stage and an iron ring on the second stage. The biggest problem is pressurising/connecting the second stage for launch without the pressure and water escaping before the stages connect. And the electromagnet and iron may be too heavy to make it worthwhile.If anyone else could have a go, that would be cool \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-13T18:16:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2017 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Skylon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T23:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI clicked the link thinking about a toy from my youth [1970s, although I think the toy dates from the 1960s]. \u00A0I\u0027m guessing it was the same tech as a supersoaker only pointed down (I don\u0027t recall trying to use one as a water pistol, then again it would be hard to fire and there was no throttle). \u00A0I think there was a more expensive model with a standard (small) rocket and a larger first stage. \u00A0I suspect when the water pressure of the base dropped enough below the water pressure of the top stage, a spring released and launched the top stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t expect the thing to go too high. \u00A0The only thing slowing down the flight down was the angled\u00A0rear fins that made the thing spin on the way up/down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T23:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater rocket fliers have been doing two and even three stage birds for decades.\u00A0 Do some digging on YouTube and Google and you\u0027ll find lots of information on how they pressurize the upper stage (I believe it\u0027s done through the first stage nozzle), how they control staging, and even how they arrange parachutes to deploy at apogee rather than when the upper stage is empty.\u00A0 The altitude record, last time I recall, was over 2000 feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-16T00:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://aircommandrockets.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://aircommandrockets.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve done one launch that was two staged with boosters and probably hold the altitude record for non-fiberglass water rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
