Hudson\u0027s research group has discovered important nuances that revise the current understanding of the cooling process, explain the difficulties encountered in previous cooling experiments and show a new path forward for creating ultra-cold ion samples. With this framework the researchers showed how troublesome effects can be overcome and even exploited to study the mechanisms at play in molecular motors and single-atom heat engines in a precisely controlled manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Of course, this work does not violate the laws of thermodynamics, but it does demonstrate there are still some interesting, potentially useful things to learn about buffer gas cooling,\u0022 said John Gillaspy, a physics division program director at the National Science Foundation, which funds the research. \u0022This is the sort of fundamental research that can really guide a wide range of more applied research efforts, helping other scientists and engineers to avoid going down dead-end paths and illuminating more fruitful directions they might take instead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo well, there are no departure from laws of thermodynamic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T04:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently the author of the article didn\u0027t read his own article.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lugge","CreatedById":143343,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T05:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRandom link is random.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T07:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pedant in me wants to say, \u0022Well, it did say \u0022apparent\u0022...\u0022, and also that the article probably wasn\u0027t written by the author of the paper, but christ its like *every* research paper/article has to have something about thermodynamics violation,\u00A0rewriting physics as we know it, something travelling faster than light, causality violations or the other chesnut: \u0022like a lightsaber\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022New low-friction bearing in 2016 line of hotwheels may produce infinite momentum!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Experiments in nanolathing may produce\u00A0sentient computer!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022During production of pocahontas III, Disney may have accidentally created an\u00A0artificial black hole!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
