It\u0027s really interesting seeing how they did it in the 60\u0027s. I was impressed with the simple way they get the fuel to move through the system in zero gravity. I never thought of the fact that it would need some way to get the fuel to the ports... I just assumed that it would go there under pressure but as you use the fuel, the pressure in the fuel tank drops and then you get less fuel the more you use it... so they added an internal bladder in the fuel tank with helium gas around it that is pumped in to squeeze the fuel out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-13T07:30:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2013 07:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T08:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, when you look at all the engineering details in Apollo, it really leaves you in awe.
