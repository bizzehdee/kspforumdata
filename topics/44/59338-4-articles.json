Some genetic conditions are obviously disabling, and there is no reason to take on people with these when you can take on healthier individuals. But it gets very shaky very fast as you go down to less obvious things. Maybe a particular genetic variation makes you more likely to get Alzheimer\u0027s, but it gives you a higher IQ. Do you want to just discard that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also plenty of things which you just don\u0027t know that they are a problem, until you end up with a small population and you get just the right set of genes present in one individual. So you have to take a look at why genetic diversity is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s important for the same exact reason that inbreeding is bad. Every single person is going to have some genes \u0022broken\u0022. Some of these might be responsible for producing melanin in your hair. Others could be producing some enzyme you need to survive. Fortunately, you have two sets of genes. Parental and maternal. And so even if you picked up a vital broken gene, the working gene in the other chromosome still produces what you need. In other words, you are a carrier for a genetic condition that\u0027s recessive on this particular allele. But you don\u0027t have a condition, because the working gene is dominant, and you\u0027re fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you do have 50% chance of passing on that broken gene down to your child. If your partner happens to have the same recessive gene, and also passes it on, child will have two copies of the broken gene, and will therefore have the condition which could be disabling or fatal. Or it could be just blond hair. Fortunately, deadly or disabling conditions are rare, so the odds of two people who are carriers for the \u003Cem\u003Esame\u003C/em\u003E condition are absolutely minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a case for siblings. Siblings share 50% of genome on average. Meaning that if one of them is a carrier for something, the other one has a 50% to be a carrier too. And like I said, everyone\u0027s a carrier for \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E. That results in very high chance of offsprings with various genetic problems. If it\u0027s something benign, it can stick in the population. If not, it\u0027s probably going to get filtered out fast. But you can also have something that\u0027s harmful, but not outright deadly or disabling, and that can lead to entire populations with serious health problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith small populations, you end up with the same problem. That small population is going to bring with them their own sample of recessive genes. And after just a few generations, it\u0027s going to be almost impossible for two individuals to not have some sort of a shared ancestor. And that significantly increases odds of two individuals being carriers for the same condition. The rest is just statistics. Some recessive gene, just by chance, becomes extremely common in population. If it\u0027s something harmless, like blue eyes or red hair, it can stick with the ancestors of that small population. But if it\u0027s something disabling, it can result in all sorts of problems leading to a degradation and demise of the group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what sort of a genetic diversity would you look for on a generation ship or an evacuation ship? You\u0027d start by screening for known genetic diseases that are disabling or deadly. These people simply don\u0027t make it on the ship. I\u0027m sure we can lose some very important people this way, but short term benefits shouldn\u0027t outweigh long term survival. Then you start looking at any conditions that are known to be, lets say, slightly detrimental. There would have to be a quota on these, and you should try avoiding getting multiple people with the same conditions. The last stage is going through recessive genes in general, and trying to make sure that the population of the ship is going to be as diverse in these, recessive, genes. If the gene is dominant, it\u0027s expressed, and you can check the health and abilities of the individual in other tests. Critical dominant genes will not be diverse, but they don\u0027t need to be. The rest will end up having sufficient diversity simply by random draw. Recessive genes are the ones that have to be checked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, all of this is a bit oversimplified, but the method can be made rigorous with a goal of maximizing long term viability of the group.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T22:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy solution to the genetic diversity/eugenics idea - no natural births.
