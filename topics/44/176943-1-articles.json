They are usually larger than Earth. When you have an ocean compressed so much, the water turns into an exotic form of ice a thousand or so kilometers down, similarly to how hydrogen becomes a metal inside of gas giants. You might be able to get a smaller, moon-sized glob of water out of some sort of grazing impact, which might not have enough pressure in the core to turn into ice.
