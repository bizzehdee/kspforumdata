The atmospheric pressure would be within a few bar limit, and surface gravity would be within tolerable for a landing. I\u0027d also throw in a few moons. Could make for some really interesting challenges, and it\u0027d be different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: So here are some numbers to go along with that. Assuming Nine has a rocky core, but still covered by a lot of ice, I would guess that it\u0027d be rather dense for an ice giant, and rather fluffy for a rocky world. So I went with 3g/cm\u00B3. That might be a little high, but we\u0027re stretching things here to make it fun for the game. That puts radius at a little under 17,000km. Almost 3x the Earth\u0027s. The neat thing about that is that the surface gravity, ends up being mere 13.8m/s\u00B2. About 40% higher than Earth\u0027s! You\u0027d be able to survive on that world, provided sufficient heat insulation. The orbital velocity would be rather high, at about 15km/s, which is about twice that for Earth, but it\u0027s nothing insane. Finally, the atmosphere. Depending on typical temperature, it could be anywhere from 1 to 10 bar. On the plus side, scale height should be comparatively small, making it a little easier to escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScaling that to KSP, I\u0027d do basically the same thing they did with Kerbin. Take radius at 1/10th and keep the surface gravity. That would put radius of KSP Nine at 1,700km and surface gravity at 1.4g. That puts orbital velocity in KSP at\u00A04,834 m/s. Then I would set surface pressure at 4 atm and scale height at 4km. That will make ascent from Nine about as challenging as ascent from Eve, especially since there won\u0027t be any significant mountains on the surface to help you along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoubt it would look like that. Since it would be so close to Super Earth/Ice giant, it would likely have an extremely think atmosphere, to the point where gases\u00A0get supercritical (like on Venus), but even then, they would likely be things closer to 0*C\u00A0water in temperature, due to internal heating. It might be possible to land, but good freaking luck getting out of the gravity well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T11:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222373661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453432845\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChrisSpace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, ChrisSpace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically it\u0027s one step \u0027behind\u0027 Titan?

Conditions much closer to what we see on rocky worlds than gas giants. I\u0027ll grant you, that this is very unusual for a Gas/Ice Giant, or even a large Super-Earth, but only because our study is focused on much warmer worlds. We tend to see the smaller worlds have a solid surface, and large worlds have layers. But the boundary depends on size and temperature of the world. A good example, once again, is Venus. It\u0027s an Earth-sized world, but due to its temperature, it already starts exhibiting some of the features we expect of a large Super-Earth. Likewise, Nine should be an ice giant. And had it remained in the outer system, it would certainly be one of these layered planets with no well-defined surface. But with temperatures as lows they should be on that world, I expect an environment that at the first glance looks very terrestrial. A well-defined surface, either icy with lakes of Hydrogen, or a global Hydrogen ocean, and above it, an atmosphere of a few bar with clouds of Hydrogen mist. All on a world with a surface gravity 30%-50% higher than that on Earth.
