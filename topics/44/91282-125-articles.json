The biggest difference between the two planes was the materials used to make them. While the X-15 could get by with aluminum and steel for its frame, the X-15B\u2019s orbital re-entry would have caused it to deal with much higher temperatures: as high as 2700 Celsius on the leading wing edges. Regular structural metals would sag and melt when subjected to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result the nickel alloy Inconel X, which was used only for the heat-resistant skin of the X-15, was restricted to the area of the plane\u2019s frame behind the nose and above the belly. Those other two areas, as well as the wings and tail fins, had to use more exotic refractory materials like graphite, molybdenum, and beryllium oxide. Where the heat was worst, NAA planned on using thorium(IV) oxide, which means that\u2014like its predecessor the\u00A0Douglas Model 684\u2014the X-15B would have been somewhat radioactive. Unlike the Douglas plane only structural elements for the tail fin edges and the roots of the wing edges would have used the stuff, not the whole skin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe skin of the plane would have been even more exotic, including molybdenum, tungsten, the Ren\u00E9-41 alloy used for the shell of the Mercury capsule, and niobium. The last of these was a particularly interesting call as at the time the Dyna-Soar was also looking as if it were going to made out of the same metal, and together they would have used up more than the world\u2019s annual production of the metal for a few years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://falsesteps.wordpress.com/2012/09/15/x-15b-shortcut-to-space/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://falsesteps.wordpress.com/2012/09/15/x-15b-shortcut-to-space/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-13T15:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223617186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221560352756\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is not doubt why they envisioned the X-20 to replace it when going to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like the X-20 uses a similar strategy as the Shuttle in returning from orbit.\u00A0 I wonder if they would have had similar (or worse) issues with tile replacement on the X-20.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223617198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221560353500\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a USAF \u0026amp;

Or even coated the airframe in ablative coating- which, as a reminder, worked on the X-15 test flight. The main issue with the coating during the X-15 flight was with the X-15 and not the coating. It ablated as intended, the issue was the airframe of the X-15 was designed to cool through the airframe and it\u0027s skin, which the coating prevented. Assuming they built the X-20 with this knowledge in mind they could\u0027ve engineered the vehicle to survive that issue.
