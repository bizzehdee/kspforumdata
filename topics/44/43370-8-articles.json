These individuals had an intellect on the outside of the bell curve, as well as ability to think through problems both systematically and creatively. They wouldn\u0027t have achieved what they did without such abilities. As such, you cannot compare them to an average individual even in a context of a problem where any education or prior experience are useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere can be people better qualified to make a judgement on these things, but we are still talking about a very small group of people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
