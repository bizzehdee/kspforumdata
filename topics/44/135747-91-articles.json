As you point out tanks are tested, but the summer 2014 incident was probably a tested tank as well. So we would need to postulate that the relevant failure mode of the tanks is a sudden failure with little to no warning before hand. Further we need to postulate that the cause of the 2014 incident was either never found or misdiagnosed or no fixes were implemented.

I had thought that the turnover time between building the rocket and launching the rocket was quite small for SpaceX, as having a built rocket just sitting around unused doesn\u0027t benefit you in any way. \u003Cp\u003EGah, I\u0027ll take the hurricanes in NY instead. Stupid Chinese butterflies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it does make the solution obvious for SpaceX. We just need to kill all the butterflies. I propose we make butterfly hunting, self evolving, nanites and release them into the wild....what..what are all of you looking at me like that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T03:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo Replicators allowed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Airlock","CreatedById":101601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T06:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T13:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Airlock\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Airlock\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T22:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Leszek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Leszek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAccording the cited article, SpaceX has moved to producing the tanks in house just like you said. However it also states that this is a recent change. So in order to this be a real connection to the issue, SpaceX had to have used tanks they acquired before moving production in house. As you point out tanks are tested, but the summer 2014 incident was probably a tested tank as well. So we would need to postulate that the relevant failure mode of the tanks is a sudden failure with little to no warning before hand. Further we need to postulate that the cause of the 2014 incident was either never found or misdiagnosed or no fixes were implemented. We would have to postulate that SpaceX either was disinterested in this failure or otherwise deemed it not relevant. (Or else why use the old tank even if you had it in stock?)\u003Cp\u003ENot impossible but I agree that you have to add a fair bit of conditions to see it happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut regardless, even if the proposed link was much more plausible, we have a vast lack of data regarding the event. Any speculation is just that, speculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I find the lack of information a week after the event is disturbing, it implies that this could be one of those round about failures that reads like a Rub Goldberg machine. It starts with a butterfly in China flapping its wings and ends with the SpaceX Falcon 9 tearing itself to pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also the helium tanks not the huge LOF/OX tanks, it makes perfectly sense to outsource the small high pressure ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
