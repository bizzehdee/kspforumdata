Boyd had flown in Korea and came back to weapons school. \u00A0At the time, the Air Flrce was committed to stand-off missiles and was convinced the dogfight was done. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nService politics being what they are, Boyd retired as a Colnel and had his biggest impact after retirement giving us airplanes like the F-5 and F-16.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dnipogo.org/boyd/pdf/boydaerialattack.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.dnipogo.org/boyd/pdf/boydaerialattack.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
