In this scenario the missile and the defending fighter are going towards each other so the distance the defending fighter travels in the time it takes for the missile to get there adds to the missiles range; if that fighter simply turns sideways or around, after the missile is fired, it will remove that added range and the missile will fall short.\n\nThis is why missiles have NEZ (no escape zones), a range where even if the fighter turns around completely, going \u0027cold\u0027, the missile will still reach it.\n\nThere are other ways to reduce the effectiveness of missiles as well: while they can turn hard when they have energy, they use up energy very fast when turning. Because of their limited deltaV a missile can only do so much turning before it runs out of energy completely and essentially becomes a lawn dart; fighters can use this by forcing the missile to make many maneuvers on it\u0027s way to the target and use up it\u0027s energy, so that **if** it gets there, the missile has low energy and the fighter can dodge it with an appropriate maneuver. Missiles have lead guidance, so if the fighter turns one way and then the other (called cranking), soon after the missile is launched, it forces the missile to predicatively aim ahead of the fighter back and forth causing it to lose allot of energy, as well as reducing the closure rate of the defending fighter to the missile.\n\nMissiles also have more drag at lower altitudes so it can sometimes be a good idea for the fighter pilot to dive to reduce the missile\u0027s range (at high mach drag matters more than gravity for the missile\u0027s energy), this also works well with Notching, a technique for confusing radars that rely on Doppler shift to disern targets from ground clutter (basically, when a something is moving towards or away from you relative to the ground, the radar return is doppler shifted relative to the ground, however, if that thing moves at the same speed relative to the ground the doppler shift becomes the same as the ground and it can disappear into the ground clutter - so if pilots fly with the enemy radar direction normal to their velocity vector with the ground behind them, they can break a lock-), i\u0027m not sure how well this works with modern AESA radars though. \n\nJamming and stealth generally don\u0027t do much for losing missiles, the whole point of them is to prevent getting detected/prevent a launch solution in the first place.     \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-18T13:31:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2016 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pyrosheep**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T14:16:12Z","Content":"The first Interstellar Battleship really engineered (just still not built) by humanity.\n\nProject Daedalus.  \n\nTwo-stage anti-planetary homing missile with 450 t kinetic warhead.  \n\nA world killer, A hammer of faith.\n\n![Daedalus_Saturn_V_comparison.jpg](http://www.daviddarling.info/images2/Daedalus_Saturn_V_comparison.jpg)\n\nA two-staged thermonuclear booster accelerates a 450 t kinetic warhead up to 0.1 c speed, aiming to a potentially habitable planet system, as close to the target planet as it\u0027s possible.\n\nAfter the booster has burnt out and decoupled, the warhead floats through the space with no option to stop or to avoid a collision.
