The mission may also test the Chang\u0027e 5 propulsion system although there is no proof of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lunar probe consists of 2 sections, the service module which has been described as a chang\u0027e 2 replica but modified with various other systems and possibly the experimental propulsion system although as stated this is not confirmed. The second section consists of the return capsule, a scaled down shenzhou descent capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probes will have a few scientific instruments such as radiation measuring devices as well as biological samples housed in the return capsule, these include plants and bacteria.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe will be launched from Xichang launch center on a Long March 3C rocket, earlier reports state it will travel to the moon on a free return trajectory however newer reports from inside China report it will enter lunar orbit and stay for up to a month to perform research, this would mean the service module has the experimental propulsion system, so far it unknown which one is correct. After departing the moon the probe would perform skip re-entry and land in Mongolia. The shortest mission time would be 9 days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T19:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExperimental propulsion module?

The cooperation with Roscosmos payed off very well, so hundreds of millions didn\u0027t have to be spent on designing a completely new hardware for Shenzhou. China as for now lacks of scientific missions beyond the chang\u0027e program except for some plans but at least the money isn\u0027t split up into too many departments. Though I absolutely support unmanned science missions as a priority, that\u0027s why NASA \u0027can\u0027t afford\u0027 too bold missions from 17.5. Earth science, ISS, rover/satellite missions are eating up most of the money and they also have to build up the equipment for the new launch system with ultramodern machinery at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this cool facebook site for the the Chinese space program.
