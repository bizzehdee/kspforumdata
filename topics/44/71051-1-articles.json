Only a handful of jobs would be replaced initially, but eventually you would reach a point where the only people who still have jobs, are those who work in a tiny handful of elite tech industries. It seems to me that this would wipe out the financial system, because nobody can afford to pay for the services provided by these robots. Nevertheless, there are no alternatives, because robots are doing ALL of the work. The people who have provided these services still want to be paid for it, but they can\u0027t get paid.

There\u0027s a limit on how much we can consume. Barring wars, you could have a post-scarcity economy.

If you have unlimited power you have unlimited water (you can distill it from the ocean, since Earth is a closed system, it won\u0027t run out). Unlimited food would be the hardest part, but with unlimited power and water it might be possible to achieve via genetic engineering. Then there\u0027s a matter of space for all that, but with unlimited power and water you can electrolyse to get unlimited fuel for hydrolox rockets, and set stuff up in space. Beyond that, it\u0027s just a matter of setting up enough resource mines in the Solar System, and enough robotic factories for making robots (and other things, as a side job) from those resources. If those factories are good enough, you end up with a system that not only expands itself exponentially (or nearly so), while providing more and more goods for human consumption.
