Even though they are wildly inefficient for sudden lethality when compared to a rifle or even an ancient sword.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if a modern army unit was up against guys with scifi BOMB slug throwers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScenario: The bad guys have both pistols and AK-47\u0027s with special bomb bullets. Look like normal bullets but when they impact they explode with the force of a modern grenade and even have shrapnel, albeit much less than a real grenade (since you can only fill so many metal beads inside the hollow nose of a bullet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion: How can a modern army unit with guns only in a hope to win against... THAT?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know suppressive fire? If the baddies start laying down suppressive fire and soldiers are hiding behind cover, the bomb bullets will blast through it anyway with sustained fire. Less places to hide effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is only one main advantage the modern army guys have, and that\u0027s the fact that it will be fairly easy to track where fire is coming from... because every shot, hit or miss leaves a smoking crater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand if the baddies use fog of war tactics with shock and awe, then the modern army guys may not be to stunned and in pain to fight back effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince with regular guns a near miss with a bullet hitting the ground only scares you, but with these you are going to take an injury, the worse the closer you are to the blastwave and shrapnel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The easiest way to deal with this threat is to just call air support, be it drones or attack aircraft which the baddies on the ground can\u0027t reach effectively with their guns.
