Each step would need to be carefully considered. Honestly, a good place to look would be the Rouge River industrial complex which was designed to go from raw materials like soda lime and iron ore to cars. Everything to build cars was done there except acquiring raw materials. Steel mills, foundries, machine shops, assembly line all of that was in one spot. I would assume that space manufacturing would be somewhat similar where everything would be in one spot. So then the next question is that for each one of those parts of the manufacturing chain, what is the best way of doing it? Do you grab an asteroid whole and melt it down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you melt it down? They already use electric arc furnaces in steel mills and foundries so that might not be a bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you purify the ore? Normally, once it is liquid any gas would bubble out but it doesn\u0027t work like that in zero g. Hypothetically you could centrifuge it but that would be a pretty huge centrifuge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter melting down ore and purifying it into usable alloys, how do you produce the next rough shapes? 3D printing seems like a cool way of doing it but it is an incredibly slow process. Do you make structural shapes like I beams, tubes, and flat sheets? These are things that engineers are already used to working with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow are they assembled? Bolting and riveting could be done like current spacecraft. Are the fasteners made in onsite as well? Electric arc welding could be beneficial. Hypothetically in space you\u00A0wouldn\u0027t need shield gas so that seems promising.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many questions to answer about in orbit raw material to finished product manufacturing that need to be answered. To me, they are all interesting and exciting because no one has ever done it before but that doesn\u0027t mean that there aren\u0027t analogs here on the ground. As for what spacecraft would look like, they would likely be a product of \u0022whatever is easiest\u0022 along each step of the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T20:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222845741\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478793292\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMillenium Falcon isn\u0027t a ship of future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe also wasn\u0027t built only for operation in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say you should look to the LM and ISS/Mir for your best bets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T09:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222845995\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478806470\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137852\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Racescort666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Racescort666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you make structural shapes like I beams, tubes, and flat sheets?
