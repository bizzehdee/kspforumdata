It depends on many factors, like the composition (imagine meteoric iron impacting solid rock), angle of impact, speed of impact, mass of the objects, which not only affects inertia but also the strength of their gravitational fields. Overall, its a very difficult thing to simulate and its not just a matter of a fixed amount being ejected into space every single time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If we look at Earth, the most common elements are iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%) (from Wikipedia).

For a planet to have an atmosphere it must have a magnetic field (otherwise it will be stripped away by stellar winds) and sufficient gravity (mass) to keep a hold of it. A magnetic field requires a rotating liquid iron core, which means the planet cannot be too close to the star otherwise it will be tidally locked and rotation will be too slow.

Lets have look:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a game mechanical point of view, you will have to define what metals the colliding bodies are made of (in percentages, or wholesale, whatever fits your needs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with colliding objects originates from angle of impact, mass and relative velocity (given M2 is always the approaching body):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erelative velocity Vr = 5 m/s and angle of impact \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 = 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and both bodies M1 and M2 have 50 kg mass then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly conservation of momentum will occur, as the angle 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 states the body to becoming from behind and gently pushing the other body.

M3 will be moving at around 500 m/s faster now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVr = 50 m/s and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 = 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at M1 = M2 = 50 kg then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are colliding at a right angle, meaning M3 will have a mass of about 33 kg, which is created by the collision of M1 and M2 and flying off at a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle.

This surface is the most exposed to the cosmos. The crust can be reshaping constantly: Earth\u0027s crust is recycled in a 4 billion year cycle due to tectonic movement, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mantle is the region between the crust and the core, and in the case of the Earth, the mantle is mostly solid and the place where tectonic plates are molten and born (being consumed by the mantle or pushed out of the mantle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, the Moon\u0027s mantle is solid and cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding on to this, many rocky worlds with significant gravity and (usually) a magnetic field an posses a gaseous layer, the atmosphere. Earth is able to do this despite its proximity to the Sun (magnetic field and high gravity). Venus also has an atmosphere, despite it being closer to the Sun and having a lower gravity. Venus only manages to retain this atmosphere because it consists of 96% carbon dioxide, a gas too heavy for the solar wind to effectively sweep away into space. Mars, however, also has a mainly carbon dioxide atmosphere, but due to its low gravity (38% of Earth\u0027s), the solar wind doesn\u0027t have to work hard to strip away Mars\u0027 atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the contrary, gaseous worlds (like Jupiter), accreted more hydrogen and helium than heavier elements, resulting in them having huge atmospheres when compared to their solid cores. Jupiter consists mainly of hydrogen 75% and helium 24%. While this results in a much lower density than Earth\u0027s, the gravity is still higher due to the mass. Gaseous worlds still feature a mantle and core, however, usually the mantle and the core are the same thing, meaning they have a solid core simply due to the atmospheric pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric development can be triggered by a variety of conditions. Earth and Venus contrast very well here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth used to have an atmosphere of mainly carbon dioxide, however, once life evolved due to thunderstorms and hydrocarbons (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment\u003C/a\u003E), it used its surroundings to benefit itself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we know, plants absorb CO2 and H2O (carbon dioxide and water) as well as sunlight in order to produce molecular oxygen. This is one fundamental building block for any planet to sustain animals, which do not produce O2 anymore but consume O2, producing CO2, creating a closed carbon cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore plants however, chemoautotrophs ruled the planet, which don\u0027t require sunlight in order to produce O2 as a by-product. These organisms (now rare and located at deep sea vents, highly toxic to most organisms, but not these microbes) are the root for all life on Earth, being not only the first, but also those to set the stage for later organisms. Through billions of years time, the Earths atmosphere went from being highly toxic (containing CO2 and H2S) to containing more and more oxygen, which eventually made it safe to populate the continents with life (as water is a very good radiation shield, and before 3.5 billion years ago, the Earth had no magnetosphere and hence the continents were all radioactive hells which could kill you fairly quickly, not to mention the temperature.) The evolution into plants paved the way for animals to live without having chlorophyll themselves (some microbes were mobile, possessing flagella, but retaining chlorophyll despite their heterotrophic nature.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth\u0027s CO2 accreted with the planet, similar to Venus\u0027. However, on Venus, a runaway greenhouse effect was produced, which resulted in the water there being vaporized and stripped away by the solar wind. Venus has always had a surface temperature too high to sustain life, which contributed to the runaway greenhouse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T13:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eelements in Earth\u0027s crust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eminerals in Earth\u0027s crust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/jesei/minerals/students.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/jesei/minerals/students.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"grawl","CreatedById":17329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T14:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your replies !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided, as I am running low on time (2 weeks left \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E ) to keep it simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I will keep my accretion rate at a constant 2/3 of the mass, maybe a bit less, it\u0027s working well for me after the tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have all the starting objects formed by only one element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the list :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Oxygen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Silicium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aluminium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Iron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Calcium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sodium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Potassium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Magnesium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Carbon \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Frozen Carbon Dioxide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Frozen water \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mechanics will be : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid materials will create the planet itself, with the materials dispatched as layers, from the heavier (center) to the lighter (border).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrozen materials will, or will not, depending on the parameters, form an atmosphere around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve managed to take some screenshots in the eclipse emulator some time ago.
