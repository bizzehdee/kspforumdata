People\u0027s attention spans aren\u0027t that long, and while I automatically know what is meant by \u0022higher\u0022 and \u0022lower\u0022 energy radiation, most people don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the concepts should be simplified, using terms closer to everyday use. For example...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Radiation is a term scientists use\u00A0to describe any form of moving energy. Heat moving between two objects is a form of radiation. Light is a form of radiation. Electricity is a form of radiation. Relativistic particles in nuclear colliders are a form of radiation. Even waves on the surface of the ocean can be considered radiation. Most of the time, radiation refers to light or things like light, so that\u0027s what we\u0027ll be talking about here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Obviously, not all radiation is dangerous, or we would all drop dead instantly. Whether a particular kind of radiation is dangerous depends on a relatively familiar factor: temperature. \u0027Hot\u0027 radiation will burn you; \u0027cold\u0027 radiation will not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Most radiation we are exposed to is low-temperature radiation...radiation so \u0027cold\u0027 that no amount of it will ever be able to hurt you. Radios, computers, cellphones, and televisions all operate using radiation with a temperature far, far lower than the human body, so they have no chance of causing harm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Slightly warmer radiation includes microwave radiation, infrared radiation, artificial lights,\u00A0and sunlight. These are closer to the temperature of the human body, so they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0burn you...but only if you are exposed to quite a lot. Cooking food in the microwave or going outside on a sunny day is basically the same process:\u00A0you\u0027re exposing an object (the food, in the first case, or yourself in the second case) to a LOT of slightly-warm light. Too much, and you\u0027ll burn. However, burns from microwave, infrared, or sunlight affect only the surface of your body and cannot cause long-term harm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very hot radiation includes high ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma ray, and nuclear radiation. Very hot radiation is hot enough\u00A0to burn away portions of individual atoms, which can cause cancer and death. Very hot radiation, also known as \u0027ionizing radiation\u0027, is the only thing you should worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Surprisingly, there are sources of this \u0027hot radiation\u0027 all around us...but not from technology. Rather, most sources of hot radiation already exist in\u00A0nature. Radon in the soil, potassium in bananas, ultraviolet sunlight,\u00A0and even the carbon in your body produces hot radiation. Thankfully, however, the levels of hot radiation produced from such natural sources are very low...so low that your body will recover well before any permanent damage is done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just like a very hot stove is only dangerous if you touch it, very hot radiation is only dangerous if you are exposed to a lot of it. This can happen if you are very close to a very bright source of hot radiation, like a nuclear reactor. But just like you can touch a hot stove with an oven mitt and not be burned, you can be \u0027shielded\u0027 from hot radiation pretty easily. Sunscreen shields you from hot radiation in sunlight, while the lead casings around nuclear reactors shield scientists and technicians from the hot radiation in them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Most sources of hot radiation are too dim to cause any harm, and the ones bright enough to cause harm are always kept tucked away in a safe place. Accidents with \u0027hot radiation\u0027 do happen, of course, but these are rare. Although using \u0027hot radiation\u0027 as a source of energy does carry some danger, accidents are so rare that it causes far less harm than energy sources like coal and natural gas.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T16:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222541289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461687685\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n24 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything has associated mortality/morbidity.

The same would be true for coal. Even wind power has killed a few in accidents (windmills are tall, people can fall), but the power produced is so tiny that makes it look relatively bad---though still really safe (particularly once pumping water behind dams is not the only way to store power). Ditto solar (people fall off their roofs both panels)---but still super safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you had to very roughly assign risk, then\u00A0burning stuff for power would be the most dangerous---along with dams (since real dam failures have killed hundreds of thousands of people, sadly). Every other method to produce power\u00A0would be \u0022very safe,\u0022 including nuclear. You could throw in the 2 atomic bomb casualties, and nuclear is \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E safe per unit power produced (since it makes loads of power per plant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChernobyl was bad for people, but wait, good for hermits.
