I mainly use it for astrophotography, but I think I can still help you out. Light pollution is an incredibly large factor when it comes to observing things, especially deep sky objects like star clusters and nebulae. Even though I still manage observing from my suburban part of town, try and get out into a rural area if you can. You might not like this next part, but the costs add up pretty quickly for a nice scope. I would recommend a computerized GoTo telescope if you\u0027re willing to upgrade. After a simple alignment procedure that involves you pointing the telescope at a few random stars, the telescope will automatically target anything you chose from it\u0027s database. Celestron makes a great series of introductory GoTo scopes called the NexStar SE series.

Due to their advanced mounts, you won\u0027t get that large of a telescope for your money. If you think you can handle tracking manually, go for a Dobsonian telescope. An eight inch GoTo will cost you $1,200, but an eight inch Dobsonian telescope might cost you half of that. No matter what you buy, if you ever decide to invest in a new telescope, you certainly won\u0027t regret it. I got my old six inch telescope about a year ago, and I\u0027ve been hooked ever since. I even bought a larger telescope just recently. On an related note, check out some of the free night sky apps if you have a smart phone. Saturn and Mars are both visible after sunset, and should be easy to find with the aid of an app that shows you what you\u0027re looking at. Let me know if you have any more questions, i\u0027ll be more than happy to answer them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T04:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(trivia: Andromeda, if visible to the naked eye, would be larger than the moon). \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood advice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndromeda \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E actually visible to the naked eye from a dark location- which makes it the largest gravitationally bound object, that can be seen by the unaided human eye.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T04:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the age, the black one MAY have been intended for the sun.
