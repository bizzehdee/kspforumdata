Only human (homo sapiens) ghosts are accounted for. Animal ghosts, bacterial ghosts, plantal (what\u0027s the modern word meaning relating to plant now?) ghosts, etc. are not counted in this exercise. So are ghosts of our evolutionary cousins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Assume all ghosts does not just \u0022move on\u0022 or otherwise disappear completely, and instead stay here indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Assume all ghosts are formed when anyone die, regardless of circumstances, not just violent or situation that makes them bears a grudge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, these first 3 premises allow us to just simply count the total amount of ghost existing at the moment by roughly estimate the amount of human deaths since the time of the first homo sapiens.

Assume ghosts can only haunt at the place of their death, and cannot move to other location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Assume ghosts have no limits on individuals per area unit - many, many ghosts can occupy the same physical space at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese next 2 premises allow us to find out the density of the ghosts population, because we can just find the amount of deaths in an area, and thus finding out how much ghosts are there over an area unit.
