The force of gravity is 9.8m/s/s. I haven\u0027t done the maths, but your moment acceleration caused by the Earth decelerating is at least 2 times greater than gravity.

I don\u0027t think your feet will have the traction to transfer the full force of deceleration. And even if it did, you would be well under escape velocity. You would probably slip, with both legs broken, and then fall onto ground moving 1,670 km/h. Think of taking a spill on a motorcycle while going 1,670 km/h.

The question, as stated, seems to be trying to find a physically reasonable answer to a situation that is not only physically impossible, but so poorly defined as to be meaningless. If some magical super-force were to slow the Earth rapidly to a (rotational) halt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 why isn\u0027t that magical super force also acting on the crust, atmosphere, oceans, and poodles? first, you\u0027d need to define in what way the Earth was \u0022stopping\u0022, before you could even begin to talk (scientifically) about how other things (like poodles) would respond to \u0022non-stopping\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, Earth \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E slowing down now - it will never be tidally locked to the Sun (timescales much longer than 10 billion years required for that), although we might* end up locked one-faced to the Moon eventually (the \u0022day\u0022 would equal the \u0022month\u0022 at about 50 current days long\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 now \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E would make for a long work day). Even then, we\u0027d still spin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and tidal forces are about the only thing I can think of that slows down the rotation of large bodies in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I say \u0022might\u0022 because when you figure in solar tides, the Moon starts having its orbit shrunk sometime after mutual tidal lock occurs, and the Moon is dropped into a lower orbit until it enter\u0027s Earth Roche limit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 except the Sun would go all red giantish first, and anyway by the time the mutual tidal lock occurs the Moon is out nearly to the point of instability due to solar perturbations, so we might loose it after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Depth","CreatedById":81698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T05:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a \u0022documentary\u0022 on National Geographic about this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8SaPPV4Ov4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8SaPPV4Ov4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Off topic: I really liked the population zero of the same series \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJLVUWEmayQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJLVUWEmayQ\u003C/a\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T05:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENOTHING can instantaneously stop, period. It requires an acceleration of infinity to do so. All scenarios in which you claim the earth stops must include how many seconds you\u0027re picturing it taking to do so.

The talk about oceans sloshing, and tectonic plates shifting are rather predicated on treating these things like they\u0027re not part of the earth and are therefore not included in the statement \u0022the earth stops rotating\u0022.
