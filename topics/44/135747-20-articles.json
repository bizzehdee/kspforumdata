The technology is mature and reliable. Commercial plains use it to control the autopilot for autoland functionality is rough weather. The system is attached to the barge and thus would roll right and left with the physical barge. Also the DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) would detect the barge rise and fall with the waves if it is sensitive enough. (Typically the ones in commercial aircraft report to the nearest 10th of a nautical mile. I am not sure what accuracy they have beyond that. The system works by pinging the DME equipment and timing the delay for a reply. I don\u0027t know how sensitive they can get.)
