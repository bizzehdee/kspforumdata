originally contracted/expected to design the rocket.\u00A0 It was called a Falcon Air, and have only 4 Merlin engine.\u00A0 It is telling that this idea was scrapped *before* spacex abandoned the idea of parachute recovery, as a powered landing with a lighter booster and the same merlin engine is likely difficult.\u00A0 Spacex would far rather fill falcons with fuel than have more crash.\u00A0 According to the infallible wiki, Falcon air would deliver 6 tons to LEO while Falcon 9 (1.0) delivered 10 tons to LEO and a similar ratio to GTO (although presumably falcon 9 still needs the inclination change after delivery).\u00A0 Best guess is that scaling issues are taking away any benefits from the physics of air launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that has been ignored so far are launch costs.\u00A0 Spacex will launch a used rocket for $60M (although part of that cost is probably a mad scramble to make *some* profit, spacex appears to still be in \u0022startup mode\u0022 and losing money, although being private they need not file the SEC papers that would make that clear).\u00A0 Back in 1990, Orbital would launch a Pegasus for a \u0022base price\u0022 of $6M (I suspect that the \u0022base price\u0022 was unobtainable/useless, but it does give a negotiation point).\u00A0 If orbital is using launch procedures based on airlines/fedex procedures (who have to cut \u0022launch prices\u0022 or airplanes to the bone) vs. using launch procedures designed by NASA which were likely developed for Apollo and only changed to increase safety during the Shuttle era, but never once had to deal with cost issues as the cost of the rocket was so high and the launch cadence wouldn\u0027t justify the training/experience needed for cheaper launches.\u00A0 I think I\u0027ve kept in the back of my mind is that Blue Origin seems to have grabbed up most of the DC-X guys, and they made a point of reducing these costs (with

there is nothing to make air launch liquid fuels unfeasible (X-15 did it), Orbital ditched that idea and moved to a three-stage all solid rocket on PegasusII until it was canceled.\u00A0 Hydrolox is particularly bad for air-launch use due to the need to keep topping up your hydrogen from the mothership (you would do the same with oxygen, just that you would need to supply so much more hydrogen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four engine \u0022Falcon Air\u0022 was presumably sized for\u00A0 the Stratolaunch, simply scaling up the size isn\u0027t likely to fit.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget that this was based off the Falcon 9 1.0 and essentially impossible to recover (they were planning on parachutes).\u00A0 With ground launch, Spacex has steadily scaled up the Falcon 9 to include both recovery and doubling the payload while increasing the total mass by 60%.\u00A0 I would assume that anything launched by stratolaunch would have no ability to scale up the mass/size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious issue the stratolaunch backs itself into is that it strictly limits the size of the satellite it can launch, while still requiring basically the same number of flights to design the rocket as the big boys.\u00A0 The Delta-II was able to scale itself by adding various numbers of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters (\u0022more boosters\u0022) and the Delta-Heavy and Falcon-Heavy \u0022simply\u0022 combine boosters to build a vastly larger rocket.\u00A0 These are then more efficient and can lob large numbers of \u0022stratolaunch sized\u0022 satellites into orbit even more efficiently than a small stratolaunch rocket even with it\u0027s 50% efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that how this thing gets to Mars is only one of Elon Musk\u0027s concerns.\u00A0 Recovery is a particular bugaboo of his, and it isn\u0027t clear that spacex could use current recovery methods to recover Falcon Air.\u00A0 But the real reason Spacex still exists at all is the CRS program.\u00A0 CRS requires 2-3 tons of cargo and is delivered by a 2 ton dragon capsule.\u00A0 If Spacex was tied to Falcon air and couldn\u0027t cut the dragon down to fit the falcon air payload requirements, spacex would go bankrupt.\u00A0 Just from memory, CRS is one of the lightest LEO payloads falcon 9 carries (excluding multiple launches),\u00A0 and I don\u0027t see how they could afford to justify falcon air without CRS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember: all this is to simply justify the *rocket*.\u00A0 Justifying the Roc is pretty hopeless, and pretty much is all about wondering if anyone will bother to pick it up after bankruptcy.\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if Airbus or Boeing picks it up as a \u0022guppy replacement\u0022 cargo plane and drive the price out of consideration for a company
