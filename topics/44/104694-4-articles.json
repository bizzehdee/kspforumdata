The law of diminishing returns applies to science too. 100 years ago, it was possible for single scientists like Marie Curie, Pasteur, or Einstein to make major discoveries pretty much on their own.

And it would be pointless to sit on our hands as the insights we gain today could be useful if/when we do get other technology.\n\nBut I do think we should be trying to look at replacements for rockets now even if we wont discover anything for 2 decades or 2 century\u0027s.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m glad to see REL finally admit that an SSTO Skylon is not realistic at this point. .\n\nGlad?\n\nWhy are you glad at set back?\n\nPlus what I got from that report is it still looks like a promising route to go down and the technology may just need maturing before anything is tried with SSTO\u0027s\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T21:36:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by crazyewok**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T21:42:03Z","Content":"Absolutely.

As much as I\u0027d like to see a Base on the Moon, and people going beyond LEO, I\u0027m not sure how to justify it, especially to start with. These days, I just don\u0027t know what people can do that robots can\u0027t, with remote human guidance. The project I hear is best suited for the Moon is a Far Side radio telescope, shielded from Earth\u0027s noise by the bulk of the Moon. Again, I don\u0027t see why that can\u0027t be built by robots, from lunar or \u0027roid mined materials. Technically challenging, yes, and requiring a [Dextre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextre)-ous robot, but that\u0027s what would be required to assist and support humans in the unforgiving environments of space, the Moon, and Mars.\n\n It would make more sense to create stockpiles of materials (metals and water mined from asteroids) in orbit, whether it\u0027s around the Moon, L1, or even LEO. If it\u0027s visible from Earth, it would be more inspiring to the general population. It should be easier to mine \u0027roids (once we anchor the machinery) because there is no appreciable gravity well to lift products out of. Once we have materials, we can use them to create Moonbases and Mars vehicles, and it would require much less upmass to support a human presence. If we can find decent quantities of platinum and rare earths to ship down, it would give high-tech devices on Earth a boost in capability and affordability.\n\nThe only reason I see for people on the Moon is to perfect life-support and other technologies with an eye to establishing colonies farther out in the solar system. The purpose for colonies is so that all of humanity\u0027s eggs are not in one basket. Having people in harsh environments will drive innovation.\n\nSorry about the rambling, I tried to minimize that"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:14:17Z","Content":"Both missions basically depend on the SLS, so I\u0027d say there\u0027s no reason NASA couldn\u0027t do both.\n\nGoing to an asteroid really just depends on mission timing, while returning to the Moon is pretty much a prerequisite for prepping for Mars.\n\nWe may be able to learn a lot about what we\u0027ll be dealing with on Mars by having a Moon base first.

I know that English isn\u0027t your first language but I know you can read better than that. The 5000 years number comes from [Kibble\u0027s thought experiment](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116237-Should-NASA-return-to-the-Moon-instead-of-doing-ARM?p=1855991\u0026viewfull=1#post1855991) about what Sumerians (who lived ca. 3000 BC) would have regarded as a waste of time, yet we consider to be among the pinnacle of our technological achievements. I did not put it forward as an estimate of when we would start to exploit resources from other planets.\n\nOk Sorry, I must knew that you could not said such thing.\n\nIn my defence the sentence seems to said that if we ignore the \u0022period\u0022:\n\n*But people like AngelLestat aren\u0027t talking about a time 5000 years from now. Much like many of us here*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You clearly believe that it should be possible to begin to exploit resources extracted from asteroids and other celestial bodies in some admittedly unspecified short time frame (within a couple of decades?) and you are entitled to your opinion, but I am also entitled to disagree with you. I think your projections are overly optimistic, possibly because you over estimate near term technological progress or possibly because you under estimate the technical difficulty of what you\u0027re envisioning. Or maybe there\u0027s another reason? You also seem to be hand waving away the issue of who\u0027s going to pay for the development of the technologies that you envision and how they are going to see a return on their investment.\n\nThe key factor why many of you make such long time predictions is because you trace a line from 1970 to 2010 and see how little we accomplish in that time (on space) and the few changes that was applied to vehicles or methods from that year.\n\nBut you cannot do that if you want an accurate prediction.. You need to understand the causes, the will and all technologies involves with their respective hatch times. I always follow how technologies grow up since 25 years back, and I keep doing it almost all days, I become pretty acurate to predict the time of hatch due the amount of funds and attention which they receive and also trying to understand how they works in conjunction with the world needs.\n\nIn fact applications as Cortana make great predictions just checking twitter trends.\n\nUnderstand economics and business helps a lot, about politics is hard to make predictions because some times doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t depend on the country needs.\n\nYou can have 40 years of the same thing, but it reach a time where all pieces come together and a new technology arise bringing a new revolution.\n\nCellphones for example grow up slow, until they reach a place where they had enoght processing and utility to change the user life, that is the smartphone revolution.\n\nThe space revolution will come when the launch cost and the space needs reach certain level. Then it will grow up exponential as the smartphones.\n\nAnd remember that when something is used more frequenty, it grows much more faster.\n\nAbout your question.. what is my prediction on asteroid mining? \n\n2040-2045 first attemps, it will not be profitable from the day 1 as everything new, but the first profits will help to reduce the investment and improve the methods.\n\nThe most hard about asteroid mining is the energy require it. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E So...\n\u003E 500000 usd to 1 million usd is open to everybody?\n\nMy rough numbers based in my opinion:\n\nIf skylon happens, 5 years later you can launch 30 kg spacecraft with 10000 U$S to LEO.\n\nWith Falcon Heavy 5 years later you can launch 7 kg spacecraft with 10000 U$S to LEO. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E A 747 is not designed to be expendable nor does it have the same flight rates as rockets. If airplanes were designed to fly for only 10 minutes, they would be much cheaper. Rockets that are designed to be expendable and mass produced are \u0022relatively\u0022 cheap compared to rockets that are designed to be reused and built in smaller numbers.\n\nForget about mass produced, none rocket in the word can be applied to cost reduction due mass production.\n\nThe only one who approach to \u0022mass production techniques\u0022 was the falcon9.\n\nAlso there is not such thing as cheap rockets that can be used one time.. because you need to be sure they work that first time.. due this, is almost sure that materials will work 20 times more.\n\nThis is not as plastic utensils vs metalic.\n\nBut another way to think in reusability more close to your view, is to think that you need a 30% bigger rocket if you want to make it reusable for a fixed payload. So the rocket will cost a 30% more aprox, but you can use it 15 or 20 times.\n\nWhich reduce the cost by a lot due production, but also due the test cost that each new rocket needs.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you are throwing a party once a year with 50 people, it makes sense to buy paper cups and disposable napkins. If you have a restaurant with 50 people every night, it probably makes sense to buy proper glasses, and depending on other factors, it might still be more economical to keep the paper napkins. My point here is that reusability is not automatically cheaper. The final operating cost depends on plenty of other economical factors.\n\nYeah.. still in neverland with the assumption that demand will not increase, google already agree with spacex to launch 4000 sats for their internet project, it already invest 1 billion and gain a 10% of the company.\nThat is only the tip of iceberg for possible business in space. It can go from pharmaceutical ruble, to exploration or any other space exploit business.\n\nAlso even if spacex does not need to drop the prices due low demand.. they will do it anyway to encourage the industry to low the cost of spacecraft components. Is not crazy to think that they self will fund a company to provide cheap and generic spacecraft components even at manufacture cost. \n\nThey will do this because at that time they will be the only cheap choice, and they need to increase their launch rate to increase even more its launch technology, so other companies would not be able to reach them.\n\nAirbus and Safran, are joining forces to create a new family of price-competitive launch vehicles to fight SpaceX, then you already know The United Launch Alliance new plans to face spacex, Arianespace, Lockheed, Khrunichev and Energia plus the japanese and chinese. \n\n**There are huge companies who increased its activity a lot lately, with new designs and fusions, all to fight for a piece of a non existing pie (in your opinion).** Because... what can you do in space?? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Absolutely. It\u0027s more likely see them succeed with industrial heat exchange technology and a multi-stage launcher than with an over-ambitious SSTO that doesn\u0027t make any sort of economical sense. It\u0027s not a set back. It\u0027s a much better strategy. Which is why I\u0027m glad.\n\nOf course it will start with the basic steps, but if skylon study confirms feasibility.. They will not wait much time, they can not allow spacex to control the space business.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T01:29:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:33:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why would asteroids be easier to mine than, for example, the Moon?\n\nMinor planets are more varied in composition, their entire mass is accessible, you don\u0027t have to haul stuff up and down a 1.6 km/s gravity well, they can bee parked on favorable orbits, and the heavy elements haven\u0027t sunk into a molten core."}]}
