Besides crystal (which I highly doubt) no rock is colored like what\u0027s on Vall\u0027s surface. The next possibility is frozen water, which means that much like Europa, a liquid ocean could exist. This I also have trouble believing simply because It doesn\u0027t reflect Kerbol\u0027s (Sun\u0027s) light like other bodies that have a liquid or frozen surface, for example Eeloo.
