With uranium-235 it\u0027s krypton-92 and barium-141, both of which are radioactive. Other isotopes and elements (including thorium in some cases) actually produce uranium isotopes as \u0022waste\u0022, which can be used in other reactors (hence the term \u0022breeder reactor\u0022). Usually the waste products are chemically useful for something or other--the only thing that really makes them \u0022waste\u0022 is the fact that they\u0027ll give you a nasty sunburn if you get too close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T13:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReactor pile, which is the center of every fission reactor whether it\u0027s a graphite block or pressure vessel, is a system of closely spaced fissionable material immersed in moderator and permeated by stuff that eats neutrons called control rods.
