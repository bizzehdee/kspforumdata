One near the north pole would have a poor view of anything close to the equator and would see little or nothing of the southern sky (depending on how close it was.) One near the equator could, in theory, see the entire sky over the course of the year, but in reality the poles would too close to the horizon for proper viewing. It only really takes two observatories on the entire planet, properly placed, to get good, clear views of the entire sky - one northern and one southern, perhaps at 30-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T11:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis again? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWISE infrared orbital telescope did a whole sky scan in 2012 with capabilities of finding Neptune-sized object all the way to 700AU, and Jupiter sized object to approximately 1 lightyear.
