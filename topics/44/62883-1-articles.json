The \u003Cem\u003Emere\u003C/em\u003E force of the atmosphere crushes them to a crisp within several hours. Same thing happened with the USA probes that landed. They come down, and within several hours, they stop relaying back data, because guess what? They are crushed into a simple metal disc on the surface. That\u0027s what the atmospherical pressure will do to you. And keep in mind, these are probes that are specially designed for the purpose of landing on Venus. They are compact, and armored like a heavy battleship. There is no type of spacesuit in service or for the foreseeable future that could last five minutes on the Venusian surface. Probably thirty seconds at most, if they were upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surface temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead. You got thunderstorms, sulfuric acid everywhere.
