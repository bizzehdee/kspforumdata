In advanced economies, securing higher and sustainable growth requires a mix of mutually-reinforcing demand and supply policies. On the demand side, accommodative monetary policy remains essential where inflation is still well below central banks\u2019 targets. However, a comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy. In particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy. In a number of countries, efforts to accelerate the repair of private sector balance sheets would help improve the transmission of monetary policy and support domestic demand. On the supply side, across advanced and emerging economies, credible and well-designed structural reforms remain critical to lift potential output, and can provide some near-term demand support directly and through increased confidence and expectations of higher future income. -IMF - 2016 report to G20 -notes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-22T15:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2016 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
