If you have more than that amount of a weaponsgrade nuclear material in a single pile, then its own radiation will accelerate its own decay, which in turn releases more radiation, which in turn accelerates the decay, and so on: your pile of nuclear material just blew up violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously you want this to happen inside your bomb, but you also want it to happen at the push of a button instead of, you know, the moment you load the material into the bomb. So the most common way to build things is to divide the pile of nuclear material into two or more subcritical parts, stored separately from each other in the bomb. You also pack some conventional explosives. When the time comes to make an ass of yourself in front of the rest of the world, you detonate the conventional explosives, which shoot the various subcritical piles of nuclear material towards each other. They collide and get compressed into one big supercritical ball, which promptly vaporizes the neighborhood (and the neighborhood\u0027s neighborhood as well).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T14:45:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T14:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many different types of nuclear weapons.

The way this works comes in two processes actually. The first is a slow neutron reaction, which is what is used in nuclear reactors. In slow neutron fission the neutrons from split atoms are slowed down by a moderator. Although it might not be immediately intuitive, slow neutrons are actually better at splitting a nucleus in a chain reaction than fast neutrons. This means that reactors don\u0027t need a large quantity of highly enriched fuel. Fast neutron reactions, on the other hand, are what is used in nukes. Fast neutron reactions produce enormous amounts of energy in short periods of time if they can be sustained, but therin lies the problem. When the reaction occurs it increases the temperature of the material, pushing the atoms away from each other and making it less likely for neutrons to hit a nucleus, but this is not a problem with slow neutrons since they have more time to pass through the material. With fast neutrons this is a major issue, making a much higher critical-mass necessary to sustain. In a real nuclear weapon this is overcome by either assembling this highly enriched material in a very short period of time (gun type), or by compressing the material down extremely quickly, since critical mass is actually lower at higher densities (implosion type). When this happens the chain reaction occurs enormously fast, since these are incredibly fast neutrons, and the energy released is sent off in waves of gamma and x-ray radiation, as well as an enormous pressure wave generated by the expansion of the nuclear material in the bomb at incredible speeds due to the extreme temperatures caused by the reaction. All this energy adds up to both a thermal/radiation front which burns the landscape from the intensity of the rays, and a pressure/heat front which expands rapidly as a rsult of the rapid change of temperature and the expansion of materials under the thermal pressure. The radiation front is essentially what melts a city, and the pressure front is essentially what levels buildings in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T16:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou get your explosion from a bunch of liberated energy, all in one spot.
